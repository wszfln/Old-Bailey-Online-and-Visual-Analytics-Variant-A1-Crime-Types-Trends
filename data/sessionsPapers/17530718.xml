               <p>J. Gilling. Yes, he was; he ran down a lane, and went a-cross two fields, and instead of going the right way to the church, he went down a little lane ; when we came up with him he turn'd upon us, and said something, but what it was I cannot say; then he drew a pistol out, and said something about shooting. (The pistol produc'd in court, it was a long horseman's pistol). Then he made off; I said here is four of us, let us take up stones and go after him again, for sure four of us with stones is a match for one with a pistol. We did, and run after him down Salmon's-lane, and there is a little lane that leads to Rogue's-well, just by there we took him.</p>

            . I had been at work upon a ship lying off the Tower, and was going home to Limeho use-hole ; coming down the lane that leads to Limehouse church, we heard some people cry, Stop thief ! I said, I had a good mind to run after them; I did, and I met a man on horseback, and people said, He is the man; I stopt him, and said you are the man; he said no, that is the man, pointing with his finger to the prisoner. I ran after him, and just as I got to him, he pull'd out a pistol, and said he would shoot me, if I did not turn round ; I stoop'd myself to the ground, thinking he then would shoot over my head, but he made off; then I got up again, and went after him, and threw him down over a bank, and took the pistol out of his hand.</p>

            . I am porter to the fishmongers company, besides the general charge in the great repairing of the hall, I had a particular charge to have a particular watch. I have had great reason to believe the hall had been robb'd, especially on the 26th of June, though I saw the carpenters fasten the door, and staid myself half an hour after that. Then I went home to get me a mouthful of supper. And when I came back, to my surprize found both doors of the hall open that leads into the hall, which gave me a strong suspicion that all things was not right, so I was determined to watch more narrowly; and on Friday the 29th, I went into the hall about the evening, and as I thought every thing was safe, and coming back to my own house which is but a few doors from the hall, (I had not got in, but set down at my own bench) I saw the prisoner and two other labourers, (one of them I very well know, as well as the prisoner, the other I do not know), go up Miles's-lane, with something cover'd; seeing of them go by I judged by the weight that seem'd to be under their arms, that it was lead, and I supposed where they were going to a house of ill repute in my own neighbourhood, did not detect them in the street, but followed them up the lane. The hindermost man either was heavier loaded, or feebler, for he lag'd behind, so that if I had waited for him, I had mist seeing the prisoner; (for I knew the prisoner, he had work'd in the hall a long time). I pushed by the hindermost man, and follow'd the prisoner, and the other labourer into the house of Mr. John Fowler, a dealer in iron, and other things of that nature, in Crooked lane; they went straight up unto the west door of the shop, and pass'd by the master of the shop who stood straightening of nails, he took no notice of them no more than though he had never saw them. I pushed by the master and went after the prisoner, who then had turn'd into one corner of the shop, where there hung a pair of scales, the prisoner at the bar, as I firmly believe, dropt from him a piece of lead; I said to him, You villian, you have stole this lead, which he denied, and made some small resistance, the other labourer had got rid of his burden, and run out at the fouth door of the shop, then the master of the shop came up to me, and took me by the shoulder, and said, don't make such a noise, I want to speak with you, supposing he wanted me to smother the matter; I told him I regarded the Fish-mongers company so much, that as I was constable, I would charge him to aid and assist me down to <placeName id="t17530718-12-crimeloc55">Fish-mongers-hall</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you ever take a view of the hall to see where the lead was taken from?</p>

Mistress being lame justice Cross came to her house and examined the prisoner, she said she was innocent of the fact. She was committed to New-Prison for further examination.</p>

I immediately follow'd him up Queen-street pretty briskly, and over-took him just by the late Mr. Stiles's shop the hosier, near the corner; I took him into the shop and told him he had stole my handkerchief, he said he had not, I search'd him, and he had it in his hand behind him under the lapets of his waistcoat, he then said he did not take it, but that another lad that was in company with him had given it to him. I cannot say that he took it out of my pocket.</p>

I heard no more of them till I read the Advertisement, in which the pocket piece was described ; I went, and was informed that the prisoner told them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175307180013"/> that the place was mine; the prisoner was in the Gatehouse, and lay in, I did not want to see her, because I did not know her, and now I cannot swear that that she is the person that pick'd my pocket.</p>

            . On the first of last April, I, Mr. Hayley, and the prisoner at the bar, went out, and going into Spring-Garden gate, the prisoner pick'd the lady's pocket of the things she has mention'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the lady?</p>
               <p>J. M. Wright. I am sure it is, for I saw the prisoner working upon her, (as we term it.) We went into the two brewers in Maynard-street, St. Giles's, to share our money, I had three half crowns, and a snuff-box, that she took out of another pocket, in the room of the piece of gold which she said she would lay up to buy a boat for the child she was then big of.</p>
               <p>Q. What things did you take from this lady ?</p>
               <p>He mentions them severally.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ormond. Did you ever get your pieces of money again?</p>
               <p>Ormond. No, not any of them, nor never saw them since I told this evidence that I would give five guineas for that piece of gold because I greatly valued it; but I never had it.</p>

               <p>E. Targoose. I cannot, they were quarrelling like ; I went out of the room and left them quarrelling. I was just out of the room and stood by the door, when I saw the woman fall : her husband was a little distance from her at the time, (about 3 yards) I believe she spoke as she fell, but never afterwards.</p>

            . On the 13th of June I missed the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. From what part of your house?</p>
               <p>Cope. The coat and breeches were in a closet joining to my bedchamber; the gold watch, chain, and seal, hung up altogether by the chimney in my bed chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you miss them?</p>
               <p>Cope. I missed them about 5 o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them last?</p>
               <p>Cope. I can't remember that I saw them since the day before I missed them, I saw them about twelve at noon.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon missing them?</p>
               <p>Cope. I went to goldsmith's hall, and had papers dispersed to goldsmiths and pawnbrokers, with five guineas reward on the conviction of the person, in order to their stopping them, if brought by any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Cope. No, I never saw him before he was taken up to my knowledge. I had my watch brought to the bar of Slaughter's coffee-house, as I had directed in the papers, by a pawnbroker that had taken it in. We concluded that as the person that brought it to him had had but little money on it, in proportion to the value of it, if we kept ourselves close he might come for more, and so be taken. It happened to be the case, and proved to be the prisoner at the bar, who was taken before Alderman Alsop. There I saw him, he had my coat on his back at the time. The coat and watch produced in court and depos'd to.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Was not there two men in your neighbourhood went off about that time?</p>
               <p>Cope. I know nothing of that, I heard there was a man went away about that time, but knew nothing of him.</p>

            . The prisoner brought this watch to me the 13th of June, ( holding the watch in his hand ) the seal and chain were to it; he asked me two guineas and a half upon it, which I lent him, as I went to open it, to look at it, he said, you need not examine it any farther, you had it in March last. The next morning I had a warning brought me from goldsmiths-hall, upon which I carried the watch to Slaughter's coffee-house, and delivered it to Mr. Cope. We concluded to let it remain a secret; and on the Monday morning the prisoner came again, and ask'd me if I could not lend him a guinea more: I told him, I believ'd I could, if he'd stay till the boy came down, thinking to take him, but looking out at my window, I happen'd to see a neighbour, whom I beckon'd to; he came over, and when he was in the shop I jumped over the counter, and told the prisoner he must give an account how he came by that watch; which, he said, he could do very well. I sent for a constable, and after that for Mr. Cope. I had him in the shop I believe an hour; at last he drew out a clasp knife, (produced in court) and of a sudden said, he'd stay no longer; the constable took hold on the lappet of his coat, and I by the collar, and we took the knife out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it open in his hand?</p>
               <p>Styles. It was open, and he said the first man that went to meddle with him he'd stab, or some such words, he was carried to Bridewell, and the next morning before the sitting alderman who committed him to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. What coat had the prisoner on when you took him?</p>
               <p>Styles. He had this coat produced here by Mr. Cope.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he it on the first time he came?</p>
               <p>Styles. No, he had not; he had then a blue one on.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it that he was with you on the 13th of June?</p>
               <p>Styles. I believe it was betwixt four and five in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>These things (the coat, and the gold watch tied up in it) I found in Queen-street, below the White Bear, at almost nine at night. There were two young men with me at the time, they are at Hampton-Court, I expect them every minute.</p>

            . On Monday last Mr. Thornton, and I, were going home from Smithfield Market, to Watford; riding side by side between the 5 and 6 mile stones in the Edgware-road, all on a sudden I saw a man ride up to Mr. Thornton, and say something to him, what I did not hear; Mr. Thornton said, what do you say? then the&gt; man said, Sir, your money .</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this ?</p>
               <p>Bowden. It was just turned of six in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that man, that said, Sir, your money ?</p>
               <p>Bowden. The prisoner at the bar is the man; upon this Mr. Thornton rode on into a gallop, and so did I, the prisoner pushed on, and got before, and turned upon us; and said, what do you mean by riding away from me, if you move, or stir a yard, I'll shoot you dead; and clapped a pistol to Mr. Thornton, and said to him, why don't you make haste and pull out your money; Mr. Thornton put his hand through his great coat side: the prisoner said what are you fumbling about; drop none, for if you do, i'll shoot you this minute; Mr. Thornton, pulled out his bag, and the prisoner took it and put it into his pocket; then he came to me, and said, where is your money; I said I had but little; he said, I know you have money, don't talk to me, and clapped his pistol to me, I was very unwilling to pull out mine, he swore he'd shoot me; I saw Mr. Thornton, look very pale and afrighted, and finding I must deliver it, I pulled out my bag, and delivered it to the prisoner, which he put into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in your bag?</p>
               <p>Bowden. There was in it, in English and Portugal money, gold and silver, to the amount of 75 l. 9 s. in the whole. After this the prisoner said, Now make the best of your way, for if you pretend to turn back or follow me, I'll shoot you dead upon the spot. And away he rode as hard as he could for London.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his face cover'd?</p>
               <p>Bowden. No, my lord, it was not; then I said to Mr. Thornton, for God's sake let us pursue him: Mr. Thornton said, I must secure some money which I have dropp'd out of my bag loose into my breeches, so he got off his horse and found nine guineas which he had put there, and took and put them into his pocket; then we set out with speed. In riding about half a mile we met a man which I know'd. I ask'd him if he met a man on a cropp'd mare, he said he did not, but saw a man ride up for Hampstead heath a great pace, then we pursued as fast as we could go, out before we got to Hampstead heath, we met a woman of whom we asked as before; she informed us there was a man riding a great pace. We followed as she directed, then we came to a gate in the road, at which sat a girl to open it, we ask'd her if she saw a man ride a-pace that way, she said he was just gone across the common; we rode after him into Hampstead town, and enquired of a man that we know w told us that the man was at his door buying a whip pot a minute ago. We rode on and at Hampstead hill, by the Red-lyon, I saw the prisoner before us; there were some gentlemen riding to London well mounted, I told them we had been robb'd by that man, meaning the prisoner, and desir'd they'd ride on and call out highwayman, then they rode on, and we after them. There were some gentlemen sitting drinking at the George, one of them catch'd hold of the prisoner's bride. I soon came up and took hold on his collar, and said, Friend, I am gald to see you once more.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think this might be after the time of the robbery?</p>
               <p>Bowden. It might be better than half an hour. I told the people the prisoner had a pistol about him, then that was taken out of his pocket first The next thing was a powder horn, the next a bag, and as soon as I saw it I said I'll swear that is my bag. (The bag and money produc'd in court by the constable, and the money told over in court by the prosecutor, and depos'd to.) The people not finding Mr. Thornton's bag, we asked him where he had put that, he told us he had dropp'd that going to shift it out of one pocket into the other, as he was going to come on the common; (we never could find it). We took him before the justice, and the justice ask'd him what he had to say for himself, he said he had nothing to say for or against it.</p>

He said don't take that from me, that is my own money, that I did not rob the men off, so I gave it him again, then I began to search the other side and took out this bag here produc'd with the money in it. The prosecutor said, Dear sir, that's my bag, I'll swear to it. Then Mr. Thornton said, where it the yellow bag you took from me, he said he had dropp'd the endeavouring to shift it out of his coat pocket, into his breeches, in the lane coming up to Hampstead heath; then he was taken before Mr. Harrings he said little or nothing there. He was committed to Newgate, and going in the coach he told us it was the first fact he ever committed, but that he had made an attempt on the Saturday in the afternoon on Black heath, to stop a cause, but people coming he was oblig'd to sist.

I said we have but very little, he said we had money both of us ; I put my hand to my pocket, and he said give me your money directly, or I'll shoot you. I fumbled out about nine guineas from my bag into my breeches, and deliver'd the rest in the bag, and id now you have got all my money I hope you'r return me some; he answer'd No. the D - l a farthing After that he demanded Mr. Bowden's money, which he gave him; then the prisoner said go along, I see you look back or offer to follow me I'll shoot you dead; and went off for London. I got down and took care of the little I had saved; then we followed the prisoner. (The rest as the prosecutor had depos'd ).</p>

               <p>M. Fennelly. The last.</p>

               <p>M. Fennelly. She did, we found him very ill; I said, lord have mercy upon me, postman; who would have thought of this when you went by? he ask'd whether there was not two men gone down the lane; we said yes, he said they have robbed and shot me; we asked him whereabouts it was, he said at the chase-gate, and that he held the gate open for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say they did then upon his opening the gate ?</p>
               <p>M. Fennelly. He said they asked him what it was o'clock, that he pulled out his watch and told them; that then they immediately asked him for it, he said he gave it them, and made no delay.</p>

               <p>M. Fennelly. About two or three stones throws; he was carried up and put to bed, and we did not see him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak plain, and could you well unstand what he said?</p>
               <p>M. Fennelly. He spoke very plain.</p>

               <p>Q. Had Mrs. Coant said any thing to the deceased about the two men, before such time as he spoke of them to you?</p>

            . I live in Kingsland Road, and was at Mr. Hubbard's, who keeps the King's-head on Winchmore-hill, on Monday the 18th of June, sitting at the door, between one and two o'clock; the postman came, and ask'd Mr. Hubbard if there was any thing for him, who said no, but that there was a let ter over the way; he went there and took the letter, and then turn'd down the lane that leads to the chace gate. About two minutes after I saw two young men on horseback go down after him, one of them had a darkish wig on tied behind; the other was behind when they pass'd by me, they both went down the same lane the postman did, and the first that pass'd had a lightish coloured coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of his person?</p>
               <p>Holbourn. No, not of his face; they both rode on dark mares, and the last man's was a clumsy dirty one, and had three white feet, I took great notice of him, he wore brown cloaths, and look'd a great deal younger than the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either of the prisoners at the bar the persons ?</p>
               <p>He points to Stockdale, and says, He is the man that rode last in the brown cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man, did you take more notice of him than the first ?</p>
               <p>Holbourn. I did, for I was sitting at the door, and he was jawing by the door, so took more notice of him, he had a swarthy complection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular in his wig?</p>
               <p>Holbourn. Yes, he had a black ribband behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else follow them?</p>
               <p>Holbourn. No, I did not. After I had drank my beer and was going, a gentleman, with a lac'd hat, came up to Mr. Hubbard's, and said, Mr. Hubbard, for God's sake, go or send somebody down the lane to relieve the poor post-boy for he is shot and robb'd, I ran down the lane, and when I came there, there were two women standing hard by, he lay about 200 yards from the gate in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the women that have been examin'd ?</p>
               <p>Holbourn. I cannot say, I said to him, Lord have mercy upon me! What is the matter? he said, two men followed him down the lane, and robb'd and shot him at the gate. Then I, and three more took him up, and carried him to Mr. Hubbard's, at the King's-head.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the mares lately?</p>
               <p>Holbourn. I saw them on Wednesday last, in a stable near Hicks's-hall, they were shewn to me by the hostler, who asked me if I knew them, I said I did, and do really believe they are the same mares the two prisoner's rode on; for one had crop'd ears, and the other had three white feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice that the mare was crop'd when you saw them go down the lane?</p>
               <p>Holbourn. I did.</p>
               <p>Cross Examin'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you doing at the time you saw them go down the lane?</p>
               <p>Holbourn. I was eating my dinner at Hubbard's door.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you never saw Stockdale but at that time, now do you think you should know him if you saw him in any other place?</p>
               <p>Holbourn. Yes, I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take notice to any one that the mare was crop'd, before you saw her on Wednesday?</p>
               <p>Holbourn. I did to several people.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you, without having been shewn the mares again, have swore to them?</p>
               <p>Holbourn. I could have pick'd them out from among a thousand.</p>

            . I keep the King's-head on Winchmore-hill ; on the 18th of June the deceased called at my house, to know whether there was any letters for him: I told him no, but that there was one over the way, which he went and took, and then I saw him go down the lane that leads to the chace: I went in, and, looking through the window, saw two men ride down the lane, the last had got a sharp cock'd up hat, and a brown wig, tied up with a black ribband behind in a double knot, and hung down loose. They were about two rods distance from one another. In about ten minutes after they were gone down Mr. Lee<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175307180025"/> came to our house, and told my wife that the post-boy was robb'd and shot; my wife told me, so I went down the lane, and they had got him in a chair just by the bottom of the hill.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you speak to him?</p>
               <p>Hubbard. No, I did not, but heard him say he took on for his poor dear wife; he was carried to my house, where I helped to put him to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had been asked a question could he have given an answer?</p>
               <p>Hubbard. He could and did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners, are you sure they are the men?</p>
               <p>Hubbard points to Stockdale, and says, that is the man that rode last I am very positive.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Winchmore-hill by Endfield chace, next door to Mr. Hubbard's. On Monday the 18th of June, much about two o'clock at noon, as I was standing by my own gate, I saw two men go by me, through Mr. Hubbard's yard, and down the chace lane; one had a brown coat, which was the prisoner Stockdale.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is Stockdale ?</p>
               <p>Jones. That is the man (pointing to him) he was the man that rode last.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the first man?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, not-so much as I did of the last; for he turned his face over his shoulder twice, so I took particular notice of him, he had got on a brown cloth coat, his wig was tied with a ribband behind, and his hat cock'd up very sharp; but I cannot say any thing to the person that rode foremost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of their horses?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, I did not, for I look'd more at them than their horses, and am sure Stockdale is the man that rode last by my gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them afterwards?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the deceased after he was wounded?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, I saw the surgeon dress the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that?</p>
               <p>Jones. Down in the lane, in the place where he lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Jones. Yes, I saw him before Mr. Fielding?</p>
               <p>Q. And was you sure then that he was the person that rode by last?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, I said so as soon as ever I saw his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other person go down the lane besides the two prisoners?</p>

            . On the 18th of June I saw the post-man lay wounded near Endfield chace gate ; he was carried from thence to the King's-head, where I asked him who did it; he said two young men followed him down the lane and robb'd him, and that the man in the brown coat shot him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how it happen'd?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes: he said he was at the chace gate and open'd it for them, that they ask'd him what it was o'clock, and he told them; that then they demanded his watch and money, after which the man in the brown coat shot them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sensible at that time?</p>

            . I live at Southgate, in the parish of Edmonton. On Monday the 18th of June, I went on the chace to look at my horses, and while I was looking, I heard a gun or a pistol go off, I thought somebody had shot at a deer, I thought I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175307180026"/> get up into the road as soon as I could, thinking I should see the person that shot the deer. I went out just by Winchmore hill gate, there I saw the two prisoners coming along the road as fast as they could gallop towards Southgate, on the side of the chace.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the report of the pistol before you saw them.</p>
               <p>H. Smith. About a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any particular notice of their horses?</p>
               <p>H. Smith. I did.</p>

               <p>H. Smith. One of them had two white feet behind, but they gallop'd very fast so that I could not mind the colour of their horses, but I took so much notice of them that I can remember them very well.</p>

            . I live at Southgate, and am a butcher. On the 18th of June I was going to the West-lodge, to look at some lambs upon the chace; and about five minutes past two as I was crossing the chace into the road, I saw a man come riding by very hard; I believe he might be got about a quarter of a mile, when another came up, he spurr'd the mare and she trip'd several times, I thought she would have fell; and every time he spurr'd she groan'd. I took great notice of the mare, she had a wen on the near leg.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take particular notice of the first man's mare?</p>

             was one, and a woman the other. I examin'd the man and ask'd him where he was shot, he said in his belly; then I examin'd and found a wound on the left side of his belly, near the navel, I prob'd the wound and found it was very deep, and went between the skin and the membrane of his belly very deep into his right groin. My probe was not sufficent to tell how deep it was; I therefore drest the wound and desir'd he might be had into a bed, and that I might see him again in an hour or two's time. I waited upon him a second time about two or three hours afterwards, I then found him a dying, and waited there till he did die, but did not see him expire; I was there after he was dead, and by examining his right thigh it had turn'd black: I found a round substance on the right side something like a ball.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you imagine the wound proceeded from?</p>
               <p>V. Moore. I believe it proceeded from either balls or slugs, and that more than one.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you observ'd do you believe the wound was mortal?</p>
               <p>V. Moore. He was sinking and dying when I came, and I look upon it to be a mortal wound.</p>

            . I keep the Black-Bull, Gray's-inn-lane. On Sunday night was a month, about six o'clock, being the 17th of June, the prisoner Johnson came to me and desir'd to know if I had two horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Miller. No, I did not, he told me where he lodg'd at a snuff-shop in Tash-Court, Grays inn-lane; he wanted the horses for the Monday following at nine o'clock; then I went into the stable and shewed him two, he told me he believ'd they would do very well, but the gentleman would be in presently; he went away then, and did not bargain: presently Stockdale and he came together.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner Stockdale before?</p>
               <p>Miller. No, my lord, not to my knowledge; they went into the stable with me, and Johnson said to Stockdale, do you take this mare, she will do very well for you; I will not have the other, but I'll go to Cook's, at the Three Cups in Holborn, for one for me ; they ask'd what I would have for the mare for the next morning to go to Barnet to see the horses that were to run, I told them 4 s. 6 d. and we agreed the next morning. Johnson came about eight o'clock, they had order'd the mare to be ready at nine; he said he'd go to Cook's and bring his mare and take Stockdale with him. He came again on a crop mare almost black, with a hog mare, and Stockdale on foot with him, and Stockdale mounted my mare in my yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe your mare.</p>
               <p>Miller. She is a black one with a wen upon her near leg, as big as my fist, and 3 white feet. The call'd for a pint of beer, and drank it, I ask'd for my money before the mare went out, Stockdale said, he never was ask'd for money before he came home; Johnson said, he always paid when he came home, and he'd be answerable for the money; then they both rode off, and in the evening about six, or rather before, they both of them came to my door, Stockdale was on my mare, he deliver'd her, and said to me if you'll go along with me to Johnson's lodgings he would pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition was the mare?</p>
               <p>Miller. She was in very bad condition indeed. She came in on but three legs, absolutely tired, and strain'd in the back sinews; she lay down as soon as she came into the stable: I went along with Stockdale to Johnson's lodgings, he ask'd the woman below for Johnson, she said he is just gone out, then he said to the woman be so good as to lend me a crown, I could not justly hear her answer, but she lent him none. We went to a place or two more, but could not find Johnson, then Stockdale said, be so good as to step home, and Johnson shall come and pay you in half an hour; I went and staid about that time, then I went to Johnson's lodgings again, and presently he came in and told me he had paid but 3 s. 6 d. for the other mare, but he paid me 4 s. 6 d. for mine.</p>
               <p>Q. When people, Mr. Smith, and others, came to see the mare that Stockdale rode, did you shew them all that same mare that he rode?</p>
               <p>Miller. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Glanister. I went to Mr. Miller, to enquire for this mare; Mr. Miller, and the hostler, shewed me her, she was a black one, and had a wen on one leg.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cook. Did you shew that mare to Glanister, which you let to Johnson?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175307180028"/>Cook. I did.</p>

            . On Wednesday the 20th of June, being at Mr. Fielding's over night; I was informed a man would shew me, and others, a place in Grays-inn-lane, where a man lived that answered the description in the advertisement, of one of the persons that shot the postman; there were Jones, Philipson, Norden, and I, we went in the morning about four clock; as soon as the street door was open, we went in; we found two women in bed, but no man; I staid in the room till about half an hour after seven; Norden and Jones were gone round Holborn, to see if they could find where the horses were hired; in the mean time I talked with Johnson's wife, she told me that on Tuesday morning her husband and Stockdale had been out together; about half an hour after seven, up came Stockdale with a handkerchief in his hand ; said I, is your name Johnson ; he said no, my name is Middleton, what have you to do with me; I had him by the collar, I put my hand to his pocket, and took out these pair of pistols loaded with eight sluggs, four in each, and a seal. (Produced in court.) He immediately said, I wish you'd go and take Johnson, for he has brought me to it, and said he'd tell us where he was; he said he was at a town beyond Hammersmith, at the Led-Lion, but did not know the name of the town; we named Brentford, he said that was it; we went in two chaises, Stockdale and I in one, and the others in the other; and between Knightsbridge and the half-way house, going to Kensington, we met Johnson; Stockdale said that was he, so we took him; Stockdale told us, Johnson had a pistol and hanger about him, Jones took the pistol out of his pocket, and Philipson the/ hanger from under his coat; Stockdale had before told us it was Johnson that shot the postman, and the seal I found in his pocket, Johnson gave to him; when we had them face to face, Johnson said Stockdale shot the man, with bitter wishes; Stockdale owned he got off the horse and took the man's money out of his pocket, and that Johnson demanded the man's watch, and he put it in his hat as he sat on horseback.</p>

            . I went along with the last witness, Jones and Philipson, in order to take Johnson ; I made a stop to talk to the keeper of Tothill-fields-bridewell; that when I came up to them they had taken Johnson as he was coming to town; when we got the prisoners together they upbraided each other with the murder of the man; Johnson wished his eyes might tumble into his hat if Stockdale did not shoot the man, Stockdale denied it and said it was Johnson ; I sat between them to keep them from fighting; Stockdale owned he took the money from the man, and said Johnson held his hat and took the watch, after which Johnson shot the man, Johnson owned he shot at a man near Uxbridge, the next day.</p>

            . After Stockdale was taken I came into the room; he desired we would go and take Johnson, and he went with us; I went with Jones in the first chaise, and Peal with Stockdale, in another; going on this side the half-way house, under the park wall, as Johnson was coming along, Stockdale said that was he; I jumped out of the chaise and got over the ditch and took him by the arm; he asked what it was for, I said I'll tell you presently; under his coat I found this hanger, (produced in court;) and Jones searched his pocket, and in his left hand side found a pistol; then I told him, they say you shot a man: I was tying his hands with his handkerchief, he turned round and saw Stockdale in the chaise; he said that little scoundrel I suppose sent you after me; I said he did; said he, did he say I shot the man; I said he did, he said he is a scoundrel, it was he that shot him; we put him into the chaise and drove to the Red-lion at Brentford, there the two prisoners argued about shooting the postman; Stockdale said, you villian you asked the man what is it o'clock, he pulled out his watch, and you demanded it, he put it in your hat, and you shot him directly, and the man gave a jump, and you laughed; Johnson said to him, you little scoundrel you shot him, and I had a good mind when we were on Hounslow-heath to have shot you, and had my hand on my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175307180029"/> pistol in my pocket divers time so to do; and am sorry now I did not.</p>

               <p>Stockdale's Defence.</p>

               <p>Johnson was very ill the time of trial, and said nothing in his defence, nor called any witness.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Dison. I knew him at Leicester when he lived with his father, I have often been in his company, and cannot suppose he would have been guilty of a crime of this nature, had he not been drawn into it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Nevil. I have known him ever since he came to London; he was clerk with Mr. Smith in Doctor's-Commons, he has been about three or four months in town, and has behaved extremely well in my sight; he has been backwards and forwards at my house very often.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lilley. I have known him only in town. I live the next door to the house he used, and during the time I knew him he behaved very well, as any person I know, in my company; he is the last person I should have thought on to do such an action, and think he must have been drawn in.</p>

            . On the 1st of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I lost my purse out of my pocket, with three new guineas, and a piece of silver belonging to a seal; I observed the two prisoners to be very near me: the man stood before, and the woman sometimes before and sometimes behind, but did not know that they had taken any thing from me, Some time afterwards there was an advertisement in the papers, describing the purse, and the persons that took it, then I applied to Mr. Lediard.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon was it that you missed your purse?</p>
               <p>Reisig. I did not observe that I had lost it till Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it lost on Sunday?</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you go into the chapel that day ?</p>
               <p>Reisig. No, I did not go in that Sunday.</p>

I was out of town, and when I came home my wife told me she had had two men in the shop that had stole a guinea; I enquir'd after the prisoner at the bar, and the other man that came in with him, to know their names and places of abode, I enquir'd at several places, at last my wife said, she heard the prisoner went by the name of Dragon, and I enquir'd of several people that knew him, but they knew not where he liv'd, but we found the man that was with him and took him up, he said, he knew nothing of it. On the 4th of June we took up the prisoner and carry'd him before the justice, he talk'd in French, and the justice's boy was his interpreter, he said the prisoner confess'd he had the guinea, but took it out of a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after you lost it?</p>
               <p>Mace. I lost it on the 30th of May, and this was on the 4th June.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any confession taken?</p>
               <p>Mace. I cannot say, the prisoner sent several times to offer me the guinea ; and there is a gentleman now in court I believe, that came from the prisoner to my wife, and said, I had better give him 20 guineas and let him go, for he would not be in my coat for 100 l.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not you take up another person and swear against him for defrauding you of this guinea?</p>
               <p>Mace. We took up another man first, but afterwards with his information we took up the prisoner, and on his confession we discharg'd the other.</p>

            . The prisoner and another man came into our shop on the 30th of May, and ask'd for a pound of tobacco. I weigh'd it, and he threw down a guinea and desir'd change, I took it up and look'd at it on the other side of the counter, and he stood about the middle ; then I laid it down by me, thinking I had change in my pocket, I had not enough, but went into the back room, and brought him change, and put it down on the counter, (he had folded up the tobacco and was putting it into his pocket just as I came out of the back room ) I never saw the guinea afterwards, there was a woman in the shop that came for a pennyworth of snuff, I did not look for the guinea her fact, the two men went out and the guinea was go.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not put the guinea in your pocket ?</p>
               <p>Mace. I am sure I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you must it?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175307180035"/>Mace. In a minute or less, I only serv'd the snuff since, and there was nobody had been there but the prisoner and his companion, and the woman that came for the snuff.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sweep the shop, it might have dropt down ?</p>
               <p>Mace. No, I am very sensible that it was far enough on the counter that it could not fall.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner then?</p>
               <p>Mace. He was at a distance off ; when we was before the justice, the interpreter told me he confess'd he took the guinea, and his companion said he had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that companion?</p>
               <p>Mace. I know nothing at all of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this interpreter?</p>
               <p>Mace. The justice's boy. The prisoner sent the interpreter that is here, whose name is Delaport, to me, and said, we had better go and give the prisoner 20 guineas and let him go about his business.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Trevill. I went into the shop for snuff, and saw the prisoner, after he had handled the tobacco, throw down a guinea, and ask'd for change; th e gentlewoman took the guinea and look'd at it, and the man that was with the prisoner said I believe it is good, she said it was. She had not silver enough in her pocket, so she left the guinea, and went in to get change. While she was gone the prisoner at the bar put his hand over and took the guinea, and then he laid it down again near the other person that was with him, who looked at it, but I did not see him lay it down, nor take it away, for I never saw the guinea afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you saw the guinea in the other man's hand after it was in the prisoner's ?</p>
               <p>Trevill. Yes, I did, but did not see him lay it down again, nor take it away. When the prisoner was before the justice, the interpreter said that this man took the guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he said this man, or the other man took it?</p>
               <p>Trevill. No, he said it was this man, for he repeated it in English.</p>

I did not hear her name; he said, he heard she was gone to live with another man, and that he thought she was dead, for he had not seen her for 3 years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen that woman to day?</p>
               <p>Owen. Yes, I drank part of a pint of beer with her, and I am sure she is the same woman I saw before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was charg'd did he deny his marriage ?</p>

I had a very good account that she was dead, but I have heard since that she was married to another man, that goes by the names of Staves, and lives at Deptford. It was easy for her to write to me, for I have been upon the same spot ever since; and I did not know where to send to her, so that last April I was married again.  <rs id="t17530718-50-verdict263" type="verdictDescription">
