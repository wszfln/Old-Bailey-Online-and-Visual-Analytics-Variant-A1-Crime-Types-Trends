I ordered a watchman to take them both to the watchhouse, namely, the prosecutor and prisoner. We searched her, and found the stock and stock-buckle; them he had not missed. Then after that the watchman found the watch in her hand, as he was pulling her hand out of her pocket. [The prosecutor described it, and told the maker's name; but could not tell the number.]</p>

She used to snap her fingers at us, and bid us kiss her backside.

When she took up this girl, she got me to go with her to Hungerford, and went round by justice Fielding's, where she had me taken up. The girl was there, who said Mrs. Noble had offer'd her half a guinea and double apparel, if she would say I order'd her to rob her.</p>

I took them up, and the girl own'd she took the necklace, and deliver'd it under the table to her mother; the mother also confess'd she sold it for 26 s. to

I paid 26 s. for it, and sold it for a guinea and a half to a woman that came in about two hours after.

I followed him out of church. He perceived me, and drop'd the hat. I called out, Stop thief, and he was taken about a hundred yards from the place. He said he thought it to be his own, but he had got his own with him, and endeavour'd to hide it, by putting one into the other. He beg'd I would let him go, and said he'd make it up the next day, if I would let him know where I lived.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. I set the tankard on the stairs in the bar, which is in the tap-room, at which time Ridout had been in the house I believe two hours. Prosser came in after he had had two pints of beer. As soon as they were gone I missed the tankard, and pursuing them Ridout was taken in Southampton-Street. I could not overtake the other, but he was taken in about a week after. I heard Ridout confess he took the tankard from the bar, and gave it to Prosser, who ran away with it; and Prosser said he carried it to a cobler, who sold it to one Woodhouse for a guinea, and that he had one half guinea, and the cobler the other.</p>

            . I am a fellow soldier with the prisoner Prosser. On Tuesday night the 15th of August I was standing at my barrack door in the Savoy; (Prosser's barrack was over mine.) I heard something fall. I step'd out and saw something shine. I took it up and held it to a lamp, and saw it was a cover to a silver tankard. Prosser said, that is mine, give it me; which I did. I said to him next morning, do you intend to make a good hand of it? take care of yourself. When we were in St. James's Park, I told one or two of my comrades of it, and said, I fear'd he did not come honestly by it. Then I and two others went to his barrack, and opened the place where he lay; but found nothing. It got to the sergeant major's car, who sent for me. Then I was ordered to go to the colonel next morning; and there I related the whole affair. He ordered the corporal and I to go and confine the prisoner in the Savoy; which we did. He was taken before justice St. Lawrence, where he said the cover was tin. Ridout being there, was asked whether Prosser was the person concerned with him? He said, he was. Then Prosser own'd he carried the tankard to a cobler; that the cobler carried it to the house of one Woodhouse in Oxford-Road, and brought out a guinea for it, gave him a half guinea; and kept the other himself.</p>

               <p>When he received sentence of death, being overwhelmed with grief and tears, and not able to speak much, he delivered into court a paper, which was read to this purport:</p>
               <p>'' My Lord, I am the unhappy perpetrator of that '' most horrid and unparallel'd crime of which I '' stand charged; and as I have nothing to sue for '' but the mercy of God to my poor soul, I will give '' this honourable court no farther trouble: But as '' a penitent, sensible of my horrid guilt, I earnestly '' beg the prayers of all good christians; that God '' through his infinite mercy, and through the intercession '' of our blessed Saviour and Redeemer Jesus '' Christ, may blot out this stain of shedding innocent '' blood; and as the motives which induced '' me to do the wicked act will not appear here, '' as I do now acknowledge my guilt, in order that '' the publick may be fully satisfied of the same, I '' have delivered under my own hand writing, a '' just and full account of the whole progress of that '' sad and fatal transaction, from the beginning to '' its final and fatal end: To be published by Mrs. '' Walker the publisher, the morning after I am no '' more in this transitory world: In hopes the same '' will be a warning to all others, to avoid the steps '' that led me to it; and God of his infinite mercy '' I hope will have mercy on me.''</p>

I order'd all the gates to be lock'd, and put proper watches over the prisoners to have them all search'd. The turnkey and I found the watch upon the prisoner (produced in court, and deposed to.) The prisoner was in for stealing a book; he was very much in liquor, and said he did not know how he came by the watch.</p>

               <p>Jones. It was hanging up by the side of the wall?</p>

               <p>Jones. He was very drunk. He had been in the bar about half an hour before I missed it. There were two watches hung side by side, this was one of them; the other was hanging afterwards. He was the first person I search'd, because he was the last person that had been in the bar.</p>

After I had looked about some time and could not find it, I took the rod and struck my child, who is between eight and nine years old; thinking she had let somebody come in and take it. The child said, nobody had been there but her uncle. Then my servant,

            , told me he had been there a second time; and she left him in the room when she went a milking. Then I went to look for a pocket-handkerchief in my box; and I found that broke open. I had a trunk in my box, which was taken away; and my money was gone, and the buckles mentioned in the indictment.</p>

            . I got only the buckles again. I went and found the prisoner at the sign of the Harrow, at the corner of Panton-Street. I took his own brother with me; and there he talked of lending his brother money, and of paying the landlord there an old score. Then I told the landlord he had paid him with my money; and desired the landlord would assist in securing him, but he would not; neither would he let the watchman come into the house to assist. While we were talking the prisoner had like to have got away; but I got hold of him. Then I took him to St. James's Round-house. Going along he confessed he broke open my box with the poker, and took the trunk out and wrapped it up in my great coat, and carried it away; and that he had sold my great coat for five shillings and six-pence, and spent the money. I ask'd him for the money he had left. He put his hand in his pocket in a passion, and pulled out three-pence halfpenny, my silver buttons, and a little bit of silver, which I found in the street two or three years ago (not laid in the indictment.) Presently he took out the two pair of buckles, and gave them to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150008"/> me. Then I told him I lost three pounds seven shillings in money, in gold and silver. He acknowledged he took the whole, and that he opened my trunk, took the things out, and left it in Piccadilly at a publick house.</p>

               <p>The other followed me to the door, and said, what man? I said, that man; and pointed to him. They left me at my door and went to him; and all 3 ran together. I turned into the shop to see what I had missed; and I missed some callico wrapper. My husband was in the back room. He followed them. I know nothing more, only that the goods are here, and my property.</p>

            . I was in the back parlour when these people came in; but I did not see them. My wife told me they had rob'd us of some callico-wrapper. I pursued, and at the end of North-Audley-Street I was directed to three men; two in red, and one in light colour cloaths. They ran, and I ran. I called stop thief. They made a stop in the field, and he in the light colour'd cloaths turn'd on the right. I pursued the prisoners, and took hold of Kelsey's collar (He had this hanger in his hand; producing one.) The other took hold of my hand. Kelsey drew the hanger out. I catch'd hold on some part of the hilt, secured it and them and carried them to the Red-Lion. There went the landlord and others to see for the other person as I directed them; and they returned, and brought this wrapper (here produced ) which they said they found in a ditch.</p>

               <p>Waradle. I took them before justice Fielding. There they were examined, and he committed them. Going to gaol the two prisoners told me, the other person was a recruit which got away.</p>

               <p>Waradle. I believe they ran better than half a quarter of a mile together.</p>

            . I sat in my room in little Queen-Street, and saw three men, two in soldiers cloaths, and one in a light colour'd coat, run by my window. The first soldier drop'd something white, and he stoop'd and pick'd it up; but whether it was paper or linen, I know not. Then the people came after in a hue and cry; and I told them which way they went.</p>
               <p>Kelsey's defence.</p>
               <p>I never was in the shop at all. I gave a young fellow a shilling to serve his majesty king George. He wanted a handkerchief. They went in to buy him one, and came out directly. The woman came making a crying, and said they had taken some of her things. She said, she would hang us right or wrong.</p>

               <p>I went in with the recruit to buy him a handkerchief; and there was nobody in the shop. I knock'd with my foot. Then the woman came and ran against me; and then out of doors. She saw the prisoner go by the shop window, and said, that man has got some of my goods. I said, not that man I am sure; because he has not been in. I said, I'd go and see if he had any thing. I went, and he had nothing. The occasion of our running in the field was, we were running a race for a tankard of beer; and the recruit ran away from us.</p>

He wanted a private room, a bed, and something for supper. I told him there were only two gentlemen and I in another room, he might come in there. He came, and had some wine. Then he wanted to join company with them. One of them did, and they spent three pence each. The others went and left him and I alone. I did not like him, he swore very much. I told my servant so. He had a silver mug, and I bid him keep an eye upon it. While I was standing opposite to the door, I saw him come towards the door twice. When I went into the room he was laying as though asleep on the table. I told him it was customary for people that had not a horse to pay for their liquor before they went to bed; which he did. I had not been gone five minutes before my man, call'd out stop thief. He brought him back with the mug in his hand.</p>

               <p>Green. I did. My wife did not know where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether any body that went to draw small beer could perceive it or not ?</p>
               <p>Green. They might go twenty times and never see it, it lay so close. There was but just room to put it in, and it was in a dark brown bag.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is the cellar?</p>
               <p>Green. The cellar is just high enough for a but to stand in.</p>
               <p>Court. Then your money lay just about as high as a man's eye when he stands up?</p>
               <p>Green. Yes, it did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your money afterwards?</p>
               <p>Green. The prisoner produced it. It is now in the constable's hands. I accused him with taking it, and he surrender'd eleven thirty-six shilling pieces,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150010"/> sixteen guineas, and 2 twenty-seven shilling pieces, which was all but one half guinea, which he had spent a trifle of.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>Green. Master, said he, it is not your money; I broke no lock nor drawer, I found it. I told him the number and value of the pieces before he produced it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he had it in his possession?</p>
               <p>Green. About twenty-four hours.</p>
               <p>Court. Then he had time enough to have gone off with it ?</p>
               <p>Green. Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a yearly servant?</p>
               <p>Green. He is. He has been with me a year next Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he behaved while in your service?</p>
               <p>Green. He has behaved well. I never found any thing amiss of him before this, and if he is cleared I'll let him to work again.</p>
               <p>Q. If this money had been laid in a proper drawer, or place where money is used to be put, whether you think he'd have taken it ?</p>
               <p>Green. I think he would not.</p>

On the 20th of July last, between one and two o'clock, the goods mention'd in the indictment were all in my lodging-room, up one pair of stairs, in the house of Mary Racket, then a widow; the box the shirts were'in, and the cloaths on it, were taken away, but I can't say the exact time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get them again?</p>
               <p>Jones. I have all my cloaths again, except two shirts. The prisoner was taken with some of the things on his back, and carried before justice St. Lawrence, where he said he bought them of a woman, and denied having any of the money.

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Jones. I had seen him once or twice come into Mary Racket's house, and call for a penny worth of beer; I know not how he came by the things.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jones. I had inform'd my uncle, at the Plough in St. Martin's Lane, of my loss, who told me he let a man with such cloaths on a horse, to go to a place near Edgware, so I and another went after him. (The cloaths found produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>

            . I went after this man. My brother-in-law living with the prosecutor, he was committed on suspicion of stealing these things. There came in a porter at the Gentleman and Porter in Leicester Fields, where the box was taken from, who said he had carried a box the last night from Rupert-street to somewhere in the Strand. Justice St. Lawrence granted me a warrant, so I went with the prosecutor, and we took the prisoner after looking for him at divers places to no purpose; but having had further intelligence of him, we went to Kingsbury Green, and found he had been at a farmer's house there, but was gone towards London. I followed him, and found him at an alehouse door. By his dress and the horse he rode, I took him to be the person. I ask'd him his name, he said Smith. I asked him if he had not once lived at the Cock in the Haymarket, and he said no. I took him and had him before justice St. Lawrence, with the prosecutor's coat. waistcoat and shirt on, which he own'd. On searching him, he had three shillings and some halfpence in his pocket. He was committed to Newgate on his second examination, and by his direction the box was found at the Green Man and Still in Tyburn-road. I saw it opened, there were four shirts and a coat in it, and the prosecutor swore to the things there.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How many shirts were found in the box?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were four, my property.</p>
               <p>Q. How big was the box?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was three quarters of a yard in length.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door where it was kept lock'd or unlock'd?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. We had a bean feast that day, and many people going up and down stairs the door was not lock'd.</p>

            . On the Sunday after the prisoner was taken up I went to see him in Newgate, when he told me he believed we might find the things at the Hog in the Pound in Tyburn-road; we went accordingly, and found them there.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the Green Man and Still?</p>
               <p>Thornton. It is the same house, only it has a double sign. I saw the box opened, and some shirts taken out of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was at work for one farmer Finch at Kingsbury-Green. On a wet day I came to London, and met with one Stapleton, who had got that box, and talk'd of going on board the Antigallican privateer; he said he would sell me the cloaths very cheap, so I agreed with him for 30 s. for the coat, waistcoat, and shirts. I paid part of the money in the Hay-market, and told him I would pay the rest in Lambeth Marsh, at the King's-Arm, where I attend.</p>
               <p>Brown. When I was bringing the prisoner to town, he sham'd drunk, and fell from his horse twice; he then wanted to call at an alehouse to do a chare for himself, where he flung this Common-Prayer book down the vault, and the landlord and we took it out (producing one.)</p>

               <p>Brown. That is about half a mile distant from the place where the box was taken from.</p>

I put my cloaths and money, all I had in the world, in a bag, as she was standing by, and left it in a loft, hanging upon a peg. On the 16th of August we went all together to work in a field about a mile and a half from it. She quitted the field about the middle of the day, and my master's son happening to see her coming out of the lost, between one and two o'clock, he and my master pursued after her, took her, and secured her at Mims, where I saw her. She denied the silk handkerchief and the money ( the goods produced in court, and deposed to.) The gown (with the other things) she had on her back under her own.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say for herself?</p>
               <p>S. Thomas. She said she had taken them, but never saw the money or handkerchief. I had put the money up in a rag, and put it into the bag with the other things.</p>

               <p>Q. How came the prisoner into your room?</p>
               <p>H. Smart. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain what you mean by being concern'd with you.</p>
               <p>H. Smart. I felt him in my body, in the very act, before I had power to speak; as soon as I spoke he went out of the room. I went and sat down, and felt my body very sore.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sensible of any thing that came from him?</p>
               <p>H. Smart. I can't say there did. My two children were in the room at the same time; the girl five years old, the boy three.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband?</p>
               <p>H. Smart. He was not come from work. A girl that sells oisters at our door came up stairs, and ask'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150012"/> me how I did. I said a man had been up and used me very ill, so that I could not sit in my chair. [The thing was transacted in an elbow chair.] The prisoner lodges in the garret, and I live up two pair of stairs; I never was in his room, nor he in mine before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever drink together?</p>
               <p>H. Smart. No; I have no manner of acquaintance with him, any more than good night or good morrow, as I saw him go up stairs and down.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you very subject to fits ?</p>
               <p>H. Smart. I have for many years, and have been an out-pensioner at Bartholomew's hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the affair happened before you took this man up?</p>
               <p>H. Smart. I went and made my complaint to justice Fielding the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body of it before ?</p>
               <p>H. Smart. Nobody but the woman who came up, my husband (whom I told of it aswsoon as he came home) and one

            , who would have had me not to have told my husband of it. The mob was so violent when I was coming from Mr. Fielding's, that they had like to have torn me to pieces; the constable had a hard piece of work to save my life. My neighbours are all Irish people, of the prisoner's country, that were so violent with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I only endeavour'd to keep her from her fits.</p>

               <p>H. Smart. I fell into a fit assoon as I got in, finding myself very sick before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this man ever before come into your room, to assist you when in fits?</p>
               <p>H. Smart. No, never to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>H. Smart. I have heard in the neighbourhood he is 65 years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these fits occasioned by drinking strong liquors?</p>

            . I am husband to the last witness. I was at work last Friday was seven-night, and came home at the usual time. We lay by at seven o'clock, I am a taylor. I found my wife in a single chair, when she said, My dear, I have been treated very ill, the rabbit merchant has used me so and so; I spoke to him, and he ran down stairs. I went down to my landlady, to ask her if she knew where he was, and desired her to let me know when she saw him. I heard from above soon after, that he was below. I went down and laid hold of him, and they offer'd to help me with him to the stone house. He was very unwilling at first, but afterwards he went willingly enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there an opportunity for him to have made his escape, after your landlady had told him of it?</p>

               <p>Smart. No, I ran down directly.</p>

               <p>E. Winington. My landlady. She struggled and he held her arms in the arm chair. I went down stairs, and when I went up again the man had come down, which must have been in about four minutes. He said, Lord bless me, I can't hold her; she is too strong for me.</p>

               <p>E. Winington. Yes, Sir. A neighbour asked her for some money, and she went up stairs, and flung herself into that fit. I saw her fuddled that night.</p>

She said to my wife, did you see two gentlemen that I draw'd a tankard of beer for? My wife said, she had not seen any body; and she'd be hang'd if the tankard was not stoln. I ask'd the maid how she came to draw in a tankard to two strangers ? She said, she had seen one (that is, the prisoner at the bar) three or four times before; and she believed he lived in the neighbourhood. Missing my tankard, I advertised it in the Publick-Advertiser, two guineas reward; but have not seen it since. About seven weeks ago there came two men to my house, and asked me if I had lost a tankard? I said, I had; and had not found it since. They wanted me to describe the men I suspected. I call'd the maid, and she described one of the men. She said, the other held down his face. They said, there was such a man in Bridewell, committed by my Lord-mayor for picking a pocket. I and the maid went along with them, but kept these two men out, and desired the girl going along to be exceeding careful who she pitch'd upon. Going in she said, the prisoner at the bar was the man that call'd for the tankard of beer, and also for a pint of twopenny to put into it; and when she came up, they and the tankard were gone ( he was in his waistcoat.) I desired he'd put his coat on. She said; there was no occasion, for she was positive. I took him before Mr. Fielding, and there she swore to him. All he said was, he never was at my house in his life time. They did not pay their reckoning.</p>

            . I have seen the prisoner several times come into master Taber's house, and I always draw'd him a tankard of beer. He used to bring two or three people with him. I draw'd him a tankard of beer on the 2d of June, at past ten at night, in a silver tankard, and delivered it to him. They were sitting in a box over against each other; and there were some lace men at the farther end of the room, and a soldier sat opposite to them (they were sitting near the street window.) They sent me down for a pint of twopenny, and I brought it up; but they were both gone, tankard and all.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Kelsey?</p>
               <p>A. Bagley. He was sitting in his place when they were gone. I went after this to Bridewell, and saw the prisoner in his waistcoat beating hemp. I knew him as well in his waistcoat as in his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you was in Bridewell did you pitch upon the prisoner?</p>
               <p>A. Bagley. I pitch'd upon him immediately.</p>

I heard her confess she carried brass to sell for a carpenter and his wife divers times. We took her before justice Keeling, and Davis was fetch'd thither.

It weigh'd twelve pounds, and I gave him nine shillings for it, at nine pence per pound. After the boy was gone I observed some pieces of it look uncommonly black. I took it to have been in the fire, in order to burn off the leather. Then I ordered my wife to let it continue in the scale, to see if any body would come to enquire about it; and in about half an hour's time there came a young man and woman, and ask'd if there was any such brass brought that day.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That was my servant, who went there to enquire.</p>
               <p>Wright. They brought a housing with them. I then judged it was the same they inquired about. Upon comparing it, they desired me to let them have some of it to carry to their master. I readily granted it. When the man was at justice Keeling's I was there. The man said, he bought it of a woman, and he could lend her [She was taken by his deferioing her the same night, and brought.] There she correcyed she had a full pot and a dram for selling it to Davis. said, he gave her four shillings and six-pence for it, and I gave him nine shillings; but then I believe there was but a little above eight pounds of that brass, some of the parcel being old because and other sort of stuff.</p>

About the 18th of July my house was under a general repair, and we had removed our things out of the way of the workman as much as we could. The piece of silk was in a drawer, the breeches lay open in a one pair of stairs room, and the other things mentioned in the indictment in the house. They were all taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find them again ?</p>
               <p>Shudal. I have got them all again. The prisoner at the bar hired herself to my wife as a single woman, and a stranger to our part of the town; but we were immediately convinced she was a base woman. At her first coming she would stay a great length of time in going of errands, and for other ill behaviour I turned her away at three weeks end. After which there came a man to me, and inquired if I had lost a pair of breeches? I said, I had. Then the person told me who had them. I went then and took a warrant for the prisoner, and one Bowen. Upon which Bowen came to me and told me he had bought the breeches of the prisoner; which she, when before the justice, owned also. She also confessed in my hearing, she did take all the things mentioned in the indictment; and she gave her key to Mrs. Jenkins (who was by at the time) who went to her box and found the other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was her box?</p>
               <p>Shudal. In her master's house, Mr. Watson in Smithfield (the goods produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jenkins. I live at Fleetditch, and the prisoner had lived with me several times on and off. After I was informed the prosecutor had lost these things, I sent for her to ask her about them; at first she denied it, but before we went to the justice she own'd she stole the breeches, and sold them to Bowen. I insisted upon her keys to look over er things, imagining there might be something of mine there, and in searching her box these other things were found in it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150016"/>Q. What was her behaviour while she lived with you?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jenkins. I always thought her to have the best of characters, I have trusted her with things of great value, and was much surprised to see her turn out in this manner.</p>

            . I am a constable in Shadwell parish There being a great outcry between twelve and one o'clock, on the 7th of August at night, I went to see what was the matter, and Mr. Clark gave me charge of the prisoner Collings for a robbery. I took her to the watch-house, and after a little time the prisoner King was brought in by some other person. The prosecutor was there, and I asked him if he knew either of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Jones. At first he did not seem to be in liquor. He told me he was sure they were the two persons that had rob'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you in what manner they rob'd him?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, he did not. He said he had lost a hat and ring, and some money, and charged me with both of them. I asked him more than once whether he was sure the prisoners were the persons that rob'd him, and he said he was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoners say?</p>
               <p>Jones. Collings denied the fact. King said she found the hat.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was the hat found?</p>
               <p>Jones. I don't know, I did not see it that night, nor the ring neither. I searched King, but found nothing upon her. [The hat and ring were then produced in court.]</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Do you know whose property these are ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are mine, and what I lost that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clark. About a quarter of an hour under or over twelve o'clock at night, August the 7th, Collings came into my house, and wanted two penny-worth of bread and cheese. I said, you shall have nothing here. She then wanted me to change a piece of money. I saw it was only a counter, so would have nothing to do with it. The prosecutor was at the door; she ran out to him, put her hand into his pocket, took out a six pence, and gave it me to change. The other prisoner was there; they took him one under one arm, and the other under the other, and drag'd him along. He drop'd on his knees, and I saw King take his hat from off his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this hat here produced the same?</p>
               <p>Clerk. I can't say it is. I observed King had him fast by the hand, tho' I did not see the ring taken from him; but he missed it directly.</p>

I took hold of the pot and drank to the man of the house, he drank to Clark, and Clark to the prisoner, the prisoner drank it up, and bid the landlord till it. Then the prisoner went and sat down by the right side of the prosecutor, sat there some time, and sang a song or two; at last he removed from thence, and sat at the corner of the box; after that he came and sat by me, Clark and I being drinking together in the opposite box. The prosecutor got up, and feeling for his watch said. I have lost my watch. The prisoner went out directly. Clark had some suspicion of him, as he lodged in the house and had never seen the prisoner there before, so went out after him. [He was obliged to go into the country next morning, so we are destitute of his evidence.] I went out soon after, and then the prisoner was at the door again; they were arguing who should go in first. Clark said, I lodge here, and can come in when I please. I asked what was the matter, and the prisoner saying he would not go in, I took him by the collar, led him in, and searched him. Then Clark said, he has been up a little further, let us go and see if he has not left the watch there. We went, and there I saw the watch lying under a bench by the side of a door, about a dozen or 14 yards from the house where we were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Clark go to him to the place where you found the watch before the prisoner came in?</p>
               <p>Williams. No, he did not, but stood at the door and call'd to him, and he came to the door; nobody went thither till after we had brought the prisoner into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Clark been out of the house before you went out ?</p>
               <p>Williams. I believe he had not been gone above a minute or two.</p>

               <p>A. Stevens.

            . I had placed my goods in an empty house belonging to one Jones, an upholsterer, as I was going abroad, and my wife was gone out of town for the benefit of the air, being in an ill state of health. The prisoner and his family were admitted to live in part of the house below stairs, rent free, by the landlord, and my goods were lock'd up in a one pair of stairs room. I went abroad in April, and return'd in November. I expressed my uneasiness at my goods being in a dangerous situation, and on the first of May I applied to look at the house where they were placed.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150019"/> I found there was a padlock on the outer iron gate belonging to the house. I inquired of the people in the neighbourhood, who told me the prisoner had not been seen for two or three days, and that a cart load of goods had been convey'd away a few days before that. Upon this I went to the landlord, and desired him to come with me to the house. He did so, and we broke a door open to get in; and upon opening the door of the room where my goods were placed, and searching the trunks (wherein had been put goods of all sorts, linen, china, &amp;c.) we found every thing empty; but as there are some particular articles that I can charge him with, I think it needless to trouble the court with the rest; the following things we can produce, a gause handkerchief embroider'd with gold, 5 cambrick handkerchiefs, and a remnant of cambrick (produced in court and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with them?</p>
               <p>Barbutt. At Mr. Gibons's a pawnbroker, at the corner of Turnstile, but did not secure the prisoner till the 13th of last month, as he was out of the way and I could not find him. When I charged him with having rob'd me, he seem'd to be extremely concern'd for what he had done. He was examined before the justice, where he own'd the fact, and was committed to the Gatehouse. He gave an account where part of the things were, and we found them by his direction.</p>

            . I live at Marybone, and lodge at the house of William Green. I lost upwards of 40 l. but there is a mistake in the indictment for instead of 3 guineas it should have been 30; there were upwards of 30, which I lost along with the foreign gold pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the money taken from?</p>
               <p>Limbrick. It was all in one drawer, in my lodging room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Limbrick. She was my servant about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the drawers lock'd?</p>
               <p>Limbrick. They were, but by taking out the upper drawer the board it run upon was broke; so she could put her hand down and take it out.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose it?</p>
               <p>Limbrick. It was in January was twelve months. She left my house upon it, and I advertised her directly. When she was taken, she confessed the fact to me. I asked her how she came to rob me. She said she took all the money, and was sorry for it. I asked her what she had done with it, and she said she had squander'd it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention any of the particular pieces ?</p>
               <p>Limbrick. No, she did not. She said that after she had taken it she went to a house in Drury-Lane, where she gave a woman four guineas to go and buy her some things.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.</p>

               <p>Q. How came he first to your house?</p>
               <p>Price. He was brought to my house by Mr. Wilkerson, his wife, and Miss Wilkerson, who dances on the wire at the Wells. On the 11th of August he paid me five pounds eleven shillings and six-pence, being the last day of his being at my house. When he was gone I carried the money to my wife, who keeps my money. She said, I think here is a piece of gold like a thirty six shilling piece.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150020"/> She went to put it to the other money, but every shilling was gone. I went in search of him, and being told he was at the Swan in Smithfield I found him there, and charged him with robbing me that morning. He at first denied it, and said, you know I told you I had but two guineas, and now I have but a guinea and half, and said I might search him; I put my hand in his pocket, and pull'd out twenty-four pounds ten shillings, and a Queen-Ann's crown piece that I can swear to, made in the year 1713, and yellow'd over.</p>
               <p>Q. In what coin was this money?</p>
               <p>Price. It was some guineas, some nine-shilling pieces, thirty-six shilling pieces, and moidores. After that he own'd he had rob'd me. I ask'd him if this money I had found upon him was mine ? He said, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that crown piece last?</p>
               <p>Price. I can't tell. I told him that was my crown piece, and that he stole it from me; yes, said he, I did ( produced in court, and deposed to.) I carried him back to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you know it ?</p>
               <p>Price. There is a little scratch on the face of it, and the yellow is worn off that part by keeping it in my pocket. My predecessor left it me, and I always kept it; was it put among a hundred crown pieces I'd pick it out. He had got a Pinchbeck watch in his pocket. Some of the people pull'd it out, and ask'd me if it was mine? I knew it, and said it was, and that both I and my wife would swear to it; he said, it was mine. I then charged him with stealing 120 l. He said, if I'd go home with him, he'd give me what he had not spent; but what he had spent, he could not give me. I charged him with taking other watches. He denied taking any, except this, and one which he sold in Cheapside, to Mr. Watkinson Wildman; that he said he took out of my house, and that he had changed it with seven guineas for another watch, name Clark.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that, silver or gold?</p>
               <p>Price. Mine was a silver one. My wife knowing best what money was lost, charged him with that in my hearing. He said, he had but so much out of one bag, and so much out of another; not allowing he had taken so much as she said he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any other of the watches since ?</p>
               <p>Price. No, I have not. He was carried before justice Keeling, and there he wrote a confession with his own hands, and sign'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the money taken from?</p>
               <p>Price. From out of a chest or drawers in the chamber I lie in. I never troubled myself with that, but left it with my wife. When I wanted 20 l. or 30 l. I had it from her, and the watches were some in a glass case on the drawers, and some in the drawers.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come first to lodge with you?</p>
               <p>Price. A fortnight before the 11th of August, but he had used my house a fortnight before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he lodge before?</p>
               <p>Price. At the White Lion in Wood's Close, as they tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take him to be?</p>
               <p>Price. They told me he was an esquire, but I did not believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he himself tell you?</p>
               <p>Price. He told me he was a planter's son in Antigoa; he fell in love with Miss Wilkerson, and was going to make away with himself for her, as I was inform'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not Miss Wilkerson and he frequently together at your house?</p>
               <p>Price. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he run up in that fortnight's time?</p>
               <p>Price. He run most of that score he paid me before he came to lodge with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can't you tell how much money he spent in that fortnight?</p>
               <p>Price. I cannot. There was once nine or ten of them at supper together.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is he?</p>
               <p>Price. He told me he was very near seventeen years old.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to encourage him to bring Miss Wilkerson to your house?</p>
         
               <p>N. B. The second Part of these Proceedings will be published in a few Days.</p>

               <p>Price. I TOLD him I would trust him no more, and after I was rob'd she never came more.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you have not proposed or told any body, that if he wou'd confess the taking of your money you would not prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Price. There was such a thing mention'd by the gentlemen; they desired him to confess where the money was.</p>
               <p>Q. Name who mention'd that.</p>
               <p>Price. Mr. Rosoman offer'd him 5 guineas to tell where the money was, and said if he would he shou'd go about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this in the presence of the justice?</p>
               <p>Price. I believe it was, but am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Rosoman?</p>
               <p>Price. He keeps Sadler's Wells.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you make him such a promise as to forgive him, if he would tell you where the money was?</p>
               <p>Price. I don't know but I might say, Be so good as to tell me where my money is, and if you lie in gaol, or are sent abroad, and want any money, you shall not starve.</p>
               <p>Q. Let the court know the express terms that any body mention'd to him, about favour being shewn him.</p>
               <p>Price. I know no more than what I have told already; I myself made him no farther promise than what I have said, that he should not want in gaol till he came to be tried.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. The prisoner came to lodge at our house the latter end of July, and staid a fortnight. He went from our house on the 11th of August, about a quarter after six. I had about 18 watches in my bed room, and upwards of 300 l. in cash, which I missed that same day. My husband came up stairs, and gave me some money he had received of the prisoner, 3 guineas and a 36 s piece. I asked him where he had the 36 s. piece, for it was like my own money. I then took the key of the drawer which lay on the table and open'd it, and all was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that 36 s. piece?</p>
               <p>E. Price. I forgot to bring it with me; it is at home.</p>
               <p>Q. What coin did your cash that is missing consist of?</p>
               <p>E. Price. There were one hundred pounds tied up in a canvas bag, 5 times nineteen guineas and 5 s. in silver; there was a purse with 48 guineas, and another green silk purse with thirty seven 36 s. pieces, in another old green silk purse there were 27 moidores, and in a piece of paper there were wrap'd up 36 pounds in gold and silver, in order to pay my landlord; there were also eight pounds eight shillings in silver, tied up in a canvas bag, and a quantity of gold in a running cash bag, I don't know how much, but imagine there might be about twenty or thirty pounds of it; it was in a hair bag, and I had taken seven guineas out of it over-night; and there was a particular crown piece lay upon the gold in the same drawer where all the money lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the drawer where the money was always kept lock'd?</p>
               <p>E. Price. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the watches ?</p>
               <p>E. Price. They were in a glass case upon the chest of drawers: There was a bag, in which there was a bond belonging to us, and there was also a 20 l. bank note taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to leave that key on the table?</p>
               <p>E. Price. It was often left on the table, but the two room doors were always lock'd. Upon missing the money I call'd my husband up, and ask'd for my money (thinking he had done something with it.) He ask'd me if I was mad. The prisoner was brought back to our house about eleven o'clock that morning. I ask'd him for my own watch. He said, Mrs. Price, I have not your own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150023"/> watch; but if you'll go down stairs into your room I'll give you your watch. When he went into my room I saw a watch hang out of his pocket. I pull'd it out, and said, that is not what I mean by my own watch, but this is one of mine; it is a Pinchbeck meta watch (produced in court, and deposed to.) I said to him, is not this mine? He said, yes madam, it is. I was call'd down stairs, and left my husband and Mr. Rosoman with him. Sometime after that we went up stairs, and on the bed where he lay, there was my watch laid wrap'd up in a dirty piece of paper on the top of a press bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that?</p>
               <p>E. Price. I did not bring that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that taken from?</p>
               <p>E. Price. It was in a drawer among my own cloaths, in the same room where I lay. I had wound it up about five o'clock in the afternoon the day before. I charged him at the same time with taking the several sums of money mentioned. He said, he took the money wrap'd up in the paper and the money out of the purse, and put in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own he took all the money?</p>
               <p>E. Price. No, he never owned he took the 100 l. bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own he had taken all the watches which you missed?</p>
               <p>E. Price. No, he said he had taken but two watches; but there were several snuff boxes that he had taken out of the same shew glass. He made a present of one to Miss Wilkerson (a Pinchbeck snuff box, with two gold rings, produced in court.) These were delivered to me by Miss. Wilkerson. The box is mine, and I can swear to one of the rings. The other I cannot, because the stone has been altered.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lose that ring from?</p>
               <p>E. Price. From out of the glass case.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that worth?</p>
               <p>E. Price. It is not worth above 15 or 16 s. ( Another watch produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this silver watch, do you k now it?</p>
               <p>E. Price. This is also my property. This was at Mr. Wildman's a goldsmith's, and I lately offered it for four guineas and a half to one of Mr. Rosoman's waiters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the money that was taken from the prisoner?</p>
               <p>E. Price. I did; there were twenty four guineas or thereabouts. He said he took it out of the drawer. At that time he told us he had sold a watch to Mr. Wildman. My husband was by.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any threats made use of before he acknowledged this ?</p>
               <p>E. Price. The gentlemen said, if he'd give the poor people their money again, things should be made easy.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>E. Price. This was at the justice's, but I was in too great a passion to observe much what was said.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the 11th of August that you saw the ninety-five guineas and five shillings in silver?</p>
               <p>E. Price. Two days before I had it in my hand and tied it up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that time did you see the 37 thirty-six shilling pieces?</p>
               <p>E. Price. I saw them on the Monday morning before, and the moidores also. The other money I saw on Wednesday morning</p>
               <p>Q. Were the keys left in the doors?</p>
               <p>E. Price. So he says, but not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your's a publick house?</p>
               <p>E. Price. It is, but nobody goes up there.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of your money have you got again?</p>
               <p>E. Price. About twenty-four pounds ten shillings, and three watches.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did he acknowledge he took?</p>
               <p>E. Price. He acknowledged he took thirty-six pounds, the running cash, and the forty guineas, and put in halfpence. He said he had paid his taylor and his millener, and had bought I don't know how many things with the money.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Wildman, a gold-smith, in Cheapside. On the 19th of July between eight and nine o'clock the youth at the bar came to the shop, and asked to see some stone buckles. I shew'd him some, and he bought a pair of shoe buckles, a pair of knee buckles, a gold watch chain, and key, a gold compass seal, and a case to hold the silver buckles in; in all he paid five pounds four shillings. He came about the Thursday following with the pair of stone shoe buckles, and desired I'd take them again. I told him. I would, but could not allow him so much as he gave for them. I give him thirty-six shillings. Then he desired I'd keep them a few days, and he'd fetch them again; he said his father did not like them. He came on the 31st of July and ask'd for them. I gave him them, and he gave me a thirty-six shilling piece. Pray, said he, have you ever a good plain gold watch? I shew'd him one, and took in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150024"/> exchange between this silver watch here produced, and that, seven guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baileys. I am clerk to justice Keeling. The prisoner was brought before him, and ask'd, if he'd make a voluntary confession? He said, yes. What Mr. Rosoman said to him, was after he had sign'd it. There were no such words said to him before the justice of giving him five guineas. After the confession was made, I read it over to him three times, and each time he was ask'd if he was satisfied; and he answered he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mr. Rosoman ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He is not here.</p>

               <p>Court. We can't suffer this confession to be read under the circumstances of such a promise made, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Isabella Wilkerson. (She takes a Pinchbeck snuff box in her hand, and the ring the prosecutor's wife deposed to.) I know both these, I had them of Mr. Langley.</p>
               <p>Q. What time had you them of him?</p>
               <p>I. Wilkerson. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to part with them?</p>
               <p>I. Wilkerson. I heard he was taken up, so I delivered the box to Mrs. Price on the 11th of August. I don't know who I delivered the ring to.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they given you both at one time?</p>
               <p>I. Wilkerson. No, they were not; the box was given to me first, and I have worn the ring a good many times. I believe pretty near a week.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Langley ?</p>
               <p>I. Wilkerson. About a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he first become acquainted with you?</p>
               <p>I. Wilkerson. At the Wells.</p>
               <p>Q. What, before he came to lodge at Mr. Price's ?</p>
               <p>I. Wilkerson. Yes, he told my Papa when I had done performing to come and sup with him; but I did not know the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever wear that ring in Mr. Price's house ?</p>
               <p>I. Wilkerson. Yes I have, and used the snuff box too, many times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I made that confession because Mr. Price told me he would set me at liberty. I hope your Lordship will consider my youth. I am not sixteen years of age. I beg to be transported.</p>

            . I was servant to Mrs. Howel. She sent me to get three thirty-six shilling pieces changed. I went in at the Peacock, the corner of Exeter Street, and ask'd the mistress to give me change for one. She said, she could not. Then the prisoner took it in her hand, and said it was a counterfeit, and swore I should not have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150025"/> it. She flung it upon the table to chink it, and then took it up and put it into her pocket. She had a pewter plate in her hand, and swore if I offer'd to touch her she'd cut me down with it. I laid hold on her arm (she had lost blood that day) and it fell a bleeding, so I let her go. She went out, and then into her own house in Catharine-court, near White-Hart Yard; I followed her, and sent mistress word that I was rob'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the landlady of the house see her take it?</p>
               <p>Turner. She saw her fling it down on the table, but she said, she could not swear she saw her take it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the landlady hear all the conversation between the prisoner and you about it?</p>
               <p>Turner. She must hear all that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner stay in that house after she had got it?</p>
               <p>Turner. I believe about fifteen minutes. When I took the prisoner to the justice the woman of the house was sent for, and she swore she saw the piece of money flung down on the table, and I swore the prisoner took it up. She was committed to New-Prison for farther examination.</p>

He ask'd for change for a thirty-six shilling piece, and said I had got the piece. Mrs. Pratt (the woman of the house) said, she never saw any thirty-six shilling piece he had.

            . I am a soldier now, but then was a watchman in the parish. I happened to be at justice Fielding's when the prisoner and prosecutor were there. The prisoner wanted to get a warrant against him for scandal, in saying, she had rob'd him. After she was committed, he said to me, Buckle, you have known me some years; I said, yes, so I have. He said, if you'll go down to Mrs. Pratt's I'll treat you with a pot or two. We went down, and he call'd for a pot of beer. Then in came a woman. He took hold of her by the arm and charged me with her (he thought I was watchman then, but I was not ) and said, you are the woman that took my 36 s. piece.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that woman's name?</p>
               <p>Buckle. I don't know that; we took the woman to justice Fielding's. The people at the door said, he had committed one already, what would he do more? and kick'd him from the door. He said to me the woman that is committed is not the woman that took the piece of money.</p>

Then we went up and had a pint of wine, and I paid a shilling for my bed. We went both to bed, and the next morning about five o'clock she said, she wanted to go down stairs into the yard. Then I thought I would see what a clock it was. I went to look, and found my watch and my money were gone, and my breeches were taken from under my head. She had been gone about four or five minutes. Then I jump'd out of bed, and ran down stairs directly, and told the man of the house how I had been served.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it?</p>
               <p>Carpenter. A silver watch.</p>

            ) and I ran about to see if we could find the prisoner, and about five in the afternoon we met with her in Drury-Lane, at the King's Head. We carried her before justice Fielding, and he committed her to prison. I went to her there last Tuesday, and Welch with me. There she told me she had given the watch to the other prisoner, Murry. He was in New-Prison at that time. She sent a letter by me to Murry since she has been in Newgate, to know of him where he had pawn'd it, and he sent his mother along with me, to the pawnbroker's. She confessed to me she had the watch and money too our of my breeches, and gave them to Murry under the table in Drury-Lane where we took her, and Murry said, he had the watch of her in the same manner, and said, he was sorry for it, and hoped we would not hurt him.</p>

            . I am a painter. I neither knew the deceased nor the prisoner. On the second of August about half an hour after eleven at night, I saw the prisoner and a hackney coachman take a woman out of the coach, and I took her to be dead. It was in Chick-Lane, at the corner of Cross-Keys Court. The prisoner came out of the coach first. Then he laid hold of the woman's shoulders, and the coachman by the legs, and they carried her down to the house of Mrs. Deal, as they call her; it was her former husband's name, but her right name is Price. They laid her down at the door, on the threshold, and she could not stir hand, foot, nor leg, nor nothing in the world. She had no life in her at all seemingly.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you got the coachman here?</p>
               <p>Coroner. No, we could not find him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's council. We have him and shall call him.</p>
               <p>Dutton. The prisoner ask'd for a lodging for his wife and himself. Mrs. Price came to the door to him. She said, what is all this? what do you want? He said, he wanted a lodging, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150027"/> talked a good deal. She said, ther e is no lodging here. He said, don't make yourself uneasy; if any thing should happen I'll give you five guineas (but he pull'd out none.) Then I said, mistress, this woman is a dead woman, and I would not have you take her in upon any account. The prisoner said, dead! no, dead drunk. I said (shaking my head) I was afraid it would be worse than drunk. After more talk, she was admitted into the house. Then the prisoner and coachman carried her into a little room on the left hand side of the entry, where there was a bed. As soon as they had got her into the room the prisoner was for going away. Mrs. Price said, no Sir, if you go away pray take the woman or your wife (one was mention'd, I know not which) away with you. Then he made no more to do but undressed himself, and into bed he went.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober?</p>
               <p>Dutton. I believe he was hardly sober.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the woman in the bed?</p>
               <p>Dutton. No. She lay on the floor, by the side of the bed. He turned himself on his left side and call'd for the maid to come and undress the woman, and put her to bed. The maid was then gone to the coach to see what was left in it. She came in with one shoe and two dogs in her hand. Then she went to undress the woman, and I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion, as you saw her lying on the floor, was she dead or not?</p>
               <p>Dutton. Upon my oath I then thought she was a dead woman.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Green. I am servant to Mrs. Price. I went to undress the woman to put her to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she dead or alive?</p>
               <p>E. Green. Her legs felt very cold, and I did not perceive any breath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you undress her?</p>
               <p>E. Green. I did; and help'd her into bed. The prisoner got out of bed and took hold on her shoulders and I her feet, and we put her in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she warm about any part of her?</p>
               <p>E. Green. Her body was warm, her face was cold, and her stomach was warm; but her legs and hands were quite stiff.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, what did the prisoner do?</p>
               <p>E. Green. He went to bed to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they lie together in bed?</p>
               <p>E. Green. The watch had just gone twelve when he went to bed. He staid in bed with her till six in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at six?</p>
               <p>E. Green. No, I call'd my fellow servant up at six. Her name is

            . I came to her as soon as the prisoner went away, which was about five minutes after six. I applied and rub'd her with warm cloths, to see if I could fetch her again; but when we came to move her about seven o'clock we found she was quite stiff, and purged very much. We could hardly move her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you help to lay her out?</p>
               <p>E. Green. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any marks of violence upon her?</p>
               <p>E. Green. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think in your judgment that she came by any violent death, or had a fit, or was drunk, or what?</p>
               <p>E. Green. The blood had settled very much about her, but there were no marks of violence at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the blood settle?</p>
               <p>E. Green. Upon her arms, her back, and neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her belly or stomach swell'd greatly?</p>
               <p>E. Green. No, I did not see her after eleven o'clock.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150028"/>J. Price. I did apprehend she was dead before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever come to your house after that?</p>
               <p>J. Price. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who buried the woman?</p>
               <p>J. Price. I did, two days after.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to bury her without sending for the coroner?</p>
               <p>J. Price. I thought it was a scheme of some body to bring a woman out of a lodging house for me to bury. I did not think any thing else but that she was dead drunk, there being no marks of violence upon her. She was as fine a corps as ever I saw in my life. There were enough and enough people to see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she swell in her stomach?</p>
               <p>J. Price. Not a quarter so much as I have known some; but what liquor she had work'd out at her mouth was very strong.</p>

               <p>Hambleton. I helped her in.</p>

               <p>Hambleton. She groan'd, but did not speak a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she drunk?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. Yes she was drunk to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take her up?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. I took her up at the White-Horse in Little-Britain.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you drive her?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. I drove her about one third of a mile. They called coach as I went by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to take her in?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. The prisoner did. He said he was only going to Smithfield. I said I lived in Cold-Bath-Fields, and was going home; he said, then that will not hurt you. I helped him into the coach along with her; he said go gently, and take care of her, do not hurry too fast. When I came into Smithfield I asked him where I must go; he said just into Chick-Lane. I stopped at the place, and helped her out.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she when you helped her out?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. She was much as she was when we put her in. I saw no alteration in her, there was a strange man coming by, and he helped us with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend there was any violence done to the woman ?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. I apprehend there was not. He bid me take care when we helped her out.</p>

The prisoner came to me on the 14th of June, and told me he wanted a little fortment of hats to go down to Mr. Hall at Suston, about two miles from Ponders End. He said they were for one Mr. Hall, who lived in repute there, and sold hats and many other things in the haberdashery way, and if I used him well I should have a good customer of him. He appeared as a country farmer. I asked him where he lived; he said he lived next door to the church at Torrenham, that he had a great farm there, and had lived there some time, and kept cows and horses, and should be glad to see me there. I told him I would come down when I had a little time, and in a little time after that I did; but he had got that and also another parcel of goods of me first. The first parcel he received from me on the 14th of June by a verbal order. I received a written order from the prisoner at the bar as a true order from one Richard Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand writing was it?</p>
               <p>Manwaring. I know it to be the prisoner's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Manwaring. He owned to me it was his own hand writing, and I have many other letters to compare with it, wrote in the year 1754.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him write?</p>
               <p>Manwaring. I have, ( be produced a 10 l. bill ) I saw him write his name on this; that is, the indorsement on the back of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he write this?</p>
               <p>Manwaring. In my house.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with the prisoner on this letter?</p>
               <p>Manwaring. No farther than reading the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. In pursuance of this did you deliver these goods to him?</p>
               <p>Manwaring. I did, and he received them accordingly. I sent them according to his order to the Black Bull and Bell, in Finsbury, Moorfields, to the prisoner at the bar. I think either he or his son left a direction in writing for me to send them there to them. I think his son came with him, but I know he came on Saturday the 26th of June, the very day the parcel was delivered, and said he'd call at the Bull and Bell, and take them down in his care to Mr. Hall. About the 2d of July I was informed the goods were not carried to Suston, but delivered at another place. Then I began to stir pretty much in it. They were lodged with one Fryer, a man whom the prisoner desired me to go and enquire his character of; he lives in Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and deals in hats, stockings, and other things. I went to Justice Fielding and told him the case; he directed me to go there, and take another person with me, and see if I could find any of my goods there. I went, and took

            , who lives in Queen Street, with me; there I saw two dozen of my hats with tickets on them on his counter, and all the rest in the box but three, and one at 8 s. I bought one of Fryer for 13 s. 6 d. and carried it to justice Fielding to prove it was my property. He asked 15 s. for it. I would have sold it for 11 s. or 12 s. I told the justice I had seen the principal part of the last box of hats. He would have went with me, but it began to rain, so he sent one of his men, to desire Fryer to come to him, but Fryer disappeared immediately upon it. Then the justice desired me to go and collect all I could swear to by themselves. I went and agreed for three more hats, and when the bill of parcels was brought out, I seized them. I took hold of the young woman's hands that was selling them, and asked her how she came by them. She said a countryman and a young man brought them to their house by night. We carried all the hats to Mr. Fielding's, who had sent a servant there with me and his warrant. Mr. Fielding then ordered me to take them home, and call on Fryer to demand back my 13 s. 6 d. I left word with Mrs. Fryer for him to come to the justice, and tell where the prisoner was, that I might bring him to justice.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the next time you saw the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Manwaring. I believe it was the 18th of July, when I went to Tottenham and Suston. I saw him at the last mentioned place. I enquired for one Hall there, and found a person named Hall, that had lived there forty years. He is now in court. I ask'd him if he sold hats. He said, no. I ask'd him if he knew one Philips. He said, he did not. After that I opened the case, how I had been taken in for hats, to the value of between thirty and forty pounds. His daughter said, there is a parcel of bad fellows about a mile off, so we rode thither, and inquired for one Philips. We were told he was over the way at a little old house. I and the gentleman with me stood a little behind. The officer knock'd at the door, and the prisoner opened it; and I said to the officer, there is your man. We brought him before a justice there, and from thence to justice Fielding, who committed him to Newgate. He desired me to make it up divers times, and wanted to get away. I charged him with being a cheat. He said, he meant nothing but to pay me honestly. He said, Hall of Susion was the man that gave him an order for the goods, and he had delivered the goods to him, and that he had put his hand to a 10 l. note, and I shou'd have the money when it became due. I acquainted him I had been to inquire for Hall at Suston. He laid as had part of my goods again he would pay my expences, and I should have the remaining part of my goods again.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150030"/> He wish'd he had never known this Fryer, and likewise he owned to me, he wrote the whole of the order.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Let me see the order, I can tell whether I wrote it or not (it is put into his hand.) This is Mr. Richard Hall's hand-writing.</p>

            . I was sent by justice Fielding to Fryer, in Great Queen-Street, with Mr. Manwaring, to keep the peace, and to see if any of his hats were there, and to bring Fryer before him; but when we came there, he was denied. Some time after that, I went with Mr. Manwaring to Suston, where we inquired for one Hall, and there we found an old man of that name, who had lived there thirty or forty years. He said, there were none of that name besides himself. Then we were told, there was a very bad house a little way off, for highwaymen or smuglers. We rode to the place, and inquired for one Hall, when we were told by a gentleman the prisoner lived there, but he knew nothing of any Hall. We went to the house and took the prisoner, and when he was in Newgate I heard him confess he did carry the hats himself to Fryer.

               <p>Q. from prisoner. Have not you heard since, there was a name-sake of your's come to live at that house where I was ?</p>
               <p>Hall. I have seen a woman and children as I went by the gate; but I don't know what name she goes by.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Have not you heard she had a child died, and buried by the name of Hall, since she lived there ?</p>
               <p>Hall. She had a child died, but I know nothing of the name.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been one named Hall in your parish, just coming into trade, should you not know of it?</p>
               <p>Hall. I think I should.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Have you not heard since, there was a carpenter sitting up a counter, for a person to go into trade?</p>
               <p>Hall. No, I can't say I have. I heard there was going to be a chandler's shop, nothing of hats.</p>

               <p>Saunders. No, it came directed for one Philips; it was a long box.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Mine was a long box, directed for Richard Hall; and Philips left a written direction to be put upon it, directed to Mr. Philips.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I did not take the box from the inn. Mr. Hall himself took it, and carried it to Mr. Fryer's, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150031"/> lodge it there till he went down into Cambridgeshire, to fetch his wife and family up.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peirce. I don't know what I am called upon for; I only came here out of curiosity.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you go into that house opposite your's at Suston, and see one Richard Hall cleaning it out?</p>

               <p>Peirce. No, I live opposite to the house, and was very sorry to have such neighbours by me. As I was going by one day, I heard somebody in it; it is an old ruinated house, and has been uninhabited some time; I knew nobody of credit would come to live there. I ask'd who was there, and a man look'd out at the window. I said, what are you doing there? Said he, I am coming to live here, and am cleaning the house out. Said I, who are you? He said, my name is Hall. I asked him from whence he came, and he said, from out of Cambridge shire. I said, if you come here, I shall insist upon your bringing a certificate. I never saw that man before nor since, and I have lived there forty years. There was a woman with two children lived there, and we wanted to get rid of them. I asked the man what he intended to do there, and he said, to do any thing the people would set him about. There were two or three boards nail'd up, and a pound or two of candles hung up.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Hall. Richard Hall is my husband. When we were first married we lived at Elsley in Cambridgeshire, but we lived at Suston in Essex last.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live there?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live there 12 months ?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Half a year?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. No.</p>
               <p>Q. A month?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you a housekeeper there?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you subsist?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. We had wherewithall then to live upon. We were going into a way of trade, haberdashery and grocery; we had not begun, but had goods bespoke.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you take the house of?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. Of Mr. Gates; it was near Mr. Peirce's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your husband now?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. He went down into the country, and is not come back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether your husband bespoke a parcel of hats of Mr. Manwaring?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. He sent me word he had, or I had not come up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever in that way of life before?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. No: We had a farm of 40 l. a year at Elsley, and the prisoner lived next neighbour to us there.</p>
               <p>Q. to Peirce. Did you ever see this woman in your neighbourhood ?</p>
               <p>Peirce. I have seen her several times; I have asked for her husband, and was told he was coming week after week, but he never appear'd since.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Hall. Had you ever any hats at Suston ?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. No, they did not come, upon the account the gentleman took them out of Mr. Fryer's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not propose to travel the country with hats and stockings, with a licence?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. The prisoner's daughter was to instruct us in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can your husband write?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. He can.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to his writing?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. I can if I see it ( she is shown the order.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the name Richard Hall.</p>
               <p>E. Hall. It is very much like my husband's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath do you believe it is his writing?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the body of the order, whose hand-writing do you take it to be?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. That is not his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose do you think it is?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. It is like Mr. Philips's.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, whether the name Richard Hall is not Philips's writing?</p>
               <p>E. Hall. No, I don't think it is.</p>
               <p>[The jury compare the body and name, and believe it was all done by one hand.]</p>

               <p>Q. from prisoner to prosecutor. Did not I say the order was sent by Mr. Hall? and you said you deliver'd the goods upon my credit, you did not know Mr. Hall.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not come twice to me in Newgate, and desire I would give you general<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150032"/> releases, and you would release both me and my son.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never mention'd such a thing as making it up. There have been many neighbours served in this manner by these sort of fellows, and I was for putting a stop to such practices.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have deliver'd the goods, if the prisoner had told you the name Hall was wrote by himself?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe I should, because he came with so much seeming simplicity and innocence: I thought I could have trusted him with a hundred pounds worth of goods. The prisoner wanted to turn evidence last night.</p>

He and the deceased lived together. He said she had been working hard all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150033"/> day, and he would give her a little beer to refresh her. He accordingly order'd some beer home, and we went into their room. They were very friendly, and had play'd together in the street, as they went along. I took the beer and said, Mrs. Jones, to your good health; she after that drank to his good guard, for being a <rs id="t17560915-55-deflabel276" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

             there, I ' will either do for her, or she shall do for me; I ' will know who has the most right, if I swing at ' Tyburn for it the next day. 'The prisoner laugh'd, and said, the woman is mad sure, and bid her hold her tongue, saying, we met in friendship, what signifies making this noise and disturbance? She said she would make a noise, for he did not use her as a wife. I said, be so good as to drink, Mrs. Jones, and I will go. He again told her to hold her tongue, and her reply was, I'll expose you. She was sitting down low, either upon a basket of cloaths or in a nursing chair, her head being almost as low as the table, on which stood the quart pot of beer, when (without taking the pot in his hand ) he gave hand a sweep and struck it off the table, and it fell upon her; she stoop'd down, and the beer run from her. I saw blood run from her face; there was a wound made on the side of it. She said she would go down stairs, and have something done to it. He desired her to go to bed. She went down stairs, I followed her, and the prisoner after me; She had it dress'd with some gin, and I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her after that ?</p>
               <p>Cutts. Yes, several times. She came to our house for things to wash after that; I saw her twice afterwards much concern'd in liquor, and once at Kemington about a fortnight after that. She is since dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that was the occasion of her death ?</p>
               <p>Cutts. I can't be a judge of that, but I don't think he struck the pot with an intent to hurt her. I look'd upon his intention to be to sling down the beer, that we might go away.</p>

               <p>Hunter. The wound itself was not dangerous. I make no doubt but she might have recover'd, if it had been taken care of at the beginning. I believe she died of it, as I found no other illness on her, but what was occasion'd by that wound.</p>

             was servant to Mr. Hanson and myself, as porter and labourer, about two years, till last May. We are dry-salters in the borough of Southwark, and we deal in indico, cochineal, verdigrease, and divers other things. At the time he was first with us, no servant behaved better. I put great confidence in him. We gave him at first no more than nine pounds a year, and raised him to fourteen, besides his board; but he did not lodge with us. We found at last he rob'd us, and we tried him at last Kingston assizes for stealing two hundred pounds weight of indico, some cochineal and verdigrease, and he was convicted for the same. We lost a great deal more cochineal than what we laid in the indictment. We missed about six or seven pounds of cochineal, which had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150034"/> put into the cellar; upon which he was detected, and he owned that he had taken several large parcels of indico, and other things, since and before last Christmas. I apprehend he had been a year and half with us before he took any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other evidence against him than his own confession?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, none at all.</p>

Macarty having confessed he used to receive what he stole from me, I apprehended him on the 25th or 26th of May. The same day I had Macarty before justice Fielding. The justice ask'd the prisoner, how long he had deal in indico. He answered, I deal in indico I know nothing of it, I never did in my life. I don't know what it is. Being ask'd if he ever bought any of Macarty, he said no, never in my life. - Are you clear in that? - Yes, I am - Upon which Mr. Fielding ordered Macarty to be brought out, and bid him look at the prisoner, and ask'd him if he could charge him with having receiving stoln goods, knowing them to have been stolen. He said, he could. Then the prisoner said, I believe I did buy a trifle, it may be a shilling value. I said, as you are a publican, it does not appear to me that you have a proper notion of this indico and cochineal; if you make a free confession, perhaps the blame may lie somewhere else, if any dyer or blue maker have excited you to buy it. Upon which he said, Gentlemen, I soicit mercy, I certainly did buy goods of this man, and sold them to a blue maker, facing the Boar and Castle, in Oxford-Road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention indico ?</p>
               <p>Clark. He did. I ask'd him the man's name, and he said, he could not recollect it. Then upon my asking if he had not dealt that way with some other people, he owned he had. I asked him to what amount he might have bought of our servant. He said, about four or five pounds value, and expressed sorrow for having been concerned in such a trade; saying, I am very sorry for what I have done, and hope you'll be merciful; I said, that will be just according as it shall turn out. Macarty charged him as having inticed him to steal it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this in the prisoner's hearing?</p>
               <p>Clark. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say upon that?</p>
               <p>Clark. He confessed he had certainly bought the goods for a trifle of him, and had sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain the word trifle.</p>
               <p>Clark. At two shillings per pound.</p>
               <p>Q. What is indico worth per pound ?</p>
               <p>Clark. It is worth eight shillings. Macarty said, in his presence, he had allowed him no more than about two shillings per pound; and that he generally bought it by the lump.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did the prisoner deny any part of the accusation?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner mention the time he bought this indico?</p>

               <p>Q. Did he inform you what sort of indico it was?</p>
               <p>Clark. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did Macarty confess the stealing of?</p>
               <p>Clark. Upon the whole, he confessed to the amount of fifty pounds sterling.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any indico produced in court upon his trial?</p>
               <p>Clark. No.</p>

               <p>Seymore. There was a person came to me, and ask'd me if I dealt in indico; I said, yes. He ask'd me what I told at a time, I said, sometimes an ounce. He went away and came again, and said, his master wanted to speak with me. I went with him to the prisoner's house, the Falcon and Crown in Dean-Street. He ask'd me if I was a blue man. I said yes. Said he. I have got a little indico that will suit you. He brought it, and threw it upon the bench in the tap-room, for it was in a bag; there might be six or seven pounds of it. He ask'd me ten or eleven shillings per pound, and I bought it for seven shillings and six pence per pound. After that I bought another parcel of him at his own house, for the same price. I ask'd him then, where he had it. He said, he had it of a friend, either at Gravesend, or at Portsmouth, from on board a ship.

            : He was a soldier. He did lodge at Griffin's house about two years ago, and I lodged there at the same time. Since he left his lodgings there, he used to come there pretty often, and call for liquor. I have seen him bring parcels, but I don't know what was in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had some conversation with Mr. Clark to-day?</p>
               <p>Gorman. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, as to the account you gave him, was it true or false?</p>
               <p>Gorman. I don't remember it now. I'll tell any thing that is true.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner tell you he had got some cochineal ?</p>
               <p>Gorman. He shewed me something, and said so was cochineal; but I don't know whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Griffin to take some of it in his mouth, chew it, and spit it out, and shew you the colour of it?</p>
               <p>Gorman. Yes. It look'd grey before.</p>
               <p>Q. After it was chew'd, how did it look then?</p>
               <p>Gorman. It look'd red.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he tell you he got it?</p>
               <p>Gorman. He did not tell me where.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any body desired you not to tell this since you saw Mr. Clark?</p>
               <p>Gorman. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time Macarty came backward and forward, did you suspect the parcels were stolen?</p>
               <p>Gorman. I did not know whether they were or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect it at that time?</p>
               <p>Gorman. I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the meaning of the word suspect ?</p>
               <p>Gorman. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the meaning of the word think ?</p>
               <p>Gorman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did you think they were stolen?</p>
               <p>Gorman. I did not know what was in the bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say you did not think they were stolen?</p>
               <p>Gorman. When I saw some things I did imagine it.</p>
               <p>Q. For what reason did you imagine they were stolen ?</p>
               <p>Gorman. I can't resolve you. I don't know whether they were stolen or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not tell Mr. Clark, this morning, the reason you had to suspect they were stolen?</p>
               <p>Gorman. I said, because when the goods were brought to the prisoner's house, he hid them immediately in a private place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see blue in the tap-room ?</p>
               <p>Gorman. Yes, once I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150036"/>Q. What sort of parcels did Macarty bring home ?</p>
               <p>Gorman. They were tied up in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did such parcels used to be brought by him pretty often?</p>
               <p>Gorman. I do not know how often. I have seen them sometimes.</p>
               <p>Council. Ten times?</p>
               <p>Gorman. I don't know whether it was ten or five, or more or less.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him deliver them to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Gorman. No, never. He used to go into the kitchen with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any brought in a blue bag?</p>
               <p>Gorman. No never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring them by day or night?</p>
               <p>Gorman. He used to bring them in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever any promise from Mr. Clark, that if you'd give evidence for him, your husband should receive mercy?</p>
               <p>A. Macarty. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been married to your husband ?</p>
               <p>A. Macarty. Three years in August last.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he work the last two years ?</p>
               <p>A. Macarty. With Mess. Hanson and Clark.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he quarter'd upon the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>A. Macarty. That is about four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever gone with messages from him to the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>A. Macarty. I have carried indico from my husband to him, as my husband told me.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it pack'd up?</p>
               <p>A. Macarty. One was in a linen bag put into a basket, and the other in a leather bag. He ordered me to receive no money.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this bag (it was one of the three produced by Henderson.)</p>
               <p>A. Macarty. It was like this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it open?</p>
               <p>A. Macarty. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner on these occasions?</p>
               <p>A. Macarty. Yes, once he followed me to the door, and bid me tell my husband to spare no time, but get more indico, cochineal, and verdigrease; got them from hell and the devil if he would, he'd buy them, and as far as a hundred pounds would go he'd stand by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention indico?</p>
               <p>A. Macarty. He did, and cochineal and verdigrease, both times.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did your husband work then?</p>
               <p>A. Macarty. At Mess Hanson and Clark's.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>A. Macarty. My husband and I too told him; and he has in my hearing bid my husband spare no opportunity, but get what he could.</p>

               <p>A. Macarty. It was one Malone a milkman, who lives at the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever declare that your intention in swearing was for gain?</p>
               <p>A. Macarty. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you use to receive money of Mr. Clark?</p>
               <p>A. Macarty. No, never; except only to cross the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not some conversation with Mr. Clark, that if you would give evidence against the prisoner, he would be as favourable to your husband as possible ?</p>
               <p>A. Macarty. No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Clark. Did not you support Macarty in prison ?</p>

               <p>Q. Was a six-pence of it given to influence any kind of evidence at all, either for or against the prisoner, directly or indirectly?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>Macarty was a soldier billeted upon me about 4 or 5 years ago. His wife was my servant, and he married her from my house; they were both very poor. I was very civil to them, having lent them half a guinea or a crown at a time through good nature, and when he could get it he brought it to me again, but sometimes I have been kept out of it a good while. It was in hopes to get some of my own money which I had lent him, that I took some of these things; I did not know what they were I shew'd the goods in an open tap room, upon the table, and sold them publickly. He told me it was a perquisite that was allow'd him.</p>

            , but never had any conversation with her since she left Mr. Griffin's house, till about two months ago, when I call'd at Newgate to see Mr. Griffin. She came in, and told him in my hearing, that a woman had brought money from the prosecutor to her husband three or four times. She then pull'd a paper out of her breast, which she said was wrote by the prosecutor; it was a certificate for her liberty all the time of her husband's confinement. When I was going out she follow'd me, and said, Mr. Riley, my master must certainly come down with a sum of money; we want lawyers to plead for my husband, and a trifle will not do. She then snap'd her fingers and said, If he does not, he will have the worst of it. I went back, and told Mr. Griffin what she said, when he snap'd his fingers, and said he would not give her a farthing. She had before that pull'd a paper out of her bosom and laugh'd, and looking at Mr. Griffin said, You know, master, I cannot hurt you, for what my husband sent by me I never saw, nor did I take any money for it. Griffin took up a glass of cyder, and said, That is a sure thing, Nanny.</p>

I took her in act of charity, till she could get a place to lodge in, and dispose of some of her things. On the 19th of July in the morning I went out, having given her the keys of my things. I left her and the child at home. I came home between twelve and one; and found the door last, and was told she was gone pack and package, with boxes and things. I got a gentleman's servant to go in at the sash, who opened the door for me. I found all the things ship'd and gone; a box, chest, and trunk from one pair of stairs. Then I went up another pair, and found the drawers had been opened, and things pull'd and mangled about. I missed a pair of stays of my wife's, and an old pair of the prisoner's left in their room.</p>
               <p>Q. What other goods did you miss?</p>
               <p>Lane. A piece of stuff to make a gown, and another piece to make a waistcoat; a silk embroider'd apron, two or three tablecloths, a bible, an ironing cloth, a cloth coat, a cloth waistcoat, a velvet hood, a velvet pilgrim, a scraw hat, a linen and cotton gown, a tea chest, and other things, and a hundred guineas from out of a cupboard below stairs; I saw the money in the morning before I went out. She knew I used to put it there. She took the little boy with her that I left in the house. He is about eight years old. It was his black coat she took, and put him on an old coat and hat. I advertised her and the little boy, with two guinea reward. After which I had word brought she was at Islington, and I found her and the little boy at the constable's house there, on the 23d of July (two gowns, an embroider'd apron, a printed piece, for a waistcoat, a qu bible, a waistcoat, an ironing cloth, five tablecloths, and two pocket aprons, (produced in court, and deposed to.) This waistcoat I had given the little boy, and he had it on when I went out that day. It is her child, but I have kept it a long time, ever since it was born.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to keep it?</p>
               <p>Lane. She was pleased to say it was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been at your house?</p>
               <p>Lane. She was backwards and forwards for nine years.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife alive ?</p>
               <p>Lane. She has been dead about sixteen weeks. She died the 20th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these things were in the house that morning ?</p>
               <p>Lane. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you counted the hundred guineas?</p>
               <p>Lane. I did it about a week before.</p>
               <p>Q. If there were such an intimacy between you as you speak of, did not you tell her there were a hundred guineas in that place?</p>
               <p>Lane. No, I did not. We were at variance a great while. I had kept her so long, that I was almost tired of hers. I had done this and the other for her, that I was almost suifeiced with her.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave in the house with her and the boy?</p>
