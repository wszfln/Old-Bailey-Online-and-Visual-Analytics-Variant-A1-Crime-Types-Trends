               <p>Court. What were the rabbits worth? - The young ones I sold for eleven-pence a piece, and the old ones were worth three or four shillings, there were eleven found alive in the fields, two days after they were lost.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you apprehend they came there? - I pursued them, I mistrusted them coming, and I set up, I had seen that there had been somebody over the pales at the rabbit house door, but it was locked, and I went to bed, at about four o'clock, I heard a noise of a bell, which I fixed round the rabbit-house door, and one bell into my room, and one into my son's, I got up, and my son thinking I called him, spoke louder than common, with that I suppose they run away, I pursued them to Kensington town, I sent my son to Oxford-road, I met a butcher, and desired him to tell me if he heard of any such things.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher at Kensington, my boy told me, that the prosecutor had lost some rabbits; Harris lives about two miles from me, as I was going to town with my cart, between five and six I overtook another man first before; the prisoner and the other person had a basket on his back, and he set it down to rest, I stopped the cart, and looked at him very hard, it was in the open road, I saw some white sleek on it, and the prisoner was about two hundred yards off this man, seeing this sleek, gave me suspicion that they were the men that took the rabbits, and I went a little further on, they kept following me, and I got to Hyde Park Corner, they then were one on the one side the way, and the other on the other.</p>
               <p>Court. Had the prisoner any bag or basket, or any thing? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Was you by yourself? - No, another person was with me.</p>
               <p>What had the prisoner in his bag? - He had a basket, I got out of the cart, seeing me get out they turned back again, I said nothing to them then.</p>
               <p>How near might they be to you when they turned back again? - About thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Both turned back at the same instant? - Yes, the prisoner went into a public house with his basket, and the other after him, there was a thorough-fare in the house, and the prisoner went through that way and got off, but left his basket at the public house.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was his basket, and not his companion's? - Both the baskets was there, the other party staid, but got off after, I went and spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they were the same baskets? - I cannot say one from the other, I went in and said to the other man, Mr. Cordway how do you do, he asked me how I did, says I, what have you in this bag, says he, it does not belong to me, it belongs to the man that run out just now, I said they were rabbits, says he, I will shew you who they belong to, he made out of the door and ran away, and as he ran one of the rabbits tumbled out of his great coat pocket; I cannot say how many rabbits, I found in these baskets, there were more than a dozen, all alive, they were white and grey, and black and white, there were 17 to the best of my knowledge; I put the rabbits in the turnpike house, and sent for my horse, and went on to my business, and returned about nine o'clock.</p>

               <p>I had been as far as Mortlake, and at the corner of Brompton-row, I met this man with two baskets, he asked me to carry one of them as far as the turnpike, I said, I could not, says he, then carry it to the public house, and call for a pint of purl, I did so, I went in, and there was no fire, and I went about my business where I was going, I have witnesses to my character.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to run away from the public house? - Because I called for a pint of purl, and there was no fire.</p>
               <p>Jury. Why did you leave the rabbits behind you? - I was ordered to leave them there, and he would return after me.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you a married or single man? - A single man.</p>

            . When we were before the Justice, the prisoner was so much altered in his dress I hardly knew him, I asked what he did with the money, says he I gave him nine shillings, we went down St. Catherine's-lane, and there we got change, he said he claimed more of the share, because he helped him to sell them.</p>
               <p>Court to Skar. How many men lodgers have you? - I have four.</p>

               <p>Did the other three continue in your house? - Yes, but they are gone to sea now.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did one Jackson lodge at your house at that time? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Did Jackson return again to his lodgings after you lost the buckles? - They were acquainted together, Jackson never came back again, he went near an hour before the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Jackson pass through your room that morning? - Yes, near an hour before the prisoner, he was a sailor.</p>

               <p>This fellow that took the buckles, he owed me some money, I lent him 7 s. 6 d. to get his wages, and he was expecting to go home to Wales; I met him going over London Bridge, and he said he had no money, he had buckles he said, if I would go with him he would sell them and give me the money, he said he brought them from Ostend, but I might say they were mine, so the man sold the buckles, and I took the money to pay myself, I went to the lodgings, and he took me up on suspicion, and I told him where a pair of buckles were sold.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. The buckles sold for 16 s. 3 1/2 d. how come you to put the whole of the money in your pocket, if Jackson owed you the money?</p>

               <p>I went into Mr. Davis's shop on the 30th of April, to get some butter, about a quarter after five the prisoner came in with a bit of a broken plate under her arm, as if she came for some butter, she asked the price of a bit of bacon, and she laid the bit of bacon down and went out of the shop, and spoke to another woman, they went and stood at a door as if considering whether they should go back and buy the bacon; Mr. Davis said to me and another of his customers, watch them women, for I know them to be both thieves, I turned my back to get change for half a crown, and the ham was drawn away.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot tell which of the two took it away? - I saw Mr. Davis take it out of the prisoner's lap.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I came into the shop to buy a bit of bacon, but whether I bought it or no I cannot say, I was very much tosticated in liquor, but as for any other woman, whether I spoke to her or not, I cannot say, I have no witness, I have no friend but God and you gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Jury to the Court. My lord, is the outside of the shop window, a part of the shop?</p>
               <p>Court. The question is, whether this is a private stealing or not, and I am afraid if you think she is guilty of the offence, it is a private stealing, because nobody was present at the time, but both these people were upon the scheme of getting something out of the shop, the other woman was on the outside, and was not all the time in Davis's eye, they were both on the same scheme undoubtedly, therefore it is a doubt whether this woman took it privately or not, now the construction of this statute is this, that only one person can be guilty of the capital felony, and that is the hand which actually takes it; supposing for instance, half a dozen women of the town, or pick-pockets, were to surround you coming out of the play-house, the man only who puts his hand into your pocket is guilty of the stealing, the rest are only accomplices; therefore unless you believe she is the woman that actually took the ham, you may acquit her of the capital part of the charge, which is that of stealing privately; the other woman might take it and give it to her: with regard to that merciful distinction, which one of the jury pointed out, whether the outside of the window was part of the shop, I am afraid it would be rather too nice to say, that the window where the goods were, is not a part of the shop; in regard to the value of hams, I believe they do not put their best hams in their window, and if you find under the value of five shillings, it is not a capital offence, even though you think she was guilty of privately stealing; but the whole must be left to your consideration.</p>

               <p>How long had you been in that dozing situation you described? - I had been a little time, I felt my pocket-book going before, and I said the minute he was gone away, you have got my pocket-book, I called and told the landlord.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he run away? - No, he went out and said he had seen no such thing, and I had brought none there.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you do afterwards in consequence of that? - I went to my inn at the Bull and Mouth.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you pursue him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you take no steps to pursue him? - No, I did not, I stopped and told the landlord what had happened, and it would be an injury to me, the loss of my pocketbook, as well as my memorandums.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire of the landlord of the house who the prisoner was? - I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Did he give you any account of him? - He did not say much about him then, I gave a man half a guinea to search the bog for my pocket-book, and it was found there in the bog at Mr. Golding's house.</p>
               <p>(The pocket-book produced.)</p>
               <p>Court. Are there any marks now remaining in that pocket-book that you can swear to? - Yes and every paper in it.</p>
               <p>Was any body in the room with him and you? - Another young man, I did not perceive him touch me, I missed my pocketbook directly as he was going away, I told him he had got it, but he put it up; there was the remains of one note or two, there was the small part of a note that was drawn by an attorney, one Bradstock, upon Mr. Sheppard, in Carey-street, he refused the payment of it, there was the stamp and part of his name, and a little bit of the thirty pound note.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the pocket-book, when it was found, delivered to you? - It was delivered to me and the company, I examined it, and found many of the things there.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the Running Horse a house you frequented? - No, my Lord, I never heard of it before, but I went in because I thought I could eat some bread and cheese.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you got the notes again? - They are in the possession of Mrs. Orde.</p>
               <p>Have you seen any of the notes in the indictment since you lost them? - Many times, they were lodged in the possession of Mr. Davison, of Temple Bar, and upon his going into the country, he left them with Mrs. Ord, I was not well the next day, I sent my brother-in-law about them, who went to some of the people; on the Monday night by some means or other it got wind, and they found me in bed at the Bull and Mouth, they came up stairs, there were Mr. Griffin, to whom one of the notes was payable, a clerk belonging to Mr. Thrale, one Humpage, and another man, they came and asked me if I had been robbed, and they produced me seven notes, I looked at them, and saw the pinholes in them, and others without any indorsement, they left me a direction to go to Bow-street the next morning, which I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I beside you? - I don't say you was, you was very near me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was on the other side? - Yes, yes, but I found my pocket-book go.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say that you felt him take your book, and you immediately followed him, he went out of the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him return into the house? - No.</p>
               <p>And yet the pocket-book was found in the privy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he there the whole time, till he went away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What time was the necessary searched? - On the Tuesday after, this was on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Court. Had the prisoner at the bar, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040011"/> your knowledge been back to the Running-horse after? - I did not see him.</p>

               <p>Court. What is your way of life? - I keep a public house, I know the prisoner, he worked for Mr. Seddon in Aldersgate-street, he owed me about fifteen shillings, and desired me to take what he owed me; I said, I did not understand the note, I told him to leave it till the morning, he said, then will you keep it, I said, yes, then he said, take these others (they were wrapped in a bit of paper) and keep till I call: I asked him how he came by the rest of them, he said he had found them, and the one he said his brother had sent him; he did not come very early in the morning, and when Mr. Thrale our brewer's clerk came, I asked him if it was a good note, and he said it was, and I will give you five guineas for it; I told him how the note was left with me, and he gave me the money; he said he was going to Charing Cross, and would enquire at the bankers, he called there and got cash for it, which he told me in the evening, I said I had several more of them: I saw no more of the prisoner, till one of the men from Bow-street came about four in the afternoon of the Monday, and asked me, if I had not some notes of William Hall's, I told him I had, he asked me to let him see them, I said if he would give me any account of them I would, he said he could not, he said would I chuse to bring them to Bow-street; I went there and shewed the rest of the notes, he said here is one drawn on a gentleman in Fleet-street; by this we found out the owners: we went to Mr. Griffin, he said he knew the note, and the person was there on Saturday night for the money for the note; but he was in liquor, and he did not chuse to pay him the note, he said he was afraid the gentleman was murthered, he told us that the prosecutor lodged at the Bull and Mouth, when he was in town, and the prosecutor was in bed when we went there.</p>
               <p>Court. You positively swear that the prisoner at the bar was the person that deposited these notes in your possession? - Yes, Sir, he worked at Mr. Seddon's.</p>

               <p>I keep the Running horse in Little Queen-street, I remember the prosecutor being at my house, on Sunday the 20th of April I know the prisoner at the bar, he lodged in the house for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Was he in the same room with the prosecutor Mr. Lowe? - Yes, it was in the and Mr. Lowe came in.</p>
               <p>During how long time did they continue in the same room? - There were more people in the room, there were two men that dined with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the prosecutor seem to be in liquor? - Yes, he rather looked as if he had been drinking a good deal.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he charge the prisoner with taking his pocket-book? - He came into the bar, and said, he had lost his pocketbook, I said, I don't think you could lose it here, it must be lost somewhere else.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there was no charge made on any particular person, nor any pursuit after the prisoner at the bar? - No, the necessary was searched on the Tuesday after; the prisoner came back, and lodged in the house; the same night there was a sailor that slept with him, but he knew nothing of what had happened.</p>
               <p>Court. Had the prisoner at the bar left the room, before the prosecutor left your house? - I think he had, he came to his lodging on Sunday night, he met with some of his acquaintance of the glass grinders, he is a glass grinder, and they went away, and about eleven he went to bed, and on Monday about eleven he went out, and did not come home on Monday night; I did not see him till he stopt in a coach on Tuesday morning, with some of the Bow-street people.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I dined at this house on Sunday, off some potatoes and mutton, and this gentleman came in whilst we were at dinner, he began clauming the meat about with his fingers, and he had some potatoes with us, and he had some beer, and afterwards, when we were paying for some beer, I saw the pocket-book laying underneath the table; I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is it not probable that it might slip out of your pocket? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Why did you not alarm the house? - I called the landlord.</p>
               <p>Jury. And went about very unconcerned? - I wished my brother to seek after him.</p>
               <p>You could not know what you was about? - Yes, I am very clear as to that part of the business, as to not going after him, I was not very well the next morning, I did not seek after him, but I wished my brother in-law to seek after him, as some of them were his drawing.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ord. I never heard any thing against the prisoner before, I have known him two years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Golding. He behaved very well in our neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Jury to Lowe. Had you a handkerchief or any thing in your pocket, that you could pull the book out with? - I had lost both my handkerchiefs before.</p>

               <p>Court. Are you sure it was your own skin? - The prisoner told me he took it out the yard.</p>
               <p>Court. What is your reason for thinking it is yours? - In the manufacturing of them our men mark them, and I have reason to think these are our marks, every man has his different mark, there are about seventeen or eighteen of them in the whole.</p>
               <p>Jury. But there are other people that may mark them the same? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What could induce the prisoner to send for you to Hertford to give you this information? - He did not send for me, the gaoler sent for me, he was taken up about this skin; he had run away from me on the Sunday, and it was either Thursday, or Friday that I was sent for, and when I came there, I asked him, if this was not such a man's making, he said yes; I made him no promises; he took it to a pawnbroker's, at Bishop's Stopford, and was stopped there, then they sent to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You say it is impossible to swear to these skins? - I should think so.</p>
               <p>It is marked as your workmen generally mark them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have many thousands? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you insinuate that you would shew him favour, or any thing of that sort? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Were any threats made use of? - No, I never promised him any thing, I was very sorry to see him there I told him.</p>
               <p>Is that the same skin that was produced to you at Hertford? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did he ever carry any of these skins out for you? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. Did he say what he took the skin for? - No, we went to Stopford on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040014"/> Monday about five, we went to the Red Cow, and had three pots of beer, and some bread and cheese, and slept there all night, and on Tuesday we went and pawned the skin for 4 s. and a handkerchief, then we went to the Red Cow again, and stopped there till Wednesday morning, when we were taken up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You received three guineas from the last prosecutor, Berner, did not you? - I never received any.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Greenwood. The confession was before the justice, I submit that confession will not be received by the Court, unless it was in writing.</p>

            , to do with the prisoner, how came that to lead you to suspect the prisoner? - From the evidence of one Whitebread an accomplice, who was concerned with the prisoner. Whitebread is here, the prisoner confessed it before the justice, I was present, and my father, when he confessed it.</p>
               <p>Now let me hear what passed in your hearing at the Justice's? - It was made mention by Whitebread in what manner they got in; the prisoner owned to the taking the wheat, and conveying it away in wheel barrows, he said, he held open the sacks, while Whitebread put the meal in the sacks, and they then conveyed them away in wheel barrows.</p>
               <p>Court. He confessed taking the wheat? - I don't recollect that he said that altogether.</p>
               <p>What did he say, be careful to speak nothing but what you do recollect? - I do not mean it.</p>
               <p>What did you hear the prisoner say about this matter? - The prisoner said nothing more than this, that he owned to be concerned in taking the wheat.</p>
               <p>Was any promises made him, or any threats to induce him to confess? - None at all.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did he say he took it? - After Whitebread had given his evidence, which he heard, they were face to face.</p>

               <p>Do you know any thing more? - Only the finding the wheat, and removing it from Wells's; the Justice gave me an order to manufacture the wheat.</p>
               <p>What became of the sacks? - They are at the mill, there is G. for George and Berner at the end.</p>
               <p>When had you seen these sacks at your own mill? - The day before I missed them, they lay in the wheat shop, the sacks lay empty, and the wheat lay loose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Had you no more sacks than these that contained this wheat, how many sacks had you so marked? - A pretty many.</p>
               <p>Do you think all the sacks marked in that manner you have described, are in your possession at this time? - They are never all in my possession, they are in the hands of bakers, and people that I deal with.</p>
               <p>You said just now, that you saw these sacks the day before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, you saw these very sacks in which you found corn? - Yes, these very sacks, because there are particular rags and patches.</p>
               <p>You have no other sacks out or at home, I suppose that were mended? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What were those particular marks besides the letters? - M. G. I saw that among the rest.</p>
               <p>Did they lay one upon another? - No, they all tumbled loose, that lay among the rest.</p>
               <p>Did you give Whitebread the evidence any money? - Never.</p>

               <p>Then you do not know, except from what you heard from your master, with regard to these nine sacks? - Between the 6th and 7th they were stolen as I heard, but I do not know of my own knowledge, I was very particular in marking the sacks that I might be certain sure, there were six as I said before.</p>
               <p>About what quantity of wheat might there be at the time at your mill? - I take it there might be about sixty or seventy quarters.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you know the prisoner before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Not heard his name perhaps? - Never.</p>
               <p>Could have never spread any ill report of him? - No.</p>
               <p>You have been a preacher twenty years? - Yes, twenty-three.</p>
               <p>Before the Justice what reason did he assign? - He had a grudge against the French.</p>
               <p>Was any examination taken in writing? - I believe there was.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner asked, where was you yesterday at half past eleven? - Yes, he was asked, was you at the French chapel, he said I was, and he said yes, upon every question that was asked him.</p>
               <p>When he was asked what he did there, what did he say? - He said, he shot at the minister, because the French had injured his character; he asked why did you shoot at him, and he said, to be revenged of the French; when he was asked how he came by the pistol, he said, he bought it about a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Did he before the Justice discover any sign of insanity? - He seemed composed, and seemed to answer no more or less, than in the compass of the question with great precision.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Why did he shoot at me, as for me, I shot in my own defence.</p>

In June 1780, he was seized with a fit of insanity, which his friends imputed to a shock he had sustained from the riots; he took it in his head that the French had offended him, he appeared so much disordered that he was attended by Mr. Pearson, an Apothecary, and by him recommended to a mad-house at Hoxton, he was afterwards removed to St. Luke's, where he continued for a year, and was returned to his friends as incurable, he became very troublesome, and lodged at Mr. Fremeau's, where he became so very troublesome, he was taken before Justice Wilmot, who recommended him to quit Mr. Fremeau's house; he continued in the same state to the present time, though with some lucid intervals, so as to enable him to do some work at his loom: a paper was also found in his lodgings, written by himself, which plainly shews the state of his mind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The reason as I went to Mr. Durand's French church, was, he hurted my character, and shot at me, and prevented me getting my living.</p>

               <p>I was coming home on the 7th of May at four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner coming down stairs with a bundle, I alarmed Mrs. Elphy directly, I asked her if she had lost any thing in the garret, Mrs. Elphy kept her eye upon her, this lad followed the prisoner, I and the prosecutrix followed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040032"/> her, and we took her at the bottom of the street.</p>


               <p>Court. Is the prisoner the same person you saw coming down stairs? - I am sure she is the person that came down stairs; she dropped the things in the street, she was not out of my sight; she denied being in the house; I saw the prisoner on the two pair of stairs, as I was going up the one; Mrs. Elphy run into the fore-room to look out, and I went down stairs to follow her.</p>

               <p>I saw her come down the steps with a bundle, I was on the other side of the way, I looked at her about two or three minutes, a woman came to the door, and seemed flurried, and I asked her if she had lost any thing, she said she had, I followed the prisoner down the street, she had got about fifty yards, I lost sight of her: She went up a court with the bundle, and when I got to it, she was coming down without the bundle; It was a thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Was you sure enough when you saw her to know her again? - She was the same person who came out of the house; it was near the top of Whitecross-street, I went up the court, and found the bundle behind a door that leads out of the court; when I came back they had stopped her; I brought the bundle, I gave it to Mrs. Elphy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was before the Justice they all swore to me, by a green bonnet I had on.</p>
               <p>Court. Had she a bonnet on? - I did not take much notice of her bonnet, I took notice of her face, I don't know whether she had a green bonnet or not.</p>

After I told Mrs. Price in the street, to keep sight of her, I ran down, and she was stopped about fifty yards from my door, when I first got out of the door she was then in my sight, I never lost sight of her after; she had a child in her arms.</p>
               <p>Had she the child when you first saw her? - No, she had the bundle, and no child; I saw her turn into the court before I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>(The bundle produced and deposed to).</p>
               <p>Court. How long had the woman been out of your sight? - Two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Could you be three minutes running fifty yards? - I cannot exactly say, I run before she turned into the court, and when I got to it, she was returning; I did not see her with a child in her arms.</p>

                        targets="t17830604-30-off154 t17830604-30-crimeloc157"/>; about five minutes before three I left the house, on Sunday the 25th of May; I shut the door, and I am pretty sure I locked it; my mistress and the servants were all gone to meeting; after I had gone out of the house I went to meeting, and after I had been there half an hour or three quarters, I observed my mistress was sent for out of her pew; in a few minutes my mistress's nephew came to my pew, and told me not to be alarmed, for his aunt's house was broke open, and to go home directly. I went home immediately, and found several people round the door, and one of the witnesses was standing on the door step with a bundle of plate in his hand, and a red box; a person amongst the people gave me this wine strainer and pepper-box, and asked me if I could swear to them. I then opened the street door, and went up into my pantry immediately, it was shut and not locked, turned with the key as I thought I left it; the door is a spring lock, and shuts after us, and only opens with the key; when I came up into the pantry, I found my plate drawer pulled wide open, and all the plate taken out; the drawer next to it, which contains the table-cloths, and those things, I likewise found pulled open, and one table-cloth and a green cloth which I lay under the table-cloth, was flung upon the ground, and two pieces of candle which I had stuck in one pair of candlesticks for night was taken out and flung into my tray, and the salt that was in the two salt-sellers ready for supper was likewise flung into the tray with the candles; I then went down into the kitchen, and missed the soup-ladle, which was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>What plate did your mistress lose? - I can inform you, I have a list of them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>When did you make that memorandum? - Not till after the plate was stolen; I made it from my memory; Mr. Chetham has one, and I took this from it.</p>
               <p>Court. Read it from the original. - [Reads] Plate that was stolen out of the house on Sunday afternoon: two pair of silver salts, two pair of salt spoons, seven table spoons, twelve desert spoons, one soup spoon, two sauce spoons, one mustard spoon, four waiters, two pair of candlesticks, one small candlestick, two basons, (one was a sugar bason, the other a slop bason, both silver) two sauce boats, one cream pot, one pepper box, one lemon strainer, two bottle labels, one marrow spoon, one wine strainer, six tea spoons, one meat skewer, that was all; there were four silver cups in a red box in a cupboard in my pantry, underneath the drawer, and one breakfast cloth, and that tied up the plate in it; I am very sure that all the things were in the house when I went to church.</p>
               <p>Is your mistress here? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived in the family? - Almost five years; my master died the 23d of February last, it was Mr. Jacomb's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Mr. and Mrs. Jacomb were married before you came into the family? - Yes.</p>
               <p>ATCHESON MAXFIELD sworn.</p>
               <p>You live near Mrs. Jacomb? - Yes, opposite.</p>
               <p>Tell the Court what you perceived on Sunday afternoon. - On Sunday afternoon, the 25th of May, I was sitting in my dining-room window, directly opposite Mrs. Jacomb's great door, a few minutes after three I saw three men come up towards the door, two of them was dressed in light-coloured drab clothes, the fashionable colour,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040037"/> very smart and clean; the third was in dark colour; after they stood there a few minutes, whether the prisoner Smith or Grant went in first to the house, I cannot swear; there was one of them that appeared to me to remain behind. I observed three men, that got in by the same way that Mrs. Jacomb's servant frequently gets in, which is, as I take it, by a key, without ringing the bell; I cannot say which went in first, the third man might stand twenty yards off; I did not measure the ground after.</p>
               <p>Did they walk in as if the door had been open, or did they make any halt as if they opened the door? - I did not see that; but I did not see any woman or man that opened it; after the two prisoners had been in ten or fifteen minutes, I saw the door open, and stand on the jar for, I suppose, a few minutes; I was very attentive, and I took notice.</p>
               <p>They shut the door, and locked it after them when they first went in? - Yes; after that the door remained on the jar, as I tell you; I took notice, and was very attentive; some good-looking people came down Duck's-foot-lane, some went along Green-lettuce-lane; the prisoner Grant came out first; one of them had a tablecloth with something in it, which he seemed to carry just as a person would carry any thing out of any house; Smith had a trunk under one arm; the third man got off. I ran down Lawrence Pountney-lane, and the three men came into Thames-street together. I had not so good an opportunity of observing the third man, but I am sure as to Smith and Grant.</p>
               <p>Court. Were these the same men you saw before? - There was no one in Duck's-foot lane but our three selves.</p>
               <p>As to the two prisoners, you have sworn that they were the same two men that went into the house? - Yes; as they went down Thames-street I was close to Mr. Smith; they were very well dressed; they crossed over, and went into a place called Coal-harbour; when Grant and Smith had got under this gate-way, the man in the reddish coat kept in Thames-street. I clapped Grant on the shoulder, and insisted on knowing what he had; on which Smith, without any answer or ill language, jumped from me, and he and Grant went down the lane; they ran very fast, and I ran as fast as them; when they had got a quarter down the lane, Smith let fall the trunk, which I picked up, and still continued to pursue them; the handle went away, and the trunk fell from me; I still continued to cry out; they turned to the right by Mr. Calvert's brew-house, towards Allhallows-lane; when I got to the bottom, I asked if they saw these people go by; they said, yes; they had so much the appearance of gentlemen, that we did not stop them.</p>
               <p>And there you lost them? - Going up Allhallows-lane, there was a lusty good-looking man; says he, I believe I have got what you are looking for; he had got the table-cloth, I do not know the man's name; I am very bad at remembering names, but my eye-sight is pretty good; I believe he was coming across. As we were walking, a brewer's man called after after us; says he, here is something that belongs to you; I turned about, and saw the man had a silver pepper-box, and a silver strainer; he gave them to me, and I gave them to the man that had the plate in the table-cloth, and we went into Thames-street to Mrs. Jacomb's door, and then left him there, and beckoned to the person to come and take charge of the plate; I went to the meeting-house at Salter's-hall, to tell the man who opens the door I wanted Mrs. Jacomb; he brought, I believe, Mrs. Jacomb's nephew to me; I told him, a little accident had happened, and I begged some person might come and take charge of the plate. Several gentlemen came up, some produced picklock keys, others other picklock keys, others some silver salts, or something of that kind. I begged they would go to the Poultry Compter with me, where they might see the men.</p>
               <p>Can you say they were the men that had been stopped? - Yes; I then went to the Poultry Compter; the turnkey told me the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040038"/> prisoners were in a room, and he would fetch them, which he did; the two prisoners came out dressed just as I had seen them before.</p>
               <p>Did you know them directly? - Oh, Lord, aye, knew them directly! they were very remarkable!</p>
               <p>In the same dress? - Yes; I went to Alderman Hart's, Smith was in the same dress that he was before, but Grant had got on a very different coat, but his face was the same; I thought his having a different coat on was rather extraordinary, because I told the keeper not to let them change their cloaths.</p>
               <p>I only ask you one general question, Are you sure, upon your observation on the sight of the men, that these two are the two men? - I can safely swear they are the two men that came out with the plate and things, but I did not see them go in.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they are the two men that came out; - Yes, they were at the Poultry Compter, Alderman Hart was very a ngry with the keeper of the Poultry Compter, for suffering them to take off their cloaths.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You say on the Sunday afternoon, about three, you was sitting at your window, which is opposite? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before the man came up you was not talking to any body? - No.</p>
               <p>You saw them enter without any pause or interruption? - They might stay a minute.</p>
               <p>You saw nothing like taking any thing out of their pockets? - He went close up to the door as the servant used to do.</p>
               <p>You saw no more? - No.</p>
               <p>They were out of your sight a considerable time? - From ten to fifteen minutes.</p>
               <p>Had you given the alarm of stop thief before they were out of your sight? - Yes, they were not so far from me as I am from you, when I cried out stop thief.</p>
               <p>They went down Ducks-foot-lane, they were out of sight then? - I did not know they were thieves till I put my hand on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>I only ask you a plain question, I do not mean to argue with you, you walked quietly down? - No, I run very fast down that lane.</p>
               <p>You met two men first? - They were in another lane.</p>
               <p>You spoke to Smith at the bottom of Alhallows-lane, one would have thought you must have been in some little doubt at that time, as you know every man is supposed to be innocent till he is found out? - I saw them all down the lane, which is a very long lane; after I lost sight of them, I saw them no more till I saw them in the compter.</p>
               <p>You then enquired of the keeper where the two men were that were in custody, they were brought out as the two men that were supposed to be the persons? - I cannot say whether there was any other fettered in the yard, there was a great many men in the yard that were not handcuffed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Grant. My Lord, I should be glad if Mr. Maxfield would answer why he did not swear to us before Alderman Hart? I swore before the Alderman, at least I said before the Alderman that I could not swear they were the men that went into the house, but I did not tell the Alderman that they were not the very men that came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it was put to you whether you would positively swear that they were the men that went into the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the Alderman then that they were the men that came out of the house? - I did.</p>

             a dry-salter in Cornhill, I was at Coal-harbour-stairs on Sunday afternoon May the 25th, I heard the cry of stop thief, upon looking up Coal-harbour, I saw these two prisoners and Mr. Maxfield following them, crying out stop thief, Mr. Maxfield was stooping at the time to pick up that trunk, one of them had just dropped it, the other had a bundle, I cannot say which, I saw the trunk dropping to the ground, they turned towards Alhallows-lane, I followed them, and came very near<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040039"/> up with the prisoner Grant, about the middle of Alhallows-lane, when he dropped these keys on the steps of a door, I saw him drop them; upon which one Mr. Bennet a blacksmith stood just by, and knowing them to be picklock keys, he followed me giving me his child, I gave it his wife who was close behind me; I picked up the keys and followed them, I lost sight of them at the top of Alhallows-lane, and gained sight of them again in Hand-court.</p>
               <p>Court. How long might they be out of your sight? - About the space of a minute, or not quite so much, they were about ten yards from me when I saw them again, they were the same men that I saw again in Hand-court, I am sure of it, they kept pretty close together; Hand-court leads into Chequer-yard, and Mr. Bennet laid hold of the prisoner Smith, while they turned out of Chequer-yard into Dowgate-hill, I lost sight of them again, I do not suppose it was half a minute or a quarter of a minute, Mr. Bennet had hold of the prisoner Smith, when I saw them again, he had got before me in the pursuit; Grant went a little higher, and I saw Mr. Maidment had hold of his collar, I did not see him stopped, I saw Bennet have hold of Smith, and Maidment hold of Grant.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. How far was Mr. Maxfield from you when you was alarmed? - About thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Were there any other people in the lane who were put into pursuit upon this alarm? - There were several, it is a common thoroughfare, and generally frequented by a great number of people, any person who had been passing that way might have joined in the pursuit, one of the prisoners dropped the bundle, and a young man, I cannot tell who it was, picked it up, and gave it to Hinton.</p>
               <p>Court to Henshaw. Whereabout did you see the bundle dropped? - I did not see it dropped.</p>
               <p>Did the trunk drop from Grant? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>You pursued a considerable distance, did not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Many other people joined in the cry? - Yes Sir, there were four or five round the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. This Coal-harbour is not a very great thoroughfare of a Sunday? - There is a great many people go to the stairs being pleasant.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you saw one of them drop the trunk which Mr. Maxfield picked up, and the other had a white bundle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never lost sight of them I think you said till they turned out of Alhallows-lane, and you got sight of them again in Hand-court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What became of the white bundle? - I have heard it was dropped at the bottom of Alhallows-lane, it was gone when I came up with Grant in Alhallows-lane, before I picked up the keys, and they were in the middle of Alhallows-lane.</p>
               <p>Then they never had been out of your sight at that time? - No, they had not.</p>

               <p>On Sunday the 25th of May, between three and four in the afternoon, I was walking up Thames-street, and just by the end of Coal-harbour-lane, I heard the cry of Stop thief; I turned about, and saw Mr. Maxfield holding his stick up for assistance; I ran back to the top of Coal-harbour-lane, and then Mr. Maxfield was down past the gateway with a box in his hand, and I saw the two prisoners at the bar running; I turned to the top of Alhallows-lane, and I thought it was impossible to overtake them the other way; I staid, and saw them run and turn the corner of Waterman's-hall; they came up the lane close together, and passed me; I was sure by their dress they were the same same men; they were dressed in light-coloured cloaths, like mine.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive either of them have any thing in their hands? - Nothing, but I head a great jingling in their pockets.</p>
               <p>Which way did they run? - From the top of Allhallow's-lane straight up into Chequer-yard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040040"/> through Hand-court, and down the gate-way; Smith have a butter-boat and a small taper candlestick out of his pocket; I picked them up; while I was picking them up, Bennet seized Smith, who was behind; I did not see him, but it was just then I held up the plate; as they were running, I halloo'd out, for God's sake stop thief, here is some of the plate; the people would not stop them; the other two proceeded on a little way, about 20 or 30 yards; I saw him stopped, and brought back immediately.</p>

               <p>On the 25th of May my wife and child and me were walking out after dinner; I was going down Allhallows-lane, and there was a cry of Stop thief, stop thief, do not stop one, but stop them both; that was the cry that I heard at the bottom of the lane. I immediately says, these two gentlemen cannot be them who are coming up, they were the prisoners at the bar; they were just upon the trot when they came to me, they rather walked by me; immediately as Grant walked by me he threw a bunch of picklock keys down; I am sure Grant is the man that threw them down; I immediately gave the child away to a young man that is in Court, that picked up the keys, and ran after them to Dowgate-hill to the gateway; as I got into the gateway Smith threw down a silver butter-boat and candlestick; I saw him do that, and laid hold of him immediately; I never lost sight of either of them, I ran as fast as possible, I took Smith under the gateway; the last witness picked up the boat and candlestick. In about ten minutes after, I heard Grant was stopped. I was going along with him after the other was taken, and a constable came behind, and laid hold of his coat, which pulled him very hard, and the prisoner said, do not pull me so hard, I can go with the man that took me.</p>

I saw the prisoner, Grant pass by me with a white bundle, I am sure that is the man; he had the bundle under his right arm. I observed it, and ran after him directly. There was another man along with him, but I did not see his face; I cannot say any thing to him. There was a gentleman following them with a trunk in his hand, that cried out, Stop thief; I followed them till they were taken, but I was out of their sight twice; I first lost sight of them turning the corner from the brew-house into Alhallow's-lane; I did not lose sight of them for more than a minute; when I saw them again, I knew them to be the same men; one of them I can say to, that is Grant, but the other I cannot; they had lost their bundle, I was a distance from it; the bundle I passed by, and my master picked it up.

               <p>Prisoner Grant. When this lad was before the Alderman, he would not take upon himself to swear to either of us; he said, he could not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you swear before the Alderman? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court to Grant. Shall I ask the Alderman that question, he is here? - If you please, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderman HART sworn.</p>
               <p>Did this young man swear to the person of Grant? - When he was before me, I asked him particularly to look at the men, and he swore to him, and said, that is the man. I questioned Mr. Maxfield very particularly whether he was quite clear that these were the men that went into the house; he said, he could not tell: I said, are you sure they are the men that came out of the house? he said, he believed they were, but he would not take upon him to say; their dress was both alike, and they were pursued; and he said, he thought they must be the men, but he would not take upon himself to swear to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. There was a very singular thing happened about this lad; the lad would not take upon himself to swear, and I told you at the same time that you did not give us fair play; you said, very well. - The boy swore positively at once.</p>

            ? - Yes; I was standing down at the Coal-harbour wharf, smoaking my pipe, my face towards the Thames; I heard a cry of Stop thief, and there were two men, one of them with a bundle, which I cannot swear to; one of them had his back to me, running to Calvert's brew-house; I sent the boy after them, I said I could not run so fast; and a young man that picked up a bundle, he gave it me, There, Sir, says he, here is a bundle one of them has dropped; I did not see the bundle dropped; it contained silver spoons, and four waiters, it was tied up in a handkerchief, and then in a white table-cloth, then there was a speckled handkerchief thrown over it; I heard the man's name was one Allardson, who lives in Tower-street.</p>

               <p>I live on Dowgate-hill. On Sunday the 25th of last month, about half after three in the afternoon, as I was sitting at my father's, I heard the cry of stop thief at a distance, I made the best of my way down stairs, when I came into the street, I observed the prisoner Smith, in custody of Mr. Bennet, and some plate in his hand; I believe salt cellars; the prisoner Grant was then on the other side of the way running away; Mr. Bennet who had hold of Smith called to me, for God's sake to pursue Grant, I did so, and at the corner of Cloak-lane, I came up with him, and took him by the collar, I never lost sight of him from the time I first saw him till I took him; upon my taking him, he dropped these keys; I tried this key, which opened Mrs. Jacomb's-house with the greatest ease afterwards; I have had them in my possession ever since, I sealed up the others, and kept that separate.</p>
               <p>- ALLARDSON sworn.</p>
               <p>Did you see either of the prisoners drop a bundle in Alhallows-lane? - I believe the left hand man dropped a bundle, but I cannot say, I believe he was one of the men that dropped a bundle, I gave the bundle to a lusty man, he appeared to me a publican, I gave it to him, and I turned back; I was going over the water.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe the two men that were running before the rest? - I did, they were two smart fellows, I thought they were joking, they got up to me, I ran after them the distance from Coal-harbour-lane to Alhallow's-lane; I believe Grant to be one.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Grant's Defence. Yesterday was a fortnight, I had been in the city in the afternoon to meet my sister, I was standing at the bottom of Alhallows-lane, and all of a sudden there was a cry of stop thief; I went up along with them, and they ran across Thames-street, towards Dowgate-hill, and at the bottom of the gateway across Dowgate-hill, I picked up these keys.</p>
               <p>The Keeper of the Poultry Compter sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you belong to the Poultry Compter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you there when the prisoners were brought into custody? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did Grant go up the next day in the same cloaths he was brought in? - They were both in light drab cloaths, I took as much care of them as I could, we have two turnkeys, one to attend each day, but one was ill, any body might put a coat through the door; and about an hour after they were examined, Grant had changed his coat, I told him, I would rather have given him a guinea than he should have changed his coat, I told him he was a rascal and a villain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Grant. I changed the coat because it was too good to wear in gaol.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith's Defence. I was coming up Alhallows-lane, and heard the cry of stop thief, I saw several persons running, and I saw a tall man throw away some plate, I picked it up, my foot slipped, and the butter boat-fell out of my hand, I delivered the property up directly.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040044"/>Prisoner's Council. I beg leave to submit to your Lordship, whether you think this case is properly substantiated against the prisoners at the bar; I conceive the best evidence is not brought forward, for there cannot be the best proof without Mrs. Jacomb's coming here herself, and therefore it is fair for me to say, that these men went into the house by Mrs. Jacomb's consent, and that the goods were not taken away feloniously, for there cannot be a proof of felony, and of the goods stolen, being the property of Mrs. Jacomb, without her standing forward: I submit there cannot possibly be a proof under this indictment, without Mrs. Jacomb herself standing forward and saying, that these things were her property, and that they were taken away without her consent; and consequently taken away feloniously: It does not prove what is necessary to prove in the present instance, and I think, unless Mrs. Jacomb had been here, that you have not the best evidence that the nature of the case will admit of; and I submit, that if the best evidence is required in support of a common action, surely the best evidence is required upon a case of such importance as the present.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any authority to shew that a person cannot be convicted for stealing goods, without the owner being present; I am clearly of opinion, that there is nothing at all in the objection, so clearly that it is not necessary for me to give you any reasons for that opinion. If you please I will leave it to the Jury, whether Mrs. Jacomb gave the prisoners consent to go into her house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. All presumptions are in favour of the parties accused.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not a necessary presumption of law, but the reverse; if you force me to give my opinion, I think the reverse; but if you think it to be left to the Jury, I have no objection.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>Court to witness. Do you know him? - Nothing about him, only I came to speak in his behalf, as I read in the news-papers, that he was to be on the trial to day; that gentleman, that man in green, I do not know his name.</p>

               <p>Court. Be careful what you say, and if you have any sense, just attend to my question, you say, you heard from the papers he was to be tried? - Yes, there is the thing, I was told in company that these gentlemen were to be tried day.</p>
               <p>A man in a green coat? - I know he had a green coat when I saw him pick up what was lost, I heard that they were to be tried to day.</p>
               <p>That who were to be tried to day? - I was at the gate, I sell mackarel; and all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040045"/> those things in fish season; I happened to be there, and seeing the mob run, I saw a man hurl some things down, and they were picked up in the lane, I came to speak in the gentleman's behalf, I came just upon a walk, I came here by accident, I was asked to come in to speak the truth by two or three of his friends, what I saw.</p>

               <p>How did you know that there was any trial to day? - I was walking past to day, and I heard by accident, there was to be a trial here about a robbery done in Thames-street, I heard there were two to be tried for it, I did not ask their names, I only came to speak what I saw, I have not been in the Court above a quarter of an hour, my name is

               <p>Court. Who was that man in the green coat? - About the size of that gentleman, I do think that is the man, I do think it is the same man, I believe he had the same coat on to the best of my knowledge; I do not know, but I think that is the coat he had on, to the best of my knowledge; I never saw him before.</p>

               <p>Court. Mind, let me warn you a little? - I need no warning.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not know that, let me warn you that if you are detected in swearing falsly, I shall not suffer you to go out of Court, but shall certainly commit you to take your trial? - I am obliged to your Lordship for your caution, but I do not need it.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A letter case maker, I live at No. 12, in Cock-lane, I rent a room there, I have lodged there about eight weeks, I believe.</p>
               <p>Who is your landlord? - His name is Evans, I do not know his christian name, I follow my business there, there are my tools and materials.</p>
               <p>You talked of recollecting a circumstance that occured on Sunday the 25th of May? - I recollect walking down Dowgate-hill, I met some people more or less, and going down the gateway, I recollect a person was stooping and picking up something.</p>
               <p>Who was that somebody? - What brought me was to see whether it is either of the prisoners at the bar, on account of an advertisement that I read in a newspaper, that I have in my pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040046"/>Court. Let me see the advertisement? - Nothing but humanity led me here, I shall tell nothing but what I know; I came here in consequence of this advertisement unknown to the prisoner intirely, I declare to God; I thought I could recollect the man again, he was dressed in a light coloured coat, it was under the gateway, he picked them up somewhere near upon the turn; I did not see any body taken afterwards; I went forwards about my business; there were some people coming seemingly in a hurry through the gateway.</p>
               <p>You had no curiosity to enquire what was the matter? - I asked what was the matter, they said, some thieves, and I went away directly, I think the man in black is the man.</p>
               <p>Had he the same cloaths on? - No, no, he had light cloaths on then, I took notice of his face, seeing him stop attracted my eye; I never saw him since till now, nor never before then.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Did not you send to him, to let him know that you would be a witness? - No, nor he to me, I made all the enquiry when the trial would come on, I thought it was time enough then; I thought the best way would be to come into Court; I waited on Saturday till they said, the London Jury was gone off, then I went away; and yesterday I never called on him.</p>
               <p>HYAM MOSES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a fishman, I live the corner of Gravel-lane, the first house, No. 5, I rent a lower room, my landlord's name is Soper.</p>

               <p>Court. Have not you been here before? - Not as I know of, I have been here, Sir, about four or five years ago; I might be here since but I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to say that you have not? - I have been here before, but not before you that I know of, I have been here about two or three years ago.</p>
               <p>What trial was you witness upon? - I do not know, I have forgot the trial.</p>
               <p>How often have you been here? - Never but once.</p>
               <p>And yet you have forgot what that once was about? - I have forgot who it was for.</p>
               <p>What do you know about this matter? - I know nothing at all about it, I know nothing of the prisoner; only last Sunday fortnight coming from Billingsgate, I saw a great number of people crying out, Stop thief!</p>

               <p>Court. What sort of bags were they? - Paper bags.</p>
               <p>What do you know them by? - Some of them were a particular sort, cut for the purpose; I am sure as to the paper.</p>
               <p>Court. These sugar bags were made of the same paper with yours? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. The prisoner I believe has been in your service a long time? - Eleven years and upwards.</p>
               <p>During which time I believe he behaved himself well in your service? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So well I believe that you gave him something additional for his assiduity and good behaviour? - I did.</p>
               <p>You cannot speak of his character before he lived with you? - I had a very high character of him, from Mr. Mables, in Smithfield, I thought him a very honest man till now, I always thought him such, I was too partial.</p>
               <p>The tea you cannot identify, that is impossible, the sugar bags are common sugar bags, such as other grocers have, it is not peculiar paper that nobody could have but you? - I do not know that; the person that made these bags has made them a number of years, the paper the bags were made of, is not usually made into sugar bags.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it a kind of paper that nobody else could have but you? - I bought the whole that was made by the maker at that time, I am positive to the paper.</p>
               <p>Court. What was there particular in this paper, you do rot mean to say that this was made by any particular direction of yours, therefore the same man that made this paper, made other paper of the same kind, this paper was not made on purpose for you? - No, but I happened to apply it for a different purpose to which it was usually applied.</p>

               <p>I went to Mr. Carr's to search this man's room and boxes, I waited some little time before the man came in, and I said, William, your master informs me that there is a suspicion that you have behaved dishonestly, he said, he was very sorry, he did not know that he did any such thing; now says I, you have an opportunity of convincing your master, if you will do what I desire you to do; there is a suspicion that some things are secreted in your boxes, will you immediately deliver up the keys, the man took out the keys with some little reluctance, and gave them to his master, we went into the room; we were obliged to cross the kitchen, and Mr. Carr went with a candle before us, in order to go up stairs; the prisoner turned short about, and seemed disposed to make down stairs, and out of a back door, I put my hand on his breast, and said follow your master, he did so; then his master opened one or two boxes, and found nothing but a little quantity of sugar candy, and in the last box there did appear a considerable quantity of tea and sugar, done up in pounds, and a pair of scales, and some weights, the man seemed much agitated, I ordered a constable and a couple of watchmen to attend below, when he came down and found a constable had been in the parlour; he said, he hoped his master would not be cruel to him, his master, who appeared at that time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040049"/> exceedingly affected himself; returned into the parlour, I told him as the matter appeared so very clear, to leave him to me, and I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Court. What did he say, respecting these things that were found in his box? - I think he said, he had bought them of somebody, I remember now he said, of an acquaintance, I believe I did ask him his name, but he did not tell me, he fell down on his knees twice, and begged that his master would not be cruel to him.</p>
               <p>(The things produced, and Mr. Carr ordered by the Court, to look out such things as he could swear to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Carr. About this time did you miss any quantity of tea? - I could not miss such a quantity as that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. This prisoner was frequently sent by you to the bank, and you always found him very exact? - I have frequently trusted him with a great deal of money at a time, and never found him a penny wrong.</p>

               <p>When was that? - Between eleven and twelve of that day, the landlord told a young fellow to go up stairs to bring down his things; that was after this young man came home to the house from the country.</p>

               <p>Court. Was you sober? - I was midling; I counted my money when I paid for the gin, and I had just sixteen shillings, I am certain I put it in my pocket; I did not feel her get her hand into my pocket, I had no intercourse with her; they did not search her, because she was an old offender, and would not have any thing to do with her.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you the book here that he signed? - I have, (The book handed up) that in the second column is what I saw him write; on referring to this original prize list, and seeing the hand writing so different, I declined paying him, I told him, as his captain was in town, notwithstanding some little difference, that I dare say on application to him, he would give a note to ascertain that he was the same person; he and the young gentleman that was with him, after using some arguments to prove that people write differently and spelt their names differently at times, left me.</p>


               <p>Did you know the person of the prisoner before? - Never saw him except those two days, I saw him after, the beginning of April, this was in February, and on the day on which he made the demand at Mr. Canning's; I do recollect seeing him and the captain that was with him passing thro' Clement's-lane, I am quite sure he is the man; I have not the smallest doubt; he probably might have set a quarter or from that to half an hour in the pay room the first day; I was induced, seeing him decently dressed, to ask him his commands; I knew him again the second day.</p>

               <p>On the 24th of April last, the prisoner came in under pretence of buying some ribbon I was in the shop; I am in the Coventry ribbon line, I go round to take orders; while I was there Mrs. Moore was giving me the orders, and when I had taken my orders for the ribbon, I looked at the two women and something causing a suspicion within me, I stood and watched them; Mrs. Moore then went to the drawer to serve them with the ribbon, one of them cheapened a remnant; and the other woman drew Mrs. Moore's attention to look at a ribbon in her cap, telling her to look at it, and the prisoner took the opportunity of taking a piece of ribbon out of the drawer; I saw a piece slipped out of the drawer, in the hollow of her hand, and immediately she put it into her pocket under her apron; Mrs. Moore, and the two women were still talking about the ribbon, and could not agree for it, and they were going out of the shop; I then took hold of the prisoner by the two hands, and said you have got some ribbon, which you never intend to pay for; I would not let her go, they sent for a constable, I desired Mrs. Moore to search her; she threw herself on her back, and endeavoured to kick some thing from her, but Mrs. Moore searched her, and found three pieces of ribbon, all marked with Mrs. Moore's mark.</p>
               <p>(The ribbon deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Were they in the drawer at the time you shewed them to the prisoner? - The lad was the first that shewed them to her, I am very confident that she took the two first from him, and one from me; when she was found out, she offered to give me three guineas to let her go, I said, I would not for three times three.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you any criminal conversation with her? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What did you suffer her to attend you all the way? - I could not get her away, she would follow me.</p>
               <p>Court. Could not you have resisted and prevented it if you had thought proper? - I could not get the money out of her hand: This was about three in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you so long with this woman, and yet have no criminal conversation? - I know nothing more then I tell you.</p>
               <p>But you was in liquor? - No.</p>
               <p>What could you have been doing for four or five hours? - That is all that I know about it.</p>
               <p>You had more than one pint? - We had two pints at the first house, and one more at the other.</p>
               <p>Was you in a private room with her at Oxford-market? - No, in a public room.</p>
               <p>Was any other company there? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you make no resistance? - All that laid in my power, but I could not get the money, I called the watchman, and he came to my assistance, he took her up and shook her, and one guinea dropped out of her bosom, and another guinea was found in her pocket, and my handkerchief; the rest and the bag was never found; a woman came on her side.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is there any truth in all this? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ever give her this purse of yours? - I told her I was going to Smithfield, I never took my purse out, I was as sober as I am this minute.</p>

               <p>I had been at a brewer's, between two and three, for grains, I live with Mr. Rhodes, in Gray's Inn-lane, I lost 3 s. and a purse, I got the purse again; I found the prisoner's hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>How came she to be so near you? - She was walking along by my side, she followed me up Red Lyon-street, and asked me where I was going; she said, shall I go with you, I said I do not care where you go, she walked, alongside of me, and I found her hand in my breeches pocket, she pulled her hand out, and shoved it into her pocket, I took hold of her hand and said, what is that you have put in your pocket, I opened her hand, and there was the purse, she gave me the purse, but not the money.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you swear that your money was in the purse at the time she took it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had she been with you; had you no consideration for this, had you nothing to do with this woman? - No, nothing at all any more than as she was walking along the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask him whether he did not send for me to make it up with him, if I would give him six shillings; I have witnesses in Court.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. A woman that said she was her sister came to me, and I told her I could not make it up without going before the Justice where I had been before, I charged the watch with her then, and she was committed.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you know this was the skin of one of the sheep you had? - I had nine more left of the same mark, I am sure it was one of that ten; the contents of the entrails was the small guts, and the liver without the heart, and the melt, they were the only things that were missing of the entrails, the head was with the skin not skinned, after I had taken them out of the pond, I went and found the place where it had been killed, it had been killed in the other field where I found them, and there lay the melt, this was on the Saturday, on Sunday a man came and asked me if I had lost a sheep, he said we have taken a man with a sack full of mutton, he brought the meat to me and I compared the neck with the head which was wrung off and not cut off, it was twisted off.</p>
               <p>Court. Is not it a difficult thing to twist off the neck of a sheep? - It is often done in the butchering way, if they have a mind to make it a short neck, I compared the mutton with the head.</p>

               <p>How came you to cord the box? - To keep it fast.</p>
               <p>What had you opened it for? - To take out a pair of stockings, I saw all the things safe then, I suspected the prisoner by his not returning any more to his lodgings, I searched after him, and found him on the 5th of May, I took him myself, I found some of the things on him when he was taken, one neckcloth and a knife, and a duplicate where he had pawned a pair of stockings and a neckcloth.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself when he was taken up, and these things were found upon him? - I took him in Holborn, he said he did not know me, I told him he had robbed me, with that he struck at me and ran off, I followed him and took hold of him again.</p>
               <p>What did he say when you took him the second time? - He struck at me again and walked along, and would not be taken by me, I walked along with him, he went into a public house and I called for a pint of beer, he ran out again, then he threw me down in the street, I got up and ran after him, the mob gathered, and I told them he had robbed me, I took him to Justice Hyde's, when we were almost there, he said he would go down to Hammersmith, he went into the necessary, and we found he had thrown a bag down there.</p>
               <p>How came you to look for the bag? - The Justice asked me if ever he had been out of my sight when I took him, I said never, but when he was in the necessary.</p>
               <p>What was in the bag? - A bible with my brother's name in it, that was the bible which I lost, I never found any of the other things, he never told where they were, nor made any confession; I went with the duplicate and found the neckcloth and stockings at one Mr. Davison's in Bishopsgate-street.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Boddington parish.</p>
               <p>Court. How did you come by this mare? I bought her of the prisoner at the bar, at the Swan at Boxmoor, within about two miles of Boddington, I am sure it was the prisoner that sold her to me, I bought her the 9th of May in the morning, I gave 4 l. for her, I did not know the prisoner, I was going by, and the landlord at the Swan called to me, and said, there was a mare to be sold, I asked the price, he asked six guineas, I bid him 4 l. but I said, I had not the money in my pocket, I should return in three hours, and I returned, I said, I am afraid my man you did not come-honestly by the mare, and I took him to Justice Bingham, at Waterend, and he examined him, and said, I might pay for the mare before him very safe.</p>
               <p>Court. So you did it under the authority of the Justice, are you sure the prisoner is the person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. When the prisoner was before the Justice what did he say? - He said, he was a farmer's son, and his father was likely to be seized, and he had it to make a little money on.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the Justice satisfied with that? - He said, his father lived somewhere about Bayswater.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the true value of the mare? - I have bought and sold many a mare as good to look at for 4 l. I thought it was worth no more.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. What was the worth of her when you lost her? - I believe she might be worth 10 l. when she was stole from me, but she had been at work, I did not think she might look so well by some pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. According to your own account of her there was some defect.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I went do wn to swear to the mare, the Justice would not deliver her on my oath, I thought it was very odd that he would not let me swear to my own property.</p>
               <p>Grover. I wish he had let you have her, I should not have had so long to have kept her.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I did not steal her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it possible that the mare could get out of your premises? - Impossible, she was found with a pannel that belonged to me.</p>

               <p>Are you sure the skin that was found at Lyon's house, was the skin of the sheep that you found on your father's ground? - I verily believe it was, I will swear to the mark of the ruddle, there is not any body round that part that marks them so, all butchers have private marks, and we always mark them different, I found there was a sheep gone that was marked in that manner.</p>
               <p>Was that mark sufficient to enable you to speak with certainty to the skin? - I verily believe that was the skin.</p>
               <p>Court. When you say, you can swear to the certainty of the mark, do you verily believe it was one of the sheep? - Yes, the prisoner was committed the day before I searched his house.</p>

               <p>Did you see he had a sheep in a string? - Yes, but we did not see it at first, for he was among the bushes, he drove the sheep into his own house, I was close by him.</p>

               <p>Court. What part of your shop were they in? - They were upon the counter, one pair new and one pair second hand, they were both my own on sale, they were taken down for the prisoner to look at in my public shop; I asked him what he wanted, he said, to buy a pair of silver buckles, but he was not in a hurry, I shewed him the two heaviest pair in my shop, when I laid them on the counter he said, have you knees that will follow them, I said, I had, when I brought him the knees, he desired me to weigh them, while I turned my back to weigh the knees, he run away with the two pair of shoe buckles.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not see him take them? - No, my Lord, my back was to him, I missed him in less than half a minute, and jumped over my counter and run after him, and called Stop thief! and I believe he did the same, when I came to my door, I saw him about fifty yards up the street, and nobody was in the street, he ran into Hermitage-street, and while he turned the corner, I lost sight of him, which was not above a quarter of a minute, a man stopped him upon my calling out, Stop thief! I was in sight when he stopped him, and he held him till I came up, he was about thirty yards off me, when the man stopped him.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you a candle in the shop? - Five or six, when I came up to the prisoner he said, Sir, I have dropped your buckles, and one of the men that stopped him, laid hold of his right hand, I said to the prisoner, never mind you shall come along with me, we carried him to the watch-house, he was searched in my house, I felt my buckles on the out-side of his left breeches pocket, the buckles were taken out of his pocket in my sight, I am positive to them being mine.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there a private mark on that buckle? - Yes, on one there is, there is my private shop mark on one and a crack on the other, you will find 48 just at the corner, they were so marked when he took them away, we always mark them and make an entry in our book, and the names of the persons we buy them of, the other buckle had a crack in it, which has prevented me from selling them, he desired me to let him go as I had got my buckles again; you rascal, says I, I have suffered too much by such dogs; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him take them? - No, my Lord, there was nobody else in the shop.</p>

               <p>Court. Was the petticoat you saw under her arm, upon the counter before? - Yes, with several others (the coat produced) she gave me direction to No. 8, Bow-street, but she said at the Justice's, she lived at No. 17.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you any private mark on that coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know that to be your master's property? - I do.</p>
               <p>Court. Was she close to the counter at this time? - No, the space of a yard and a half off.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were they folded up? - Yes, they were folded up, she seemed confused; I saw the foldings through the arm hole of her cloak, she saw that I saw it, and she dropped it on the ground, and took it up, and laid it on the counter, and said, she was not culpable.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did she say she was not culpable, before you charged her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she ever look at that petticoat before? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe her take the petticoat up? - I came round the counter to shut the door, she was a good many minutes looking for her money, but she had but two-pence or three-pence.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you did not observe her take it and put it under her arm? - No, I did not see it till I saw it under the armhole of her cloak.</p>
               <p>Court. Then if she had left the five shillings, she would have gone off uninterrupted? - No, I do not believe she would.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he was before the Justice, he said, he was in great confusion.</p>
               <p>I was a little suspicious when I was on the other side the counter; she asked me to make out a bill, I got a pen and ink, and then I was a little confused, suspecting she had something under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Court. You was not so confused but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040089"/> you remember the circumstances you have now mentioned? - Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The reason I did not leave money, I had been out to market and changed half a guinea, and left it on the drawers.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the value of the things she bought? - Fifteen shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Court. Then half a guinea could not pay that, you must go into the shop with an intention only to steal.</p>

               <p>Court. What way of life are you in? - My husband has been abroad about a twelve-month, he supported me in a genteel life and that is expended; I expect to hear from him every day, to remit me some money, or to support me.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. In this case I should recommended to you to take the milder meathod, and reduce the value under five shillings though if ever there was a case of private stealing this is one; I was in hopes something would have come out, that he saw her steal it, therefore, if you think she is guilty, you will find her guilty of stealing, but under five shillings.</p>

               <p>Was not you a taylor originally? - Never, Sir, in my life time, I was an iron master for seven years: Jones works at Messrs. Wrights and Pigotts, from over the water, at the Falcon, I do not recollect his Christian name, but I know that his name is Jones, and he afterwards worked for me, at the Bear Garden Foundry; he asked me to serve it for Mr. Quirk, I said, I did not know Mr. Quirk, but I would serve it.</p>
               <p>What connection had it with your trade, or business? - I do not know how it came; he asked me to do it; I said, I did not care if I did.</p>

               <p>Court. With respect to Watkins, he has asserted no facts which can be contradicted; he must take warning, but let Kelly be committed to Newgate to take his trial for perjury.</p>
               <p>Kelly. I beg for mercy, my Lord, I am a poor old man, consider a poor old man sixty years of age.</p>
               <p>Court. It is impossible, consistent with publick justice, to pass over so gross and impudent a perjury. It is the most impudent I ever remember committed in a court of justice; you have ventured upon oath to deny a fact, which is known to several persons.</p>
               <p>Kelly. I beg pardon, I am sure I shall not live.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. You have been convicted of an offence, which considered merely in itself was not of a very aggravated nature, and if the case had rested entirely on the evidence given on the part of the prosecution against you, and you had been simply convicted; the court might have thought perhaps a corporeal punishment,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040094"/> and a confinement for a few months might have been sufficient; but here is an attempt to add to the crime, a subordination of perjury, which is of infinitely greater magnitude; the jury have formed judgment which I most entirely approve; there is not the smallest doubt on that evidence, that the judgment they have found is right: the Court consider you as in the highest degree, partaking of the guilt of those men, as well as your own, and I think it right that those people who have heard this trial should hear the sentence that the court will pronounce, and the reason why that sentence is pronounced: Therefore instead of that mild punishment, which would have been inflicted upon you; the sentence of the Court is, that you be <rs id="t17830604-100-punish472" type="punishmentDescription">

               <p>What time did they take in robbing you? - About two or three minutes, I had never seen them before, I met four men going after them, they said, they had been robbed by the two men, I said, they had robbed me too, we went after them, and the two young men pursued one, and took him at the five mile stone, the other was taken the next morning.</p>
               <p>How long was that after you was robbed? - Two hours.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you see them? - I saw one of them, Rogers, in about two hours after I was robbed, at the publick house; he was the man that was in company; Liddell was taken the next morning; Rogers told where he was, and Hawkes went and took him, I knew him to be the person directly.</p>
               <p>ALDRIDGE HAWKES sworn.</p>
               <p>My brother was robbed the 9th of May, he came to our house and said, he was robbed, and desired me immediately to follow him, and at the White Lyon, at Edgware, we heard they had robbed a waggoner: I took Rogers just by the five mile slab, between the four and five mile stone; I found upon him four silk handkerchiefs, a night cap, a pair of gloves, 4 s. 6 d. and 4 d. half-penny, the silk handkerchief he pulled out of his breeches, and this man swore to it, the prosecutor swore to one of the shillings.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What do you know the silk handkerchief by? - There is a snag at one corner, it is tore; there was one of the shillings that I put into my mouth and tried it, and there is the dot, I scratched it with my teeth.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long have you had that shilling to be acquainted with it so? - I received it that day, I took particular notice of it, I thought it was not a good one.</p>
               <p>Court. (Looking at the shilling). This appears to be a good shilling. Rogers informed us where Liddell was to be found; he said, he was very sorry, he should rob a soldier, that was my brother, that was in the Oxfordshire militia; and Liddell cried and said, it was the first time, he had ever been out: he did not acknowledge robbing the prosecutor, he did my brother.</p>
