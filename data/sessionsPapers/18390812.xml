On the 20th of July I was coming past Mrs. Knight's house, in Cornhill, about a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner opposite the shop—I went on about one hundred yards, and then sat down to rest, as I had my tools on my back, and I saw him run by with a roll under his arm—I gave information to the officer, who took him with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live in Walbrook—I have one partner—the prisoner was in my employ. On Friday, the 19th of July, I told him I had heard he had been offering our goods for sale, and asked him to explain it—he said he had bought a couple of pairs of screens of Dodd and Co., and made them up for sale, to see what was doing in the trade—I asked if he had sold them—he said, not—I said, "Then you can produce them"—I accompanied him to his house,</p>

On the 15th of July, about nine or ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner Boyce in our yard—he said he wanted to go into the water-closet—I said he might—he did not go, but went out—I did not see the other prisoner—I had a gown hanging in the parlour, which was safe at that time—my little girl was in the room—I left the door open, and went to hang some things in the yard—my little girl hallooed out there was a strange man—I went and missed my gown, ran out, and came up with Boyce in Castle-alley—I said he knew something about my gown—he said, "No"—I have never seen it since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Robson, a gardener, in Shackle well-road, Hackney. I am a laundress. On Monday, the 8th of July, I was returning home from Wells-row, about half-past nine o'clock—I am a stranger in town—I have left Newcastle about three years—I had a bundle of linen on my head, belonging to Mr. Blain and Mrs. Hart<lb/>ley—I was taking them home to wash—it was a pretty sized bundle—when</p>

               <p>I was about a quarter of a mile from home, in King Hemy's-lane, a person came behind me, and knocked me down—he hit me on the back of my seek with his fist—the blow threw me into the hedge—he kicked me, and used bad expressions, and said he would kill me if I touched my bundle—that was after I had got up and got hold of my bundle—he snatched it from me, got hold of my arm, threw me into the hedge again, and took the bundle away from me—he threw me into the hedge by a blow on my breast with his closed fist, it was not a shove—he hit me right on the left breast—I got up again, and got hold of my bundle—there were hedges on each tide—he got away about two yards with it, and when I got up I got hold of it again—I snatched it out of his hand, and offered him money or bread if he was in want—he used very bad expressions, which I do not like to repeat—it was what he would do if I touched the bundle—he said he did not want money, he wanted the bundle—I would not let him take it—I stood to my bundle—I hallooed "Murder" twice, and a policeman came up directly—the prisoner never got the bundle from me again after I snatched it out of his band—the value of the articles in the bundle was about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was hurt on my thigh and my breast—he kicked me with his foot the second time I got up, which quite stunned me and hurt me—it did not knock me off my feet—I think he had hold of the bundle about five minutes, without my having my hands on it—I do not know why he did not run away, but he could not throw it over the hedge—I hallooed dreadfully for somebody to come to my assistance, and be hallooed "Policeman" after I cried "Murder"—he had moved two or three yards from me with the bundle—the back of my neck was very black for several days, and so was my breast—I was not hurt in any other part—I told him in the struggle, that I would rather lose my life than the bundle, and he made use of dreadful expressions, what he would do if I touched it.</p>

On Monday night, the 8th of July, about ten o'clock, I heard a scream of "Murder," coming directly from King Henry's-walk, Islington—it is a place much frequented by day, but very few pass that way at night—it is very lonely about that time—I only heard the scream of "Murder" once—I went up, and saw some fe<lb/>males before me—when I got up, the prisoner had just met the females—somebody called out, "Here comes a policeman," and another female called out for me to take him in charge—I immediately took him back to the prosecutrix—he was about six yards from her, and nearer to me than her—he was with the two women when I got up, but I had seen the women running before me, and he had met them—they were about twenty yards from where I took the prisoner when I first saw them—when I first saw him he was walking—the prosecutrix said, "Take him"—I took him back to her—her hair was very much disordered, hanging over her head,</p>

               <p>her bonnet off her head, and her cap also—she said the prisoner had struck her behind on her neck, and she fell forward, the bundle fell, and she scrambled for it—that he again knocked her down into the ditch, and again got hold of the bundle, and she offered him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a loaf if he would give her her bundle—I then took him to the station-house—on the road he be<lb/>gan pretending to cry, and said he was an unfortunate fellow—the prosecu<lb/>trix, with assistance, brought the bundle to the station-house—I opened it, and produce part of the contents.</p>

On Friday morning, the 19th of July, after six o'clock, I was in my chaff room, over the stable, and found tied up in a table-cloth, a pair of boots, a tea-kettle, and some brass candlesticks, which the prosecutor afterwards claimed—I delivered them to him.</p>

On Friday morning, the 19th of July, I heard these things were missing—I knew the prisoner by his being about the place—on the 20th I was coming up Compton-street, and saw the prisoner—he said the police were after him—I was going to ask him what for, but he said it was for some candlesticks and things he had taken—he said, "I got in at the top, and dropped it—then I got the three candlesticks—I could not get out, and I got the table and chairs, and put there, and I cut myself;"—just as he said that, he saw the policeman, and ran away—I do not know how he came to tell me about it—I was coming along with another young man at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman ship-joiner, and live in Leicester-street, Blackwall. On the 19th of July, between nine and ten o'clock at night I was in the Red Lion public-house, Poplar, and met the prisoner Marney—I was drunk—we stopped there till twelve o'clock—I then went to the Har<lb/>row public-house, and <hi rend="italic">stood</hi> some gin—I am sure I had three sovereigns in my pocket at that time—I changed a sovereign to pay for half-a-pint of gin—I put three shillings into my pocket, the two sovereigns and the rest into my fob pocket—I went home to her house, No. 2, Red Lion-court, with intent of stopping with her that night—she told me to go to bed, and she would be there very soon—she asked for some money to get some gin or what she liked—I had 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. In copper in my pocket, which I gave her—I thought she was gone to get it, but she did not go out of the house—I put on my trowsers, and came down to look after her—she asked me for more money—I told her I had no more—she said she would feel whether I had or not—she felt my fob pocket, and as soon as she had done so she went to the mantel-piece and began to rumple some papers about—I said, "You have got all my money," and I found it was gone—she said she was going</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183908120047"/>
               <p>to the Harrow public-house—I went also, she met Tantony there, and after staying a little time I went to sleep, and did not awake until three or four o'clock, when I went to the policeman and gave charge of them—two sovereigns and two-pence were found—I am sure, that at the time she had her hand in my pocket, I had some money in it.</p>

Into my fob pocket—I had changed a sovereign, to pay for half-a-pint of gin—we had a quartern of gin at the Red Lion, and I believe I had been having some beer by myself—I had beer and gin after I met her—I paid eight-pence at the Harrow public-house—the prisoner went to the mantel-piece in her room—I have not found the sixteen shillings—I cannot say why I did not give charge of her at the Harrow public-house, only I wished to leave it till the morning, that I might have the chance of seeing a policeman—I cannot give any notion how much beer and gin I drank that night—I had been paid at the Britannia public-house, and drank about a pot of beer with my mates—a little will make me drunk sometimes—I went to the Harrow public-house, and had half-a-pint of gin with the prisoner and one or two whom she might ask to drink—the prisoner Tantony was there.</p>

On the 31st of July I was taking two dozen of wine from Mr. Abbott's near the Regent's Circus, to my master's in two baskets—I saw the prisoner, and asked him to help me down with them, which he did—I waited some time, and then asked him to help me up with them, and while he did so, I suppose he took one bottle, for when I got home one was deficient—I went out, and found the prisoner with the bottle in his pocket—he first said it did not belong to me, and then said it was mine, and I might have it.</p>

The prisoner De la Salle is my wife's brother, and Mordaunt was my journeyman—on the night of the 3rd of July I went to bed at twelve o'clock, and left every thing safe—about two o'clock in the morning De la Salle came to me for a light, and said he was bad in his inside—about half-past five o'clock in the morning I went down, and missed a parcel of 350 springs, which I had done up the evening before for the Board of Ordnance, and some of the springs were lying about—I missed a great coat and the other things stated, to the value of about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to the Tower, to make it known that I had been robbed of these springs—I was told Mr. Manton was at Birmingham—I wrote to him, that if they should be offered for sale there to stop them, as I knew that they could not be sold in London—the prisoners were taken at Birmingham—Mordaunt had worked for me for nine days—I took him from De la Salle's recommendation—this is the gown which the prisoner had pawned—the springs were delivered back to me by order of the Magistrate, as the guns wore waiting for them at the Tower—I have only kept a sample of them—the other things are gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman-saddler and harness-maker, and live in East-street, Marylebone. I work for Mr. Kipps, coach-maker, in Great Marylebone-street—on Saturday, the 27th of July, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was in East-street, coming home—I had a small parcel with me, containing a few articles, which I had been purchas<lb/>ing—I saw four persons standing talking together—they appeared to me to be in company—I knew them all by sight well—the prisoner, who was one of them, came up to me, and said, "Old <hi rend="italic">chap,</hi> are you going to give me any thing to drink?"—I said, "No, I am going home"—immediately afterwards he caught me round the waist with his left arm, held me tight, and, with his right hand, caught hold of my right-hand waistcoat-pocket, and tore it clean out—he held me, and took it by force—it contained a half-sovereign, a half-crown, four shillings, a sixpence, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. In coppers—I am quite certain that was in my pocket—one of the other men, named Burns, immediately came up, and knocked me down—they all four then ran down Dock-court—I immediately got up, and called "Police" as loud as I could, but there was no one handy—I went into Baker-street, met two policemen, and told them—I described the men to them, and told them how they were dressed—I then went home—f was called up about three quarters of an hour afterwards by a policeman—I went to the sta<lb/>tion-house, and saw the prisoner there in custody—I knew him perfectly well as soon as I saw him—I positively swear he is the man that took my waistcoat-pocket and money—Burns was taken into custody the same night, about half an hour after.</p>

               <p>me where he lived—I went to his house, and told him I thought I could apprehend the party—as I went to the station-house I met the prisoner going down Thayer-street—I told him I wanted him on suspicion of com<lb/>mitting a robbery in East-street—he said, "I don't know any thing about it"—I took him to the station-house—the prosecutor came there, and identified him directly—I also took the other three—at least, two of them came to the station-house, and Burns I took in Oxford-street—the prose<lb/>cutor identified him as well, and said be was the one that bad knocked him down—they were all four taken before the Magistrate, Mr. Rawlinson—the prisoner was committed, and the other three kept all day, and discharged at night—I found a half-crown and three shillings on the prisoner—I had teen them all four together, drinking, after the robbery took place; and I also saw them all four together not five minutes before it took place.</p>

On the 3rd of August, I saw the deceased Moses gates at his stall, about a quar<lb/>ter or half-past nine o'clock in the evening—I was between five and six yards from his stall, as near as I can guess—I heard tome noise at the stall, and on looking towards it, I saw Gates strike the prisoner twice on the side of the head—I am quite sure I saw two blows—he said he would not cut and maul his salmon about for him—the prisoner then went away a little distance, and returned in half-a-minute—he was saucy to Gates, but I did not hear the words distinctly—Gates ran after him two or three yards—he then came back, and Coker followed him, and said if he bit him again, he would not run away, he would give him something for himself—Gates again ran after him, and just struck him with his finger on the head, as his hand could just reach him—it was his open hand—Gates immediately after came back, and said he had stabbed him—there was a candle in a lantern there, and I observed a cut in Gates's trowsers, just about the stomach, when he made the exclamation, and the blood was running—the light was taken out of the lantern, and one button of his trowsers was undone—he afterwards went to the doctor's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stone-mason, and live at Harefield. On the night in question, I saw Gates at his fish-stall—I was about four or five feet from it—I saw Coker there—Gates was weighing some pickled sal<lb/>mon—he told Coker it weighed seven ounces, and asked 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—the answer Coker made was, "Go to hell; who do you think is going to give 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce for your salmon?"—Gates made no answer just for the moment, but Coker kept grumbling about the price, and with that, Oates gave him one rap on the head—he said, "Be off about your business; who do you think is going to weigh salmon for you?"—or "Why do you come here to order salmon, and not take it when it is weighed?" and gave him a rap on the head—it was with his open hand—it was a smartish rap on the cheek—it was not sufficient to knock him down—it was a kind of blow which a man who was angry at the salmon not being bought would give—after this rap was given, the prisoner then said, "You b—if you hit me again, you shall have something for it"—this passed in front of the stall—the prisoner then left the front of the stall, and went to the back of the stall in the horse road—he came back again in a short time after—it might be a minute and a half—I should not suppose it was above a couple of minutes at most, and the first word I heard the prisoner say was, "Now come and hit me; you shall have something for it"—he said, "I sha'nt run"—these words were repeated by the prisoner move than once or twice—after he had dared the deceased in that way, the de<lb/>ceased went towards him—he was then standing with his back a little way towards the road—the prisoner then ran backwards, and the deceased fol<lb/>lowed him to nearly the middle of the road—when the prisoner was running backwards, followed by the deceased—he was waving his arms about, but whether it was for self-defence, I cannot say—I saw no blows pass, and Just as they got to near the middle of the road, I saw the prisoner make a stand, and a sort of rush towards the deceased—they were not a yard apart—the next thing I heard was, Coker said, "You have got it"—the deceased put his</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. About half-past ten o'clock on Satur<lb/>day night I went to the house of the prisoner's father—I found the prisoner in bed—I searched his breeches pockets, and found a pocket clasp-knife—I examined it, and saw marks of blood on it—I had asked him where the knife was—he said it was in his trowsers pocket, but it was not bloody; but I perceived marks of blood on the end of it—I asked him if he was not sorry for what he had been doing—he said no, he was not, for Gates hit him first—I asked him whether that was the knife he did it with—he said "Yes"—I gave the knife to the high-con stable of Ux<lb/>bridge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in New-road, St. George-in-the-East. I only know the prisoner from this occurrence—I believe he is a tailor, but he has been a bricklayer in the country—I had seen his wife, before this affair, at a cousin of hers whom I attended, but I did not recollect her—she was about twenty-two yean of age—the had had one child, which died, I believe, at eleven months old—they had no children living—I was called in to her on the night of the 14th of July, about one o'clock—the prisoner fetched me—he requested I would come immediately with him to attend his wife, who, he said, was far advanced in labour, and there was no time to be lost—I got up imme<lb/>diately and went with him—I answered him out of window—he waited outside while I got up and came out—nothing but common conversation passed between ns on our way to his wife—I do not believe ten words passed—that was nothing at all about his wife, except with regard to her being in labour—I do not recollect whether any thing passed at all respect<lb/>ing her on the road—we had about four minutes walk to go—when we got there I think the prisoner had a key and let me in—we went in together—he conducted me down stairs into the kitchen—his wife was in the front kitchen, below stairs, lying in bed—she appeared to be in great pain in her stomach and bowels—that was what she complained of—I understood she had been vomiting, and she complained considerably of constant sick<lb/>ness and of purging—she was tossing about and moving from one side of the bed to the other, first on her back and then on her side—that was certainly indicative of pain, but not of labour far advanced—her hands and feet were cold—the pulse at the wrist had ceased, I could detect nose whatever—her countenance was anxious and expressive of great pain and suffering—I found on pressing the stomach and bowels that there was grot tenderness—she was quite sensible—the prisoner was not by at the time I was making my examination—he was in the adjoining kitchen—the door was not shut close, and I think ho could hear what passed—I inquired of the deceased the cause of her suffering, and of how long dura<lb/>tion was—I think that the prisoner could have heard it without paying any particular attention, from the construction of the door, and that ap<lb/>peared an eye-sore to the deceased, for she was casting her eyes towards the door, while I was asking the question she frequently turned her eyes to the door—no part of her account took place after the prisoner came into the room—in conjunction with the other pains I thought there was some<lb/>thing of pain going on in the womb—I made an examination of the state of the womb at that time, to satisfy myself as to whether that would account, for the suffering and the state she was in—there were pains independent of labour pains—the labour pains were very slight—they were the common</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183908120066"/>
               <p>usual pains attendant upon that state—I made an examination—I found the uterus very slightly dilated, and the <hi rend="italic">umbilical</hi> cord very little protruding—on further examination I discovered the feet of the <hi rend="italic">foetus</hi> foremost—she had only gone six months—after making the examination, and satisfying myself that the symptoms and state she was in did not arise from that, I did not make any attempt to deliverher—there was general prostration of strength, without any pulse at the wrist, and vomiting—(I saw her vomit)—involun<lb/>tary purging, extreme anxiety of countenance, excessive tenderness of the stomach and bowels, and excessive pain, which she appeared to be suffer<lb/>ing generally, beyond that of labour pains—the pains continuing, I made slight attempts to deliver her, but finding the stomach did not improve, and that the pains continued, I ceased to make any attempts, conceiving it arose from other causes, and not from labour—the symptoms were very suspicious, and what I could not at all solve at the time—I was positive they did not arise from natural causes—I sent the prisoner to my house for some medicine—he was away from ten minutes to a quarter of an boor, during which time I was still holding conversation with his wife, and ex<lb/>amining her—on his return I gave her some of the medicine he brought back, and after she had drank it she requested to have a little tea, which she had, and it was immediately thrown up, with the medicine—I do not think the prisoner was by then—I told him afterwards, in the adjoining room, that the deceased had said he had given her a powder—he said, "I have given her some cream of tartar, which I have been frequently in the practice of doing when she felt poorly"—I replied that cream of tartar would not produce those symptoms, not in the quantity he bad given her—he said he had given her about a tea-spoon full—I said, "Are you cer<lb/>tain you have given her nothing else?"—he said he was positive he had not—I requested him to produce the cream of tartar—he showed me about three drachms, or from that to half an ounce of cream of tartar—I told him I would take care of that—I put it into my pocket—I said I should like to have it, and took it away with me—he made no reply—he said he had given her the cream of tartar some time in the afternoon, I believe, but I do not recollect whether he said afternoon or evening—I told him his wife was in a most dangerous state—I remained with her until she died, which was about four o'clock—that was about three hours—I told him she was in a most dangerous state, perhaps about three-quarters of an hour after I got there—I do not recollect that he made any reply to that—on returning to the deceased, and finding the same symptoms in<lb/>creasing, if possible, I advised a mustard poultice for the stomach, which I sent the prisoner to my house for—that was the other time I sent him—I cannot charge my memory how long after, but it was about three-quarters of an hour or an hour before her death—he brought it back, and I applied it—before I sent him for it I communicated to him a still further opinion of the dangerous state of his wife, that she was in more danger still, if possible, and could not live long—he then came into the room—that was before he went for the plaister—he kissed his wife, I believe, and seemed very much cut up at the time—he seemed very much affected, as man and wife could possibly do—nothing more passed that I recollect before he went for the plaister—she made no remark about her ailment while he was there, nor did I—on my way from the house immediately after her death, I met police-sergeant Donegan, and communicated my opinion to him—before I left the house, and after her death, I saw the prisoner in the back<lb/>kitchen,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183908120067"/>
               <p>and inquired of him if his wife had any relations in the neighbour<lb/>hood—he said she had a sister at Hampstead—I wished him communi<lb/>cate her death to that sister, but, after reflection, I told him it was of no im<lb/>portance—I told him it was a very alarming and remarkably sudden death—I do not recollect that he said any thing to that—I told him I would call again at nine o'clock—after meeting Donegan I returned with my assistant to the house—that might have been five o'clock—I saw the prisoner in the back-kitchen—I repeated as to the suddenness of her death, and at the same time informed him that in all probability there would be an inquiry about it—he said he hoped I would make it as mild as I possibly could with him—I made no reply—that was the sum total of the conversation—when I returned with my assistant, what I told him was a repetition of what I told him before—I told him his wife had said he had given her a whito powder—I did not tell him any thing else which she had said at that inter<lb/>view—I had told him I would return at nine o'clock, but I returned be<lb/>tween five and six o'clock, after seeing Donegan—it was then that I told him his wife had said he had given her a white powder, and I also told him that she desired me not to tell him, for if I did he would kill her—(it was either kill her or murder her, I am not sure which,) and that the reason his wife assigned for the powder was, that he said he did not want any more b—children—that was what passed in the presence of my assistant—he is not here—two other persons who live in the house were present, and they are both here—I said nothing more to him about what she had said—he said, "Oh, poor woman, she was not sensible" or could not be sensible—I said, "She was perfectly sen<lb/>sible"—he said nothing to that—I again repeated that it was very sodden, and an inquiry would be entered into no doubt—he said he hoped I would make it mild with him—I did not use the expression that his wife had said "on her dying bed" that he gave her the powder, but only that his wife had said so—the woman was perfectly sensible when I came to her, and continued so for two hours at least—she lost her senses for half or three-quarters of an hour before her death—she was not under the impression that she was going to die—from the expressions she made use of she did not at any time think she was going to die—I examined the body after death in company with Mr. Adams, on the day she died—on opening the body I found the stomach highly inflamed, and slightly contracted, thrown into wrinkles—the inner surface was lined with a thick coating of mucus, inter<lb/>spersed with flakes of a substance similar to the half-boiled white of an egg—it contained a light brown fluid—the small intestines, the glands were slightly enlarged, slightly inflamed, and contained a large quantity of fluid, interspers<lb/>ed with the same substance as the stomach, like the half-boiled white of an egg—the large intestines were inflamed, the secreting glands of them enlarged and also inflamed—the rectum was in the same state—the bladder was contracted and empty—the womb contained a <hi rend="italic">foetus</hi> of six months—the membranes of the <hi rend="italic">foetus</hi> were ruptured, the <hi rend="italic">umbilical</hi> cord torn, and the lungs congested, and infused blood in points—the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination confirmed me in the opinion that she was not suffering from labour pains, from the state of the stomach and bowels, which would account for the pain, but the state of the womb and its region did not—the appearance of the body, except the stomach, intestines, and lungs, was healthy in the extreme—I have seen many subjects labouring under the effects of poison, and who have died of it—I have made a great many <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183908120068"/>
               <p>examinations of the sort—I have, perhaps, seen twenty or thirty opened who have died of different poisons—I should say without doubt that the woman did not die from natural causes—I have no doubt she died of poison, from the symptoms, and from the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I took the contents of the stomach to subject them to a chemical test—I gave them into the hands of Mr. Lunn, an analytical chemist—I was present part of the time, but did not myself make any analysis—I did not detect any poison—I cannot account for no poison being found, supposing she had taken arsenic or any metallic poison, unless the vomiting and purging might have carried off the contents of the stomach—it is a question in the profession whether a person may not take poison and die from it, and yet none be discovered; whether it might not create such inflammation as to cause death, and yet be vomited—it is the opinion of the profession that that may take place—it is an opinion—I have not a particle of doubt, from the symptoms, and from the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, that she died of poison—the circumstance of no poison being found in the coat of the stomach or elsewhere, does not at all shake that opinion.</p>

PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you save any liquid which came from the stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The only liquid was the medicine and tea that came out while she was lying down, and that was spilt on the linen—I have the cloths which I found in the room—poison may be introduced into the stomach to produce inflammation, of which a person may die, and yet the poison be thrown off, and not be discovered—a person may die from inflammation of the stomach and bowels, producing exhaustion—that death was caused by something of an irritating quality taken into the sto<lb/>mach there is no doubt—poisons are irritating—I am not aware of any thing else that would irritate the body through the whole track of the sto<lb/>mach and intestines—it would be brought up again—persons do not die in that short space of time from inflammation of the stomach and bowels with<lb/>out taking poison—not from the time she told me she had taken the pow<lb/>der—I went, at a very late stage of the disorder, when pulsation at the wrist had ceased.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you whether or not medical men are satisfied in general to pronounce that a person has died of poison, in any case where it is not detected? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Where you have the appearance of the stomach and bowels and the state before death, without doubt any medical man would say from the appearance of the stomach and bowels, coupled with the symptoms before death, that the person had died from natural causes—I never heard of any substance, comparatively harmless at other times, which will sometimes act as a poison—persons have died from eating fruit—the cholera is an instance of that kind, but you have very different ap<lb/>pearances of the stomach and bowels—I have not seen any cases of death from inflammation without poison—I have never heard of persons dying of violent and repeated inflammation of the bowels and intestines, except where poison had been taken—inflammation of the bowels is very common<lb/>persons die of it sometimes—I am not aware of instances of death five or six hours after some substance having been taken—I never knew any so rapid as that—I have known it in thirty-six hours, never less—I have had many cases of thirty-six hours from the time I might have attended them, but persons may have been ill for some time—I am surgeon of St. George's parish—I have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for attending all the patients—it is a very large parish, 50, 000 inhabitants—I find all the physic—I understood that the deceased had wished to see me in the evening before—I gave evidence before</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner show all possible affection that a man could to his wife, under such circumstances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when I communicated to him that she was dying—the medicine I gave her was carbonate of magne<lb/>sia, laudanum, and a little spearmint water—carbonate of magnesia was decidedly not the worst thing that could be given to her—it is a sedative—it would not at all increase the inflammatory action, it would tend to allay it—I should give it in an extreme case of this kind—I should not give it in common inflammation of the bowels, but it is not by any means bad in inflammation arising by itself—I should not depend on magnesia, but in that state of things it suggested itself to me, combined with other matters—I should not recommend it, supposing poisoning by arsenic, not at first—if I saw the case early I should not use it, but in the state of things I ob<lb/>served I should use it—I at first observed what might possibly be labour pains in combination with the other pains—there were some labour pains, as I imagined—if she bad lived she must have miscarried in seven, eight, or ten hours—she was in a very weak state indeed—the pain in her stomach and bowels must have produced a miscarriage, in the extreme state of prostration she was in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and lived in the same house as the prisoner and his wife—he is a tailor—the last time I saw his wife up was about seven o'clock on the Sunday evening—I saw her standing at the bed-room door in the kitchen, where they used to sleep—she appeared to be like a per<lb/>son ill with a cold at that time—I might be there three quarters of an hour, talking to the prisoner—I was standing at the yard-door with him, and she was standing there at the time—I was within sight and hearing of her—I did not see her vomit or sick during that time—I was called up about half-past three o'clock in the morning by my wife, and came down—Mrs. Clif<lb/>ton was not quite dead then—she drew her breath, but was just near death—Mr. Garratt was there—I was in the back kitchen with Mr. Garratt and the prisoner after her death, about a quarter or half-past four o'clock—when the prisoner came in, I heard Mr. Garratt say that his wife had said he bad given her three powders, but she had desired him not to tell him, or he would kill her—I do not remember that the prisoner made any reply to that—Mr. Garratt left shortly after—he said nothing else then, to my knowledge—when he returned again, he told the prisoner it was a serious thing—the prisoner said, yes, it was, but, he was innocent of it, he had given her nothing but cream of tartar—I was then left in the house with the prisoner and my wife—he took a piece of white paper out of a closet, and went into the yard, and emptied two water-butts—I told him it was a bad job—he said, yes, it was a bad job, but he was innocent, by G—d; but if the worst came to the worst, they could only bring it in manslaughter, and they would transport him for life—my wife was by at the time.</p>

I saw Mrs. Clifton about seven o'clock on Sunday evening, in bed in her room—I was with her then about a quarter of an hour—she seemed to be very bad—she complained of a great deal of pain in her bowels and head—I did not see her sick, but she said she was—I did not see her again till one o'clock in the morning, when the prisoner came to call me, saying his wife was very ill, and begging me to come down—I got up directly, and was there all the time till she died—she had been very poorly the day before, on the Satur<lb/>day, but seemed to be worse on the Sunday—I do not know whether my husband saw her after I had been with her on the Sunday evening, or whether she was up after that time, I do not know—after she was dead I was in the back-kitchen—I said to the prisoner it was a shocking thing—he said it was, but by G—d he was innocent of it—but if the worst came to the wont they could only bring it in manslaughter, and transport him for life—that was after the doctor was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and have been in practice about ten years on my own account—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and conducted it jointly with Mr. Garratt—I have only a slight variation to make to his evidence, which is, that the smallest in<lb/>testines were not inflamed, except at the commencement of them—I did not see her before death—my opinion is, having heard all the symptoms described, and from the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, that she died of some acrid poison—I cannot swear to it, but that is my unqualified opinion—I would say that a large dose of medicine might produce similar effects—an inordinate dose of a powerful medicine, such as gamboge, or a large dose of calomel—hardly any quantity of the blue pill would produce it, except numerous doses—a drachm, or sixty grain?, would be about twelve times an avenge dose of blue pill—I think an extraordinary quantity of drastic medicine might possibly produce those symptoms—cream of tartar is certainly not a very drastic thing—I cannot conceive that any quantity of cream of tartar would produce it—I did not analyse the contents of the stomach, they were given to Mr. Lunn—supposing no poison to be found through the coats of the stomach or intestines, that would have no effect on the opinion I pronounce, as to her having died of poison, because I apprehend, if poison were administered in small doses, repeatedly, and for a considerable period, the symptoms, as indicated, might supervene, and yet no poison</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183908120071"/>
               <p>be discovered—suppose, for instance, a person taking for three weeks con<lb/>siderable doses of the corrosive sublimate or arsenic, precisely the same symptoms are found—that is the only way I can account for the absence of poison either in the stomach or intestines, or their contents—it accu<lb/>mulates in the system, and the effects suddenly come on—it is absorbed—I think the absence of poison may be accounted for, on the supposition of a violent sickness, or purging carrying it all off, but then you could detect it in the matter thrown off—the first discharge upwards and down<lb/>wards would carry the greater part of it off, yet the patient may die, although it is all discharged—the sickness may last after it is all thrown off—the latter sickness would show nothing—vomiting is more likely to get rid of it than the other passage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, supposing the earlier discharge of sickness not to be ob<lb/>served, do you think the patient might die of metallic poison, and yet the contents of the stomach would not detect it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, that would be another position, independent of its being taken in small quantities—I am of opinion, that although all the poison may be discharged at the first sickness, the patient may nevertheless die—I believe it is possible that the presence of poison in the stomach for a short time might create an irre<lb/>coverable inflammation—if metallic poison, such as arsenic, be given in a large dose, I should expect sickness to come on within half an hour, if given in a quantity sufficient to produce death—it would be sickness of great intensity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then, if you had found arsenic, it would not have strengthened your opinion, at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Unquestionably it would—I have not said arsenic was the cause of death, I said some acrid poison—finding arsenic would add very great strength to my opinion, but I say it may accumulate in the system, and you will not find it—a couple of grains may cause death—it is a very small quantity, but it is just possible—it pro<lb/>duces inflammation, and frequently mortification of the coats of the sto<lb/>mach—it affects the coat of the stomach by producing inflammation—it does not <hi rend="italic">erode</hi> it, that I am aware of—I never observed that effect—I will not say that effect does not exist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you whether medical men in general will venture to assert a person to have died of poison without finding the presence of poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Undoubtedly—I have seen a person who took arsenic for the disease of the stone, and very violent inflammation of the stomach and bowels was the consequence of it—medical men assert the possibility that death may take place from poison without ever being able to detect poison in the in<lb/>testines—they will not say that death must have taken place from poison—it is not a matter which can be positively stated—it is possible, but it is not by any means certain that death may not have followed from some other cause—I mean to say it is possible a person under these circum<lb/>stances may die of common causes, and where no poison is detected, I should certainly say a person might have died under common causes—from the symptoms detailed in this case, I might venture to assert that a person might die of common causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But without the detection of some specific poison in the interior, a medical man would not give a positive opinion that death arose from poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that is my answer—I think it might be—that is the result of my opinion.</p>

On the 18th of July I was eating cherries at my stall—the prisoner was before my stand—I spat a cherry-stone out of my mouth, which hit her cap border—I did it on purpose—she went into the public-house, then came out behind me, and spit some beer out of her mouth—part of it went down my back, and some over the goods I had on my stand—she returned to the public-house—I followed her, and told her as she had spoiled my goods, I would knock her down for it—she took up a quart-pot, and attempted to strike me, but did not—she afterwards struck me with her fist—I did not strike her, but we both walked out, and took no more notice of the case at that time—she remained at her stall about a quarter of an hour or less, and then came from her stall in front of mine—there was a large knife on my stall which she took up, and made a cut at me—I put up my left arm, and stopped that—she then turned the knife in her hand, took the blade in her hand, and struck me with the handle—she had struck me with the blade pre<lb/>viously, and I was cut on the wrist—I cannot say how she came not to cut her own hand—I do not know which blow inflicted the cut—I am not aware whether it was the heel or the point of the knife cut me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—this is my name—it was read over to me before I signed it.</p>

I came into the shop in consequence of what I heard, and saw the prisoner go out—I picked up the half-crown—it was the one I saw my wife ring on the steps—I heard her say it was a bad one—I followed the prisoner, and had her taken by a policeman—I delivered the half-crown to him.</p>

A person named Joseph Robinson came into our service in November last—the prisoner, Thomas Colegate, has been in our service six years and a half—he first came as porter, when he was about sixteen or eighteen years of age, and said he had just come to London—we advanced him, and when we went to Watling-street, which is about three years ago, we took him into the warehouse—in June last I had not agreed with him about any salary, but I should have given him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. this year—he before that had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, and lived in my partner's house, but he married in November or December last, and left my partner's house—he had no authority from me to sell goods without giving an ac<lb/>count of them to the entering clerk—we allow our young men to take a piece of goods for their own use, and to charge themselves at prime cost, but I should not take a piece of goods myself, nor would my partner with<lb/>out having it entered—during the last year we did more business than we had ever done before, and in December last we took stock up to the 30th of November—we found a profit, but the stock was about 1000/. less in value than I expected, and the profit was about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than I had calculated it ought to be—there appeared to be a deficiency of goods from a calculation I kept of the stock at the beginning of the year, and the goods that came in from time to time—we mentioned to all the persons in our establishment that we were deficient, and my partner spoke to Stevens to look out—in consequence of information, on the 12th of July last I procured two policemen, and sent for Robinson to my counting-house—he delivered to me an account of some property, and while he was writing out a list I sent for Thomas Colegate, and said to him, "Thomas, here are some goods you had on the 7th of June, according to a memorandum of Stevens, where are they entered?"—he said, "They are not yet entered"—I said, "It is nonsense talking about that, you never intended to enter them—the fact is, no doubt, you have robbed us of these and a great many other things beside—here is Robinson, (who confesses he has done wrong,) writing out a list, now do you do the same; it may be better for you, but mind I make you no promise"—(I said that in consequence of what the officer had said to me before)—I then asked him what had been done with the goods—he said they had been sold in a tally business, conducted by his brother under the name of his brother-in-law Purkis—I enquired where the tally-shop was—he said at his house, No. 16, Devonshire-street, Mile<lb/>end-road</p>

Hodgson and Co., as a warehouseman—I told Withers Colegate that I was about going off to buy some cord of my draper—he said, "My brother Thomas sells cord, you may as well have it of him"—I said, "Oh, does he?"—I told him I should not want it for two days or so, and to enquire of his brother what price it would be—he called on the following morning, and told me I had better see his brother, and I went to Mr. Hodgson's warehouse, and saw Thomas Colegate there—I took him a pattern of some cord, and asked what he would do me the same sort of cord at—he told me from 20<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that he had not any just then; but he would let me have it in the course of the morrow, if possible—it did not come the next day, and I sent my lad with a note, to say, that if it was not convenient to let me have it by five o'clock that afternoon, I must buy some, as I wanted it—he sent word back that I should have it about three o'clock in the afternoon, and it came by Court, Mr. Hodgson's porter—I asked Court for an invoice of it—he told me he had none—I asked if he knew the price—he said, he did not—I had no invoice—I paid for it in the way of trade, as I have done for the other things—Withers Colegate called on me the morning after I had it—that was on the 6th or the 7th—I cannot exactly say the day—I asked him if he had brought me a bill of the cord—he said, no his brother Thomas could not let me have it under 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, I did not much object to that, as it was a good one, and I could not get it cheaper of my draper—I told him to tell his brother to make me out a bill—on the 12th of July, Withers came to my house before the officers came—he said, he wanted to leave a few things, which were afterwards delivered to the officer.</p>

On the 7th of June, Thomas Colegate desired me to cut him thirty yards of cord—he told me the price of the piece, and where it laid—I went there and cut it off—he told me I must take it or send it to Mr. Houghton, a tailor in Jewin-street, and I told Court it was to go—I have told my master of this since—I had a suspicion at the time that it was out of the course of business, and not entered.</p>

Forbes wishes Messrs Barras to send him by the bearer, who will wait, 6 best Woodville's, 3 Cuba's, 3 cheroots. Ryegate, July 20, 1839. To Messrs. Barras and Co., High-street, Bloomsbury."</p>

The prisoner came on the 25th of July, and bought one penny worth of buttons—he wanted me to change them—I did—he walked down the shop, and I missed a paper of buttons—I jumped over the counter, and accused him of taking them—he said he had not—I found them under his arm.</p>

                  </hi>, I am single, and live in Great Earl-street, Seven-dials—I have known the prisoner Andrews between three and four years—I believe she is married—she has a person she calls her husband—in consequence of something that person communicated to me, on the 10th of July, I went to Mrs. Andrews, who lives in Blue Anchor-alley, Bunhill<lb/>row—I saw her standing at a coal shed-door, opposite where she lives—she came over to me, and asked if Mr. Andrews had called on me—I said, "Yes, he says you want me"—she said, "Yes, I want you to do me a favour, for a person has lent me two or three things, to make a little money of"—I went up stairs with her, and there was two brass candle<lb/>sticks and a metal tea-pot—she put them into a basket, and came down with roe, and we went towards Clerkenwell, through Jerusalem-passage—she there took out the two candlesticks and gave them me to pledge—I pledged them for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of Johnson, I think, and gave her the money and tickets—she told me to put them in that name—she then gave me the tea-pot, which I pledged at the corner of Exmouth-street, for 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave her the money and duplicate—we then came back to her own house, and had a quartern of gin—we went up stairs, and on the two-pair a neighbour, Mrs. Holland, called her into her room, and said, "I want to speak to you"—there has been two policemen after you, describing a person like you, and a girl"—she said, "What do you mean? what does the po<lb/>liceman want of me?"—she then went up her own stairs, apparently very angry, saying something which I could not hear—I went home, and did not go into her room any more that day—next morning, about a quarter to ten o'clock, four knocks came to my door—I went down, and saw the two pri<lb/>soners—they both had parcels in their hands—they came up stairs into my room—Thompson said, "How came you to go away so, yesterday after<lb/>noon?"—I said, "I heard quite enough to make me go"—Mrs. Andrews appeared the worse for liquor, and Thompson exclaimed, "Oh dear! I must be mad drunk, to rob my mistress"—Mrs. Andrews said, "I have some China, and a sheet, I wish to leave them here"—I said, "I will have nothing to do with them"—Andrews said, "Then we will sell them"—Thompson said, while Mrs. Andrews and I were gone out on the Wednes<lb/>day, she had a great mind to get up and hang herself—(she was lying in bed when I went to Mrs. Andrews's house)—we all three came down stairs, and went towards Vinegar-yard—Thompson then left us, and went to sell the China—she returned in a very few moments, and told Mrs. An<lb/>drews she had sold the China for 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we then proceeded to Monmouth-street, where Thompson left us, and said she would go and sell the sheet—Mrs. Andrews held the sheet, while Thompson went to sell the China, and then gave it to her to sell—I walked on with Mrs. Andrews, and then said to her, "How came you to send for me yesterday, to make away with these things, when you knew they were stolen?"—she said, "Oh, don't bother, you shall not be hurt"—I then said to her, "When I was in your place yesterday, I thought I saw some knives and forks, on the end of a bench</p>

I wish I was dead"—Andrews walked on before, and Thompson walked with me, and told me that the evening be<lb/>fore she had taken out a pillow, and given it to a girl to sell; that she brought her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, which she had spent herself—I said, "I sup<lb/>pose, then, you drank a good drop last night?"—she said, "Yes, I did, for I do not know what time I got home to Andrews's house"—she then exclaimed, "Oh, what shall I do? they are sure to fetch me; I shall make away with myself!"—we went home towards Whitecross-street, where Andrews lives—nothing passed there, but Thompson sent Andrew with a frock of her own to pawn, to get some tea, and we had tea together—I saw no more till they were in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Morgan, of the Strand. On the 3rd of August, the prisoner came to receive some gloves for his father—he was standing in the shop—I was in the parlour—I saw a movement of his hand which led me to suppose something was taken from the counter where he stood—I went forward into the shop—he stood there with his hat in his hand, and a bag on the top of the hat, covering the open part of the hat—I desired him to wait a little while and he should be attended to, and desired him to put down his hat—he put it down on the ground on a stool sideways, so that it leant against the stool—the bag fell forwards, and I saw something there—I put my hand down, and took the piece of hand<lb/>kerchief out of his hat—I locked the door, detained him, and sent my son for my husband, who came as soon as possible, and he called in Lock, the policeman, who took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Thomas Cutts, a law writer, in Tooke's-court, Chancery-lane. On Saturday night, the 10th of August, about half-past ten or a quarter to eleven o'clock, I went into the shop of Mr. King, a pawnbroker, in Holborn—it is a pawnbroker's on one side and a jeweller's on the other—I went to the jewellery side—I saw both the prisoners in the shop—they made way for me to stand between them—there were several other persons in the shop—the prisoners stood near me—I was not there many minutes when I put my hand to my pocket, and my purse was safe—I put my hand in my pocket again, with in three minutes, and the purse was gone—I turned round, and saw Bird, the other prisoner was gone—I took hold of Bird, and accused her of having taken my purse—she said she had not—I then asked her where the other girl was—she said she was gone round to the boxes—I took Bird to the boxes, and Clifford was not there—I asked Bird where she lived—she said she would show me—I took her across the road, and gave her in charge—she told us Clifford lived on Saffron-hill—we went and found her there at play with other children in the street—I said to the constable, "That is the girl who was standing behind me"—she attempted to run away. but he caught her—I said, "You have taken my purse"—she said, "I have not"—I afterwards said, "What have you done with the purse?"—she said she had thrown it away in Holborn, that she had changed the five shilling piece and half-crown, some she had spent and some she had got—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Holborn last Saturday night, and Mrs. Cutts gave Bird into my charge—I afterwards took Clifford playing in the street with some girls—she attempted to run away—a policeman caught her and brought her back—Bird, when she was first charged, said she had not committed the robbery, but she thought the other one had, as she ran away and left her, and she knew where she lived—she could not give us the number, but she would show us where it was, and she went with us—Clifford said Bird tapped her hand against the lady's pocket in the shop, as much as to say she had money, and she (Clifford) then put her hand into her pocket, took it, turned the money into her own pocket, and threw the purse away in Hol born, as she always did do—when I got hold of her, I asked her where the purse was—she said she had thrown it away in Hol born—that she had changed the fire shilling piece and a half-crown, and spent some, and the rest she had—Bird heard this, but said nothing to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to David le Bontillier and another, in the Commercial-road. On Tuesday, the 30th of July, about half-past three o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop with another woman, and asked for some narrow black sarcenet ribbon, which I shewed them—they looked at a drawer of ribbon—I served the other woman, and saw the prisoner take a silk handkerchief off the counter, put it under her handkerchief, and then put her hand towards her right-hand pocket—I afterwards saw her take a piece of ribbon out of the drawer I was showing her—I sent for a constable—I saw another piece of ribbon in her hand, but she let it fall into the drawer—Mr. Bontillier went into a room with her at the back of the shop, and I told the prisoner she had a lavender spun-silk handker<lb/>chief with a narrow border, and a piece of ribbon—she said she had not—I told her she had the ribbon down her bosom—she then put her hand into her bosom, took it out, and said she had had it three or four months—it had our mark on it—I asked her for the handkerchief—she said she had not got it—I left the room then for two or three minutes, and when I came back the policeman had the handkerchief in his hand—the ribbon was marked "A."</p>

On the 26th of June I paid a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the prisoner, on the prose<lb/>cutor's account—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it was paid for goods supplied to me by Messrs. Cookson—on the Monday morning after I paid the prisoner, he called on me, and brought the book, which was deficient of the entry of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque which was not accounted for there—he said he wished me to let it stand over, and said he would pay me the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the book he brought, as far as I can say—there appears a deficiency in it—I said I could not do any thing of the sort—I must send the book down directly to Messrs. Cookson—nothing farther occurred.</p>

The prisoner was in my service—on the 23rd of July, I sent him to St. Katharine's Docks for twenty bags of sugar—he was to deliver ten of them at Topping's wharf, and ten at Forster and Whistler's—I re<lb/>ceived information, and went to Forster and Whistler's—I found he had delivered ten bags there all right—I went to Topping's wharf, and found he had only left nine bags there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in Rose and Crown-court, Bishopsgate. At half-past seven o'clock on the evening of the 23rd, I saw Mr. Cobley's wagon in the Commercial-road—it went on till it got just past the end of Gloucester-street, and stopped about one door past the street—the prisoner was standing against the hones or the wagon—a man got up into the wagon, and put out a bag, which appeared, by the description on the bag, to be East India sugar; and another man, who is at large at present, took the bag on his backhand carried it into Mr. Mew's, a confectioner's shop—the prisoner was at the time by the side of the hones or the wagon—I did not notice whether the man who carried the sugar came back to him.</p>

On Wednesday or Thursday I missed a pair of traces from the prisoner's bench in the manufactory—I made inquiry about it—on the Saturday the prisoner came to finish his work—I asked him where the other two traces were, as there had been four—he said he had taken them down, from which I supposed he had finished them and taken them down—I said, "You have not taken them down"—he said he had—I said, "Who did you give them to?"—he could not tell me—I went and asked the foreman if he had received them—he said, "No"—I told the foreman he had better not pay him till his work was finished—the traces produced I believe to be the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I told him they were not finished, but I would bring them on the Monday—he said, "Have you pawned them? if you have I will lend you the money to get them out"—I said, "No, I have not." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did say so.</p>

On Saturday, the 3rd of August, I missed about four feet of the lead gutter off the roof of the skittle ground—there was ten feet taken away—I know the prisoner by his frequenting the house—I went with Mr. Craig to the prisoner's house, and asked him how be came to take the lead—he said, "Don't make a noise, I will go with you"—on the way to the station-house I said, "You are the last person I should have thought guilty of such a thing"—he said, "If you will let it be till next week, I will make it all right"—we have not found any of it.</p>

On the 6th of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I went down to the bottom of the garden, and while I was sitting there I saw some mortar fall from the party wall—I called out, "What are you doing?"—I got up, and saw the prisoner take the lead from the party wall, double it up, and throw it under a bench in the yard next to the skittle ground—it was a piece of the water pipe—he told me he was repairing the gutter—I told him to make good the hole he had left, and left him—I went back in about an hour, and saw some loose bricks put into the hole, which I thought was not done by a workman—I went and told the barman, and went to the prisoner's lodg<lb/>ings with him—the hole was nine inches square—I know nothing about the other lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Messrs. Guy, Champion, and others, vinegar merchants, in the City-road. Caveley had been in our employ for five or six months—we keep a number of horses, and made a verbal contract with the prisoner Larman to supply us with ten bundles of tares every day, weighing 60lbs. per bundle—he was to be paid 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per bundle—I fancied that the quantity of tares delivered was less than it ought to be, and on the 31st of July I secreted myself in the loft with Gay, one of my foremen—I saw Larman come and deliver the tares—he only delivered eight bundles—Caveley was there, and took them in of him—he put some of them on the weighing machine, but it did not go down—(it was his duty to weigh them all)—when they were delivered the two prisoners went away together—after they were gone I and my foreman weighed the tares, and, instead of 600lbs. which they ought to have weighed, they only weighed 302lbs.—next morning I and my foreman secreted ourselves again—Larman came, and delivered eight bundles instead of ten, as he had done on the former morn<lb/>ing—when the prisoners were gone I had the tares weighed, and they weighed 3321bs.—next morning I was not there; but on the morning after, which was Saturday, the 3rd of August, I was again concealed there—I had then spoken to two police-officers—there ought to have been twenty bundles delivered that day, weighing 1200lbs.—when the prisoners were gone I saw them weighed again, and there were only 624lbs.—Caveley had been present each morning, and had put some of the bundles on the ma<lb/>chine—he knew what they should weigh—he did not make any remark that they were not right—on that Saturday morning I had directed Tennant to mark some money—I was present when the officer brought the prisoners back to the yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Union-street. I ex<lb/>amined Jennings on the morning of the 3rd of July—I found a cut on the left side of his nose, perforating the nostril—a wound under the upper lip, another on the left side of the mouth, and one by the left ear—they were such wounds as this knife might have produced—it appeared to me that the knife had glanced off by the whisker or bone, but I think there had been more than one cut—the knife appeared to have struck against the angle of the lower jaw, and in the struggle, a man lowering his head might have prevented its going lower.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was not my head cut? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see him till he was at the office—he had some dressing on his head as if he had been injured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On this night Jennings came to the door and knocked—I opened it—Margaret was up stairs—I let him in—he said, "What are you about?"—I said, "Nothing at all, she is drunk, but you have been with her, and are drunk too"—he said, "I am b—d if I will have your nonsense, you come out"—he took out his staff, dragged me out, knocked me down with his staff into the kennel, and fell on the top of me—I had no knife in my possession—the policeman said he saw two or three women over us with a knife in their hands, and now he denies it—I had no knife—I was knocked down senseless, and I used no knife.</p>
