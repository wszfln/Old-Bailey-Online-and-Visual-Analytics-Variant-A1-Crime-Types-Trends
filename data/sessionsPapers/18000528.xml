             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer: On Thursday, the 6th of March, I went in company with other officers up one pair of stairs in a house in Gloucester-court, between Golden-lane and Whitecross-street; when I came to the door I looked through the key-hole; I opened the door and went into the room, with Mason and Ray; I found in that room the prisoner Blakesley, Wright the accomplice, Hayes Jones, another prisoner, who is since dead, and the prisoner Hale sitting by the fire-side on a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose lodgings these were? - A. The landlady is here; in the window were these two one pound Bank-notes; the prisoners were secured, with the bed, two pillows, and bolsters, that were in that room; we took them all to the office; I left Hayes at the office giving his deposition, and I went with Vickery and Mason, two other officers, to a room in Red-lion-court, Red-lion-market, I believe it is called, in Whitecross-street; I went up two pair of stairs, and broke the room-door open; there I found this carpet, a bed, three pillows, a bolster, two images, and sundry other things, which I put into a coach, and went to Hayes's house in Golden-lane, and brought Mrs. Hayes to the office, who had the key of that room; there was a woman laid in that room, though Mrs. Hayes kept the key; I took her into custody, but she was discharged; I took Mrs. Hayes to the office, her word was taken, and she came when the Magistrates ordered her; her husband was kept; I delivered them to Mrs. Davies in Court last sessions, and put my mark upon them; these are the same things, there is my name upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Davies. I am very sure they are all mine; they are the things that I left in my house in February, and that I missed when I returned home.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the value of them? - A. Each bed two pounds; I gave three guineas for the carpet at Michaelmas last.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it after your husband was taken up? - A. Yes; they were removed to Red-lion-market; there was a bed and two small images, a carpet, and two bolsters.</p>

               <p>Q. You have once sworn to that Jury that you had no room in your house for those things, is that true or not? - A. I had no room, because they were in the passage; I had no room convenient to put them in; the shop and the kitchen laid open, and I did not think that was proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no place above stairs? - A. None but my own sleeping room.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not like to put them where they could be seen; that was not convenient to you and your husband's business? - A. No.</p>

year and a half.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you go there? - A. We went with a horse and cart; we unbolted the garden-gate and went in, and found the door as Davis and I had left it on the Monday before.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you leave the door when you left it on Monday? - A. We pulled the house-door to, and left some stones between the door and the doorpost.</p>
               <p>Court. You see you cannot make this a burglary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What did you do then? - A. We pushed the door with our knees, and it went open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it require any degree of force to open it? - A. No; then we went into the house, and I brought out a bed that laid in the passage, and put it in the cart; after which Blakesley brought out another bed that was in the passage; we went up one pair of stairs, and brought the carpet down.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that carpet; do you believe it to be the same? - A. It was like this; there were two china images, three pillows, two bolsters, and some chimney ornaments; they were all put into a cart; we brought them to town, and took them to Jones's apartments, somewhere in Whitecross-street; we took the things up to his room; Blakesley helped to take the things out; then we wanted a purchaser; we shewed them to two or three persons, and they would not buy them; then I went to Henry Hayes, in the afternoon of that same day; he lives in Golden-lane; I told him what articles we had got, and he came along with us to look at them; Blakesley asked eleven guineas for the property, and Hayes refused; he said he would give five guineas and a half; we did not agree to let him have them, and he returned to his home; and then Blakesley went to tell him he should have them; Hayes came back with him, and he was to have them for five guineas and a half; he paid half-a-guinea earnest; Hayes took one bed away with him, and the carpet, and the chimney ornaments; then he returned again for the other bed, and as he was paying the money to Blakesley, while we were there, the officers, Armstrong, Ray, and Mason came in.</p>

               <p>Q. We have heard that Hale was in the room at the time? - A. Yes, she was sitting down by the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any thing to do with the sale of the articles? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you amnsed yourself in this trade of breaking open houses? - A. About five or six months.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you pay them all in cash? - A. No; there were two one-pound notes; one of them was torn a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two? - A. These are the same; Blakesley put the money in his pocket, all but the notes; they were put in the window, and then the officers came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Blakesley and you having any conversation about where the goods came from? - A. No, they did not tell me; Blaksley said they came from the country; I think it was him; I had no other conversation with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you think these goods fairly and honestly come by? - A. No; I did not think about it.</p>

               <p>Q. You are training her up early? - A. I never bought any thing in my life before; my wife keeps the shop, and my business is out-door.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you not open the door to them? - A. I did not know, when they knocked at the door, that it was them.</p>

            ; the prisoner at the bar came up to me, and said, your money.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. The prisoner is the man; I got up from my seat, being very much alarmed; he then said, in a loud tone of voice, you hesitate; upon which I turned round, I was going to run away, and he presented a pistol at me; I said, stop, Sir, and I will give you all I have got; I gave him my purse containing a seven-shilling-piece, some silver, two or three shillings, and there was a little gilt clasp in the purse; he then ran off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the size of the pistol which he presented to you? - A. It was a small pistol; half of his face was covered with a white handkerchief, the lower half; the prisoner was brought to me in about a quarter of an hour afterwards; the children had raised an alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he was brought back, did you, to the best of your belief, think he was the person that had robbed you? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner, who now stands at the bar, the man who was brought back to you? - A. He is.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q. How long had you seen him before he came up to you? - A. I had not seen him till he came up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was one half of his face covered during the whole time he was with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you under much alarm at the time? - A. I was not at the first.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it that you are enabled to say that he is the man, one half of his face being covered? - A. I attended very particularly to the other part of his face; for as I knew I had but very little in my purse, I was afraid what he might do to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any particular observation upon his dress during the time he was with you? - A. Yes; he had on a brown coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he had his own hair, or a wig? - A. I did not observe that; he was without powder.</p>
               <p>Q. How are you enabled to judge with certainty - do you speak from his features? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled, from the observation you made, to speak with certainty? - A. I can speak with certainty.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the garden was it? - A. Near the Bayswater-gate.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was brought back to you did you hear him speak? - A. Yes; and I knew his voice immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Sarah Vale at the time? - A. She was sitting opposite to me; one of the children was sitting by me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at that time observe the prisoner? - A. I cannot swear to him; I only saw the colour of the coat, it was a brown coat, I saw him running; just after that, I saw him take a dirty handkerchief from his face and put it into his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man that was brought back to Miss Nation the same coloured coat on that the man had on that you saw run? - A. I think he had, I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far might you be from Miss Nation? - A. About an hundred yards; I then rose my head up and saw him running; he was then about as far from Miss Nation as I am from there,(the bench); I was very much alarmed for the children; I think he was a man about the same size, but I cannot pretend to say.</p>

I am a surgeon, in Queen-street, Portman-square: On the 9th of May I was in Kensington-gardens; I saw Miss Nation about three hundred yards from the Bayswater-gate, or between two and three hundred yards, she was sitting upon the first bench from the gate; I heard the alarm of the children, and immediately saw the prisoner running down the gravel-walk, I immediately pursued him.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is Grosvenor-gate from where Miss Nation was sitting? - A.

               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in his hand? - A. No, I did not; I beckoned to the people, when he was laid hold of, to bring him to me, and he was brought to Grosvenor-gate, where I stood; and when they brought the prisoner to me, I desired them to lead him on to Miss Nation; I went with them, and she positively identified his person; I did not see the pistol found, but I heard the prisoner say that he picked up the pistol.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Are you perfectly sure, that the person who was brought to you at Grosvenor-gate, was the person that you had seen running in Kensington-gardens? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him stop for any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What was the cause of your pursuit? - A. The children gave an alarm, and Miss Nation pointed out to me that that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any handkerchief found in his hat? - A. Yes; there was a white handkerchief, a coarse cambric handkerchief, rather dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it found? - A. No; the Duchess of Dorset's servant told me it was found in the hat; after he came to Bow-street the handkerchief was found in his pocket.</p>

My Lord, with regard to the pistol, the evidence that saw me pick the pistol up is now at Bath; it is true I had it in my possession; there was a review in the Park, both of horse and foot, I went into the Park to see it, and kicked this before me; I picked it up, and with a bit of stick I tried it, and found it was not loaded; I looked at the lock, and found there was but one screw in it; as to Miss Nation, I am perfectly innocent; it was a very hot day, and the people were drove about very much, and there were a great many people glad to put handkerchiefs in their hats to keep the sweat from running down their faces; I dare say there were fifty people in the Park with handkerchiefs in their hats; I have lived with Lord Howe, and some of the first families in the kingdom, and am now in the Custom-house; there were several people running in Kensington-gardens; I offered to be searched when I was stopped; but as to Miss Nation, the great Searcher of hearts knows I never saw her purse or money, and we shall be judged by-and-by; I know I had this pistol about me; I thought it would look black against me, and I threw it away.</p>

               <p>Wather. He certainly offered to be searched.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

            , I went with him to a place called Corkcutters-alley; as soon as I got into the alley, it is not a thoroughfare, a woman ran up the alley, and said, Jack, shut the door; I made the best of my way to follow her into that house, and I found the prisoner standing in the house with his back towards the fire-place; when he saw me, he stooped to take up something, which he held behind his coat, which put me on my guard; the woman then ran towards him, put her arms round him, and took something away, but what it was I could not discover; he then stooped again, and took something else up, which he held behind his coat in the same way; after a little while that was dropped, and I discovered a poker lying upon the hearth; he asked me what I wanted with him, and it was nonsense, and so on; I then desired the watchman to take him into custody, and I took out my truncheon, and we took him to the watch-house; when he came to the watch-house, I searched him, and in his left-hand waistcoat-pocket I found four Ramsgate bank-notes, which I have now to produce; they were squeezed up separately like waste paper; I did not ask him how he came by them, he was drunk at that time; the next morning I did ask him how he came by them, and he told me he came honestly by them, but did not tell me how. (Produces three five-guinea notes, and a ten pound note.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gibson. I believe them all to be mine; but the ten pound note, which is marked with, the names of Mr. Heritage and J. Perkins upon it, I can swear positively to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You mean only to speak to the ten pound note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And from that single circumstance, of having these names upon it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. They are all Ramsgate bank-notes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing is more common with notes than to have names endorsed upon them? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>

               <p>Q. It appears to have been a good while in circulation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you recollect ever having seen the names of Heritage and Perkins upon any other note? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Heritage kept a tavern at Ramsgate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was his practice to put his name upon other bills? - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see any other notes with his names endorsed upon them? - A. I may; I cannot recollect them.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing there had been a ten pound note that had found its way to York, or any other place, it having the name of Heritage, and having the name of Perkins, should you have been able to distinguish the one from the other? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I see the endorsement, Heritage, is dated May 1795? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Observe this is not the endorsement of an endorset, because it is payable on demand, but an endorsement put on for some other purpose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Bly. Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The first person you saw at the end of this alley was the woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw nothing of the notes in the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The woman was the person who appeared to be agitated? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you curiosity to search the house before you took the prisoner to the watch-house? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Therefore, whether there was any other man in that house you do not know? - A. It is a small house let in tenements.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the house to see if there was any other man in any other part of that house at that time? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the prisoner make any resistance when you took him? - A. He seemed to menace at first, but he did not make any resistance.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You say there was a woman whose arms were round the man, what became of her? - A. She was taken into custody a few days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it impossible that she could have taken any thing from his pocket, or any part about him? - A. I think there was a possibility, but I did not see her take any thing; he back was to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Might not the woman have given him something? - A. I did not see her; there is a possibility of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could she have given him these notes that you found squeezed up in his waistcoat pocket? - A. I should suppose she might.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have told us all that passed about the woman? - A. No; she went to him when he stood by the fire-place, and took something out of his hand, but what it was I do not know, she made use of this expression,"Don't, don't, do nothing;" she put her hands to his hands, and whatever he had in his hands, he dropped; I did not know whether it was the poker, or what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us all that happened that the woman did? - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the woman clasping the man round the body, with her arms? - A. Not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. If that had been done in the room, you must have seen it? - A. Yes, there was a light in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he gave her any thing, or that she gave him any thing? - A. I did not see her either give or take.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Bly.) Q. Was it in consequence of what Greenhill told you, respecting the prisoner having fifteen or twenty pounds, that you proceeded to do what you did? - A. Yes; Gentleman was a man that had returned from transportation, and therefore I suspected the prisoner as they were together.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Pemberton.) Q. You say, you observed a footstep when you went up stairs, was it a man's footstep or a woman's? - A. A man's.</p>

            , for a capital offence, so constituted by a special Act of Parliament passed for the purpose in the 39th year of the late King, by which it is made an enquiry before you, notwithstanding the offence itself was committed in the county of Cornwall.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen. This is a provision of the law which I think you will find, when the circumstances of this case come to be stated to you, is absolutely necessary; for sorry I am to say, that the evidence that will be offered to you in this case, will shew you what the legislature were sensible of at the time of passing this Act of Parliament, that justice was not to be expected upon the spot, that so many persons were concerned in transactions of this nature, that it could not be hoped upon the spot to find a Jury who would do justice; not perhaps because they might not be disposed to do it, but probably because they would not dare to do it; for, Gentleman, it is a melancholy reflection, that in those counties upon the coast, where transactions of this kind take place, there are so many persons who are in the habit of setting themselves above the law in certain instances, that they are very apt to set themselves above the law in all; and that persons who think sit, as you will find, according to the evidence that will be given to you in this case, to hazard their lives in one instance, are disposed to hazard their lives in others, for the protection of that gain which they are attempting unlawfully to make.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This Act provides, that if any persons, to the number of three or more, armed with fire-arms or other offensive weapons, shall be assembled for the purpose of assisting in a variety of illegal acts with respect to the smuggling of goods, and particularly with respect to the rescuing or taking away such goods after seizure, from the others of the Customs or Excise, that they shall be adjudged guilty of felony, and shall suffer death as in a cases of felony, without benefit of clergy. Gentlemen, that is the offence with which the prisoner at the bar stands charged, and you are, as indifferent persons, between the prisoner and his country, to determine whether or not he has been guilty of that offence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, According to the evidence which is stated to me, the case will be proved to you fully, clearly, and in such a manner that I apprehend you can have no doubt upon the subject. It will appear to you, I think, that in the month of May in the last year, some officers of the Customs and Excise had seized a quantity of brandy and geneva, in those small casks which if any of you Gentlemen have been at all conversant with smuggling causes, must know by the common appellation of tubs or ankers, and which ankers(but they are commonly called tubs by the smugglers) were found concealed, being buried in trenches in a ploughed field near a village called Trebuthan, in the parish of St. Keverne, in the county of Cornwall; this village is near another, called Coverack upon the Beach, where goods are landed. Gentlemen, it will be proved to you, that the officers having found these goods buried in these trenches, and having seized them, that some of them went for the purpose of procuring horses or carriages to remove them to Helstone, which was the nearest place to which they could have removed them in safety; that some of them employed themselves in searching for more goods, and a man of the name of Lisle was left in possession of the goods that were seized. It will be in proof to you, that while this man was alone, in the possession of the goods so seized, eight men armed with guns, with pistols, and with hangers or swords, some of them having two of these weapons and others only one, arrived at the place where Lisle stood with the goods; that they used threatening expressions to him, threatening to kill him if he attempted to hinder them, saying that the goods were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280012"/>their's, that they had already hazarded their lives for them; and then each man took up an anker and carried it away. Gentlemen, this was when Lisle only was present, and a part only of the goods were carried away upon this occasion; when these eight men had carried the goods to the distance I think of about half a mile, they were met by other smugglers, to whom they delivered them, and then they instantly returned, all the officers at that time being collected together. Gentlemen, upon returning again, they presented their firearms; they threatened the officers if they made the least resistance, and then they again carried off seven more of the ankers, leaving a staved one in possession of the officers. The fact, therefore, of the rescue of these goods from the officers, after they had seized them, will be clearly and distinctly proved; the circumstance of these eight men coming thus together, coming thus armed, coming a second time, will also prove to you that this was deliberately done. But, Gentlemen, it will also be shewn to you, that these men came up from the Cove called Coverack, for the very purpose of rescuing these goods; that they made enquiries upon the subject before they came to the spot; they enquired after the goods, and got a person to conduct them to the spot where the seized goods were; it is evident, therefore, that the most deliberate purpose of violating the laws of their country, of setting themselves up above the law, and of preventing the execution of that law by force, was the object of these persons. Gentlemen, the same is obvious also, from the language which they used upon the occasion; when they were told by the officers that the goods had been seized by them, in the character of officers of his Majesty's Customs, the answer they gave was, that they had already hazarded their lives for the goods, that they were their property, and they would have them. Gentlemen, the goods being thus taken away, it will appear to you, that the officers mounting their horses, rode after the men, not for the purpose of taking the goods from them again, because the force was too strong for them; but with a view of going to that place called Coverack, from which these persons had come, to ascertain precisely who they were, or to get some account of them. Gentlemen, they came up with them in a narrow lane leading to Coverack; when they came up with them the smugglers put down their casks and stood before them with their arms presented to the officers, to keep them back; the officers told them they did not mean to fight them, at which time they had an opportunity of minutely examining the persons of the men who were concerned in the transaction; and I understand it will be proved to you most satisfactorily, that the prisoner at the bar was one of those persons. Gentlemen, it will appear to you, how boldly, how openly, and how unfortunately for the peace of the country, these men dared to act, for, upon the officers going to Coverack, the smugglers followed them, and having set down the casks openly in the town at a public-house door, they drank out of them; here there were so many smugglers of different descriptions, crews of vessels employed for that purpose, that it was utterly impossible for the officers to do any thing, and they were obliged to leave these people quietly in possession of the goods. You will easily imagine, Gentlemen, that in a country where such a transaction can be carried on, where all the people of the country sit quiet, and suffer men to conduct themselves in such a lawless manner, that justices is not to be had; the men who are resident upon the spot, whether from their habits of life, whether from their connexions with these people, or whether from the fear they have of them, you will perceive they did not dare to stir to assist the officers against those persons who were thus acting in open defiance of the law.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, If this case is proved to you as it is stated to me, I apprehend you can have no doubt of the guilt of the prisoner; for it will appear to you that there was a rescue of goods seized, as required by the Act of Parliament; that that rescue was with force and violence, by a number of persons armed, to the amount of more than three, namely, eight persons at least were concerned in the transaction. It will be proved to you, that the purpose of these men was deliberate, that their intention was to effect a rescue, that they went for that purpose to the spot, that they returned a second time, having before taken but part of the goods, that they took them away by violence, and declared their resolution to risk their lives in the attempt, if they should be resisted.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, The case therefore, under these circumstances, will, as I conceive, be distinctly proved to you; and if it is proved to you, I conceive you will not hesitate to discharge your duty. You, Gentlemen, must be indifferent upon this subject; you can have no passions or prejudices upon it, nor can you have any fears: to you, therefore, it is, that the law appeals, and your verdict must declare between the prisoner and the public, whether he is guilty or not.</p>

            , an Officer of the Customs; we went to Coverack, a smuggling cove, where we expected a vast quantity of smuggled goods had been recently landed; having left our horses at the Cove, we dispersed in different directions to search for smuggled goods; about ten o'clock in the morning of that day, I discovered, in a ploughed field near the village of Trebuthan, sixteen casks, containing brandy and geneva.</p>

             went off to seek for horses or carriages for that purpose; when they went off, I was in possession of the goods, with Richard Lisle and Mr. Veal and Mr. Hodges; but immediately after they were gone I left Mr. Listle in possession of the goods, charging him to take caro of them till we returned; I went towards Coverack to see if we could find any more in the fields and hedges, being about a quarter of a mile from where we had left Lisle in possession of the goods we had seized; I observed eight men coming up from the village of Coverack; at first fight I took them to be the crew of a King's cutter; when I came nearer I found I was mistaken in that conjecture, seeing them all armed.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they armed? - A. They were armed with guns, pistols, swords, and hangers; one man in particular had two pistols; they were every one of them armed with weapons; I stood upon the hedge when they passed quite near me, I could have touched them; on their going up towards the village called Trebuthan, I followed them close behind; on getting near the village, Mr.

             came up also; these eight men went to the first house, and apparently were very anxious to do something; I only heard them enquire for the goods, or something to that purpose, as where is the goods; but it appeared that they did not receive a satisfactory answer; they immediately proceeded to another house, occupied by one Roberts, but I was not near enough to hear what passed; a boy came with them from Roberts's house; and not till then was I certain they were going to rescue the goods; they turned quick round, and went right to the place where I had left Mr. Lisle in possession of the seizure; the boy ran before them; I followed him; they arrived at the place before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who was in the occupation of the field where you had made your seizure? - A. I do not positively know.</p>
               <p>Q. These men went up to Lisle then? - A. I saw them go up to Lisle; before I could get up to the spot each of them had got over the first hedge coming towards me again; they were returning with eight ankers; on coming up with them I told them that what they had got were goods that we had seized; I told them they were doing a very illegal act, and cautioned them against persisting in it; they bid me stand off, saying, the goods are our's, we have hazarded our lives for them already, and we will have them; I directed Lisle immediately to go for our horses; I took possession of the other eight ankers.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first began to expostulate with them, did you tell them what you were? - A. Yes; I told them we were Revenue-officers, and that we had seized the goods for the use of his Majesty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at the time you first spoke to them, know any of them by person? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time when they had got the goods, and had passed you, were they armed in the same manner as they were before? - A. They were all armed; I took possession of the other eight ankers that they had left behind; I observed that the persons that had taken away the eight ankers, were met by another party.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing from whence they came? - A. They came from the neighbourhood of Coverack, but whether from that place or not I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they armed? - A. I was at the distance of three or four hundred yards; I only perceived that there was a second party; they delivered the ankers that they had taken away to the second party; they then returned to the place where I was in possession of the other eight ankers, at the same time, Mr. Thomas came up to me; the smugglers seeing Mr. Thomas come up, made a stand in the field before they got to the place where the goods were laid; they came on, after stopping a bit, towards me, and bid me stand off; I had some of the casks in my possession; they were all armed as they were before, I do not know whether they had the same arms or not; I had concealed two or three of the ankers in the old trench, where they were found; seeing the slings and ends of the cords hang out, they took them out; I expostulated with them in the same manner as at first, telling them the consequence of such an act, and they answered nearly in the same manner; one person in particular said the most, he was a tall man.</p>
               <p>Q. As this was the second time, you had an opportunity of noticing them; did you observe any one of their persons so as to identify them? - A. One I can, he was a short man, and shewed his teeth very much; that was not the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the prisoner at the bar was one of the eight? - A. I cannot say that he was.</p>
               <p>Q. And they took away all the remaining tubs? - A. No, only seven; one part of the end was quite out, it contained brandy; they bid me stand off, saying, the goods were their's, and so on; one of the men had no anker to carry, and he took the arms from the others, guns particularly; then they went off towards Coverack; Mr. Lisle and Mr. Hodges then brought horses into the field, and we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280014"/>followed them; we came up to them, and upon coming up, they appeared to apprehend we intended to attack them; they put down their casks, some on the ground, and some on the hedge, and stood with their arms in their hands; on coming up to them, I told them I hoped they would not fire at us, or injure us, we were not strong enough to cope with them, or to attack them; one of them answered, no, do not meddle with us, we have got the goods, or something to that effect; we immediately went to the village of Coverack; I cannot say that I saw any more of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether the prisoner was one of them, then, or not? - A. No, I cannot say that I can identify the prisoner; I saw some of them at a distance in the village, but I did not go near them, they seemed to be all together; it was near twelve months after that the prisoner was apprehended; I was not present when he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. You it was that chiefly held the conversation with them, while Thomas was by taking notice of them? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an officer of the Customs: I was with Mr. Twentyman, in the parish of St. Keveme, in Cornwall: On the 5th of May, 1799, we seized sixteen casks, ankers; Mr. Twentyman found them in a field near the village of Trebuthan, about three quarters of a mile from the cove of Coverack, I assisted him in taking them out of the trenches; I first tasted one cask, containing geneva; I afterwards tasted one containing brandy, which was staved by Twentyman for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when you first discovered this? - A. About ten in the morning; I went about a mile to get carriages, to convey them to Helstone; I returned in about an hour and a half, more than an hour, I believe; I found Twentyman in the field, with only eight of the ankers; I saw, almost instantly, eight men returning to the field, every one armed, several with two weapons, some had a musket and a pistol, some a musket and a cutlass, some two pistols, and others a pistol and a cutlass, they were every one armed with one, and the major part had two weapons; they came up within about fifteen or twenty yards, and then stopped, they seemed to be consulting together; they hesitated a few minutes, and then came forward; before they came quite up, Mr. Twentyman stove another cask, it was marked brandy, and that I found was brandy; the foremost man of the party that came up, not the prisoner present, said, the goods were their property, that they had ventured their lives for them already, and they would lose their lives before they they would lose the goods, or before we should have them, or words to that effect; they immediately took up seven ankers, and one man that had no cask to carry, took the whole of the muskets of the party; they then went off by the way they came; I was positive that I had seen some of them before; immediately after they were gone with the casks, our horses were brought, by the other three officers, to the side of the field; we purposed going towards Coverack, and mounted our horses immediately; they had not got, I believe, half a quarter of a mile from the village before we overtook them; they had not been out of our sight more than a minute, just while they were turning round the corner of the village; upon seeing us coming, they put down all the casks; and upon our coming up to them, I was the second of our party, I observed one of the eight present a pistol; I called to him not to do any mischief, that we were not going to fight them, for they saw we were not prepared, or something to that effect; they made answer, that it was the best way for us not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, observe any of their persons particularly? - A. I looked at them particularly, every one; I knew almost all of them by person, as sailing in smuggling vessels.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar? - A. The last man of their party I observed to turn his head away before, who must have been the foremost in going off; we passed them in a narrow lane, and left them all to our right-hand; I observed him to turn his face away, upon which I turned my head round to look at him as he turned his face towards me, and as he recovered his position again he looked me full in the face; I looked in his face, and discovered it to be the prisoner at the bar; I told the other officers that I had seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you recollect to have seen him before? - A. Four or five years before; he was in the harbour of Helford, belonging to a sloop; I knew him then by frequenting the public-house where I lodged, in company with a brother of his, called

            ; I said, no, your name is not Teague, your name is Strick, and you are my prisoner; I took him out of that room into a back parlour, and he immediately asked me what is it that I am taken up for; I told him it was for the business that happened last summer, up at Trebuthan, when you rescued the sixteen ankers from us; he then cried, and said, I cannot say but what I was there; I then brought him to Helstone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before that you had seen this man? - A. It might be four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. The time that you had been acquainted with him was about a week? - A. It might be more or less, the vessel laid before the door where I lived and lodged, and he was in the habit of coming in and out with his brother, and slept in the house, I believe; his brother was boatswain of a revenue cutter, lying at Helford, in the Port of Coverack.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the least possible doubt of that man being the same man? - A. Not in the least.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him again the instant that you saw him at the public-house where you took him up? - A. I saw him three or four days before we took him up; he came in in a sloop to the Pier of Coverack, a smuggling sloop belonging to Coverack; I saw him on board the sloop, and on shore; Mr. Twentyman was in company with me; I passed him two or three times, I was there for two or three hours; I told Mr. Twentyman that that was one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take him at that time? - A. We had no authority; Mr. Twentyman had a warrant at Penzance, twenty-five miles off; I desired him to send it to me, and I would apprehend him, which I did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Can you undertake to say, that the prisoner was one of the men that you saw in the field? - A. I was very much agitated in the field, but I was sure the faces of them were familiar to me, and when I saw the prisoner the second time, I was same he was one that I had seen in the field.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I was with the other officers, at Trebuthan, on the 5th of May.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear the evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you agree with them in the story they have told? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner to be one of the men who came up? - A. Yes; I know the prisoner to be one of the men, he had a musket with him or a gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him armed in the field? - A. No, in the village of Trebuthan; the prisoner went to the door of a house to enquire where the smuggled goods were; I heard what was said, I think it was him that spoke, I am sure he was one of the persons that went to the house, I had never seen him before in my life that I know of, I do not recollect to have seen him any more till he was apprehended; I was present when he was apprehended in the village of Coverack, at a public-house; after we had taken him into the back room, he enquired what was the nature of his offence that he was taken for; Mr. Thomas told him it was in consequence of the rescue of some goods the summer before, at Trebuthan; he said, he could not say but he was there; he seemed very much agitated, and burst into tears.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very sure it is the same man? - A. I am clear it is the same man; after we had taken him to Helstone, I was mentioning the circumstance to him, and telling him in what situation I saw him; he acknowledged that he had a gun with him, but it had no lock to it, he said he had nothing at all for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing to say, any more than this, I trust to the Jury for what punishment they chuse, after what they have spoke it is of no use to say any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sufficiently acquainted with the stain of aqua-fortis, to say whether you believe it to be aqua-fortis? - A. I believe it is; Mason then came up, and I delivered the woman prisoner to him; I then went up to the three pair of stairs, which is a garret, Ray being behind me; I found the door locked, by trying the latch; at that instant, I heard the footstep of somebody come across the room inside; the prisoner Dight or Jones opened the door, and I said, ah, master Dight, is it you? then Ray and I were in the room, till we called Mason to come up, and he was to direct Vickery to take care of the woman; Ray and Mason secured him, he made no resistance; I observed the room had got two windows, one looks to the side of the house, and the other to the front; towards the front of that part which comes into Clement's-lane, was a lathe, by the side of the window was an instrument, used for turning the edges of these blanks, and between the windows there was the corner of a room that bulged out into this room, so as to receive the light of both windows, and not be perceived by any body from the window, and in that was this cutting engine, fixed upon a stool, and the stool fixed to the floor; but under the legs of the stool was this soldier's jacket, and this cloth to deaden the found; and close by the cutting engine were these plates and this cecil.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the cecil the same metal as the plates? - A. Yes, it appears to be the same; the cutting engine was fresh with the oil running down the screw, and this cutter fixed in the engine, which, if you compare it, corresponds for cutting out the blanks; here is a quantity of sand paper that I found upon the floor, by the side of the cutting engine; the sand paper is used to rub them; these blanks, one hundred and fifty in number, I found in a cupboard, in the same room where the cutting engine was; in a piece of paper, in the same room, by the side of the cutting engine, were these punches, which appear to be used with a hammer; here is another, which will receive the plate, and may be cut out with a hammer, without the force of a cutting engine; a quantity of file dust, which they save; here are the files, with the appearance of that kind of metal now upon some of them; all that I now produce, except this bit of cloth, were found in that garret; this piece of a flat iron was lying upon the floor, and it then bore a heat, which I presume had had the blanks, with the sand paper rubbed upon it, that is the way they are cleaned, his hands were dirty, as a man's hands would be who had been employed in that way; here are shears and pincers, and other articles, which are used, in other business besides this; I asked the prisoner if he lived there, he said, yes, and paid ten pounds a year for that room and the room underneath, and a little back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room in which you found the woman, a part of that, for which he said he paid ten pounds a year? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. In the room where the woman prisoner was, you found nothing but a bit of cloth? - A. Not at that moment, till I came down again.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs, had not the prisoner his great coat and his hat on as if he was going out? - A. He had his hat on.</p>
               <p>Q. You have described these instruments, I believe, they are all used by brass-workers? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. That sack and jacket was for deadening the found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if a person was at work there, as a brass-founder, it would prevent disturbing the other lodgers in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where was the bed? - A. In the little place behind where the woman was.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an officer belong to Worship-street; I went with Armstrong, on Thursday the 24th of April, to the prisoner's lodgings, Armstrong went up stairs first, and I was immediately after him; he opened the room door up two pair of stairs, and there was the woman prisoner stooping to a tub with some wet clothes in it; we did not stop there, but proceeded immediately to the garret; we found the door locked; we knocked at the door, and the prisoner Dight immediately opened it; we immediately secured him, and behind the door, upon the right, was a lathe fixed; there was some file dust lying fresh about the lathe; on the left-hand, in the corner, was this cutting-engine in the state it is now in, except that it had the cutter in it, it had been fresh at work, for the oil was running down; I saw Armstrong go to a closet and find these blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them, are they of the same colour now that they were then? - A. No; they have got tarnished very much since I searched the room; and over the door, just by the lathe, upon the ledge, were these two pieces of blank copper.</p>

               <p>Q. What are they the size of? - A. For sixpences, and these two blanks for shillings.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280017"/>Q. At the time that you found them, did they appear to have the appearance of being fit for circulation? - A. One of them had, but they are now altered a great deal; there, was one that had been blacked to deaden the whiteness of the metal.</p>
               <p>Q. In their present state, you think they would not pass? - A. No; and in a corner I found this bottle, and at that time there was a drop of 
aquafortis in it, it smelled very strong of the aqua-fortis.</p>


               <p>Q. Are you well acquainted with the smell of aqua-fortis? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in the habit of apprehending many of these kind of people? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else in the room in which you found the man? - A. Not that day; I went again two or three days after, Armstrong having kept the key, he himself locked the door.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. I locked the door, and took the key to the office, I gave it to Ray to go and make a second search.</p>
               <p>Ray. Upon the second search, upon the moving a board behind the skirting board, I found these three blanks, they are a great deal tarnished since that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of them, at that time, such, as in your judgment, would pass in circulation? - A. No, I do not think they would; after the first search, I went down again to the room where we had secured the prisoner, I found nothing there, I saw Armstrong find a rag, which we all smelt, it had the smell of aqua-fortis upon it, it was very much stained, I believe, with aqua-fortis; I did not see any thing else found.</p>
               <p>Q. Could this room be overlooked by the opposite house? - A. No; this was a higher house than the opposite side, and no person could see it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Be so good as tell us what the reward is in this case? - A. Forty pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. For each of the prisoners to be divided between you and your brother officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These blanks have been kept in the same paper since? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said one of them, you think, was in a state fit for circulation, point out which of them it is? - A. This is it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you found them? - A. About a month.</p>
               <p>Q. And do you mean to swear that it was a shilling by which you could have been deceived? - A. Yes, it has changed very much.</p>
               <p>Q. The paper in which these two shillings have been kept is a softer paper than the other? - A. It may be.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you went before the Magistrate to complain of this offence? - A. Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not then state to the Magistrate that you thought they were not in a state fit for circulation? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Nares state that they were not in a state fit for circulation? - A. With respect to this he did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you understand from him what he was, when he took the lodgings? - A. A brass turner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiry of him what branch he was in? - A. Yes, my husband is a printer, and he desired me to ask him, because, perhaps, he might have served him, and he hesitated, and said he worked for two masters, who gave him constant work; he did not tell me at first, at last he be thought himself, in a minute or two, and then said he was in the lamp way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of his work in the lamp way go out of the house? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Upon your oath, did you not ask him the question to get him to contradict himself? - A. No, I never had any reason.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it light, or dark? - A. It was rather light.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see a man's face? - A. Yes; I could see a man's face very plain, and likewise the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that by moon-light? - A. I did not observe whether it was moon-light or not; I unlocked the bed-room door and went into the kitchen, which is up one pair of stairs, and looked out at the window; I saw a man lying upon the ground between two watchmen, that was the prisoner, Williams; I immediately went into the bed-room again, put on my small clothes, and came down into the tap-room; I ran against the bar-door, which I found open, I found the outer door upon the spring-lock; I opened that and went out into the street; I had bolted that door with two bolts, I found the bolts undone, but not the spring-lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you conceive that that door had been opened? - A. I cannot say; I went into the street, and was informed that Williams was one of the thieves; I desired him to be taken to the watch-house, which they did; he said he had lost a shilling, I saw a shilling lay, and some halfpence, and I picked them up and gave them to him myself; I did not go to the watch-house, but went home; there is a door in a gateway under my club-room, I found that door unchained, and unbolted, not even upon the latch, I saw it chined and bolted over night as usual; the door that is at the top of the cellar-stairs had been broke open, the lock was inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that door you think must have been opened from the inside? - A. Yes; (produces the lock); I found the lock forced off, and lying upon the tap-room floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then some person or other, by breaking open this door, got into your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that door locked over night? - A. Yes, it was; and the key in my till in the bed-room; I did not miss any thing; a neighbour brought a light to me, he is a baker, his name is Freeman; there was an iron crow found in the gateway, a dark lantern, and a little bottle, and matches; they were found close upon the spot where the man laid upon his back.</p>

             sworn. - At half past two o'clock on Thursday, the 14th of May, I left the watch-house to go to bed; as I was coming down Water-lane, past Hughes's-court, I saw a man standing at Mr. Williamson's back-door; when I saw him at that hour in the morning, it led me to a suspicion that he had no right to stand there; I rushed in to see what he wanted, and he ran off immediately; I do not know who the man was, he was twenty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280020"/>panes from me, the first time I saw him; when I came to the back-door of Mr. Williamson's house, I put my hand to the door, and the door went in, by that means I discovered a light at my right-hand, I stood upon the threshold of the door; it was a dark-lantern and had a candle in it; I looked round and saw the two prisoners at the bar, and one more; Newman had his hand upon a drawer in the bar, pulling it out; there were three of them in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the two prisoners are the men? - A. I am; I saw Newman take a paper that was tied up, I do not know what it contained; I was looking at them for four or five minutes before I went in, I did not see what he did with the paper; when I saw that, I shut the door in order to keep them in; I asked them what business they had there; Newman told me he would tell me; after he made that reply, he came out of the bar, and when I had an opportunity I struck at him with a stick, I am sure I struck him; and it was but a very short time before he returned the blow, and I received it upon my arm; after I had got the blow, I went back to the door again, and endeavoured to spring the rattle but I could not, they prevented me; they struck at me; at this time we were in the dark, they forcibly opened the door and rushed out; another watchman was coming round upon his beat, and he was pretty near the door when they rushed out, his name is Harrison, he secured the prisoner, Williams; I heard him sing out, I was inside at that time, that he had one of them, and I saw Williams struggling with Harrison; I struck at him with a stick two or three times, to prevent his getting away; as to Newman, I saw no more of him till I saw him a prisoner in Castle-Baynard watch-house, I believe it was about fifteen or twenty minutes afterwards; I was sent for by the constable to see if I knew him, and when I came to the watch-house, as soon as ever I saw him, I told the officer of the night that he was the very man that struck me in the public-house; at that time he was in a gore of blood; I am sure he is the same man that I saw in the bar.</p>

               <p>Williams. He said, at the watch-house, that the man was a big stout man.</p>
               <p>Witness. I said no such thing; I said he was a stouter man than Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. You had only the light of this lantern in the bar, are you sure there was light enough for you to be able to say these were the same persons? - A. Yes; I stood looking at them for some time, and they moved the lantern about round the bar to see what they could find; I saw them very clearly.</p>

Yes, it was quite light; I heard some noise in the house, which made me stop to know what it was, because I knew the family, had been gone to bed some hours; the door was open, and the first man that came out was Williams; we had a long scuffle together, at last I got him down, and there I held him upon his back till I got assistance to take him to the watch-house; in the scuffle he dropped some of his money, which I gave him; I took him to Blackfriars watch-house, and from thence to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure Williams was one of the men that came out? - A. Yes, he came out at the door under the gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it under the gateway that you laid him upon his back? - A. No, that was in the front of the house, in Water-lane; there were two more came out, but who they were I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon before had you seen your money? - A. I paid three hundred and twenty pounds into my banker's, Child's, not half an hour before I went, and when I got to the theatre, I very incautiously pulled out my money and looked at it at the door, and I apprehend the prisoner saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted none of this money had any marks by which you should know it again? - A. No, I believe it to be mine only from the sum, three half-guineas I know I had, and a guinea.</p>

(Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I was going to Drury-lane theatre, and was violently crushed, in consequence of which I drew back, and standing against the farther end of the colonade, Mr. Williams came up and charged me with picking his pocket, says I, sir, I believe you are mistaken, says he, why, here is my money, catching me by the collar; says I, it cannot be my money, and how it came here I do not know; says he, you are endeavouring to hide it, says he, what are you stirring your foot at; says I, sir, I see something lye there, and I suppose you would stir your foot to see what it was; Mr. Cooper came up at the time, and caught me by the collar, and likewise picked up some money; I was given in charge to Mr. Beresford, the officer, and taken to the Brown-hear; that is all I know about the mat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280023"/>ter; I positively deny any thing of the charge alledged against me; I am entirely innocent, and in your hands I trust my cause.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Hemingway. These are my shoes, they were made for a person in Westminster, but they were too small, and I intended to wear them myself; I can swear to them by the cut of them, I cut them myself; and by the binding; if it had been some of the other shoes I could not have sworn to them, because they came out of the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not in the habit of cutting other shoes? - A. The shoes that I cut myself are bespoke shoes.</p>
               <p>How many had you cut in the course of the preceding week? - A. I might have cut twenty, perhaps; sometimes two or three hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that among all the cutters about town, no other man could have cut these shoes? - A. I am positive I cut this pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you positively swear that these are shoes that you have not sold to some other customer? - A. I can, I know the cut so well; it is a very remarkable pair; the moment Mrs. Levy shewed me the shoes, I knew them directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you usually put the name of your customers in the shoes? - A. I do not at all times.</p>

            ; in consequence of what he said, I felt in my pocket, and found I had lost my pocket-book; I had felt it in my pocket in the course of the morning; I cannot speak exactly to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had not taken it out and left it any where? - A. I am certain I had not left it; he desired me to follow him, and he would shew me the parties; I went as far back as Norfolk-street with Bly, and Mr. Lake; Bly looking down the street, saw the two prisoners walking together, about half way down the street, on the right-hand side; we all ran up to them, and just before we got to them, Bly said, come Joe, knowing Davis, upon which they both stopped; I immediately laid hold of Davis, and accused him of picking my pocket; the moment I laid hold of Davis, I perceived my pocket-book at his feet; as I came towards them I kept looking, for I expected it would be dropped, and when he turned round to look me in the face, he dropped it from his left-hand pocket; we took them both to Bow-street; the officer has the pocket-book; they made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. (For Kemp). Q. It might have been two or three hours before this time that you felt for your pocket-book? - A. It possibly might, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Kemp was at some distance from Davis, was he not? - A. No; they were walking together; and when I went down Norfolk-street, and called to them, they both stopped.</p>

             sworn. - I was with Mr. Holland, on the 18th of April; in consequence of information that we received, we followed two men down Norfolk-street, they were walking together; when we got nearly to them, Bly said, come, Joey, I think he added, let us see what you have got; at that instant, I saw the pocket-book drop from Davis's pocket, or the side of his pocket, which Bly immediately picked up, it was a red morocco pocket-book; at the same time. Bly desired I would secure Kemp, which I did; when I found he was an officer, and knew what he was about, I think, Kemp said, he knew nothing at all about it, or something of that kind, and begged I would not collar him; we were rather apprehensive of a rescue, from the gang that were about; we were desired, by Bly, to take care what we were about; we took them to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Kemp protested his innocence, and gave you no molestation in taking him to the office? - A. None.</p>

             sworn. - I live in the Strand: On the 18th of April, between one and two o'clock, I observed the two prisoners; I was sitting with the sash up, being a hot day; I saw a number of people walking, I saw Mr. Holland particularly, being very tall, and Mr. Leake; and immediately behind Mr. Holland was a person, whom I knew to be a notorious pickpocket, who is not taken, which led my attention that way immediately; after him followed the two prisoners together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the two prisoners held conversation together? - A. They appeared to me to be talking together; I was at too great a distance to hear what passed; at the corner of Norfolk-street, the person, that was immediately behind Mr. Holland, passed him and Mr. Leake, and walked close before them to Arundel-street; when they got to Norfolk-street, the two prisoners walked close up to Mr. Holland and Mr. Leake; they had not gone many yards, before I saw Davis stoop, and put his hand into Mr. Holland's left-hand pocket; he then stood upright, and the other prisoner stood on a parallel line with him on the pavement next the houses; Mr. Holland was likewise next the houses, to the best of my recollection; one of the prisoners then stepped off the pavement, and beckoned back the man that had preceded Mr. Holland, and then he turned back, but what became of him I cannot tell; the two prisoners walked down Norfolk-street, the third man followed them down Norfolk-street also; they had got about halfway down, when I saw Mr. Holland, and his friend, and several other persons running, I went after them, and went to Bow-street; my house is directly opposite Norfolk-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You had never seen the person of Kemp before? - A. Neither.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure that he is the man? - A. I know him to be the person, he was never out of my sight till he was taken; he had a drab greatcoat on, over a suit of black.</p>

             sworn. - I am constable of St. John's, Westminster: About half-past one, on Friday the 18th of April, I was walking from Templebar towards Somerset-house; I saw the prisoner, about half a dozen yards from me, and because they should not see me, I stepped off the pavement, that was between Norfolk-street, and Somerset-house; I know Davis perfectly well, and I knew Kemp some years ago; I turned round and watched Davis, and found him very nimble with his fingers, and pressing very hard upon two gentlemen, in blue coats, whom I afterwards discovered to be Mr. Leake and Mr. Holland; Davis was rather the foremost man, Kemp was next the houses, and Davis towards the kirb-stone; I walked on a few yards, and some people being between us, I could not see what they were doing; I then observed Kemp stop, and I got a view of Davis, but slightly, and as I suspected they had picked these two gentlemen's pockets, I made as fast as I could after those two gentlemen; I touched Mr. Holland on the elbow, with a small stick I had in my hand, and asked him if he had lost any thing, he at first said, no; but putting his hand to his pocket, he said, yes, I have lost my pocket-book; then I went with them after the prisoners; I had lost sight of them then for a bit, but I went on pretty fast, till I came to the corner of Norfolk-street; I looked down Norfolk-street, and saw the two prisoners walking together, I pointed them out to Mr. Holland; I then ran down, and said, come, Joe, I believe, I said, hand over; immediately the pocket-book was dropped on the pavement; I heard something fall, which I believe was the report of the book upon the pavement, it had hardly done moving.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not on the pavement before? - A. No, it was not. (Produces the pocket-book.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. When you observed them in the Strand, Kemp was rather behind? - A. Davis certainly was a little distance before him, but a very small distance.</p>
               <p>Holland. The pocket-book that I lost has my hand-writing in it, it cost me six shillings.</p>

On Easter Monday last Mrs. Freeman went out into Fore-street for half a pint of split pease; Mr. Freeman was out at work; she had not been gone out long before I heard a noise; I did not give it a thought, as it was a very windy day, till I heard it again; I was cleaning myself, without a handkerchief; I threw a petticoat over me, and saw the prisoner run out with his apron full of clothes; it was about half past ten o'clock in the morning; I ran out after him without a handkerchief, and with my petticoat in my hand, and the mob went after him; I did brush him, but I could not hold him; as he went along, running, he threw the things into the kennel.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this? - A. In New-court, Ropemaker's-alley, Cripplegate; the prisoner was brought back; I am sure he was the same man; the things were brought back, I did not see them picked up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not said that you never saw me till after I was brought back, two hours after the affair happened? - A. It was not an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man? - A. I am positive of it.</p>

             sworn. - I went out, and locked the outside door; I tried it, and double-locked it; when I came home again I found the things brought back and lying upon the floor; I had left one drawer with the key in it, and every thing was gone out of that drawer; there was another drawer forced open.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get in, do you know? - A. It had been forced open; it was half unlocked, and the rest forced; I lost a pair of shoes, two waistcoats, three pair of breeches, a coat, two gowns, three handkerchiefs, two aprons, a new pair of shoes, and a piece of cloth for a shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you suppose they might be all worth? - A. Four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all in wear, I suppose? - A. Yes; the cloth was new, and the shoes were new; the constable has got the property; when I went out I left my little boy,

             sworn. - I am a box-maker<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280038"/>On the 22d of April, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner with a truss upon his shoulder, and another man by the side of him; from his manner of carrying it, and seeming to be in haste, it gave me a suspicion that it did not belong to him; I followed him to the top of Distaff-lane, the prisoner, and the other man, went into a court called Crown-court, and pitched the load in the court; the prisoner stopped with it, and the other man went away; my father being an officer of that parish, I went and informed him what I had seen; he immediately came and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At nine o'clock at night, I suppose it was about dark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you walk? - A. About twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. On the same side of the way? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the face of the person, you know? - A. No: I could not see his face on account of the truss.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you gone for your father? - A. I suppose, about half a minute; it was only the length of four houses; I never lost sight of the end of the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear, that the person you saw with the truss when you came back with your father, was the same you had left there? - A. I believe it was the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. What coat had he on? - A. A brown coat.</p>

               <p>Q. That is not very remarkable - what stockings had be on? - A. Blue and white.</p>
               <p>Q. That is equally remarkable - what was the colour of the coat that the other man had on? - A. Blue.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was a blue coat? - A. He was on the outside of the prisoner, and being dark, I cannot swear positively it was blue.</p>
               <p>Q. The other man was between you and the person you suppose to be the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently you had a much better opportunity of observing him than the person carrying the truss? - A. I took more notice of the man that carried the truss than I did the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into your father's house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor turn from the court at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk backwards then? - A. My back was to it when I went to call my father.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any doubt, that the person that you saw when you came back with your father, was the same man that you had seen with the truss? - A. Not the least.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, is that the same man? - A. Yes, it is.</p>

             sworn. - I am a painter: On the 22d of April, about a quarter before nine, I went to Crown-court, and I saw a truss lie three or four yards up the court, and the prisoner at the end of the court; I looked at the truss, and took down the direction of it, and by that I found who it belonged to; I took possession of the truss, and have had it ever since; it weighed one hundred and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Watson. This is the truss that I took in on the 22d of April, I know it by the mark S P S, Bristol; it has never been opened.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the contents of it? - A. By the invoice. (The truss was opened, and found to contain linen cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Read.) Did you see this truss packed? - A. I did not; but I can swear to the goods, and I can swear to the marking of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is twenty-seven pounds the value of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney contended that the property was proved not to be in an out-house, but a part of the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Court. I am certainly with you upon that point, for it is only the lower part of the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Dibbin.) Q. How far is Distaff-lane from your house? - A. Between three and four hundred yards; rather less than more.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the butcher come in the first time? - A. The butcher was at the door when I got out of bed; I am not sure that he came in, my husband got out at the foot of the bed, and got into the next room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation between Wilson and your husband? - A. I heard a voice say, here he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband say any thing to you or Wilson before he went into the room? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about constables? - A. Yes; when I asked him to come into bed, and asked him what was the matter, he said, oh, Mary, here are constables coming to take me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass? - A. I do not know, I am sure, I cannot recollect at present; there was something passed between Wilson and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280040"/>him, but I cannot recollect what, just as he was getting out at the foot of the bed; he shut this man, the foreman of the tailor, into the front room with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The name of the foreman was Ledeka.</p>
               <p>Witness. I got out of bed after he went into the front room, and went into the lobby.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you were in a situation to go out upon the stairs? - A. I put nothing on but my gown and one petticoat; when I went into the passage, I saw Wilson, and I believe, this butcher, this man in a butcher's dress.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The butcher's name was Lyne.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they standing? - A. Standing at the front room door; I asked one of them what was the matter? he told me, that he had got a warrant, or an order.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state the purpose of his warrant? - A. To arrest Mr. Bartolomichi from the tailor.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them gave that answer to you? - A. Mr. Wilson; I then told my husband to open the door; he told me he would not; he said, they had shewn me no paper, they have not touched me, nor they dare not break the door: Wilson said, he had better open it, he told him to open the door, he did not want to hurt him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any proposal to your husband about settling the business about which he came? - A. He told him to open the door and dress himself, and go to Mr. Aberer to settle it, and that he need not go to prison; my husband said, he would not, and told them to go away from the door; he repeated many different things, but I cannot recollect them, about telling Wilson to go away; I told him to go and fetch Mr. Aberer, to settle it; something else passed, but I cannot recollect what, but I told him to go and fetch Mr. Aberer and settle it; then he went down the stairs, and the butcher either went with him or before him; then I knocked at the door, and told him they were gone; I told him to come and get his clothes and dress himself; he opened the door, and I gave him in his clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in the room with him? - A. Yes, Ledeka; my husband let him out, and he went away, then he locked the door, and I gave him his clothes; after having dressed himself, he remained in the front room some minutes, this Wilson came up again to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband not go down stairs at all? - A. Not at that time, it was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When Wilson came back, who was with him? - A. At his first coming up to the door, I do not believe there was any one with him; he knocked at the door, and asked it to be opened; when he came up to the door, there were men coming up with him; my husband said, he would not open he door, and if he did not go away, he would make him; Wilson made some answer, but I cannot recollect what it was, so then he frightened Wilson away, or Wilson went away, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did he say or do to frighten Wilson away? - A. He spoke within side of the door, I do not know what he said; then he went down stairs, and my husband opened the door and went down after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Matthews. Q. Did you go down stairs with your husband? - A. Yes, I followed him down to the first floor; I then saw Wilson go out at the door, and my husband driving him out with a short sword; Wilson then went away, and returned the same moment; my husband wanted to shut the door, and Wilson and several other men came in, and drove up stairs after my husband; as I was going up stairs, he said to me, oh, Mary, I shall be murdered; my husband went into the second floor front room, and fastened the door; Wilson was coming up after him, with several other men; Wilson and the other men went up to the garret; they broke open the garret door, and when they could not find him there, they returned down to the second-floor, a man looked through the key-hole of the front room door, and said -</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Were you in the room? - A. No; I was in the lobby, by the back-room door; a man looked through the key-hole, and said, when he saw the door shut, that there was a key on the inside, and it was locked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Matthews. Q. Did they attempt to get in? - A. Yes; a man put a stick against the door, and they broke open the door, the man went into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go in alone? - A. The rest were behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which man it was? - A. No; he said, here he is, the others followed; my husband made answer, and said, here I am, what do you want with me? they rushed in, and I heard the people say, murder him, murder him, knock him down, shoot him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your husband said nothing to them? - A. He made some answer, but what it was I cannot tell; they all scuffled into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say any thing like this - though they had broke the door open, they should not take him? - A. Yes; I think he did say so; I stood by the door of the room; I did not see my husband at that minute, I saw him when he was down, before so many of them got in, I saw him stand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Wilson at that time? - A. Along with them all; they were all together standing in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280041"/>Q. What was their situation, with respect to your husband - were they near him? - A. Yes, they were over him; they had nothing in their hands but sticks, the men all had sticks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had none of them a poker in their hand? - A. That was Wilson that had the poker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the men say any thing at this time? - A. yes, they did; I saw Wilson's arm, I believe it to be Wilson's arm, I cannot swear that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing said by any of them, when your husband was on the floor? - A. They said something, but I cannot recollect it; I then saw the poker fall like by the hand that held it up, I saw it go down; then I heard them say, d - n him; drag him up, they then dragged him out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure, that when you saw the poker go down, your husband was lying upon the floor? - A. Yes; I got out, and I saw them dragging him out; I got out before him at the top of the stairs; my husband asked me for a handkerchief, he was all over blood.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give your husband the handkerchief? - A. No, they took him away.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not give him a handkerchief? - A. Because they said, d-n him, and something - and took him away; I cannot recollect what it was; I asked them they did mean to murder my husband, and I lifted up my hands so, (describing it;) and of them gave me a blow, and called me a name.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the expression they made use of? - A. I think it was, a b - d whore or a b - d b - h, and said, they would serve me so too, and dragged him down by me as I stood, as I held by the banisters; they wiped their hands against the wall as they went by; they then took him out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the poker go down, and your husband lying upon the floor, were you near enough to see whether it hit him? - A. I saw the poker go down, I did not see where it went to.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I keep the Crifpin public-house, in Poland-street, next door but one to Mrs. Mills, on the me side of the way; on the 15th of March, I was ting in the tap-room I heard an noise<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280042"/>in the street; I went out past my window to the house where the deceased lodged.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect Wilson, the prisoner at the bar? - A. No; I cannot swear to the persons of any of them; five or six persons went into the house, I followed them, and when I came up to the one pair of stairs, the window was standing on the stairs; the man pursued up stairs, and went into the garret; I stood at the foot of the garret stairs, by the door of the two pair, and then came down from the garret, and went towards the first floor; in a moment or two after, they returned again up to the second floor; one of the men which came up stairs first, looked through the key-hole, and said, he saw the key in the door inside, he tried the door and it was fast; he said, if you are in there come out; nobody made any answer, but a man behind him, that followed him up stairs, holloaed out, break the door open; he took a stick, pushed the door, and it flew open the first time; he then took the handle of the lock in his hand, he did not go into the room at first, but looked past the door into the room, as if to see if any body was there, and said, d-n you, I don't mind a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man any thing in his hand? - A. He had a stick that he broke the door open with, but nothing else; then the other man came up to him, and they all went in together; I heard one of the men say, shoot him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing to shoot him with? - A. Not any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body throughout the whole, that had either a gun or a pistol? - A. Neither; nothing but sticks; somebody called out, knock him down, and other expressions; I believe the word, murder, was made use of, but I cannot say, I heard a great noise in the room after they got in; I thought it was tables and chairs which they were throwing at the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see? - A. No, I never went into the room; I heard the deceased shriek out, I was then standing at the door; they dragged him out, two men, each had hold of him by the collar; they dragged him out of the room on to the landing-place; the man seemed to hang back, and one of the men said, come along you little b-t; as they were dragging him past me, the deceased, wife was standing by me, two men followed the deceased, one of them, like a butcher, dressed in a frock, with sticks in their hands, said, d-n your eyes, you b-h, we will knock you down too.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom was that addressed? - A. To Mrs. Bartolomichi; they then dragged him down stairs; the blood seemed to come very forcibly from his mouth on the stairs; after they had got him out at the door, I saw them take him towards Oxford-road; I saw them turn the corner of Oxford-road, and I saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. You do not know what passed when they were there before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you stood, on the landing-place, you could not see into the room? - A. No; I could not see into the room where they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Mrs. Bartolomichi stand? - A. Sometimes walking about in the back room, and in and out; she seemed quite distressed, and did not know where she went to, and one time with her hands together.</p>
               <p>Q. The person who made use of that offensive expression to Mrs. Bartolomichi was not the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. How long was it, from the time they broke into the room, till they dragged him out? - A. Not above a minute.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Matthews. I keep the house in which the deceased lived: On the morning of the 15th of March, I heard a noise; I got out of bed, and wrapped a great coat round me, I slept on the dining-room floor; I came out and inquired what was the matter; they said they were come to arrest Mr. Bartolomichi; I then saw Mr. Wilson come running down stairs frightened, I believe from the second floor; then I went up nearly to the second floor landing-place, and I heard the deceased say that he would not be took, that he would kill or be killed, repeatedly; he said, if twenty soldiers were to come they should not take him; then, by that time, Wilson had gone out to get more assistance; I saw Lyne, the butcher, standing at the bottom of the stairs, he seemed very much afraid; there was a man locked in the front room all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that man was? - A. A tailor's foreman; he was, I dare say, half an hour in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a person taken there by the prisoner for the purpose of certifying that he was the man? - A. Yes; Mrs. Bartolomichi went to see if there were any more men in the house; she came back, and said there were no more officers; then Bartolomichi opened the door and came down stairs, with a dagger in his hand.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a dagger was it? - A. About half a yard long, what I saw out of Bartolomichi's hand; then he drove the young man, the butcher, out at the door, with the dagger, pointing it at the street-door; by that time Mr. Wilson was coming back with more assistance; then they went up stairs, Mr. Bartolomichi, and the people after him; I went into my own apartment, and saw no more of it till they brought Mr. Bartolomichi down stairs again; they led him along the passage out at the street-door, and up the street towards Oxford-street; and then I saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The poker was not a poker that any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280043"/>of the persons brought with them? - A. No; it belonged to the room.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore it might have been taken up suddenly by some person, without intention of doing any mischief with it? - A. Yes, (the poker produced); I believe this is the poker.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the dagger as long, or longer, than this poker? - A. Not so long.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the dagger to produce?</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. No, my Lord; unfortunately Mr. Degville, after the Coroner's Inquest, conceiving there was an end of the inquiry, broke it to pieces.</p>
               <p>Court. That was extremely wrong.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He is a foreigner, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Could the deceased have run the butcher through if he had been so inclined? - A. The butcher ran so fast, that I do not think he could.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The butcher was making his way out of the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was drove out by the deceased with a dagger? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, was not the deceased pointing his dagger at the butcher? - A. Towards his shoulder as he went down the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to force him out of that house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the foreman was in the room with the deceased? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After he came out of the room what became of him? - A. He went down the kitchen stairs, I did not see him again.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I keep the White-lion public-house in Oxford-street: On Saturday the 15th of March last. I saw the prisoner come out of Poland-street with other persons; I have known him many years, he is a Sheriff's-officer; there were five or six men leading along a man bleeding very much at the mouth; Wilson left the man to call a coach, there were two coaches on the stand; he called a coachman, but the coachman seeing the bloody man would not turn out of the stand; Wilson went and got into the coach first, the man that was bleeding was laid along the pavement opposite the coach, and Wilson called out to the man, bring the bloody b-r along; the bleeding man was then led up to the step of the coach; he there seemed unable, or unwilling, I cannot say which, to go up into the coach; Wilson said, you bloody b-r, do you want to begin again; do you want any more of your teeth jammed out; the bleeding man cried out, O Lord! O Lord! my arm, you have broke my arm, or you have hurt my arm, I did not hear which he said distinctly; Wilson replied, you bloody thief, I never touched your arm; the man cried, O Lord! and then they shoved him into the coach, the coachman wiped some blood from his mouth first; Wilson said, thank God, I saved you from killing that man; but who it was I did not know; I did not hear the deceased say any thing to that.</p>

             sworn. - I am pot-boy at the King's-arms, in Poland-street: On the 15th of March, I saw the prisoner, that is the man, with two or three more with him; I saw the deceased run Mr. Lyne up to the door with something in his hand, but what it was I do not know; he turned him out, and then the deceased turned quickly in at the door, and four or five men after him, they had very large sticks in their hands; then I hastened up to the door, and stood opposite the door, on the other side of the way; I saw them bring the deceased out, pulling him by the arms, and the collar; then they led the deceased into Oxford-road, and going along Oxford-road, between Poland street and Berwick-street, he was walking with one man on one arm, and one man on the other; Lyne was walking about two yards behind him; Wilson was one that was leading him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you recollect seeing them put the deceased into the coach? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say it is very well I knocked you down, or you would have killed that man? - A. Wilson said it is very well I knocked you down with the poker, or else you would have killed that man, pointing to Lyne.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased say any thing in contradiction to that? - A. He did not; he was crying with the pain in his arm, I believe.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a Hackney-coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on the stand on the 15th of March last, in Oxford-street? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; he was the man that called me, there were three more with him; I observed a man between two more, bleeding about the mouth, he was put into the coach; first of all two men got in, and then the man that was bleeding; I asked the prisoner at the bar what had been the matter; the prisoner told me that the man that was bleeding drew a dagger out of a stick, and he was very near being run through; and he in his own defence, he said, took up a poker, and rammed down his throat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you drive them to? - A. Five of them got in, and told me to drive to the Old-Bailey as quick as I could; I stopped at the debtor's-door, at Newgate, and got out there.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did the bleeding man appear then? - A. He appeared very saint; he was taken into Newgate, and I did not see any more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. When he said this to the deceased, 
did he contradict him? - A. No.</p>


               <p>Court. Unfortunately the deceased knew too much of the law, and too little; he knew that a door could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280044"/>not be broke open for the purpose of arrest; in that he was correct; but he did not know, which is also law, that if an officer got peaceably into the house, he might break open the inner door; he may break open any inner door having once got within the outer door.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am band-master at the Opera-house; the deceased was a dancer at the Opera-house: I visited him at St. Bartholomew's Hospital after he had received the wound, in the evening of the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you, as to his apprehensions of his own life? - A. He said that he had been murdered.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use any other expressions, respecting whether he expected to live or not? - A. He said he was a dead man; he said, he was certain that he would die; that he repeatedly said.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had said that to you, did you enquire of him in what manner the wound happened? - A. I did: he told me that some men came into his apartments in the morning, that they knocked at the door, and he asked them who they were; they told him to open the door, and he would not; they then forced the door open, and he ran into the other room; that they afterwards came, many of them -</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state to you what he did when he came into the other room - did he say any thing respecting a sword? - A. Yes; but that was not till the other people came; he said other people came, and forced into the room, and he then took his sword, and presented it to them to frighten them; they immediately threw chairs and tables at him; in that scuffle one came behind him and pulled him down, while another struck him in the mouth with a poker, and knocked it down his throat, and when he was down, he pulled the poker out with both his hands; that then they dragged him away; he said they had never touched him; I put the question to him, and asked him whether they had presented him a warrant, and he said, no; that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at any other time than the 15th, at which time you first saw him, and the day of his death? - A. I saw him three times: I saw him on the Saturday, on the Tuesday, and on the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, at each of those times, state that he was in apprehension of approaching death? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he relate the circumstances of the case more than once? - A. He did, three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all those accounts, of the circumstances of the case, consistent with what you have now related? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Did he, in the course of what he told you, mention any thing of the preceding circumstances, of having pursued the man down stairs with a dagger? - A. He did not; he only told me he had taken his sword to frighten them away, but that it never touched any one.</p>
               <p>Q. And that he took up this sword upon their coming into the room? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not mention to you that he had used such an expression as this: I will either kill or be killed, I will not be taken? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your conversation, you asked whether they had shewn him a warrant? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Your impression consequently was, that if they had not so done, they were acting illegally? - A. When he told me they had not touched him, I knew he was wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Your idea was, that the touching was not necessary, but that it was necessary that they should shew a warrant? - A. I imagined so.</p>
               <p>Q. His idea was carried to a greater length, he thought it necessary that he must be touched by the officer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon that opinion, you collected from him that he justified the resistance that he made? - A. I should judge so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of seeing the instrument with which he attempted to frighten them? - A. I saw it the first time at the Coroner's Inquest; and I saw it at Mr. Peters's the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Peters belongs to the Hospital? - A. He is the undertaker.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the instrument? - A. I went to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18000528-39-person435">Peters</persName>
             the next morning to speak to him, and to consult how he was to be buried; and in the course of conversation, Mr. Peters took the broken sword, for it was a broken sword, and presented it to me; I looked at it, and said, d-n it, says I, it shall not cause the death of any other man, and broke it into small pieces, and left it in Mrs. Peters's house.</p>

               <p>Q. Of what description was it? - A. It was a broken sword, to which a handle had been affixed.</p>
               <p>Q. And, therefore, much longer than daggers usually are? - A. Very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Nearly the length of that poker? - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was twenty-one inches and a half, I have witnesses to prove it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. That was the day after the Coroner's Inquest? - A. Yes; and I imagined all the business was at an end.</p>

               <p>Q. I need scarce ask, I suppose, whether you meant to suppress any evidence? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were you not the prosecutor? - A. I went with the window to Sir

I do not; I thought, after the verdict of the Coroner, that the business was at an end; it was certainly an instrument that would have killed any man had it been used.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Matthews. I am a pupil of St. Bartholomew's Hospital: I attended on Saturday, the 15th of March, at the usual time, between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether he died of that wound? - A. He most assuredly died in consequence of a wound that he had received under his tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it cause a fever, or gangrene, or what? - A. A mortification, and divided a material artery, which produced an hemorrhage, and mortification took place.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the appearance of the wound? - A. After his death, we found the wound extend five inches on the right side, under his tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the appearance of his lip? - A. He had a wound in the upper lip which penetrated entirely through; the red part of his lip was not injured, but above that there was a hole which penetrated quite through, and two or three of his teeth were knocked out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to state whether a poker could have proceeded to cause that wound, from the aperture in the upper lip? - A. It is impossible for me to speak with certainly upon that, as it has been doubtful, but I should think it could not; if it had been done by one blow, I should have conceived that the red part must have been injured; I believe it to have been a distinct blow, but I cannot say with any certainty; the blow under the tongue was certainly the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. That is an opinion upon which others have differed? - A. There were very few of us that did examine him; none of them examined him so minutely as I did; some have differed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Now I will put it to you, Mr. Gurney, whether there is any evidence which brings the blow home to the prisoner, expect the confession?</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There is not any, except the declaration of the deceased.</p>
               <p>Court. But that declaration does not at all prove who the person was that struck him; there is no evidence of that except the prisoner's own confession, which confession is accompanied by a declaration that he did it by way of self-defence; that confession is his defence, as well as his accusation. Gentlemen, I will now ask you, after what you have heard, whether you think it necessary to proceed any farther.</p>
               <p>The Jury declared themselves not satisfied, and expressed a wish to hear the evidence on the part of the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. My Lord, as your Lordship has called upon me, I think I am bound, in justice to the prisoner, to say, that if my learned Friends prove he acted under a warrant, it will then become a case of justisiable homicide.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. Certainly the warrant should be proved.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I will prove that directly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The attorney for the prosecution informs me that he has seen the warrant; I will not, therefore, insist upon the proof of the warrant, but will admit it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I had like to have been murdered twice by the deceased, once with a poker in his right hand and a knife in his left at the same time; that was the time that I made my escape out of the room, and the deceased at that time locked the door, and kept in the foreman belonging to the plaintiff; then I went to fetch Lyne to my assistance; he went with me; I knocked at the fore room door, and asked if Ledeka was there, but I received no answer; Ledeka will tell you that the deceased held a knife to his breast, and would not let him answer me; then I begged of him to come out quietly; I begged of Mrs. Bartolomichi to prevail on him to come out; I told her I would go down with her to Mr. Degville, and take their joint note for the debt, or I would go with them to the plaintiff; he would not comply with either; I then told him if he would come out and behave like a civil man, I would take his own note for six weeks at my own risk; he then told me he would either murder me or I should murder him, for he would not go to prison; I then told him I could not leave him, I must break the door open; but I thought proper to fetch more assistance, I found him so very violent; I then returned in about five minutes with three others; just as we got within about twenty or thirty yards of the deceased's lodgings, I saw the deceased drive out Lyne with a dagger in his right hand; he put his left hand on to the door-post, and extended his right arm, and made a blow which we were very much afraid was in his shoulder; we then all followed him up stairs, but he was so very quick that we lost fight of him; we searched the back-garret, and he was not there; we then returned to the fore-room of the two pair of stairs, one of the persons with me saw the key on the inside of the door, I concluded that the deceased was in that room, and then put a stick just by the lock and shoved it open; it came open very easy, there was no damage done to the lock; I entered the room first, and Crane immediately after me; the deceased then ran to me with the dagger in his right hand, I made my escape out of the room, and cried murder; he then immediately attacked 
               <persName id="t18000528-39-person438">M. </persName>
            Crane, and made a blow at his breast with a dagger, which he avoided; he was making another blow at him in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280046"/>the breast apparently, I then said hold of the poker, which laid upon the drawers, the same poker which the deceased bad drove me out with, and in that instant I threw it at him, just as the dagger was coming towards Crane's breast; the poker entered just under the nose; at that instant he let the dagger fall which he had in his hand; he pulled out the poker with both his hands, and made a blow at Crane with it, he then immediately ran towards the window, which was open, and certainly would have jumped out if Crane had not caught hold of him and pulled him back; Crane and one or two more laid hold of him, and brought him down stairs instantly, he never fell down at all; and the witnesses will tell you there were no chairs or tables at all moved.</p>

I am foreman to Mr. Aberer, the tailor: My master called me down from the shop to go with the prisoner to arrest Mr. Bartolomichi for debt; my master ordered me to go with him, and I went with him; my master told me that he was a sheriff's officer; I went with him to where Mr. Bartolomichi lodged; the street-door was open; there was a young woman there, and I asked her is Mr. Bartolomichi at home; she said he was; we went up stairs and knocked at the door; he answered, who is there; I told him I came from Mr. Aberer; then he gave me an answer to go to the other room, it was the front room; I went to the front room, I stood just at the door, and the officer, Wilson, stood a little behind me; at the same time Wilson took out his pocket-book and pulled a paper out of the pocket-book; then Mr. Bartolomichi opened the back-door and came out; there is no door from the front-room to the backroom, but they must come out on to the stair-case to go from one room to the other; he came half out upon the stair-case, I told Mr. Wilson, that is your man; Mr. Wilson put his hand upon his shoulder, and said, you are my prisoner; then he returned to his bed-room and he wanted to shut the door, and I put my foot between the door so that he could not shut it; then Wilson went into the bed-room; it was dark; Wilson said, open the shutters; Mr. Bartolomichi jumped into bed again directly, and when Wilson said open the shutters, he jumped out of the bed again and went into the front room; me and Wilson then were after him; he wanted to shut the front-room door, we were so close to him that he could not do it; then he ran up to where stood a table just by the window, and there he took a knife in his hand; he ran to the fire-place and took a poker, and began to swear in a dreadful manner, if he did not leave the room he would murder him; and ran up to Wilson; I said held of him, and said, what are you about; then when I looked round, Wilson was gone out of the room; I let him loose again, and he ran up to the door and locked it, I was locked in; he took the key in his mouth, he had a knife and the poker in his hands; I asked him to let me out, then he took the key out of his mouth, and came up to me with the poker and the knife in his hand, and told me if I was not quiet he would murder me; then I was quiet; then he called out Mary, to his wife, give me my clothes, and give me the dagger; then she came and knocked at the door, and said, there is your clothes; at the same time, when he opened the door to receive the clothes, he put the poker upon a pair of drawers which stands close to the door; he took the clothes and the dagger; he put the dagger upon the table and began to dress himself; when he was dressed, he told me he should jump through the window; I told him he should do no such thing, he would break a leg or an arm; there were curtains in the room and he tied the strings together to let himself down; I told him if he did such things I should make a noise; then there came a knock at the door of the room where we were; that was Wilson; Wilson asked if that man was in there, he meant me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner: I did not know his name.</p>
               <p>Ledeka. Then Mr. Bartolomichi came up to me and told me if I was not quiet he would murder me, and so I was quiet; then Mr. Bartolomichi and Wilson had some talk together before the door was open, but I cannot recollect what; Wilson told him to give him a note, or something.</p>
               <p>Foreman of the jury. It is the with of the Jury not to give the Court any further trouble; they are satisfied.</p>

               <p>The Jury having intimated to the Court that their minds had been biassed and prejudiced against the prisoner, by the reports of the different examinations which had appeared in the public prints, the Court marked, in strong terms, their disapprobation of such reports, and expressed a wish that the printers of such papers should be prosecuted.</p>

               <p>Q. What were these persons in prison for? - A. For desertion; I delivered them at Coventry to a party of the 13th light dragoons, and received back two prisoners from them to convey to the Savoy; they were deserters.</p>
               <p>Q. Having received these two deserters, what did you do? - A. I received the same orders from the adjutant of the 13th light dragoons, to prime and load before them, which we did; the deceased,

             marched in front of the deserters; I was in the rear, and so was the prisoner, in file with me; the deceased ran to the right, up Hart-street; I ran after him; by that time Baxter was behind me; I went several yards, I cannot say how many, I was in a slurry at the time, and cannot say how many yards, it might be eight or nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards might he be before you? - A. He might be between twenty and thirty yards, he gained ground considerably upon me, for I was loaded at the same time; Baxter was behind me, and I did not know what he was about till I saw the man drop in front of me, before I heard the report of the piece; I turned round to see where the report came from, and likewise to see if the other prisoner was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance was Baxter at that time? - A. A considerable distance; he was with the party at the time; I went up to the deceased and found him quite dead.</p>
               <p>Q. What accoutrements had you? - A. We were loaded with our belts and guns, and our knapsacks with necessaries.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you could have secured him by pursuit? - A. Certainly we could not, we were so fatigued, for we had been up three nights watching over them, because we could not get a prison to put them in, and we were afraid of being punished if we lost them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any passages that he could have gone up and escaped? - A. Yes, I believe there was one very near where he dropped, I am not sure, I am not much acquainted with that part; at Dunstable they tried to break out of the cage from us, and we were obliged to alarm the town.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no particular knowledge of the deceased? - A. I never saw him before in my life that I know of.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What would have been the punishment upon you if you had let him escape? - A. It depends upon what the gentlemen of the Court-martial please.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I think, by the articles of war, it is death, or such other punishment as the Court-martial may think fit.</p>
               <p>Witness. I told them, the men, to prime and load every morning, and the deserters told me they knew that part of the duty very well, for they had been upon such duty themselves.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. He knew, therefore, the consequence of his attempting to run away? - A. Certainly; I received a paper with them, which we call a rout, and delivered it to the provost.</p>

               <p>Q. Suppose they had suffered a deserter to escape, what punishment would have been inflicted on them? - A. According to the diseretion of a Courtmartial.</p>
               <p>Q. Can they go so far, by the articles of war, as to punish with death? - A. I believe 
they can.</p>



               <p>Q. What punishment do you recollect to have been inflicted for such an offence? - A. I have known four or five hundred lashes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have been used to receive these certificates? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it quite regular? - A. Not quite; there is a not a bene in that rout which is not in routs in general; the difference is, that these two men had been tried by a Court-martial, and found guilty, and were to be sent to Chatham to serve abroad.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant-major, and three other witnesses, who gave him an excellent character for humanity and good nature.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, or any body in your hearing, recommend it to him to confess? - A. Nothing of the kind passed in my hearing; he said, it was his first offence, that he was induced to do it by the persuasions of a man that had taken away a bag before; I asked him where he was going to take it; he said for sale; he would let me know every particular if I would but promise to forgive him; I told him I would promise him nothing but prosecution; I made no other promise; there was a bag of nails missing that day, to my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Saturday last, a man asked me if I wanted a job; I said, yes; and he took me down this yard, shewed me the job, and told me to carry it over Blackfriars-bridge; upon that, he took the bag of nails and put them upon my back; I had not gone but a very few paces before I was taken into custody; I have served his Majesty five years in the Guards, and was never taken into custody before; I hope your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, will shew me lenity now.</p>

Yes, she did, she refused to go up stairs; she said she was dressing her master's dinner, and she could not go up stairs; I told her we had a warrant to search for a black silk cloak; I told her we could not go without her, because we did not know the box; then we went up stairs with her, she gave Jackson the key before we went up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you the key readily or reluctantly? - A. Very reluctantly; Jackson opened the box and found the cloak, two sheets, and a handkerchief; a servant in the house said, they were her master's.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: On the 18th of April, I had a warrant to search for a black silk cloak; I went to Mr. Crawford's, the prisoner was in the kitchen; I told her I had a warrant to search her box, she refused to go up stairs, but I told her I should not go up without her; I then demanded the key of the box of her; then she wanted me to go up by myself, but I told her she must see what was done; we went up stairs, and she shewed me her box; I opened it, the cloak laid uppermost, and then we returned down stairs, for I had nothing further to search for; she said, she could prove where she bought it, she said she gave six shillings for it; I told her, if she could do that, it would be all very well; upon going down stairs, there was an order from Mrs. Crawford to go back to see if there was any of her property, I went up again.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether, between the time you took the cloak out, and going back again, any thing could have been put into the box? - A. No, the box was locked, and I gave her the key; I had the key from her again, and opened the boxes a second time; the sheets and the cloak were not found in the same box.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether the sheets laid uppermost? - A. I cannot say, there were a great many little things that had belonged to Mrs. Crawford, which she said her mistress had given her, and the servant acknowledged that they had been given her, and they were thrown on one side.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say with respect to the sheets and the handkerchief? - A. I think she said Mrs. Crawford had given her them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the second box looked? - A. Yes; they were all locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Crawford never came to the office? - A. I believe she was lying in at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. The orders you received were from a servant in the house? - A. The orders came out of the room where Mrs. Crawford was lying-in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember which of the servants brought you that order? - A. No, it was not this servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Crawford was in the house? - A. Yes, he was very ill, and is now.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Calf.) Q. Relate, as well as you can, what dispute there had been between you and the prisoner? - A. She said she would punish us for saying that she had got the cloak wrongfully; we had told the coachman that it was his cloak, and he asked for it, and she denied having it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the room at the time the sheets were taken out of the other box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the sheets in the same box as the cloak? - A. No, they were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the sheets at the top of the box? - A. No; there were several things taken out before they came to the sheets; the linen sheet, she said, her mother had given her out of the country, this is the sheet, it is marked H.

             at the Blackhorse at Enfield-highway: I went with him to Mr. Harman's for some sheep; I told him my father had sent me for four or five sheep; he took me to Harman's, and delivered me five small pole ewe sheep; I drove them home to my father's house, one was killed that night, and the other four left grazing in the field; George Robinson and his son came down the next day and claimed them; we killed one that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that skin? - A. - Hung it up in the yard; to the best of my knowledge, it is the sure that was produced here.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those five part of the sheep with respect to which you gave evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This conversation passed in the afternoon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was day-light? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you put the four sheep into the field publicly? - A. Yes; by the road side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What did the prisoner say to you when he delivered you the sheep? - A. He told me to take the sheep home to my father's, and tell him, that when he saw the salesman, on the Friday, or the Monday, then my father and him would agree about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the name of any saleman? - A. No.</p>

             (the younger) sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. My father and I are drovers to Mr. Tingey: On the 10th of March last, Mr. Tingey lost nine little pole ewe sheep, marked over the loins; my father and I went to Enfield-highway on the Wednesday afterwards, to the prisoner's father's house, and from there I went to Mr. Grover's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, in your way to Mr. Grover's house, did you see the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At Mr. Grover's did you find any thing? - A. Yes; the skin of a sheep that was killed, and four alive in the field; I believed them to be the sheep; when I came back to my father's, in my way back I saw the prisoner, he was on horseback, I was in the path, and he was in the road; I asked him whether he knew of any wrong sheep that road; he smiled, and said, no, he did not know of any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that you had lost any? - A. Yes; I told him we had lost nine, I did not tell him where they were lost from; then he went on, and I came on; then I went back to old Mr. Field's house, which is a public-house, and found the sheep.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the skin? - A. Yes; Grover gave me a skin some days after.</p>
               <p>Grover. The skin that I gave to him was the skin of the sheep that I killed; Mr. Spilling the constable has the skin.</p>
               <p>- SPILLING sworn. - I am a constable, (produces the skin); it was delivered to me at Hatton-garden-office by young Robinson; it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Robinson. I cannot swear that this is the same skin.</p>
               <p>Tingey. I believe this to be the skin of one of the sheep that I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never had any more sheep but what I had honestly paid for; I did not know any thing about the sheep before Tuesday morning; I mentioned to Mr. Grover that I had got some sheep at home, and asked him if he wanted any; I told him he might have a score, or half a score, or fifteen, or any number he pleased; finding these sheep came wrong into my drove, and not knowing where they came from, I sent them to Mr. Grover's to be killed, because they were sinking in flesh; the other four I let Mr. Harman have; I told him they came wrong into my drove, I did not know the price, and when I learned the price I would let them know, for they should pay no more than I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280058"/>did; Robinson came down on the Wednesday, and I paid him for the nine sheep; he took fifteen guineas from me for them, one pound fifteen shillings a-piece; he told me they were his property; I told young Grover to tell his father I did not know the price of them, when I found out the owner I would let him know.</p>

             (the elder.) sworn. Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. When these sheep were found out at Grover's did you receive any money for them? - A. Yes, I did; I received three five pound notes, half-a-guinea, and two half-crowns, and I gave him sixpence back, which made fifteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the market price of the sheep when they were lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that been put to the account of Mr. Tingey? - A. I left it at Mr. Tingey's book.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before the man was taken up? - A. Yes, some days.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you that money? - A. William Field.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you authorized to do that by Mr. Tingey? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Tingey know that that stands to his account? - A. Yes; but I took the money on my own account; I was at the loss of the sheep.</p>

I am an unfortunate woman: This young man asked me to take him home with me, I told him I could not; then he took me to a public-house and gave me two glasses of liquor, and then we went together, I asked him what he was going to make me a present of, and he gave me these things to pledge because he had no money;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280059"/>then we went to bed, and laid till seven o'clock; I asked him if he was not going to get up, and he said not yet; then I went out on an errand, and when I came back he was gone; I kept the things a considerable time and he never called for them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker in the Strand: I took in this pair of boots from one of the prisoner; to the best of my belief it was the prisoner Mason, on the 28th of March. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To Knowles.) Had you missed such property as that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Acklem.) Do you recollect what time of the day it was? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Mason is the man? - A. Yes, I had seen him before; I believed him to be a shoemaker from his appearance; I lent him ten shillings upon them.</p>
               <p>Knowles. These boots have my own hand-writing; I know them by the cut, I cut them out myself; they have the name of the gentleman that they were made for in them, and my stamp upon the soles; I made for Colonel Hamilton, of the Royal Waggon Train; they were too small for him, and they were returned.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not sold them afterwards? - A. No, we never sell any thing in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop a part of the dwelling-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that pair of boots? - A. Eleven or twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ailey. Q. The prisoners had worked for you some time? - A. The tall one, Brodrick, I have known ever since he was in the petticoats.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sent these boots to his lodgings to be altered? - A. Not these; there are others in Court that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who delivered your work out in the shop? - A. Myself generally.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mason employed by you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not given directions to Brodrick, your foreman, to send these boots to Mason's house? - A. No such thing; he could not make such a boot if you would give him a million of money.</p>
               <p>Q. But did you not send them to him to alter the seam? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Wood. I am mistaken in the time; I thought it had been in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Q. When they are delivered upon that wharf, they are delivered into your charge, I suppose? - A. Yes; they were left upon the wharf, and the numbers all answered; there were ten of them, from 230 to 240; the one that was lost was No. 240; I received them between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; we missed it on the Saturday, it was taken off the wharf; they were never put into the warehouse.</p>

In the Royal Artillery: On the 13th of March, I accompanied Mrs. James to see her children, and Miss Clark was with us, she is here, Mrs. James is confined to her bed; we went to Mrs. Balam's house at <placeName id="t18000528-67-crimeloc376">Enfield-chace</placeName>

               <p>Court. Q. During the time he lifted up his crape had you an opportunity of observing his face? - A. I cannot be positive to any thing more than his chin; he was not content with what he had got, but said, don't hesitate, I shall be troublesome, or I shall shoot, or something to that effect; I saw your watch, give it me; the ribbon hung out, upon which I gave it him, and he rode away.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured horse was it? - A. I am not positive, I was so intent upon the man, I did not observe the colour of the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your way to town, did you give an alarm at the turnpike-gates? - A. At the desire of the ladies, I desired the postillion to tell every person he met of the robbery, and also at the turnpike-gates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pass through any turnpike-gates? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this person, whoever it was, be with you during this transaction? - A. The transaction could not be more than two or three minutes at the utmost.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280064"/>Q. How long was it before you saw the man now at the bar in custody? - A. It was nearly a month, or, I believe, it might be nearly two months, I saw the prisoner at Bow-street; the man who stopped us was a man about the same height as the prisoner, his hair of the same colour, very dark hair, and a very great resemblance of the chin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. It was two months before you saw the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him without a crape? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what sort of a pistol that man had who robbed you? - A. He had a small brass mounted pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the crape was divided into two pieces or one? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the crape at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose that crape to have been the same? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. James was examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the able to swear to the person of the prisoner? - A. I do not think her evidence was stronger than mine.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live near the gate at Enfield-chase, two of Mr. James's children were at nurse with me: On the 13th of March, Mrs. James came to see her children, with captain Owen and Miss Clark, and left me a little after two by my watch; before they got into the chaise, I saw a gentleman walking his horse; the wheels of the chaise had not got through the gate, when I saw him go up to the post lad, and bid him stop, he said to captain Owen,"Sir, it is of no use your hesitating, but give me your watch immediately, or I will blow your brains out;" then he gave him the watch, and left the chaise and came off towards me; I saw him pull off the crape, and put it into the crown of his hat, and went off by me towards Enfield, and the chaise towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think you had a view of him from the time he put the crape inside his hat? - A. He walked his horse from the gate, and put up his crape into his hat, and then he went off at a great pace; I then saw all his head and face as you see mine now. (Pulling off her bonnet.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and see if you can see the man? - A. Yes; that is the gentleman. (Pointing to the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Q. At this time, had you any body at home with you? - A. None but the two babies.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think you might have a view of his face without any crape over it? - A. A very few minutes; our house is as close to the gate as it can be, it is not further from the gate than that white wall. (Pointing to the side of the Court.)</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did you ever see the same person? - A. Yes, I saw him twice after; I saw him to the best of my knowledge, about three weeks or a months, I was all alone by myself; I saw him after that again, I cannot say how long after, I saw then alone, I saw him both times go through the same gate on horseback; I did not see him again till the day my husband took him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of the horse? - A. The horse that he robbed captain Owen upon, was a little dark chesnut, cropped.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take notice whether, at the other times that you saw him, he was upon the same horse? - A. No, upon a different horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then you knew him again, not by the size or colour, or the circumstance of the horse being cropped, but by his face? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that common a convenient common to ride off, after having committed such an offence as this? - A. There are a number of turnings all manner of ways, to Potter's-bar, and different places; I told my husband of what I had seen directly as he came home.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did your husband take him upon your description? - A. Yes, it was three weeks ago last Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband with you at the time you saw him? - A. No, he came home; after I had seen him, my husband was in view, and the prisoner was in view at the time; I saw him on the day that my husband took him.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q. Had you known the person before the day on which he committed that robbery? - A. No; I said, Balam, there goes the gentleman that robbed captain Owen and my mistress, Mrs. James.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where your son was at that time? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him again, and tell me if you have any doubt whether that is the man? - A. That is the man that robbed captain Owen, and took his watch, and put it in his right-hand waistcoat pocket to my certain knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of his hands did he take the watch with? - A. With his right-hand, and the bridle in his left.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had he any whip? - A. He had a little came tucked into his boot.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was his pistol at that time? - A. In his left hand with the bridle.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280065"/>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where you live is very near the turnpike-gate? - A. It is not the turnpike-gate, it is a gate that opens to the common.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you observed the person twice, between the time of the robbery, and the time of the prisoner being apprehended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no man in the house at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any houses near your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you alarmed your neighbours, and desired them to pursue him? - A. No, I did not; if I had seen any body on horseback come past, I should have alarmed them.</p>
               <p>Q. There are several houses in your neighbourhood? - A. Not close by.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it was a chance whether you might ever see him again, and yet you gave no alarm? - A. I told several people, but he had got by so far, they could not have pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. However, you did not go to your neighbours to give the alarm? - A. No, I have not time to gossip.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you, the second time, alarm your neighbours? - A. All that I have to say is, he is the man that robbed captain Owen.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not put yourself in a passion with the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Have you never heard of a reward of forty pounds? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you expect, or your husband, to get forty pounds if that man is convicted? - A. I do not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know, that your husband will have forty pounds for apprehending him? - A. I have heard gentlemen say so.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you expect it? - A. To be sure, we shall have something, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect to have the forty pounds? - A. Yes, I dare say we shall.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, you have given the same account to day, that you gave at Bow-street, when you were first examined? - A. I dare say I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, if you have given the same account now, that you gave that day? - A. He is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you given the same account? - A. It will be found I have.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am herdsman and common driver to the parish of Edmonton, my business is about the common from morning till night: On the 9th of May, I was coming home from Barnet, and when I got on to the common, my wife held up her finger to me, and beckoned; I touched my horse, and was home in a minute, she clapped her hands together, and said, good God, Joe, here is the highwayman that robbed my mistress, Mrs. James, and Miss Clark, and captain Owen; I said, give me my shoes and my stick, and my bill, and I will pursue him, and take him, please God blesses me; Mr. Franklin was in sight then, and no other man but Mr. Franklin; I pursued him, I in my cart, and Mr. Franklin Jogging along upon his horse; I pursued him nearly a mile, and then I got nigher to him; there was a load of dung coming, and I put with my hat upon my stick, for the men with the dung to stop him, but they did not; I drove down to the gate that parts Enfield-common and Edmonton-common; I then stopped down in my cart, and took up my stick and my bill, and got down out of my cart, and sprung at his horse's bridle, and caught it; I up't with my hand, I told him, he was the man that robbed Mr. James, on the 13th of March, he hesitated a little, and said, it would not do; I told him it should do, it was either him or me, it is either your life or mine; says I, I will take you; he immediately flew from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280066"/>his horse, he went off on the off-side of the horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. By the off-side, do you mean the right-hand side or the left? - A. The off-side is the right-hand side, and the near-side is the left-hand; I was standing on the left-hand side of the horse, he got off from the different side to what you would get up on horseback; Mr. Franklin then flew from the hind part of the horse to make for the Chace, and so did I, caught hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run far? - A. No, we both joined like at the hind part of the horse; I had hold of the shirt of his coat, then we scuffled till we tumbled into a great muddy ditch together, luckily, it was my fortune to be at the top; I squeezed him into the mud; I clapped one hand upon the nape of his neck; and my knee on his loins, and said, where is your pistol, it is in my waistcoat-pocket, he says, I turned him a little on one side, and took the pistol out of his pocket; my son then came up, and I desired him to take hold of one of his hands, and we pulled him out of the ditch together; we then took him into my son's cottage; he said, do not beat me, for I am fairly taken; we got him into the cottage, and he begged some water and a towel to wash himself, he was dirty from being in the ditch; after he had washed himself, and refreshed a little, he made a very great plunge in the house, with a deal of resolution to try to get away to make his escape; then I set at him with a deal of resolution, and down with him in the house, and when he fell down, his hat fell off, and his crape fell over his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not his hat fell off in the ditch? - A. No, his hat fitted on very tight this black thing; there are two pieces of lead, one at each corner of it; I then tied his hands behind him, and put him into a one horse cart that I had at the door; I took him to Mr. Gundry's just by, and from there I took him to Bow-street; my son went with me to London, Mr. Bond examined the pistol at Bow-street, and it was not loaded.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you hear from your wife, of Mrs. James having been robbed? - A. They had been gone with the chaise about ten minutes when I came home, and then my wife told me directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. All that you knew of this man before you took him is what your wife told you? - A. Yes, I had seen him on the Common several times, I opened the gate to him one morning and pulled off my hat, I thought he was a gentleman; I saw him stop a chaise near Mr. Kingston's gate.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no robbery committed that day that you took him? - A. No, nor since.</p>

            , Jun. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am the son of the last witness, I live on Ednonton-common; I saw my father get out of the cart, with his bill in his hand, close to the house where I live; I saw my father go up to the prisoner, that is the man, (points to the prisoner;) when my father laid hold of the prisoner's horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far does your father live from you? - A. About a mile and a half; I heard the prisoner say, it will not do; I heard my father say, if he moved his hand, or offered to put his hand to his body, he would chop it off, then the prisoner flew from his horse, and tried to run away, my father was close after him, he had hold of the flap of his coat, and there was a bit of a boggy place, a ditch, or what you may please to call it, and there the prisoner was taken, and my father got across him, and pinned his head down to the ground, and I came up and assisted, he laid hold of one side of him and I the other; he asked the prisoner where his pops were; he told him it was in his waistcoat-pocket, but not loaded; then we got him upon his legs, and took him into the house where I lived; then my father told me to get a string to tie the prisoner's hands; then the prisoner resisted very much and tried to get away, and the force of us all struggling with the prisoner, burst the door-way open, we tied his hands, and put him into the cart; in the struggle his hat came off, and the crape fell down over his face, we did not examine his pockets; this is the crape, it had two pieces of lead to it; we put him into the cart, he wished to be released, for his hands were tied behind him, and he was in very great agony; we stopped at the Cock, at Bowes-farm, and he called for one shilling's worth of brandy and water; he pulled out some money to pay for it, and said, that is all the money I have got, he had eight or nine shillings and a half-guinea; I said, it was a very bad day for him, and he said, it was a very good day to him, for he was tired of his life; then we brought him to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The post-boy is here, I shall not examine him, but I will call him, if my learned friends chuse to examine him.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - A. I cannot swear that, captain Owen desired me to stop at a house on the left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop at that house? - A. Yes, afterwards, but I went a little way out of the way, because I understood him I was to turn to the left, and I went a little way out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go out of the way? - A. About a quarter of a mile.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you must have known your way back again? - A. Yes; but when the gentleman told me to stop at the house on the left, I thought I should turn to the left.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say it was only a quarter of a mile out of the road, did you not drive three quarters of a mile out of the road? - A. No, not so far as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the direct turnpike road to London after that? - A. Yes, the same way we came.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Who was your guide upon the road? - A. The ladies pointed to me, I did not know the way; I looked back, and when I came to the turning, the ladies pointed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I hardly know how to express myself upon this dreadful occasion; I am a very unfortunate man as well in health as pecuniary circumstances, and it is a very improbable thing that a man like me, who has a very bad rupture at this moment, and which I have had for a number of years, should attempt such an offence as this; I have had the honour of serving in the navy, as a <rs id="t18000528-67-deflabel377" type="occupation">midshipman and captain's clerk</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you observe him all the time he was doing this? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the person that did this? - A. That man that stands there, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him without any crape? - A. I did, and without his hat; I had a view of his face entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any remark upon the horse? - A. Yes; the horse's head, and his eyes, the offside to me was half a wall-eye, and a blaze in the horse's face.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again? - A. The day he was taken, the 9th of May; I do not recollect what day of the week it was; I saw him in the cart in which he was brought to town, about five minutes after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him, or he to you, at that time? - A. No; I attended at Bow-street, and gave my evidence there.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him again, and tell us if you have the least doubt that he is the man? - A. No; I have not the least doubt whatever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. He was in custody when you saw him? - A. Yes; Balam had just taken him.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the horse also at Bow-street? - A. Yes; I rode the horse up.</p>
               <p>Q. The horse you rode up is the same horse that the man was upon? - A. I am certain it is the same that he did the robbery upon.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him in the cart, how happened it that you did not tell any body he was the man that robbed your mistress? - A. I did, to Balam and my master, as soon as he was taken; Mr. Gundry said, we have got the highwayman; I went and looked at him, and said it was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. This man met you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He came up to the coachman first, of course? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he came past the coachman, and up as far as the carriage, before he put the crape over his face? - A. He did not put the crape on at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the coachman say he could not see his face for the crape? - A. Yes; he held his hat so, while he came past the coachman, trying to put the crape on.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he never had the crape on at all? - A. No, it hung down his back; the wind blew it over his head, and it fell down his back.</p>
               <p>Q. All this the coachman must have seen as well as you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a chariot, is it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that chariot standing still? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are equally positive as to the horse? - A. More so of the man than of the horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He was by the side of the carriage when he was robbing your mistress? - A. Yes; his face was towards her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was behind the coachman? - A. Yes, with his horse's head straight to the carriage-door.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you see any fire-arms? - A. He did not shew any fire-arms at all.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live very near Mr. Balam's house: The day that Mrs. Gundry was robbed, I was driving my cows upon the common, a man on horseback overtook me, and asked me what those two women were, in that field; I told him they were picking up some sticks; there was a man went into the field, and he asked me what he was going to do; I told him I thought he was going to take the sticks from the women; and he said, a son of a b-h, if I was there I would well lick him; he asked me if I had never been there; and I told him I never had; and he said, if I was you, I would fetch all that wood away by night; I said, Sir, you want to get us hang'd, don't you; and he replied, no, d-n hanging, they cannot hang you; and then I called to the two women coming across the field to come to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this conversation take up? - A. He stopped with me near a quarter of an hour; he went on with his horse towards Edmonton-Common; I saw him go through the gate near Balam's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was Mr. Kingston's house? - A. Very near; close by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you any questions about Mr. Kingston? - A. Yes; he asked me if that family were then here; I told him, no, they were not here now; they were mostly in town, but came down backwards and forwards; then he rode towards Edmonton-Common; I had not got into my house before the news came that Mrs. Gundry was robbed!</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again? - A. The same man rode by me that very day that he was taken by Balam.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. I really think that is the man; I am almost positive it is the man.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he dressed? - A. In a brown loose coat; he had boots on at the same time.</p>

Joe, here is the man that robbed my mistress, Mrs. James, and Miss Clark, and Captain Owen; I bid her give me my shoes, my stick and my bill; I said, I will pursue him please God blesses me, and take him; the prisoner was then in sight; I pursued him in my cart and the prisoner jogged on upon his horse, till I came to the other side of Mr. Gundry's, nearly a mile, then I got higher; as I got on, he was never out of my fight, I drove down to the gate that parts Edmonton-Common and Enfield-Common, I took up my stick, and my bill, and got out of my cart; I sprung at the prisoner's bridle, and caught it; I up'd with my bill, and told him he was the man that robbed Mrs. James, on the 13th of March; he hesitated a little, and said, it will not do; I told him it should do, it was either him or me, either your life or mine, I will take you; he flew immediately from his horse, he went off on the off-side of the horse, that is on the right-hand side, a different side from that on which a man would get up; the prisoner flew from the hind quarter of the horse to make for the Chace, and so did I; we both joined like, at the hind part of the horse, I had got hold of the skirt of his coat; then we skuffled till we tumbled into a muddy ditch together; I was quickly at the top, and squeezed him into the mud; I clapped one hand upon the nape of his neck, and my knee upon his loins, and said, where is your pistol; he said, it was in his waistcoat-pocket; I turned him on one side, and took the pistol out of his pocket; then my son came up, and I begged of him to lay hold of one of his hands to keep his hands from his side; we took him out of the ditch, and took him into my son's cottage; he had some water to wash himself, and then he made a very great plunge in the house, with a deal of resolution, to try to get away; then I set at him with resolution, and down'd with him in the house; when he fell down, his hat fell off, and a crape fell over his face; the hat did not fall off in the ditch, for it fitted on very tight; this black thing, that crape, has two pieces of lead, one at each end; I tied his hands behind him, and put him into a one horse cart that I had at the door; I took him to Mr. Gundry's, and then to Bow-street, my son went with me to London; Mr. Bond examined the pistol at Bow-street, and it was not loaded; I heard of Mrs. James being robbed about ten minutes after I came home. In cross examination, he said he heard of no robbery the day he was taken.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Witness.) Q. Is what I have read, true? - A. It is all true.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing that you would add to it, or take from it? - A. I saw him before he robbed Mrs. James, I thought he had been some gentleman, and I let him through the gate; I knew him again when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you see Mr. Gundry, or his footman, after you had taken him? - A. Yes; as I was taking him to town, I saw Mr. Gundry Mrs. Gundry, and the footman; the footman said, in the hearing of the prisoner, that that was the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280071"/>Q. Did he make any answer to that? - A. He said, if we knew who he was, and the circumstances he had been in, we should pity his case; Mr. Gundry made answer, and said, no, not in these matters, these matters are terrifying.</p>

            ; I live on Edmonton-Common: I saw my father get out of his cart, with a bill in his hand, and go towards the prisoner; I heard the prisoner say it would not do; I heard my father say, if he moved his hand he would chop it off; then the prisoner flew from his horse, and tried to run away; my father was close after him, he had hold of him at the time, in a boggy place, or ditch; my father got across him, pinned him down, and I came up and assisted; he laid hold of him on one side, and I on the other; he asked the prisoner where his pop was; he said, in his waistcoat-pocket, but not loaded; we took him into the house, and then my father told me to get a string to tie his hands; he resisted very much, and tried to get away, and the force of us all three struggling burst the door way open; we tied his hands, and put him into the cart; in the struggle his hat came off, and the crape fell down over his face; we did not examine his pockets; the crape had leads to it; we put him into the cart; he wished to be released, for his hands were tied behind him, and he was in very great agony; after that we stopped and had some brandy and water; I told him it was a bad day for him; and he said it was a very good day to him, for he was tired of his life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, the day that I was apprehended by Mr. Balam, and when I hired the horse, I told Mr. Watson I was going to South-Mims, which is but a very little distance from where I was, I have an uncle lives there that I meant to have called upon, that was my reason for going that road; when I was taken, I was very glad it had frustrated my intention in a thing that I never was guilty of; and as to the day that they attribute the robbery to me, I was at Mr. Castell's in the morning, about half past eleven o'clock, and I only went to the other end of the town to see my poor mother, who is bed-ridden; I staid with her about an hour, or an hour and a half, and then I took a walk round and came to Mr. Castell's again; that I declare is the truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- CHAMPANTE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. You have heard Mr. Watson examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the horse? - A. I cannot swear to the horse; I hired a horse of him on the 13th of April; I rode him a circuitous course by Swaffham; on the 27th I was indisposed; I remained at Swaffham till the 4th of May, and then I sent the horse to town by the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. That waggon would arrive in town on the 7th? - </p>
               <p>Court. I am satisfied that the horse that he had, when he was taken, was not the horse upon which the man who committed the robbery rode.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. You say I swore at you; what words did I make use of? - A. A d-'d puppy, or a d-'d scoundrel, I do not know which.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I do not know any thing of him at all; I have not the least idea of his countenance.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not give him orders then to request ten guineas, and a two-pound and a one-pound note? - A. Nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Stewart.) Do you know when he was apprehended? - A. A fortnight ago last Saturday; he was detained by another baker attempting the same again; I saw him in Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court, and the decision of the Jury; I have a wife and three children who reside thirty miles in the country, and my friends are all there; I did not expect my trial to come on so soon.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable of the city of London: On Thursday, the 1st of May, I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of the Old Change in Cheapside, with a box; I observed the box and I observed him; I saw it very loosely corded, and the prisoner rather in a hurry; I looked and observed no direction upon the box at all; he was looking about him, and during that time a coach get off the box the kirb; before the coachman could get off the box the prisoner opened the door; he put the box in, and the coachman shut the door; he ordered the coachman to drive to Chesterfield-street, Marybone; I then went up to the door, and looked steadfastly at the prisoner; he seemed to be very much confused; the coach drove off into Newgate-street, opposite Bagnio-court; I saw him get off the seat; he told the coachman to draw up; upon that the coachman drew up on the off side; I then ran round the horses' heads, and before I had got to the coach-door he had opened it, and was going to get out; I immediately stopped him, and shoved him back into the coach; I then got into the coach; he asked me what I meant by that; I then told him I had a suspicion that that box was not honestly come by; I asked him if it was his own property; he said, no; I asked him whose it was, he said it belonged to a gentleman's servant at the other end of the town; that he had left it with him, and desired that he would take it to him; and not being satisfied in my own mind, I ordered the coachman to turn round and go to the Compter; the box was in the coach; I took him to the Compter; I there asked him for the key; he said there was no key, it was not locked; I asked him if he had any objection to my opening it; he said he had not; I opened the box, and found a bag containing a quantity of raw coffee; I took him before Alderman Newnham the next morning, and he remanded him till the Wednesday following; the bag was kept in the Alderman's room during that time, in the box; and it was advertised on the Wednesday; I saw the same box again, I sealed it up on the 1st of May; Mr. Cornish attended, and Mr. Brown, his clerk; they saw the bag, and he was fully committed; the bag and box were delivered to me, and I sealed it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The first time you saw the prisoner was in the Old Change? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And because the man was in a hurry, going about his business, you took him to be a rogue, and stopped him? - A. So it turned out; I had some suspicions about it; I am a little judge of these things.</p>
               <p>Q. The box you spoke of had no directions upon it? - A. No. (Produces the property.)</p>
               <p>- BROWN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I have been clerk to Mr. Cornish between nine and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280074"/>ten years; the prisoner was labourer to Mr. Cornish, and had access to all parts of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on the 1st of May, miss any coffee? - A. The 1st of May was a holiday.</p>
               <p>Q. The day before? - A. I cannot say; there had frequently been coffee missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bag? - A. The bag is inside out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had better empty the coffee out.(The coffee was emptied out.) Do you see any mark there by which you can swear to it? - A. It is one of the bags that has been in the warehouse, and has been lodged there with coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. That is one of the bags that has been intrusted to Mr. Cornish's care? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. By what mark do you swear to this bag? - A. By the shipmark, E B, 250.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other mark? - A. Yes; an original mark of S H.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the original mark? - A. It is a plantation-mark; the other is the ship's name, and the captain's name.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it every bag that comes from the plantation has the same mark? - A. I look upon it not; it may.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it is the custom of this plantation to mark with S H, or not? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the ship's mark - is not every bag brought by that ship marked with the same mark? - A. It ought.</p>
               <p>Q. How many does a ship bring? - A. Sometimes a ship does not bring more than ten, and sometimes five thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. If the ship comes over in 1798 or 1799, all the bags will be marked with the same mark? - A. Yes, if the ship's name and the captain's name is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether this bag came over in 1798 or 1799? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear to this bag being in the warehouses any time in April last? - A. Not without looking at the book; that bag might have been out of our warehouse six months ago; but still it has been the property of Mr. Cornish.</p>
               <p>Q. The business of Mr. Cornish, as a warehouseman, is this, that when coffee is landed, it is deposited in that warehouse for a certain time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what period does it leave the warehouse, when it is sold to the grocer? - A. Yes; or being delivered for exportation.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that that bag was in Mr. Cornish's warehouse at any period of the year 1800? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was in Mr. Cornish's warehouse in any part of 1799? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath at what time? - A. I cannot exactly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see it in the warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did it first come in? - A. About a year and a half ago.</p>


               <p>Q. Will you swear that it was not delivered? - A. If it was delivered property it must have been delivered for exportation, for it was prize coffee that was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that that bag was not delivered out of Mr. Cornish's warehouse last year? - A. I look upon that bag to be a bag that has been started, and put into casks; I can tell if I refer to my book.</p>
               <p>Q. Refer to your book then. (Produces his book.) Is that your day-book or your ledger? - A. It is my weighing-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these entries made from the weighings themselves? - A. After I weigh them I put them upon pieces of paper, and then copy them into the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are those pieces of paper? - A. Delivered to the broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Those pieces of paper then are the originals? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. This book is only a copy from those pieces of paper? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then it is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. You can make it evidence if you chuse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. To shew your Lordship I am not afraid of the contents, I will examine to the book:</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell me what is that book? - A. The weighing-book.</p>
               <p>Q. According to this book, at what time was that bag emptied? - A. I cannot tell from that book.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time does it appear by that book that it was weighed off? - A. The 14th or 15th of March, 1799.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at the time it was weighed off, emptied? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that book afford you any further information upon the subject? - A. It does not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then can you now tell me if that bag was in Mr. Cornish's possession in December last? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. In November? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In October? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. How long it has been out of Mr. Cornish's possession you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me leave to ask whether bags that have been in Mr. Cornish's possession do not find their way on board ships and on board lighters? - A. Yes, for the purpose of mending other bags; the prisoner himself has taken bags from the warehouse for that purpose, by my order.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the bags at any time become your perqui<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280075"/>site? - A. No, unless I purchased any for my own use.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear positively that you never purchased that identical bag? - A. I am certain I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are bags never left at the public-house, the Friars, near the warehouse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are bags of this sort ever sent out of the warehouse after they become Mr. Cornish's property in overtakers? - A. Yes, but they have a private mark put upon them; the mark of those packages which have been started.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Has this bag that mark? - A. No, it has no mark but the original mark.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark upon that bag which denotes it ever to have been the property of Mr. Cornish? - A. There is not.</p>

               <p>Q. What ship did that come by? - A. The Eagle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all the coffee which came by that ship come into the possession of Mr. Cornish? - A. Some of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the ship contain? - A. To the best of my recollection sixty hogsheads, and about five hundred bags came to our warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear there were no other bags that came in that ship that went to some other warehouse with that mark upon it? - A. I am almost sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible that you can know? - A. It is very seldom that it goes to two different persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know how many of those five hundred bags you had delivered out of your warehouse before the end of the last year? - A. I do not think there were any remaining at that time; this identical bag I can remember being started by the number; I only know that from my book.</p>
               <p>Q. Shew me where it appears in the book? - A. I can shew it by a memorandum from the day-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the day-book here? - A. No; it was started on the 15th of March, 1799.</p>
               <p>Q. And when that bag went out of the warehouse after, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never know an instance of a bag going out of your warehouse fairly, without a mark upon it? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they never given to the Custom-house officers to make aprons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor to the Excise officers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never given them yourself for that purpose? - A. I cannot recollect any such thing having been at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you, that this bag you know from the circumstance of its being a part of a parcel of eighty that were started? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had gone out of your warehouse then, would it have gone fairly? - A. It could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it any such private mark as it would have, if it was to get to an overtaker? - A. It has no private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. If bags were given, would they be given with raw coffee in it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that coffee the same sort that you had in your warehouses in April and May last? - A. I cannot swear to the coffee.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The first was a holiday, on every holiday we leave the doors open; on the 1st of May I went out, and took a pint of porter; I met with a person that had this load; when I have nothing to do, I do any thing for any body that will employ me; I met with a person who asked me to take this box in a coach to Chesterfield-street, Marybone, and having nothing to do, I took it.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a Custom-house Officer; I had the care of Mr. Cornish's warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Under what locks are the warehouses kept? - A. The Custom-house, the Excise, and Mr. Cornish's locks.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it easy to pick those locks? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was taken on the 1st of May, were you there the day before he was taken up? - A. If the warehouse was open I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known any bag which had contained coffee to be sold? - A. Mr. Cornish's clerk frequently buys them for his use, or for overtakers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known an instance of a bag being given? - A. As he buys many bags, I have myself asked him for a bag, and he has let me have it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of a bag of that sort? - A. I do not know, I suppose about three-pence or four-pence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. It is not an easy thing to pick Custom-house locks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But it might be easy, perhaps, for any body to take coffee before they were locked up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bag - is that a bag that was ever given to you, by Brown? - A. That I am sure I could not swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it any mark upon it, that it would have, if it was given for an overtaker? - A. It has the import mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Is any private mark put upon it by Mr. Cornish? - A. Not that I know of; it has the mark of the ship, and the lot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. There is no mark belonging to Mr. Cornish? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If a bag was given to you, would it have any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280076"/>more marks upon it, than there is upon that bag? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it possible for any thing to be stolen out of the warehouses while you are upon your duty? - A. It may be.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for a man to take a large sack of coffee out without your observing it? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you or not, know whether bags are frequently given away by persons belonging to the warehouse? - A. Certainly they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a public-house called the Friars? - A. Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if Brown has ever left bags at that public-house? - A. I cannot say; I have had bags given me myself to make aprons of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Though a diligent officer, you did not observe a man go out with a bag of coffee? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But a servant in the house might have done so, without your knowing it? - A. We always rub the men down.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a Custom-house officer; I survey the warehouses of Mr. Cornish; there is always one officer in the warehouse continually; when we go, we lock it up with three locks.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you at all be surprised to hear that a man had escaped with sixty pounds weight of coffee in his breeches-pocket? - A. He could not carry one pound without being discovered.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for the prisoner then to have carried out that quantity of coffee without being derected? - A. Impossible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you at the warehouse the day before the 1st of May? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that, recollect yourself? - A. Every day the warehouse has been open I have been there.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, were you there upon the 30th of April? - A. I cannot rightly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the 30th of April, if you were not there, any body might have taken out a bag of coffee? - A. But the locks are always locked when we go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear, that on that day the warehouses were locked with locks upon them, and that you saw it? - A. We always six the locks when we go away.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am an Excise-Officer; for the last fourteen months, I have not been absent a day from these warehouses; the prisoner at the bar worked in the warehouses; we always rub down the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for any man to carry out sixty pounds of coffee without being discovered? - A. I should think not five.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner generally dressed? - A. In a short jacket, with an apron before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known bags given away? - A. Yes; the clerk was kind enough to make me a present of one, about a twelvemonth ago to make an apron, and since that, I made a request of another, and he let me have it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did he give you any coffee at the same time? - A. No, I did not ask him that question.</p>
               <p>Q. You rub down the men, you tell us? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 30th of April, 29th, or 28th, did you rub down, or make any enquiry of the prisoner, with respect to any thing he took out of the warehouse? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called nine witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Tipper.) Q. Was the bag inside out when you took it from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the mark could not be seen? - A. Yes; it was exactly in the same state in which I produced it here in the box.</p>

               <p>Penn. This guinea I can speak to, and I believe the other three to be mine.</p>

On the 6th of April, I was discharged from the Warwickshire Fencible Cavalry, at Coventry; I received seventy-one days arrears, fourpence halfpenny a day, one pound six and seven-pence halfpenny; then I received fourteen days pay, at one and three-pence a day, seventeen and sixpence, and thirteen shillings for doing a serjeant's horse, and I sold my bridle and saddlebags, and horse-cloth, and a pair of buck-skin breeches, two pair of black gaters, and a pair of trowsers to a serjeant, I got one pound eleven and sixpence for them; I was discharged, and did not know how to carry them home; on the 16th of April, I inlisted in the Royal Waggon Train, and got two guineas bounty, then I went upon a recruiting party for the Plymouth division, and got a recruit, and I had two guineas for him; then I was ordered to Birmingham, and from there to Nottingham; then I was ordered to Hertford, and from there I came to this house; I was billetted there, and was very ill, being wet and tired, and I went to bed, the landlord dried my jacket for me, and brought it up to the bed to me, and then I started for Staines.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you with him at the time? - A. No, I was at Blackwall; I have known the prisoner between six and seven years; I served five years in the same troop with him, in the Warwick Light Dragoons, he was discharged when the regiment was broke up, and then he entered into the Royal Waggon Train, in the same troop that I serve in now, and he had two guineas bounty; I never heard of any thing amiss in him.</p>

               <p>Corbet. He said he could not see very well to swear to it, it was dark, it was near ten o'clock at night when the man was committed; he said, his father had sent it him, and that he had sold his watch.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am engaged in the mill business with my brother: I went with my brother, in consequence of Bryan's information, to the stable; we had not waited in the stable above ten minutes before I saw the door open, and two men enter, who they were I did not know, being at the furthermost corner of the stable I could not see then, but I heard one of them get into the lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were two men? - A. I saw them both come into the stable; I had seen the sack in the hay-lost, Bryan shewed it to me; it contained about five pecks of flour.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the weight of five pecks of flour? - A. About seventy pounds; I heard them whisper, and then I stooped down behind the horse to conceal myself; about a minute after that, I saw somebody go out at the door, and shut it, but I supposed there was only one, upon which I did not immediately get out of the stable, but made up towards the door; when I got to the door, I whispered to my brother, but he was not there; I then got out at the window, but before I got out, I heard an holloa, which I supposed was my brother, as a signal that they were that way; I then jumped out at the window, and before I had got ten yards, I saw Warren running, he was then about ten yards from me; I called to him as loud as I could and told him, if he did not stop I would shoot him; and, as he did not stop, I fired a pistol, thinking to frighten him; he ran about twenty yards after that, and then I collared him, and brought him to Bryan's house; Sharp was in custody at Bryan's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any account of himself? - A. I never heard him speak a word; we delivered them both over to Bussey, a constable; we could not find the sack afterwards; Agar absconded.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Agar you have not been able to find? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no observation upon the sack? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What its contents were you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How are your sacks marked? - A. What we have bought since we began partnership are marked J. and I. Surrey; before the partnership J. Surrey.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Those sacks that were marked only J. Surrey, do you use them in your partnership? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Whether this sack had either J. Surrey, or J. and I. Surrey, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Bryan.) Q. How was this sack marked? - A. J. Surrey; it was one of the old sacks used before the partnership.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Is it not very common for millers to lend their sacks to other <rs id="t18000528-76-viclabel431" type="occupation">miller</rs>

               <p>Mr. Simpson. This is Mr. Pitcairn's great coat; he desired it to be left with me, I had worn it one day, it rained and I slipped it on; I know it to be his coat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought the coat of a Jew, and gave one shilling and sixpence for it; I am totally innocent of the robbery.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you buy it for yourself? - A. No; I bought it for one of the men, of the name of Robertson, with my own money, till the ship was paid, and then he would have paid me again; when I got to the Dundee-arms, the boat was not ready, and we had a pot of porter, and some bread and cheese and onions; the bundle was on my left-hand side, and Davis sat on my left; my two sailors went out first, and the prisoner took the bundle off the table; when we came out, instead of his turning to the right, to go towards the boat, he went up the alley, and was off like a shot, I could not overtake him, and I turned back, and went down to Gravesend with the men; I walked it up to town the next day, and as I was coming up the hill from Dartford, who should I meet but Davis; I immediately collared him, and said, you d-d rascal, you robbed me last night, now I will take you into custody; he up'd with his fist, and gave me a shove, and ran away; he broke out of the road into the fields, and I never saw any more of him till Friday the 2d of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw him at the Hercules, in Leadenhall-street, and I ran after him; he took down a gate-way, and there I caught him, and he was taken before the Lord-Mayor, and committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I met with that man at Dartford, he said, why did not you ship with the other men; and I said, I should be a d-d fool to let him ship me, for him to get three guineas; if I shipped myself, I should have it myself; he is a crimp.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Thorngate.) What is your profit upon shipping men? - A. A guinea a man; if the men take their own crimpage they get two guineas, if not they get three.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he or you made her any promise? - A. No; I told him not, and I was present the whole time; she said she hoped he would not hurt her, it was the first time, and she would tell me where all the property was.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pressman. The same afternoon that she was apprehended I went with her to her lodgings, and the first thing that I claimed was this handkerchief, marked M B; she denied it, and said her sister had given her it; this muslin gown, when it was lost, was in a petticoat; but I cannot say positively as to any of the things, that they were in our house, only the ladies said they were; I have had things<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280085"/>with these marks a great many times, for these ten years; the prisoner owned to this handkerchief, marked M B; and to the muslin spotted gown, and begged for mercy.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Foster: I was gathering in my pots between nine and eleven o'clock; I took away from one house one quart and two pints; I put them down upon the steps of that house, and ran across the way after the newspaper to carry to another house on the same side of the way, and when I came back again the pots were gone off the step; I saw the prisoner and a little boy with her; I saw him pulling her cloak over the pots; upon that I took hold of her and secured her; she immediately let fall one quart and two pint pots; I took her and the pots across, over to my master; the prisoner and the pots were delivered to the constable.(The constable produced the pots, which were deposed to by Foster.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My little boy picked them up, and brought them to me; he used to play with a pot-boy; he brought the pots, and he said they are Jem's pots; I immediately said, you little villain, how dare you touch them, and I took them out of his hand at the moment that this man came up.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Harrison.) Had she a child with her? - A. Yes; a boy of about seven years of age; he was pulling the cloak over the pots.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the pots upon the child at all? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My little boy was three weeks in the House of Correction, and when he was had before the Magistrate again, the boy was discharged.</p>
               <p>Constable. Mr. Kinnaird sent him there, to see the event of the mother's trial, that he might be sent to the Philanthropic Society.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else? - A. He did not; I let him go, and kept the tobacco; I locked it up, I have had it ever since; (produces it;) the prisoner came to his work the next day; as soon as he came to work the next day I sent for an officer to take him into custody; the officer came, and I went with the officer down the warehouse, and found he had made his escape through the files; I saw no more of him till the Wednesday in Easter week, the 16th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. He made his escape in September? - A. Yes; my superior officer ordered me to go to Lambeth-street Office, there I saw the prisoner; he was committed for trial; I believe he had been at work previous to that time but two days; it is the same sort of tobacco that is in the warehouses.</p>

             KING sworn. - Examined by Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280086"/>Knapp. I am clerk to Mr. Litchfield, Solicitor for the Customs. (Reads the names of the Commissioners from the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are those the names of the commissioners? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Lucas demanded a shilling of me, and said I should not work there long if I did not give it him; the next day he asked me for a shilling again; some time after that I met him upon London-bridge, and my wife was with me; he asked me where I was going, and I told him I was going to work in the Borough; and he told me I was very foolish not to give him the shilling, for I might have staid there till now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Lucas.) Q. Is there a word of truth in any thing he has said? - A. Not the least; it is as false as there is a God in heaven.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He says he met with you upon London-bridge? - A. I never saw him from the time he made his escape till I saw him before the Magistrate at Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it that you let the man go when you found the property about him? - A. Years back it was a customary thing to take the tobacco from the men, and let them go; Government did not think it worth their while to prosecute, but carrying things on to such a pitch in taking the tobacco, Government began to be more severe, and thought proper to prosecute them; I did not know that till after the man was gone, when one Mr. Kelly, who is warehouse-keeper to the merchants, told me I had done wrong in not detaining him.</p>
               <p>Mr. King. With respect to this warehouse, there has been no prosecution for stealing tobacco since Mr. Litchfield has been Solicitor for the Customs.</p>

             sworn. - All I have got to say, is, that I nursed the prisoner's wife during the time that this transaction transpired, and while I was there they were very much distrest for money, and he left his work and went to work over London-bridge, at Mr. Mackenzie's; he is a sawyer by trade; and being short of money he took me one morning over London-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after the transaction of the tobacco? - A. Yes; it was the latter end of September; his wife was delivered on the 2d of September; he was going to take me to his master's for some money; we met a man upon London-bridge, I am not confident who the man was; there were some words between them; the man said, you were very foolish to leave your employ; he said, how came you to be such a fool to leave your business; had you given me a shilling, this would not have happened.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that man; is that the man? - A. I think it is like the man; I won't take my oath of it; I believe you are the man.</p>
               <p>Lucas. I never met the woman nor the man to the best of my knowledge, till I saw him before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Morris.) Q. Is that the man? - A. I think it is.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Lucas.) Q. You said to the best of your knowledge; it is a fact you must know, whether going over London-bridge, you ever met the prisoner and the woman? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet him in the month of September, at any time? - A. I never saw him from the time he went away till I saw him before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not meet you several times, both morning and evening, as you were going to and from the tobacco-warehouses, and I going into the Borough to work; did not you and I go to the Tumble-down Dick in the Borough, and have a pint of porter, and toss which should pay for it? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Lucas.) Q. Where do you live? - A. In Little Suffolk-street, in the Mint, in the Borough.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it was your horse? - A. He is a black horse, he has had a kick upon his nether hock behind, and it is challis'd; his off leg behind is greasy, and a star in his forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose was he used? - A. At cart; he was an overgrown horse, a very poor horse; I was going to send him to the marshes; I have not the least doubt of it being my horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you saw the horse? - A. About two o'clock, or a little after; on the Monday following I saw the prisoner at Bow-street; I took the horse home the following day.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any challis about either of the hocks? - A. I did not observe it, there might be such a thing; it was a large horse, he was as much out of condition as any horse alive; I gave thirty-one shillings for him, the man was to have a shilling that came from Mr. Peake to let me know of the horse; I took him home, and he stood at my own door in North-row, Oxford-street, till my little boy came home from school; I sent my little boy with the horse to carry it to Sharp's-alley, Cow-cross; I went to Aldridge's repository, and I got information there that my little boy was at Bow-street, crying most cruelly, being taken with a stolen horse upon him; I then went to Bow-street; I afterwards took the horse from the Boar and Castle, and left it for Mr. Butler, at the Half-way-house, at Paddington.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a boy was this? - A. He was dressed in a jacket like mine, and a pair of velveret breeches.</p>

             sworn. - I am hay-binder to Mr. Gaunt: On the 20th of May, near about five in the morning, I went to the rick-yard. I found the rick cut and hacked about at a strange rate, I thought I had lost fourteen or fifteen trusses of hay, but there was not so much cut out as if I had cut it myself; I looked at the other rick, I saw but a trifle cut off the other rick, and that was hacked about like mine; I then tracked the loose hay that had been dropped into the lans, the lane was close by, there was not more than room for a carriage to pass between the rick and the hay; I traced it about fifteen yards up the lane, there was a good deal of hay there, where I suppose they loaded the hay; I then tracked the horses' feet, and the wheels, towards London; I then took my horse out of the stable and followed the track down the road, and saw hay scattered at several places; I tracked it up a lane that goes towards Hampstead; I then went on to West-End, and there I was informed of a cart with some hay slung off it, I made the best of my way after it, and when I got near to Hampstead, I saw the track plainer and plainer; there had been rain, and the road was wet; I went down Hampstead till I came to a gate-way, where I could not have gone past it without I did it on purpose, it was so plain; there were two horses in the cart, and the hay in it, under the gate-way; I saw the landlord, and desired him to assist me; I got off my horse, and asked who belonged to that cart, and he, by pointing, made me understand that the person was in doors; I went in, and asked which was the man that belonged to that hay; and the prisoner at the bar told me that he belonged to it; I went to him and took hold of his shoulder, and told him he was my prisoner; he asked me for what; I told him, the hay that was in that cart was stole out of the rick where I bound, that it was my property; he said it was not; I said it was my master's; he told me then that he brought it from Harrow-Weald; upon which I said, I know it did, for it never was there; then I sent for a constable, the constable came, and I searched the cart; I pulled the hay on one side to look for tools, and found a cutting-knife in a sack, upon the top of the cart; I told the constable to take care of him, and I went and rode to Park-lane, to my master, and told him I had had four cuts of hay stole; and he went with me to look at the rick, and then went to Hampstead where the prisoner was in hold.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been used to cut this hay? - A. I had cut upwards of thirty load of it; I built the rick, and thatched it, for a gentleman that is dead; Mr. Gaunt bought it at the sale.</p>

               <p>Q. Then can you tell us, whether the hay in the cart, from the quality of it, was the same hay that had stood in your master's rick-yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say that from knowing the hay, or tracing the wheels, or all together? - A. I know it from both.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How far is it from the rick-yard to where you found the prisoner? - A. About two miles.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you went out in search? - A. About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. A great many hay-carts were coming to London at that time in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the track so visible that you could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280089"/>trace it from the place where you first found it to the place where you found the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to say you traced the track without any information? - A. There might be places where the wheels had crossed.</p>
               <p>Q. You made an inquiry of a man that you met, you must therefore have lost the track? - A. No; I only asked him to know how long it had been gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a ladder in the rick-yard? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It could not have been carried without a ladder? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found no ladder? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. In what state was the hay? - A. Made up in bundles for trusses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Have you never said, that the knife you found upon the prisoner could not have cut that hay? - A. I do not think I could; it is not cut, hardly, it is rather mauled about; I could not have done it as should be with that knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not undertake to swear to the hay? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found eighteen bundles of hay in the cart half a load? - A. Nineteen; if it had been properly bound, I think it would have been contained in between fourteen and fifteen trusses.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say, that there was ar in the cart that clearly did not come from your master's rick? - A. No, none.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Gaunt.) Did you look at the hay in the ot? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hay was it? - A. It was mine, there no doubt of it; I know it because all the rick of hay that has been cut, has been used by myself; I could, with a vast deal of safety, swear to it; it is a very remarkable load of hay, it is of a very particular colour, it has a great deal of gay flowers in it; though it is dark in its colour, there may be a great dead of hay like mine; but I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You do not mean to undertake to swear to the hay? - A. I cannot swear positively to it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. No; I gave one hundred and sixty guineas for the rick.</p>
               <p>- READ sworn. - I am a constable, I took the prisoner into custody: I asked him where he got the hay from; and he said, he brought it from Harrow-Weald, from his father-in-law's. (Produces the knife).</p>
               <p>Q. (To Gaunt.) I want to know, whether with that knife you could have cut the hay? - A. There is not a doubt of it; it was very fresh when it was found, it is a little rusty now.</p>
               <p>Read. I asked him how he came by the knife, and he said it was the last load that he had; it was his own cart and horses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you leave the prisoner at any time by himself at the public-house, for a considerable length of time? - A. I did; he said, I need not be afraid of his running away; and when I came back I found him there; I really thought, at the time, the man was innocent.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the Black-Lion public-house, and stables, at Bayswater: On the 15th of May, the prisoner at the bar brought a grey horse to me, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, he asked me if I would buy a horse of him; I asked him how he came by the horse; he told me he bought it, on the day before, at Chertsey-fair, of a chimney-sweeper; I then told him, neitner the horse should go out of my stable, nor he from my hands; I thought he did not come honestly by him, as I knew the horse; I had seen him a great many times before, I had seen the old gentleman ride him, he has used my house, with cattle, for some years; the prisoner begged to be released, and said he did not come honestly by it; he was a very remarkable horse, he has two spavins on both his hind legs; I took the prisoner to London, put him into a coach, and took him to Bow-street; the Magistrate desired me to keep the horse till I had further orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew Mr. Cole the horse? - A. Yes; I am sure it is Mr. Cole's horse; I shewed it him the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a horse-slaughterer? - A. No; I keep a public-house, and am a livery-stable keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate that this man confessed he did not come honestly by it? - A. I swore it there; I told Sir William Addington so; what he said was, that this horse was not his.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear, that the man ever confessed he came dishonestly by the horse? - A. He said the horse was not his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he stole it? - A. He said he did not come honestly by it.</p>
               <p>Cole. The horse that I saw at Mr. Peake's was my horse, and had been for a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was on the road, and saw a man who looked like a chimney-sweeper, with a horse; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said; it was going to be slaughtered, and I bought the horse of him; I gave him a guinea and a pint of beer.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the place in which it would have been in the regular course of delivery? - A. No; we would not suffer the prisoner to unload the cart, another man did it.</p>

             Sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am servant to Mr. Bell, at Stamford-hill: We loaded three hundred and twenty quarters of malt for Messrs. Hanbury; there were sixteen quarters in thirty-two sacks, in the cart that the prisoner drove; the sacks were tied with a bit of rope; we tie them with any thing we can get at times. Q. Was there any one on those sacks tied with a hay-band? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any extra sack in the cart? - A. No, unless he had any over his horses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. They do sometimes slip in the tying, do they not? - A. Very often; it was to go to Messrs. Hanbury's, Brick-lane, Spitalfields, about four miles from Stamford-hill; it is very common for the cords to slip, and a bushel or two to run out into the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it ever happen that a man should be so wicked, in that case, as to put it into another sack and place it under the the tilt of the waggon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. The same sack out of which it came would have held it again? - A. It would if they had taken pains to put it in.</p>
               <p>WM. PAGE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a maltster, at Ware: I was coming to town from Ware; I saw the prisoner standing on the cart, moving the sacks; I did not see him take any malt out of the sacks, but he was moving them; I informed the brewer of it; it appeared to me that he was taking malt out of the sacks; I saw the malt taken from under the tilt; it was lying upon the front ladder, with a little hay over it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Had you the curiosity to see if any of the sacks were bulged? - A. No. For the Prisoner.</p>

I gave him half-a-guinea, and he gave me sixpence; I saw that Mr. Bond was hurt upon the business, he was all of a sweat at the time, he was all of a quiver; I said, Mr. Bond, you have got 100l. too much, tell those notes over again; I said that, because seeing him all of a shake and a quiver, I thought he was going to rob me of the money, I immediately thought I had done wrong; I desired him to count the notes over again, in order to snatch them away from him, but as I thought there were several gentlemen in the coffee-room, it might be taking his character away, and I never knew any harm of the man, I always took him to be a very honest good man; I made up my mind that I would not loose fight of him going out, we paid the reckoning and went away to the Bank; I took hold of his arm, I said to him, is the business done, Mr. Bond, meaning, was the stock transferred, he said, yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You will not stand there and swear that I said it was transferred? - A. I am stating facts; he said it was transferred, he did before God and man; upon that we went into the Bank together, arm in arm; when we came into the great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280095"/>hall, I withdrew my arm, or he withdrew his, I cannot say which; I then went to the transfer office of the 3 per cent. consols, where I was to have my receipt, as I expected the stock was transferred to me which he had purchased, as he told me; when I went there to the letter A. I missed Mr. 
               <persName id="t18000528-100-person1019">Bond</persName>
             all in a moment; I waited in the office for some time, then I went into the hall where the brokers are, but could not find him, I took all the pains that a man possibly could; I waited in the Bank from a little after one till after three without success; I then went down to Billingsgate to a house that I use, the Three-Tons, where he has dined with me, and enquired there without success; I then returned to the Bank, and went to the book, letter A. and made enquiry there, without success again, and from that time, till the day he was apprehended, the 24th of April, I never saw him, nor heard from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have entrusted him with that 2552l. for any other purpose than the transfer of that stock? - A. I would not; the money was going to be placed there to pay for an estate that I had purchased; I went from the Bank to the Borough, there I took my horse, and went over to Mr. Bond's house, on this side of New-Cross Turn pike, on the Deptsered road, near the Five-bells, he was not at home, but I saw Mrs. Bond.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that other letter? - A. That was brought to me, but I cannot say by whom; I have seen Mr. Bond write frequently, and I believe this to be his hand-writing, but I cannot swear that it is, Mrs. Bond was taken into the custody, I saw her before the Lord-Mayor; I gave information the next day, Good-Friday, the 11th, at Bow-street; I got it put in the hue and cry, and in all the papers, with 100l. reward for apprehending him; I was present when he was apprehended at the Bull and Mouth, in Bull and Mouth-street; I saw Carpmeal take some notes out of his pocket, and lay them upon the table, I did not see to what amount.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The notes delivered up to the Lord-Mayor, and the notes taken by Carpmeal, amount to more than the money you paid to Mr. Bond? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You had employed the prisoner before, as your stock-broker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon those occasions, have you always paid him a brokerage, or have you and he gone partners in buying and selling stock? - A. I know nothing of partners.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not shared together the profits of buying and selling stock? - A. I have not; I have merely paid him his commission as a broker; he never had any share with me in the purchase or sale of stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Lightfoot was the person with whom Mr. Bond told you he had made the contract for the 4000l? - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Lightfoot give you some information, with respect to a contract made by Mr. Bond with him, for the sale of 4000l. stock? - A. - Yes, he did, that was on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any information from Lightfoot, respecting the 4000l. stock to be sold to you? - A. Yes, I did.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer belonging to Bow street: I apprehended the prisoner at the bar, on the 24th of April, about half past five in the morning, at the coffee-house of the Bull and Mouth, in Bull and Mouth-street: I followed the Carlisle mail-coach, to the Bull and Mouth, with Mr. Alstone, the prosecutor, in a post-chaise; Mr. Alstone and I got out of the post-chaise, I went into the coffee-room, and Mr. Alstone stood at the window, the front of the coffee-room is all window; upon seeing Mr. Alstone, Mr. Bond sat down to the table, and put his head down upon the table, resting his head upon his hands; I then went up to him, and told him, he was my prisoner; Mr. Alstone then came in, Mr. Bond then flew back towards the grate, and appeared to me to be looking for the poker; I then knocked him down, I pulled him up again, but he would not suffer me to search him; Mr. Alstone was so hurt, that he could not help me at all, he cried, and I thought would have fainted away; two waiters then came in and caught hold of one of his hands, then I tied his hands together and searched him, I found these notes in his right-hand breeches-pocket, amounting to 1500l. I delivered them to the Lord-Mayor, and the Lord-Mayor delivered them to me, they are the same notes; there are three of 100l. one of 200l. and two of 500l. Mr. Alstone said, were they his notes, or had he changed any; he said, yes, he had; there was another person with Mr. Bond; I then told him, there is a 1000l. notes recovered from your wife; he said, then there is enough, Mr. Alstone, to satisfy you; the notes and money were then reckoned up, and there was 6l. 12s. more than Mr. Alstone's money; we took him to Bow-street, and from Bow-street, before the Lord-Mayor.</p>


               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Mr. Bond before he was taken up at any time? - A. I think I met him as I was coming to town from Litchfield, on the 10th of April; I have no doubt of it, I met him upon Finchley-common, about five o'clock in the evening, in a post-chaise, with a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the high north-road, is it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280096"/>Q. Have you any doubt that it was Mr. Bond that was in the chaise? - A. I will not swear positively.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you to believe it was Mr Bond? - A. I had some conversation with him, when I apprehended him; I told him I met him on the Barnet-road, upon Finchley-common, and he said he was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Balmanna. Q. Did the Carlisle mail-coach stop at the Post-office? - A. I do not know, I suppose it does; I believe they all do.</p>

               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner an opportunity, if he had chosen it, to have got away before he came to the Bull and Mouth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you conceive it to be remarkable, that a man who had travelled a long journey, should rest his head upon his hands? - A. It satisfied me that it was him.</p>
               <p>The letter read, dated four o'clock; addressed"Mr. F. S. Bond, Peckham, Surry."</p>
               <p>"Dear Nancy,"Inclosed is a Bank-note of one thousand"pounds value, which you will take off, from your"loving husband."</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Is there not a space after the words take off?</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. A. No, there is not.</p>
               <p>Another letter read, dated 10th April, 1800.</p>
               <p>"Dear Nancy,"Business of the utmost consequence to"me has taken place since I left home, which re-"quires without delay my going into Sussex; I"had not an opportunity of communicating it to"Mr. Alstone, whom I left at the Bank; I make"no doubt but he will call on you; pray inform"him that as soon as the business I am going on is"finished, I shall come home by the way of Ro-"chester, and call at his house. So conclude, with"love to you and the children.</p>
               <p>"Your loving husband, F. S. Bond."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Alstone.) Q. Are these notes of the same amount and sum that you paid to Mr. Bond? - A. The 1500l. are in the same sums, every note that I paid to the prisoner; they agree in the numbers and dates, as well as the sums.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the 1000l. note do you now find any mark that you recollect, upon it? - A. I do, which I can safely swear to-1923l. 15s. which he sold me out the 3000l. stock for, in my own handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put those figures upon it before you delivered it over to the prisoner? - A. Yes, in his presence, on the 7th of April; and upon the 10th, I paid him that very note.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who had known him a great number of years, and gave him a good character.</p>

            : On the 23d of April I was sitting in a little parlour behind the shop; the prisoner lifted up the latch, opened the shop-door, and came in; he had not regimentals on, he had a light coat; it was between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, it was very dark; he bit himself against a pair of scales, and that alarmed me; I went into the shop and saw the prisoner; I said, you villain, what are you doing there; and he made his escape out of the shop; I went after him and laid hold of him; I said, you villain, you have robbed my shop; and then he got from me; my husband was only two doors off; I went with him, and we found the prisoner at the next public-house; I am sure it was the same man, I saw his face distinctly; there were eleven pair of cotton stockings, and three pair of worsted stockings; the worsted ones he dropped at the door; my husband laid hold of the prisoner, and he wrung himself from him the same as he did from me; he was apprehended the next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long had you been sitting in that room before you went into the shop? - A. Not so long as an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you were too much alarmed to know whether the light coat was a great coat or not? - A. I cannot be positive, but I am pretty sure it was a little coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any other part of his dress? - A. No; my husband took him within ten minutes after; he was asking a comrade to lend him a jacket, and he said he had none to lend; I am sure he is the same person, because I had a good view of him in the shop; I am sure to the prisoner, and I am sure to the property.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I went after the prisoner; I found him at a public-house about an hundred yards off; I heard him asking a comrade to lend him a jacket, and he said he had none but what he had on his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280097"/>back; my wife said that was the man, and I laid hold of him; the prisoner snatched himself out of my hand, and got away; I took him the next day at his quarters, when he came from the parade.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am as innocent as the child unborn; I know nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called the publican upon whom he was quartered, and his paymaster-serjeant, who gave him a good character, and deposed that they had never seen him in a light-coloured coat.</p>

On Tuesday night last, I took two of those deals now produced, to Mrs. Smith's cellar; a few days before this, I told Mrs. Smith I should soon have some deals to sell, when she told me to carry them into her cellar, and she would pay me for them; on the Wednesday morning, I took the other deals from Mrs. Taylor's wharf, and carried them likewise to her cellar, this was about five o'clock; I did not exactly know the number, but I called at Mrs. Smith's window, as soon as I had done, and told her what I had done, she came down into the cellar, and put them by; Mrs. Smith promised me, the Tuesday before I brought her any deals, that she would give me one and nine-pence for each deal, as the most she could afford, but she had not seen them then; after Mrs. Smith had put the planks by, I asked her for my money, she said, she had none at present; I then asked her to let me have two shillings, which I was to give to the watchman of the wharf that permitted me to take them from the wharf, saying, I must remember him, for his wages were so small, he could not live by them; I gave him one shilling and some purl; I am not the only person concerned in robbing this wharf of deals; there is one

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Shadwell Office; I apprehended the prisoner, in company with the prosecutor; he gave me charge of her, and in her possession I found a number of duplicates, (produces them;) here are sixteen that match with Mr. Windsor's, they were examined and found to correspond, before the Magistrate; here are three that relate to the articles pledged at Mr. Mashiter's and Mr. Dickman's, which correspond exactly; I also found a teaspoon in her pocket, when I searched her in the presence of her master, which is not in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say at the time? - A. She said she had certainly made away with them, and gave up the duplicates in the presence of her master, and there was nothing more said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What conversation had you with her before she made these observations? - A. I made use of no promises or threats, I know better; she said she had done so, she had made away with the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she had done it at the request of her master? - A. She did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing like it? - A. She did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did she say she was either the wife or the kept-mistress of Mr. Waterman? - A. Neither.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. He often desired me to buy articles for the house without giving me money, and I could not buy them without money; I was obliged to pledge some things to get money, and he owed me a quarter's wages, and denied paying me, because I wanted to go away.</p>

               <p>Mr. Waterman. This silver cup I can swear to, it has my initials upon it; I believe them all to be mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Of what prosession are you? - A. I do not prosess any thing at all but that of an honest man, and pay for what I have; I live upon what my ancestors have worked for: On the night of the 9th of May, I came through Covent-garden at twenty minutes after eleven o'clock; I came within<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280109"/>ten yards of the door of the Theatre when I saw the prisoner at the end of the Piazzas, going towards Drury-lane Theatre, standing against one of the pillars; I was wishing to see a friend of mine out of Lancashire come out of the Theatre; I asked the prisoner if the play was nearly over, he said it would not be for half an hour; are you from the country, sir, says the prisoner, because I am; I said I was from the country; he said, so am I too; he said, I am a <rs id="t18000528-128-deflabel744" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Was it by your private parts that he seized you? - A. It was; he screwed me most violently round with his hand as he laid hold of me, and said I must have your money, or I will cut your b-d throat; and then he held me, not by the collar, but where I alluded to previous to the word collar, until he put his hand into my right-hand waistcoat pocket, he there took out some halfpence; he felt in my coat-pocket, which is in the inside of my coat, and insisted upon my, that moment, giving him all I had, or he would say - I am ashamed to say what.</p>
               <p>Q. You must tell us what? - A. It is a word that you will find written at the beginning of the Bible.</p>
               <p>Q. You must tell us the words he made use of? - A. I screamed out watchman, and he said he would call sodomy.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was that the word? - A. It was, so help me God; I then begged him not to cut me any more, for he had made several attempts to cut my throat with one hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he in that hand? - A. Something resembling an instrument commonly called a penknife; my throat and my face were cut in several places; I begged for mercy, and told him he should have all that I had about me; he then put his hand into my coat-pocket, and took out my pocket-book; he asked me whether it contained bills, or what; I told him letters of consequence to me concerning a law business; and of no use to any body but myself; he said, I must have some money, have you no more about you; I replied that I had not, but that I would give him any money he should require for the pocket-book back; that if he lived by robbing, I was willing to redeem my papers back; he said, how much will you give me to have it back again; the prisoner said, if you will give me half a guinea I will let you have it, for I must have half a guinea; I said to him, you may stay here, and I will fetch you half a guinea; he said, will you not hang me, and I declared I could not swear to his face; that if he chose to go along near Temple-bar, I would procure the money; he walked along with me, and when we were opposite St. Clement's Church, he said he must have a guinea, or he would not let me have the pocket-book again; that he was very sorry if he had hurt me, for he lived by that way, and no doubt, he said, I was up to the gossip; I told him I did not know what gossip he meant, without it was cutting throats, and robbing people; he then said that three or four and twenty shillings, I am not sure which, would answer his purpose for the present night; I then asked him to come with me for the money, and he repeated again, will you not hang me; I told him, upon my honour I would not; I went to the Magpye and Stump public-house, where I knew the landlady, Mrs. Young; the prisoner followed me in; my physicians and surgeons, as I live in the country, come there to consult me concerning my health; I went in and asked for a glass of porter, and begged to speak with her alone; I told her to send for a constable; she said it was too late to get a constable, and she sent for a watchman; the prisoner was in a back-room, commonly called a parlour, and I in the tap-room; the watchman came in about two minutes; I was then in the parlour; I gave charge of the prisoner; he said, I have not got Mr. Oliver's pocket-book, but please to look under the table and about the room, and you will find it, I have no doubt; Mrs. Young called me Oliver when I first went in; the pocket-book was found under the table; the prisoner then insulted me with a great deal of bad language, that I was a false man, and should I attempt to swear that that was my pocket-book he would lay such a train against me as should ruin me for ever; the watchman and Mrs. Young were present; then the watchman took him away; (produces the pocket-book and bracelets:) I received it from the person who picked it up; his Christian name is James; I can swear to the pocket-book and its contents.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Here is a letter directed to you at No. 49, Aldermanbury? - A. That is a Mr. Lee's, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280110"/>friend of mine, to whom I have letters directed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell me that you were a gentleman's servant? - A. I did, in order to induce him to restore my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish your Lordship to ask him what he is now, and what he has been? - A. I am a country farmer's son in Northamptonshire; I have had a great deal of friendship from the Earl and Countess of Kinnoul, and the Drummond family, and with what my own friends did for me, and these noble families, I have always been kept independent; I married a lady of most respectable family in Lancashire, a Miss Hart, Counsellor Hart's cousin, and was by that means made independent; she is dead, and I have since married another lady, the daughter of Mr.

            , a respectable citizen of London, who is now living with her son at Newcastle.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to tell him you were a gentleman's servant? - A. To save my life; he said he thought he had got something of value in his clutches.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your second wife living? - A. I cannot say, she was nearly twelve months ago, when I came up to London upon some law affairs in Chancery respecting my son by my first wife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not send your servant to me to try and make it up? - A. I have no servant, nor did I ever send any person; here are some letters that he has sent to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not walk arm in arm with me on the 9th of May? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where were you going that night? - A. To Temple-bar; I had been at a house in May's Buildings, to speak to a friend from Liverpool.</p>
               <p>Q. How many gentlemen were with you? - A. I believe there were about thirty; it was a society of people that meet together called Odd Fellows.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going? - A. To Lieutenant Marsh's, No. 12, Swan-place, Bricklayer's-arms, where I lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to stop at the play-house? - A. I wanted to see a gentleman of too much decency to mention with such a man as the prisoner, to whom I had lent a pair of silver buckles of a particular pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that gentleman's name? - A. They call him Lee, he comes from Liverpool.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - A. I cannot altogether say.</p>

               <p>Q. Is he a gentleman of property? - A. I cannot say any thing about any body's property but my own; he had a country house a little way out of Liverpool, but I have not spoke to him these four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you intimate with him? - A. So far as taking a cup of tea with him, or drinking a bottle of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to lend him this pair of buckles? - A. They were quite a new fashioned pair from London; I would have sent him ten thousand pounds if I had had it, and he had wanted it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Lee lives up two pair of stairs in Milford-lane.</p>
               <p>Oliver. The Mr. Lee that I mean is too much of a gentleman to live up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to know that Mr. Lee was at the play-house that night? - A. Because I had met a Mr. Jackson near Temple-bar, a cousin to me by marriage, and he told me Mr. Lee was in town; but I have not seen him these four years.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before that night? - A. To the best of my recollection I had never seen him; but I have every reason to believe he had seen me.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Oliver.) Q. I asked you, in your original examination what you were - what are you? - A. My profession, I before told you, I am the son of a country farmer, I lived till I was, perhaps, twelve or fifteen years under the care of my uncle, an alderman of Leicester; I was afterwards sent by the Drummond family to try if I could learn the cotton business at Stockport, but it did not agree with me; then I went to Edinburgh to study the profession of a surgeon, and I carried it on for some time, but I did not practice for the last four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you drawn teeth within these four or five years? - A. That is a question I can hardly tell, for I believe I drew a stump a few days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Young has said, that you are a dentist, are you or not? - A. I was once, but not for the last three years, unless a friends asks it of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell the Gentlemen of the Jury so before? - A. I have no profession that I live by.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him before? - A. I think I have seen him at Warwick, I recollected his face the moment I came into Court, and his speech.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what year it was in? - A. I think about two years ago, for an assault upon two young gentlemen, I believe he is the man.</p>
               <p>Oliver. How dare you say so, unless you can prove it; I say, it is a lie, and you are a villain for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280112"/>saying so; two years ago I was at Bradlington, in Yorkshire.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you believe he is the man that you saw at Warwick? - A. I do believe he is the man, and I think it was by the name of Oliver.</p>
               <p>Oliver. There was a man of the name of Oliver, who was hung, but I am not that man, he was a surgeon too, and it came to Liverpool in the calendar, I was at Liverpool at the same time.</p>

               <p>Oliver. I say, that this man robbed me identically, used me cruelly beyond description, and said, he lived by that means, and I swear by the God of heaven and earth (and I am well known throughout the kingdom) that I never did an indelicate action in my life, by God he is the man that robbed me.</p>

             sworn. - On the morning of the 14th of April, about half past three, I went to my father's house, with my husband, to lay a watch, as we had been robbed before; we staid till almost six o'clock, inside my father's house; then I doublelocked the door, and came away; I saw the back-door with the bar up, and screwed; I made a mistake, and left a paper at home that I wanted, and I returned about a quarter past seven; I found the street-door locked as I left it, and as I unlocked the door, I saw the prisoner in the house; he fled towards the back-door, and got out side-ways, he stooped to get under the bar; it was quite light enough for me to see who it was; as I advanced towards the yard-door, I saw the bag lie at the threshold of the door, I did not see him drop it; the drawer was left quite open; I locked the door, and went to a neighbour; I told him what I had seen, and he went with me to the boy's father; I said, that is the boy, I knew him perfectly; I used to employ him in a morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. That was without your father's knowledge, I believe? - A. Yes; if I was in a hurry, he would go with a paper or two for me, and I used to give him a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband entrusted with the key of your father's house? - A. My father does not so particularly give him the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your father desire you not to deliver it to him? - A. No, he never did; I generally kept it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or not, intrust him with it? - A. Sometimes I might.</p>

               <p>Q. With your father's knowledge? - A. My father never asked me about it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When Joyce was apprehended, there was a great deal of bad money found upon him? - A. No, it was all good.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present during this transaction? - A. Nobody but me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the whole rests upon you - what are you? - A. A soldier.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280114"/>Q. Have you ever been a smasher before? - A. No, I can take my sacrament oath I never was.</p>
               <p>Q. You being a soldier, you thought it was your duty to protect the public, and therefore you went to buy this bad money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no acquaintance with the woman before you saw Coleman? - A. I had not; Mr. Coleman gave me the money to buy it; Tony, a soldier in the same regiment, directed me to the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. How often has he been prosecuted for smashing? - A. I don't know.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you expect for coming here to-day? - A. I do not expect any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Let that be taken down? - A. I don't know whether I shall have any thing or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have been attending here ever since the first day of the Sessions, and expect to have your expences paid? - A. Yes, I hope so.(John Coleman, and John Wightman, confirmed the evidence of the last witness).(Mr.
