He sent for her; she went with me to Mrs Folier's lodgings, one that buys old cloaths; she went with us to Mrs Hambleton in Monmouth-street; I did not see the spoon that night, but after that it was brought before Mr Welch, there I saw it.</p>

            . I am Constable. Mrs Davis came to me about five weeks ago, and described the prisoner; I afterwards took the prisoner upon suspicion; I ask'd him if he ever lived at the King of Prussia by Brooks-market; he said he did not; I ask'd him his name he said Williams; I sent for the prosecutrix; she said that was the man, that she described for me to take; upon being charg'd with taking the spoon he own'd he did take it, and also he own'd the same before Justice Welch; after it was produced by Mrs Hambleton, the prosecutrix brought another to match it.</p>

I was going to see about, to find the remains of what were scattered about; one Smith told me he saw a bundle of things carried into Herbert's house; I went and got a warrant from Justice Barry, and went and searched the house, and found a sheet and a towel; there had been my name on the sheet; we could see a name had been picked out, so I can't swear to them. Mrs Herbert told me her husband was gone to pawn a petticoat in Long-Lane, Smithfield, and that Conner had brought a bundle in for him to pawn with that in it; I went in pursuit of Herbert, and found him with the petticoat upon him. It was not quite finished; I am pretty sure it is my wife's property, but she is not in a condition capable to attend the court, so is not here.

He came to tell me I might get work where the fire had been; I am a carpenter and joyner; he desired me to call at his house concerning some money I ow'd him. When I came there, they said the landlord Herbert was gone off with some things stolen from the fire; I said he was at my house; I told them he said if the things got wet (for it rain'd) it would be the ruin of him. I and a constable went back to my house with another man, and found he had left word with my wife he would call again at two o'clock: I went with the constable at the time, and took him at my house with the petticoat; he said he had met the lady in Rosemary-lane, and they had drank two bottles of wine together.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know Conner at this time?</p>
               <p>Garside. I did; and knew he worked at Mr Turner's factory in weaving sail-cloth; he had something white under his arm; I can't say any body was with him that belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the place you met him at from Herbert's?</p>

            . I had a warrant brought me to search Herbert's house; we made a diligent search but could find nothing; we were for taking the woman away, the man not being at home. She said, If we would stay, she would shew us something, which she did. A sheet, a towel, and some wrappers. Producing them.</p>

               <p>Conner's defence. My fellow-prisoner brought the goods from the fire; I was at his house the next day, and there were he and other people picking the marks out of the things. I ow'd him six shillings; he told me he would acquit me of the debt, if I would not inform against him. I call'd for a pot of purl, and before I had drank it the people came in, and his wife told them I brought the things in there, and they took me.</p>
               <p>Herbert's defence. I was drawing beer in my house, between eight and nine o'clock; this other prisoner came in with a bundle of things, and desired me to take care of it 'till the morning; he came in the morning before I got out of my bed, and said he had them things to dispose of.

               <p>Q. Where was your watch and buttons?</p>
               <p>Foy. The watch was taken off a place where it used to hang, and the buttons from out of a drawer; I knew Dayland before; my wife knowing the number of my watch, went to the Pawn-broker's to inquire for it; she found that at Mr Murphy's house; Dayland own'd she took them, for we suspected her; she was seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175901170008"/> to go up the stairs where we lodge. Before the Justice of Peace, she own'd she took the watch and gave it to Crouch to pawn.</p>
               <p>Mr Murphy. Crouch brought this watch to me; and after that the prosecutor's wife came said she had lost a watch with the same name and number; then I had her taken up; Dayland brought the buttons; Crouch was angry with Dayland, and said, How could you give me a watch that was stole; Dayland confess'd she stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that Crouch was innocent?</p>
               <p>Murphy. To me it did: for Dayland said nothing in answer to her question: but at last confess'd she did steal it. The watch produced in Court and deposed to by prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Dayland's defence. The prosecutor's wife lent me the watch unknown to her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor's wife. Did you lend Dayland this watch?</p>
               <p>Answer. No: I did not upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Crouch's defence. Dayland brought the watch to me, and said, a friend of her's desired she would get it pawn'd for some money; and I took it, and pawn'd it to that gentleman.</p>

               <p>Gaston. There was nobody in the room but she; I took her before a Justice of the peace, and she denied having taken them.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is that man that delivered it to you?</p>
               <p>Gaston. He is not here: I had also my breeches return'd me by a prisoner in the Marshalsea-prison.</p>

            , but I can't swear to the man at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the buckles?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can't swear to them: there is no particular mark upon them; they are the same pattern of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had your's?</p>
               <p>Harrison. About half a year?</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner acknowledge he took the buckles?</p>
               <p>Harrison. He own'd he took my buckles and pawn'd them there for five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. to Rochford. Did you take them in?</p>
               <p>Rochford. I did not take them in: but he came a second time; he having had three shillings at first, and the second time he wanted two shillings more, and I let him have that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can't you recollect the man again by seeing him at that time?</p>
               <p>Rochford. It is so long ago that I cannot: and I saw him but that time.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it to be this piece?</p>
               <p>Green. I know it by the dirt on the paper it is wrapped in: and also by dirt on the end of the piece; she took it up and ran directly away; I went and ask'd Mr Thorn if he had sold her a piece of shalloon; he said no: then I informed him what I had seen; he and I followed her into Smithfield; he overtook her; she turned about directly, and said she had nothing of his; at which time I saw her drop it again behind her; Mr Thorn went and took it; then the prisoner was very much confused.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Is this your property?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw the piece in the shop; there was another woman there buying of buttons; when she came out, she dropp'd the piece and I pick'd it up.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. She was with me at Hicks's-hall, and she said there would be no trial here today; and she would not come here.</p>

               <p>Sarah Banford. The prisoner came into my house the 4th of December, for a pint of beer; she desired to toast a piece of bacon at the fire; she had a little knife like a pen-knife; she got to my pocket as I sat by her, and took out two Half-guineas, two gold rings, and some silver.

I was not at home when it was taken, but I came home soon after; a child told me some men had taken it; I went in pursuit of them; I went as far as Aldersgate-bars; a young gentleman went with me; then I went into Charter-house-square, on the right hand; when in the square, I met two men and the prisoner with them; he had my pot of honey on his head, but before I could come to them they shifted it from one to another. I went to lay hold of the prisoner, and he throw'd the pot of honey on my arm, which, by my preventing it from falling to the ground, least it should break, it prevented me from securing him for a little time; he struck me and us'd me very ill, but at last, I overcame him, and paid him pretty well; the porter of the Charter-house came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Is it feasible to think that I should take the honey away, and am not able to buckle my shoe; I had been to carry a coat to the scowerer's, and went after that into the Square to look after a shipmate of mine; and there I went to do my occasions, I let down my breeches, and this man came and said, You have robb'd me; and I absolutely befoul'd myself in abundance. I know no more of the honey, than I know of the sacred God.</p>

In about a week after my key was lost, I also miss'd a shilling a day several days; then I having a suspicion of the prisoner at the bar taking of it, I sat down, and marked 15 s. and 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she access to the room where the bureau stood?</p>
               <p>Sanderson. She had, and no body else, beside my wife and I; she went up that day to make the bed as usual; after she was come down, I went and told my money, and miss'd a shilling; I call'd her to me and examin'd her about it; she denied having taken any. I insisted upon searching of her; then she pull'd out her things from her pocket, presently she pull'd out the key of my bureau, and after that came out my shilling; I saw the mark upon it. I said, This is the key of the bureau, and this is my shilling; and told her she took the shilling about half an hour before. I charged a constable with her; then she confessed she took the shilling before me and the constable of the night. I took her before Mr Alderman Gosling, there she said she found the key, but did not know the use of it.</p>

            . I am a lodger in the prosecuter's house; they told me they had a suspicion the maid had robb'd them; they took the prisoner into the kitchen, and desired her to pull the things out which were in her pocket. She took out some small money, but did not pull out the key or shilling for some time; then the mistress desired the pocket might be turned inside out; then she pull'd out a key and a shilling. When the constable was coming in, I said, Here comes the constable; she desired I would speak to her master for her; they charged her; she down on her knees, and confessed to the taking the shilling, and said she found the key under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say where she took the shilling from?</p>
               <p>Lee. No, she did not; she begg'd to be forgiven; the mistress said she would forgive her no farther than the law would go. She said she never took any money before that; he desired his wife to fetch down the money that he had marked, and the shilling was marked as the rest; I shewed the shilling to the Grand Jury here yesterday, but whether by pulling out my handkerchief, or by what accident, I know not, but I have lost the shilling; the Grand Jury looked at it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Here is the other money which I marked the same as that which we found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I found a shilling upon the bed when I went to make it, that I sent down to mistress by her k inswoman; after that I found a key and a shilling under the bureau; my master sent me to carry same beer to the Fleet, and then directly took me into the kitchen, and charged me with taking them. I said, I don't know of any key belonging to you; I pull'd out this key, and said, This I picked up, and delivered it to him; had he not sent me out with the beer, I would have given it him directly. Then he charged a constable with me, and sent me to the Counter.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lee. Did she say she found the shilling under the bureau?</p>
               <p>Lee. No, she did not; she was above an hour before she was sent away.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did she readily say upon your charging her, she had found a key and a shilling?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I told her what I had lost, and said I wanted to search her; I desired her to pull out what she had from her pocket, she pull'd out two sixpences, a half-penny, and three farthings. She utterly denied taking any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge her with taking a key and a shilling?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did; and she said she had nothing in her pocket but her own key and her own money.</p>

            . The prisoner Falkner was in my prison on the 16th of November; I had been out in the afternoon, I came home<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175901170019"/> about ten at night, my man told me there was a prisoner escaped; I asked if he could tell who assisted? he told me he was sure that the prisoner was up in Falkner's room; I sent for Falkner, and asked him what he knew of it? at first, he said he knew nothing of it; at last, he said the cloaths were deposited in his room, and the man that was escaped was shaved in his room, and that he knew two hours before he would escape, or at least, attempt it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner's name that escaped ?</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give you any reason why he knew he would attempt to escape?</p>
               <p>Crompton. No, he did not; I ask'd him how he could be so cruel as not to discover it to me, when he knew I had been so good to him; he turn'd himself round, and said, D - n it, it was nothing to him.</p>
               <p>Q. from Falkner. When you sent for me, do you think I was sober or fuddled?</p>
               <p>Crompton. I think he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say as to the other prisoner?</p>
               <p>Crompton. When I found the cloaths had been brought into Falkner's room, then I made enquiry who brought them there? and found that Fielder brought them there from Kensington.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any business in your goal?</p>
               <p>Crompton. He came to a woman that is a prisoner there; I went to Kensington and made enquiry where I had been directed, and found he had given a receipt for the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Fielder examined upon this?</p>
               <p>Crompton. He did not say in my hearing to what purpose he brought them. My man will give a farther account.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Chadwick. I am turnkey there; I felt on the out-side of it to see if I could perceive any spirituous liquours in it; I ask'd him what he had got in it; he said he had got some cloaths; I ask'd who they were for; he answered, I am going up to Falkner's room with them; he went in, and up to that room.</p>

               <p>Q. Who let him out?</p>
               <p>Chadwick. I believe I did, not knowing who I let out; I took him for a stranger, the old cloaths, that he had on then, were left in the bag that the other cloaths were brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had appear'd at the gate in his old cloaths should you have let him out?</p>

               <p>Falkner's defence. I am a poor debtor, and have been in that goal six months; I desire to be hang'd up now in the yard if I know any thing of it; they don't care what they swear against a poor debtor to clear themselves.</p>
               <p>Fielder's defence. That fellow that is gone out of the goal was in Falkner's room the Sunday before; he ask'd me to go of an errand for him; I said I would; he said it was to fetch him some cloaths; I went and brought them from his lodgings at Kensington, he sent a letter for every thing he had there; 2 shirts, 2 night-caps, 2 or 3 handkerchiefs, and other things; I brought them to him, he was standing on the foot of the stairs, I gave him the sack with all the cloaths in it, and where he carried them I don't know; he took his shoes out of the sack and brought them down and put them on, and gave Mr Chadwick his shoes which he had borrow'd of him, and Mr Chadwick charg'd him sixpence for the use of them.</p>
               <p>For Falkner.</p>
               <p>Mr Boudler. I have known Falkner twenty-one years; he lived in my neighbourhood in Black-Fryers; he has made shoes for me, and always used me very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you ?</p>
               <p>Boudler. I am a Carpenter.</p>

I put all the letters that were delivered in at the Post-Office on Sunday the 17th of December last, into the Coventry bag, and tied the bag up, and sealed it with the seal of my office; and afterwards I saw it buckled up in the mail, and put into the packet-cart and set off for Daventry.</p>

               <p>Marjoram. I gave her nineteen guineas and a shilling; I told her there was her full change; she then gave me three guineas back, and I gave her 6 s. out of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr Marjoram?</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any more conversation past between the prisoner Sharp and you, than what you have given an account of?</p>
               <p>Wootton. No, there were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there any conversation about burning at all?</p>
               <p>Wootton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she wanted to see Mr Marjoram about a note?</p>
               <p>Wootton. She did.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing at all of Mrs Sharp's receiving this note of Cleaver ?</p>
               <p>Wootton. No, I never saw him in my life, 'till I saw him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. to Marjoram. What did this evidence say to you when she came?</p>
               <p>Marjoram. The message that I understood by her, was, that she had got the money to give me if I would give her the note again, and she would burn it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wootton. Do you not recollect this conversation?</p>

               <p>Wootton. I never said these words, nor had a half-penny of money about me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Marjoram. Did you understand her to have the money to deliver to you, or you to go and have it of Mrs Sharp?</p>
               <p>Marjoram. I understood it, that the witness<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175901170025"/> had got the money to deliver to me upon my delivering her the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any such message delivered by this woman, tending to your delivering up a note ?</p>
               <p>Marjoram. Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this evidence Wootton examined before Mr Fielding?</p>
               <p>Marjoram. She swore that before Mr Fielding, with this variation; that Mrs Sharp would give me the money, if I would deliver up the note.</p>
               <p>Cleaver's defence. I have nothing more to say, than that I gave the note to this woman, (meaning the prisoner Sharp) and I never had a farthing of the money.</p>
               <p>Sharp's defence. He brought me the note, I can't tell the day, I believe it was the 18th or 19th; he said, Mrs Sharp, can you change me this note? I said no, I did not think I had money enough; I went and look'd, and found 17 l. 18 s. then I said I had no more, except he would take halfpence: he said they were luggage; I went to one Mrs Malin's, she said it was not in her power to change it; then I went with it to Mr Needham's, he could not change it; then I went to my Wine-Merchant; Cleaver said in Mrs Malin's house, while I came back to give him the two guineas: and when I came there with the money, he was gone; I saw him the next morning and said, Are not you gone home? he said no, nor he would not go home any more; for he had been in company in the Old-Bailey, and lost most of his money at cards: he told me his business in London was to buy sugar and plumbs for his father.</p>

               <p>Sharp. Cleaver brings this gentleman, and said, Mrs Sharp, your daughter is very bad; this is an acquaintance of mine, let him go and see her, he said don't fear the money, I'll pay you. The gentleman came down again and talk'd, and said, I understand you let out a little money, what interest do you take? I sometimes get neither interest nor principal. He said, If you'll let Cleaver have twenty or thirty pounds, I'll be bound for him, to go to buy horses; there is a gentlewoman of my acquaintance that takes but three per cent. and she has made me a present of a goose.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it offered to you?</p>
               <p>Malin. No, it never was; when she came to me, Cleaver said he wanted money to go out of town directly the next day, saying she owed him two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the note?</p>
               <p>Malin. No, I never saw a bank note; I saw her deliver a piece of paper to Mr Marjoram, but what it was, I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing pass between Cleaver and Sharp?</p>
               <p>Malin. I heard him bid her make haste, he wanted to go out of town; and said there were two guineas owing; he went away before she came, and came back again at night a little in liquor, and said, give me a dram of rum; I have been to the play, give me silver for half a guinea; said I, I'll trust you, you seem to be in liquor; he went away, and two or three days afterwards, he came again and paid me for the dram of rum.</p>
               <p>Sharp. I denied the note because of Mr Fielding; I begg'd I might not be taken out of the city, but go before my Lord-Mayor. They tore and dragg'd me about; I was afraid of owning the note, fearing it should touch his life, hearing he had robb'd the mail. I thought no body could take me out of the city; If I had known this had been a stolen note, I would not have gone to Mr Marjoram's where I knew it must have been paid back again. Mr Fielding's fellows us'd me cruelly, and Cleaver us'd me as bad.</p>

               <p>Farr. She told me the nutmegs ( there were twenty-one large ones) were given her by a person that came from on board a ship, the mace and cloves were with them in a box.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say as to the rest of the things?</p>
               <p>Farr. She could not tell what to say as to the sugar and tea, because I knew them to be mine; I used to breakfast in the compting-house, and after I sent the sugar up I could have none come down again; I put down but two pounds of tea, but there was a great deal more; she said she brought the tea with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own that she had taken any thing from you?</p>
               <p>Farr. No: she said one of my men gave her the sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say any of the things mentioned are your's?</p>
               <p>Farr. I believe them all to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason for so believing?</p>
               <p>Farr. I have sugar of the very same to match that, and am positive it is mine, or at least have all the reason possible to believe it; after she was committed to the Compter, it happened to be mentioned in Newgate-street that I had a servant that had committed a theft, and sent to prison; a man by accident said is it the chamber-maid or the cook; he was told, it was the cook; said he, I am sorry for it, for I have a box of her's in my house in the Old Change; I went there with a constable, and the constable opened the box that the people said was the prisoner's; in that box I found a key that undoes my lock, to a place in my dinning-room, where I lock up my tea and other things, and there I found the tea.</p>

               <p>Q. Does he deal in sugar?</p>
               <p>Elmore. He does: I saw some in his house: but I saw the sugar upon a table above-stairs, and he said it was the sugar that he bought of this evidence and Smith, and he had cut some of it off.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before the Justice ?</p>
               <p>Elmore. He own'd these two boys sold it to him.</p>

               <p>Capper. A very honest man; I have had particular instances to think him so. I have serv'd him with goods, and have omitted putting goods two several times in the bill of parcels; he had honesty enough to bring me the bills of parcels, and the money for what I had omitted.

            . Smith and I were together last Sunday was seven-night, at night at Hoxton; Smith held the prosecutor's door open, and I went in and took this bacon out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the shop?</p>
               <p>Coltis. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the shop did it lie?</p>
               <p>Coltis. It lay upon a shelf on the right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it afterwards?</p>
               <p>Coltis. We carried it to Feathers's house that same night.</p>
               <p>Q. What! on a Sunday-night?</p>
               <p>Coltis. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before, or after, taking the sugar?</p>
               <p>Coltis. This was after that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after?</p>
               <p>Coltis. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find Feathers at home?</p>
               <p>Coltis. We did; we ask'd him if he would buy the bacon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his shop open?</p>
               <p>Coltis. No: we knock'd at the door, and he open'd it and let us in; he said he had bacon enough, but he ask'd the price of it; we ask'd him a groat a pound, it being a hock.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this bacon. He takes it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Coltis. This is the the same bacon.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you a pound for it?</p>
               <p>Coltis. He gave us two-pence a pound for it; and there was a little sat bit that he gave us five-pence a pound for.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there of that?</p>
               <p>Coltis. There was about two pounds and a half of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you any questions how you came by it?</p>
               <p>Coltis. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it that you was at his house?</p>
               <p>Coltis. I can't say indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out upon your business that day?</p>
               <p>Coltis. We had been out about three or four hours before we took the bacon, and we went out about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Feathers pay you for the bacon that night?</p>
               <p>Coltis. He did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175901170032"/>Q. What did he give you?</p>
               <p>Coltis. He gave us half a crown in all.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the money?</p>
               <p>Coltis. I and Smith divided it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after you had sold the bacon?</p>
               <p>Coltis. We went home to our lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you taken up?</p>
               <p>Coltis. We were taken up last Tuesday was a week in the morning, that was the next day but one after we sold the bacon; we were taken out of our beds by

            , and carried that morning before Justice Fielding; the Justice ask'd us where we were taken up? I told him at such a house; he committed me as an evidence, and he sent Elmore and me to the shops where we had stole these things from; Elmore ask'd the people if they had lost any thing? and they said they had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor say he had lost any thing?</p>
               <p>Coltis. He said he had lost such a piece of bacon as this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Feathers's?</p>
               <p>Coltis. We did; and the prosecutor Winsley along with us, he bought the bacon of Feathers.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you see the bacon at the prisoner Feathers's house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I went to Feathers's house at about seven or eight at night; I took a basket and a few greens in it. I ask'd him if he had a bit of bacon to fell, and said I had got a few nice greens; I looked about and saw a hock of bacon, I took it down, and said, What will you have for this? I view'd it very well; he sold it me at four-pence a pound. I took that to Justice Fielding's.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the hock that you bought of Feathers?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the very same: (if it is not mine it is like it.)</p>
               <p>Q. toColtis. Look at this bacon, do you know it?</p>
               <p>Coltis. I am sure this is the same bacon that I took out of the prosecutor's shop; and Feathers own'd before the Justice, that he bought this bacon of Smith and me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know it to be the same bacon, and the man that you say owns it does not know it?</p>
               <p>Coltis. Mr Feathers own'd it to be the same?</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any marks by which you know it?</p>
               <p>Coltis. Because here is a slit underneath it; turning it up and showing it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Elmore. Did you hear Feathers own this to be the bacon that the two boys sold him?</p>
               <p>Elmore. I did; and own'd before the Justice he gave two-pence a pound for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say when he bought it?</p>
               <p>Elmore. He did; he said he bought it on Sunday was seven-night at night; I took the two boys in bed, along with two women.</p>
               <p>Smith's defence.</p>
               <p>It is a great falsity, I never saw Coltis before in my life, only once at the White-Lion by Cow-cross; and that night he went home to bed with me, and Elmore came and took us up.</p>
               <p>Q. to Coltis. How old are you?</p>
               <p>Coltis. I am between 17 and 18 years of age.</p>

               <p>Q. How much?</p>
               <p>Russel. About 14 ounces of green and 5 of bohea, in two cannisters.</p>

            . Betwixt 6 and 7 o'clock on Monday night, I and the two prisoners went that way; the prosecutor's door was latch'd; I went in and handed one of the cannisters to Blaze; then I went in and got the other, then we went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it?</p>
               <p>Coltis. We put it all out into a handkerchief together before we got home.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do that for?</p>
               <p>Coltis. Because no body should find the cannisters upon us.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with them?</p>
               <p>Coltis. We throw'd them away, and went directly to our lodgings, and left it on the table in the handkerchief all night, and went to bed; we were taken up on the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Blaze lie with Smith and you?</p>
               <p>Coltis. No, he went home to his lodgings about nine or ten o'clock.</p>

            . This I found on a table at the boys bed's soot, when I took them up. Producing a handkerchief with tea in it. Coltis said he took some from an old woman in Old-street, and some from the prosecutor's in Hoxton-square.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is there of it?</p>
               <p>Elmore. Here is two pounds and an ounce handkerchief and all; when the evidence had given an account that Blaze was with them, the Justice sent me after him. I went to his lodging in Barbican, but not meeting with him, I went to the house where I took up the boys, and while I was in the room, Blaze came in at the back door, so I took him there. I told him he had been stealing sugar, tea, and bacon, and must go along with me. He said he was not concerned in the bacon; he was only concerned in tea and sugar; I ask'd him whose handkerchief it was that the tea was in? he said it was his own, and he wanted it again.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Captain Smith; Neal us'd to come on board early in the morning, and would get the hatches open; the mate had the care of them. I have seen sacks tied up, which they have taken away full of something, I cannot tell what. They put log-wood dust in just at the top. Neal told me to say nothing of what I saw, and he would give me a coat.</p>

               <p>I sent some log-wood and sweepings on shore by Neal; the Captain bid me do what I pleased with it, and I got two guineas of Neal for it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cockeril. When you saw these sacks taken away, was the ship delivered of her cargoe?</p>
               <p>Cockeril. No, we was not got to the second tier.</p>

               <p>I never promis'd him a coat, nor no such thing. It is customary in the river Thames, for the mate to have the sweepings of the sugar; this man had money bid for them, I said I would give him as much as any body; accordingly, he let me have the preference.</p>

               <p>Q. What is his character?</p>
               <p>Golding. I never heard any thing ill of him 'till this.</p>
               <p>Q. How does he get his livelihood?</p>
               <p>Golding. He was a chair-man at the other end of the town, I knew him there, and I knew him since he came down to the waterside.</p>
               <p>- Jacobs. I have known Neal twelve years.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175901170035"/>Q. What has been his behaviour?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. A hard-working man always; he work'd at any thing that came in his way; he always bore an honest character before this.</p>
               <p>A witness. I have known Neal sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character?</p>
               <p>Answer. He is an honest man, he ow'd me money, and paid me honestly; he works at chair-carrying and coal-heaving.</p>
               <p>A witness. I have known him seventeen years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Answer. He is very honest and just, he pays every body twenty shillings to the pound; he has carried lords and ladies, and when he could not get work he went to coal-heaving; I once belonged to a ship; I have known sweepings to be given to the mate; it a customary thing in the river Thames.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call sweepings?</p>
               <p>Answer. That which is trod under foot, and not fit to be put into the cask again, for fear it should spoil the rest; if the officers thought it would pay duty they would never leave it there, but carry it to the Custom-House.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose there is a great quantity of sugar on board, and before the sugars are delivered, and some falls to the ground without being trod upon, would you call that sweepings?</p>
               <p>Answer. No! no! I don't call that sweepings: that is to be put into the cask again.</p>
               <p>Neal. I have a great many witnesses in court for me, but I am afraid they are gone home.</p>

               <p>Robert James. Upwards of a month ago, I lost a board of livery lace; I made strict search throughout my shop, and could not tell which way it went; some time after that, came Turnis the evidence, and a man with him; they ask'd me if I did not lose a parcel of livery-lace; I said I had; Turnis said he was the instrument in taking it, they desired I would go before Justice Welch; I went; there I saw the lace as I believe; I said I could not positively swear to the lace, as there were other lace much like it; I then said, and so I do now, I believe it to be mine.</p>

            , a Jew, came and offered a sample of these sort of goods in my shop; I suspecting them to be mine; I told him they were worth more than they really were; and offered him something for himself if he would bring the whole of them, and the person he had them on, that I might buy them. On New-Years-Day he brought thirty dozen, but did not bring the man; I wanted to know who he had them of: (believing them to be mine) I charged the constable with the Jew, to find out the man that sent him; he would not for a good while tell where he had them; but after a good deal to do, he said they were left for him at the Hare and Punch-Bowl in Lime-street, a publick-house; I ask'd him if the man was not waiting there for the money for them; he said he could not tell, but he believ'd he was; I went there with the Jew and constable; the Jew and I agreed, going along, for him to go up to the man and tell him I bid him so much money for the goods; there we found the prisoner by the kitchen fire; the Jew did his message; the prisoner said he could get more money for them; I ask'd him if he was the person that own'd the goods; he answered yes, and he gave them to the Jew to sell; then I charged the constable with him; but withal I told him, if he would tell me where he had the goods I would let him go. He would give no account how he came by them; I took him before the siting Alderman; there he could give no account; so he was committed; they are a very particular sort of goods, and very hard to come at in London; and they were offered to me at a price less than what we sell them at.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say they are your goods?</p>
               <p>White. I don't swear to them, but I really believe they are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you the goods from?</p>
               <p>White. I had them from Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them before they were lost?</p>
               <p>White. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they lost from?</p>
               <p>White. They were lost in the passage from the ship to the Custom-house, I imagine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were not lost on board the ship?</p>
               <p>White. I can't tell that; my having lost such goods, and these being brought me to sell, made me desirous to trace it out.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you lost such goods at all?</p>
               <p>White. I had an envoyce that such goods were shipped on board such a ship; and when I came to examine the goods, I found such good were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible such goods might be lost in Holland?</p>
               <p>White. It is possible, but not likely.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you charge the prisoner with before Mr. Alderman Stevenson?</p>
               <p>White. There I charged him with buying them, knowing them to have been stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any evidence of that?</p>
               <p>White. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say there you imagined some custom-house officer took them?</p>
               <p>White. I do not charge any body with taking them, though I really think them to be my goods.</p>
