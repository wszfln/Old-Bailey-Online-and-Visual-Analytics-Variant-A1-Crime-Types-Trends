                  </hi>. I am an assistant to William Abner Vaughan, a linen draper, of Aldgate. The male prisoner was a porter in Mr. Vaughan's service—I have seen the female prisoner at the shop—on Sunday, 11th Nov., in consequence of directions from Mr. Vaughan, I and William Bun-dock, another assistant, concealed ourselves in the shop—about 6 o'clock the male prisoner was admitted—that was the usual time for him to come to the house—I do not know who admitted him—Mr. Vaughan and his</p>

               <p>family then left the house, and went to a place of worship—we were then in concealment in the shop, under the window—there is a partition that sepa<lb/>rates the passage of the private door from the shop—the partition is put up like shutters—when the partition is up, there is no means of getting from the passage into the shop without taking down one of the shutters—when I and Bundock concealed ourselves the partition was perfect, all the shutters were up and fastened—we were fastened up inside—we had the key of the shop door leading to the other part of the house—about 25 minutes to 7 o'clock I heard the male prisoner come down the stairs—he opened the side street door, and let the female prisoner in—I saw him through a crack between the shutters—he said to her, "You are late to-night"—she made some reply about two children—she had the child with her that she has now in her arms—they then went up stairs, to a room above the shop, and were talking between two and three minutes—I then heard the male prisoner approaching the stairs leading to the kitchen—he passed by, and went down into the kitchen, and returned with a knife in his hand—I could see that by the gas light in the passage at the top of the stairs—I then heard foot<lb/>steps coming down the stairs that I had seen them go up—by means of the knife they unfastened the bolt, and took down the shutter—I could not see which did that; I had to get to my place of concealment again—the male prisoner entered the shop first—the female handed in a light, which was placed upon a stand, and then she came in herself—she then took down from a shelf two lengths of printed cotton for dresses, and laid them on the counter, close by where I was concealed—she then undid a wrapper which was on the counter, but did not take anything from it—while she was doing this, the male prisoner was in the centre of the shop, walking backwards and for<lb/>wards—she then took down another wrapper, of black Coburg cloth, and cut about two yards from one of the lengths—the male prisoner went to the opposite side of the shop, brought a drawer of ribbons, and placed them on the counter, by the side or in front of the female—she then tied up the wrapper, or put the string round it, and was going to put it back into the fixture—the male prisoner made some remark about the wrapper, to which she sharply replied, "I shan't"—she put up the wrapper—she got on the ladder to do it—I could not hear what it was he said to her—she then cut lengths from several pieces of the ribbon, and wound them round her hand—they were placed with the other goods upon the counter, about a yard from where I was hid, and they both went to the opposite side of the shop—the male prisoner then reached from the top fixture of the shop a paper of wool shirts and handed them to the female—she was then holding a lighted candle—the female undid the paper, and the male asked her whether they were the right sort, and she replied they were very fine ones, and he said the paper was written on <hi rend="italic">Supers</hi>, and they both laughed—the male prisoner then made some remark about leaving, as the time was up, and the child was crying up stairs—they looked through several boxes, I did not see them take anything—they then came into the centre of the shop, and the female asked for table covers—they got over the counter to the side of the shop they were first in—the female took down a wrapper of table covers, took two from them and replaced the wrapper—she then looked over several fixtures, containing lengths for dresses, of different textures, and from one she took a length of six yards of woollen and cotton stuff—she laid the various things upon her arms, and went out of the shop—before that, he asked whether there was anything else she required, that was before she took down the table covers—I believe she made some reply, but I did not hear what it was—it was after that she went and took down some table</p>

               <p>covers—as soon as she had left the shop the male prisoner followed, behind a stand close against the opening—I then got from my place of concealment—the male prisoner left the shop—I saw the female go up stairs first with the goods on her arms—the male prisoner then put up the shutters again, and followed—he had not seen me at that time—I and bundock went up the opposite stairs which we had seen them come down, and at the top of the stairs I saw the female prisoner with the goods at her feet—I went up rather quickly—I said, "Well, Mrs. Peckham"—Bundock said, "You had better go into the room"—her husband was then in the room with the child in his arms—the female entered the room, followed by Bundock—she wished to come out to get her bonnet—I would not let her pass—we had a short scuffle there, and by force we kept her back—I locked Bundock and the two prisoners in the room from the outside, and I remained outside the door—she asked several times to be allowed to get her bonnet, and then she said, "Let us go and put the goods back, and let us both off, for my husband's sake, for it is all my fault, and not his"—she repeatedly asked me to allow her to go up or down stairs, and also the male prisoner—I declined—she was kept there until Mr. Vaughan came home—I told Bundock to look after the fire—when Mr. Vaughan came home I gave him some inform-ation—when I went into the room with Mr. Vaughan the male prisoner said, "I will bring all the goods back I have got at home"—a constable was sent for, and they were taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Paradise-row, Islimgton-green, and am a warehouseman. On 9th Nov., I was Grossing from Fleet-street to Ludgate-hill, about 5 o'clock—I saw a crowd at the obelisk—I stopped and there was a man selling gold rings for a penny apiece—a soldier was looking at one of them, which he had purchased—while I was looking at him I felt a pull at my watch chain—my watch was in my waistcoat pocket—I glanced down, and detected the prisoner taking the watch off the ring—I saw the watch in his hand—when he had got possession of the watch he darted across the road—I ran after him—he dodged amongst the cobs and omnibuses—I did not lose sight of him—I came up with him at the obelisk in Bridge-street—when I was in the act of seizing him, he gave me the watch and said, "Here you are, what is the matter?"—I attempted to seize him, but I missed him and he darted across the road—I pursued him—he attempted, to rush into the middle of the crowd—I cried, "Stop thief!" and he was caught by a man in the crowd—I never lost sight of him once—I got hold of him, and with assistance took him to the station—I gave the watch to the officer at the station—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. 1 am the proprietor of the shop in Mason's-alley; Hustwaite and Header have been in my employment as journeymen, Hust-waite for about one month, and Reader about three months—they slept in a room in the house—I do not reside there, except occasionally—there is a door bell which communicates with their bedroom—on Friday morning I returned to the shop from market, about half past 6 o'clock—I found the shop closed—I endeavoured to ring the prisoners' bell, and wondered that it did not sound—after making two attempts to ring it, I rang the house bell—this cloth produced is mine—I was not at all acquainted with Lock and Hill—I saw the meat that was taken in the cart—it was mine—I saw it at the police station in Moor-lane, and recognised it immediately—it weighed 80 1/2 lbs., and was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—Hustwaite and Reader had no authority from me to remove the meat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Wilson's employment On Thursday night, 15th Nov., I was outside the shop from 7 to 8 o'clock, and saw Lock and Hill come through White Rose-court—Hustwaite went and spoke to them in Mason's-alley—Hustwaite then returned to the shop, and they passed and went to the Butler's Head public house—Hustwaite followed them and went in also—I saw no more of them that night—on the Friday night, I saw them again, between 7 and 8 o'clock—they came through White Rose-court, and Hustwaite went and spoke to them in the court, and then returned to the shop in the same way as before—they came through Mason's alley this time—I took off the bell on the Thursday afternoon—we went up to clean ourselves, and we generally used to smoke there, and I took off the bell that we should not be disturbed, and I forgot to put it back.</p>

I said yes; he said, 'I have some meat to take, will you take me up at the end of Mason's-alley?' I accordingly went there, and they put the meat into the cart I never said, 'Is it all right?' or, 'Are you ready?' then the officer came and took charge of the meat, and likewise of me. I deny knowing it to be stolen." <hi rend="italic">Hill said</hi>, "I have been staying with this young man (Lock) about two or three days, and he asked me if I would go down to the market this morning, and ride with him.

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the London Militia, and live at Providence-row, Hoxton. On Wednesday evening, 23rd Oct., I was returning home with my wife, at a little after 12 o'clock, perhaps a quarter past—my wife was some few yards behind me—the prisoners came up, and said, "Oh! you have got a top coat on, but still we can see you belong to the militia; do you want any recruits?"—I said, "Well, if you are in<lb/>clined to enlist, you had better make application at Oliver's yard, I will see you there to-morrow morning"—that is the depot for the militia—they then walked on, the same way with me, and suddenly Boyce, the tall man, made a spring upon me, and pinioned me against the railings of the church—he was in front of me, and held the railing, with his arm under my throat, to prevent my hallooing, and my head against the railings—I was helpless, and the other person then tore my watch from my trowsers pocket; it was attached by an Albert chain, which they broke, and got the watch—I had, as near as I can guess, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in, my jacket pocket—I distinctly felt his hand in that pocket, and afterwards missed the money—my wife screamed very loudly, and Boyce left go of me and seized her, and then I seized Rush worth by the neck handkerchief; there was a considerable scuffle be<lb/>tween us, and I got my watch out of his hand—I had him on the ground, and Boyce was kicking me violently about the body and head, to make me let go of Rushworth—I did not get my money back, Rushworth got up and ran; I ran after him, met a policeman, and he was taken into custody—I was weakened by the kicking, and could not hold Rushworth any longer—I was down in the mud with him—a policeman met us both run<lb/>ning, and stopped us both—after I had been before the Magistrate next day, and preferred the charge against Rushworth, I saw Boyce in the waiting</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutors wife. I went with him to see a friend home, and having left her at her residence we were going home—as we passed the railings of Hoxton church my husband was about four yards in advance of me, and I saw Boyce holding him by the collar or throat, and Rushworth doing something to him, but I could not see what—my husband had his back to the iron rails and could make no resistance in the way he was held—I got between them, and said, "Let him alone, he is my hus<lb/>band"—Boyce instantly left go of him, and took me by the shoulders and held me tightly, and Rushworth instantly struck my husband in the face across my shoulders-there was a struggle between them—after that I called "Help!" as loud as I could—I heard my husband say to Rushworth, "You wretch, you have got my watch;" they then struggled together, and both fell on the ground—I then got from Boyce, and tried to help my husband off the ground, but Rushworth seized me by the throat, and with his disengaged hand struck me on the head—I did not fall, but Boyce then took hold of me again by the shoulder, and I called, "Police!"—Rushworth then ran, and my husband pursued him, crying, "Police!" and "Stop thief!"—I did not see what became of Boyce, I saw nothing of him till next day, when I was before the Magistrate—he was there sitting on a form near the reporters' box, and I thought I knew him as one of the men, but I was rather flurried, and did not speak of it; the Magistrate asked me if I should know him again, and I told him, "Yes"—I saw him again with his hat on, and was then certain that he was the man who held me the night before—I and my husband then went back and gave evidence against him—my hus<lb/>band works for the regiment, and had some work on his hands at that time—I know that he left work to go before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>the station at that time—I should suppose the charge had taken about ten minutes, not longer—when Boyce came, he asked mo whether I could take bail—I told him it was a case of felony, and I could not take bail—this was almost immediately after the charge had been booked—until the charge has been entered we do not allow persons unconnected with the matter to come into the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live in King-street, Covent<lb/>garden. On Friday evening, 16th Nov., I was in the shop—the prisoner Scales came in a little after 5 o'clock, just as the gas was lighted—she wanted some paper and gave me a shilling—I said it was bad, and I rung the bell—she told me her name was Ann Walker—I said, "Have you any mother?" she said, "No"—I said, "I will send my young woman with you, you shall not get off so easy "—she said she did not expect to get off go easy—she said, "My brother gave it me to buy the paper; he is going to write a letter "—I asked where her brother was, she said he was outside—I sent for a policeman—he came in, and the prisoner Johnson followed him in, and said, "What is the matter?"—I told him—he said he was very sorry indeed, and he offered me a good shilling for the bad one—the police<lb/>man said, "I don't think this lady will take the shilling"—I said I should be very sorry to do anything to hurt a child having no mother or father—Johnson said, "I will go to the station with you"—he said he gave the child the shilling, that he had received change for a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—Scales was taken to the station—Johnson said, "I will go and tell the inspector the truth, that I gave her the shilling"—he went with us as far as the corner of Russell-street—he then ran away—I heard no more of him till the Sunday morning, when I was sent for to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant at Mr. William Bickley's shawl and mantle warehouse, No. 7, Ludgate-street, not many yards from Ludgate-hill. On Wednesday, 31st Oct., the prisoner came to our shop, between 7 and 8 o'clock, nearer 7 than 8—she wished to look at a mantle—I showed her several—she selected one at 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and presented a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in payment—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I passed it to Miss Payne to be handed to Mr. Bick<lb/>ley, who was at the desk—he called me to him, and in consequence of what he said, I went to the prisoner and asked if she had any smaller change—she said she had not—I then asked her name and address—she gave me "Mary Ann Cox, No. 5, Union-street, Borough-road," which I wrote on the back of the note in her presence—I find that on this note there is also the name of Pawson and Co.—I saw that at the time—they are persons carrying on a large business in St. Paul's churchyard—finding that the pri<lb/>soner had no change, I again sent the note to Mr. Bickley by Miss Payne—she returned with the change, and gave it to the prisoner—I packed up the mantle in brown paper, and the prisoner left with it—the note was brought back, stamped "forged," on the Monday following—it is customary for persons in business to put their names upon notes in their possession—seeing Pawson and Co. upon this note led me to suppose it had passed through their hands.</p>

On Thurs<lb/>day, 1st Nov., about 9 o'clock in the morning, when I got to business, I saw a parcel on the counter directed to Mrs. Cox, Union-street—I took the parcel there—I inquired for Mrs. Cox, and the prisoner came into the pas<lb/>sage, and then showed me into a small room—I said I had brought the parcel that she had purchased the previous evening—she then gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I examined it, and saw W. Bowman, of Woolwich, on the back, and I think the name of Pawson and Co.—this is the note—I had not been in the shop on the previous evening when the prisoner tendered the note—I said. I had not change with me, but if she would allow me, I would send her change in about half an hour—I was about to return with the parcel and the note, when the prisoner said, "Oh! no, you are not going to take the parcel as well as the note"—I said that she might depend upon having the change, as ours was a respectable house, and I gave her one of our cards—after some little hesitation, she allowed me to take both the note and the parcel—she told me she had received the note from a sailor who had been sleeping with her for three nights, and that he had sailed for the Crimea—I returned to the shop with the note and the parcel, and sent it to the Bank by the apprentice; it was returned, marked "forged"—I am sure this is the note, the apprentice's writing is on the back—about an hour after this, the prisoner came to Mr. Baker's shop—she said she bad come for the change of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that she had given me—I presented the note to her, saying it was a forged one—she said she believed it was a good one, and it was given to her by a sailor—I said as she doubted it being a bad one, she had better go with me to the inspector, and he would prove that the note was a forged one—she said, "You had better send for the inspector; let him come here"—I then went to the police station, a sergeant came back with me, and the prisoner and I went with him to the station—I left the prisoner there, and the note—I did not give her in charge—she informed the inspector where she obtained the note.</p>

If your life be of any consequence to you, we advise you to punctually execute all that which is here described, because perhaps you will not believe that our societies are well united and in full relation with all others; therefore, if ever it should come into your head to escape from here, in whatever place you may go, or soon or late, you will be taken and killed. So if you should attempt to avoid it by advising the police, you may be certain of walking very little longer; but, on the contrary, we assure you that if you will execute the above, you will be able to travel where you wish; that no one will molest you, neither will they ask you for anything further"—I opened that letter and read it—I went to the Justice room at Guildhall, and communicated with the police—on the night of 2nd Nov. I went to the General Post-office in St. Martin's-le-Grand, at 12 o'clock precisely—I found nobody there at the moment, but shortly afterwards I saw the prisoner—I did not know him before—he was walking towards me when I first saw him, he was alone—he spoke to me, and said in a very impudent manner," Have you received the letter?"—he spoke in Italian—I said, "Yes"—he then said, "You know the word?"—I said, "What word?"—he said, "Mario "—I replied, "Primo."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I merely asked him the way to my house? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He did not ask me any question of that sort—I put my hand in my pocket where I had a bag containing 300 farthings—on my putting my hand in my pocket, the prisoner looked frightened, and fell back, and said, "Be so kind as to come with me"—he said that three or four times—I said, "No, according to the letter I am obliged to pay here "—he said, "No, no, no, be so kind as to come with me," drawing back—I had some officers in attend<lb/>ance, not far from me, on the opposite side of the street—when I saw the prisoner fall back and like run away, I made a signal to the officers, and they came in a moment and arrested him—they asked him, "What do you want with this gentleman?"—he said, "Oh, nothing! I want nothing."</p>

On Tuesday night, 23rd Oct., about 11 o'clock, I was at the Eagle Tavern, City-road—I was in company with the prisoner, and went to the bar and had a glass of brandy and water with him—I left the bar and went into the front coffee room—I left the prisoner at the bar, and bid him good night—I did not stay in the coffee room more than two minutes—I then came out in company with a gentleman who I had met there, the prisoner was still at the bar, and as I was going out, he said, "Is that gentleman going to see you home?"—I said, "He is going part of the way"—he said, "If you allow that gentleman to go home with you, I will kick your——"—I took no notice, but bid him good night, and walked away with the gentleman—I did not see the prisoner say more that night—about 4 o'clock the following afternoon he came to my apart<lb/>ment in Great Chart-street—I was alone—he came into the room, locked the door after him, and said he had bad news for me—I asked him what it was—he appeared very agitated—he pulled a knife out of his pocket and opened it, and said, as I had left him on the previous evening he intended to do for me—he said he would cut my throat, and he held up the knife—I said, "Don't be so ridiculous, don't be so silly; I will do anything for you if you won't be so silly"—I believe he had been drinking, but as he had the knife open, and said he would cut my throat, of course, I expected he in<lb/>tended to do so, and I put up my hand, and by so doing the knife out my finger—he took hold of me with his left hand, at the top of my dress—that was at the time I lifted up my hand—he had the knife in his right hand, holding it up, and I put up my hand and it cut my finger—he did not do anything with the knife, further than cut my finger with it—it was cut across, just at the top—it is getting perfectly well now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 487). On the evening of 27th Oct., I was on duty, and Mr. Ashley told me that a female had complained to him of a soldier on the bridge in a very indecent state—I went along the left hand side the bridge, and saw the prisoner standing on the middle of the pavement—his trowsers were undone, and his person quite exposed—he was not doing anything, but standing with his hand down against his person—he was three or four feet from the wall standing on the middle of the pave<lb/>ment, his face was towards the gate—there was a gas light just by—I saw him plainly—I made him do up his trowsers, and took him—I asked him what he meant by such beastly conduct—he said he should continue doing so as long as he thought proper—I took him into custody—he walked quietly with me through the gate to the City side, and just as he got on this side he said, "Let me go; if you don't let me go, I will kick you in the private parts, and injure you for life"—I said, "I will take good care you don't do that"—he walked about four or five yards further, and then com<lb/>menced kicking—he threw himself on his back, and still continued kicking upwards, trying to kick me in any part he could—I attempted to lay hold of him by the collar, and in stooping to lay hold of his collar, I caught his foot in my left eye—it was a very violent kick indeed—a great deal of blood ran out of the eye, and out of the nostrils—the moment he kicked me, it threw me back, and he got up and ran away—I immediately called out, "Stop him!" and Mr. Ashley stopped him—Mr. Homes assisted in taking him—I have been attended by Mr. Childs, the surgeon, ever since—I have been unable to do duty, and am so still.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the City Police Force. I saw Gaul on 28th Oct, he applied to be put on the sick list, in consequence of a severe contusion of the left eye—he was quite blind with that eye, and the vision of it at the present moment is very defective—a violent kick would have produced that injury—I was for some time apprehensive that he would lose the sight of that eye—I now hope he will recover it, but I fear it will be some time before they will have his services in the police—the kick to produce that injury must have been very violent.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 56, College-street West, Camden-town. On 15th Dec., 1854, I was the driver of one of Messrs. Pickford's carts—the firm is Joseph Baxendale and others, and they trade under the same of Pickford and Co.—on that day I received some packages in my cart, at the North Western Railway, one of which was addressed to Messrs. Brockle<lb/>hurst of Milk-street—that package was safe when I was at the end of Milk-street—I had to deliver two boxes at Mr. Evans's, Cheapside, and when I came back to the cart the box was gone—it could not hare fallen off, it must have been stolen by somebody—I had had to wait at the station for the train from Macclesfield, and these packages came up by it—I had other goods to deliver at Messrs. Brocklehurst's, but I lost this truss—it was 10 minutes to 8 o'clock when I got out of the station.</p>

Lightly and Simon, our agents—I inquired of the manager, in his presence, what was to be done in the matter, as duty had been paid on English goods—he said, "I very much doubt whether you can get the duty back, but if you wish to do so, you have to get several certificates; one from the Custom-house agent who received it in France, and another from the one who shipped it again to England"—we then left together, and while we were yet in Lime-street, he asked me again what instructions the manager had given—I took a pencil and piece of paper, and wrote down the names of the certificates which the manager had said would be required, and gave it to him—he said that he would see that everything was done, so as to recover the duty—I believe he said that the goods when first they went from England had been booked in Regent-circus; as there are several booking offices at Regent-circus, Piccadilly, I told him if it had happened to go to our own office, No. 33, Regent-circus, it would be much more easy to go into the matter—he said that they had been in bond in France, and that Mr. Beaumont had ordered them to come back to England—I never saw him in the office again, but met him two or three times over the water—we had no further conversation about the matter.</p>

Lightly, and begged me to find Mr. Beaumont, and take him—I said that I could not part with him till the case was cleared up—I allowed him to go to his house, as he had not had any breakfast, but I went with him—it was then about 11 o'clock—at one time he said that he should not go with me—I told him that if he did not, I should send for two men in uniform immediately—he then said that I had no business to take him unless I had a warrant—I showed him my warrant card, this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—we always carry it to show our authority—I think it was after that that he said that he would not go—I think I showed it to him in the public house.</p>

I am the prisoner's daughter; the deceased, Ca<lb/>therine Lordon, was my mother—I was living with my father and mother in Parliament-court, Finsbury, near the Old Artillery-ground—we had only one room, the front room, second floor—my father and mother, myself and two brothers occupied the same room—my brothers are younger than I, one is fourteen, and the other twelve years of age—my father used to be a weaver—for some time before my mother's death he had been employed in the tea warehouse, at St. Katherine's Docks—on Monday night, 17th Sept, I was at a raffle at the Green Dragon public house—it was a raffle for the benefit of my mother—I went there about 10 o'clock by myself—when I got there, I found Mr. Kingston, my father and mother, and two of my mother's brothers, their wives, and a daughter of one of them, and seve<lb/>ral other people—Kingston worked in the same employment as my father—he was an acquaintance of my father's—my father was intoxicated, and so was Kingston—my mother was sober, she might have had a drop of some-thing to drink, but you could not see it—I remained at the Green Dragon till twenty minutes after 12 o'clock—there was not much drinking going on, while I was there—there were several pots of porter had, but no spirits—about a quarter after 10 o'clock one of my brothers came in for me, to fetch me—I did not go with him—upon that, my father <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me, and one of my uncles, Daniel Crees, got up and took my father by the shoulder, and pushed him down the stairs—in about twenty minutes afterwards, my father came back again to the room, and brought a pint of beer in his hand—Thomas Crees then took him by the waist and half way carried him down stairs, and then let him fall the rest—my father was tipsy at that time—he was not more tipsy than he was before—he did not return to the room after that—I remained there till a quarter past 12 o'clock, and then went home with my mother—as we went out of the public house I saw my father standing on the kerb—he did not speak to us—as we were going home we met Kingston at the door—he was at the door when we came there—he sent me for a pot of beer, and he, and my mother, and I drank it at the door, in the court—I took the pot back and then returned,</p>

"—my father struck Kingston with the poker, they then had a struggle, and both fell on the pavement, and then Kingston got up and went away—my father, after that, went up into his room on the second floor—I followed him—I went into the room and lay down on the bed—my father went out again about two minutes afterwards—my mother was on the third landing at that time—my father went out and went through the court, but I could not see which way he turned—in about ten minutes he came back—I was then on the first floor landing—he passed me—it was dark there, he could not see me as he went by—he went up into his room on the second floor, and locked the door—my two brothers were at that time asleep in the room—I passed the night on the first floor landing—ray mother passed the night on the third floor landing—about half-past 5 o'clock in the morning my mother called one of my brothers to go to his work—he left the house just before 6 o'clock—about half an hour afterwards my other brother went out—my mother called him to go—he left about twenty minutes to 7 o'clock—I walked to the door of the court with him—after that, my mother came down stairs to me at the door—she took a walk with me in the street—I was going somewhere to some business I had—before I parted with my mother, I saw my father at the corner of Sandy's-row; that is a court close by where we live—that was about quarter to 7 o'clock—I parted with my mother at the top of the street—that was the last time I saw her alive—I heard of her death about quarter to 8 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the relieving overseer of the parish of St. Pancras, and have been so for some years. In consequence of complaints made to me, I think on 21st Sept. last, I inquired into the state of the lad James Frederick Weedon—he was one of five children belonging to the prisoner, at that time living in a house in Compton-street, Brunswick-square—I also found a woman living with the prisoner, a strong, stout woman—she was not the mother of the children, but a woman with whom he coha<lb/>bited—the deceased boy was twelve years of age, I think—he was a very small, decrepid looking child—I found him sitting on a stool by the side of his father, sewing round the toe of a shoe, with the usual leather apron on, and a strap upon his foot—he was in a very miserable, emaciated condition; he was covered with vermin, and was a mere shadow, skin and bone, nothing more—it was a fearful sight that all of them presented—I found some food in the cupboard, part of a neck of mutton, and there was a saucepan on the fire, with some vegetables, as they told me, and they had bread—the prisoner and the woman were looking very well and healthy—the whole of the chil<lb/>dren were in a wretched condition; I took them at once to the Clerkenwell police court—the prisoner said he believed a good deal had been said against him which was untrue, that there was a conspiracy against him, and he was very thankful I had come to make an inquiry—I asked him if he would accompany me to the police court, which he consented to do, and he went—he told me that he had corrected his children, the deceased, and a younger boy, for going through the streets, and picking up what he called <hi rend="italic">muck</hi> in the street, and they had promised him they would not do so again, and he believed they would not; but they were in the habit of doing so, notwithstanding what he gave them—before I went to the police court, I sent for Dr. Morris Davis to see the state in which the children were—from the police court I took the deceased to the workhouse, where he was imme<lb/>diately placed under the care of Mr. Waldegrave, the house surgeon—he got better for a time and seemed to have more flesh upon him, and then he rapidly sank, and died about three weeks ago—a girl also died, the others have improved very much—they look like children now, they looked more like ancient people before, than infants, they were ghastly creatures.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner Q.</hi> You say you found my children all covered with vermin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, their heads—I saw quantities of lice in their hair, I did not see any upon their bodies—I cannot speak as to their clothing, they were chiefly about their necks—the boys had clean collars on, although their clothes were very dirty and ragged; it seemed to me as if somebody was expected to come, and they were put off to the best advantage—I did not observe their linen, it appeared to me very dirty, it might hare been clean on on the Sunday—I should say the meat I saw in the cupboard was enough for a meal—there appeared to be some bread in the cupboard and some cold</p>

                  </hi>. I am a milkman, and live at No. 2, Little Guildford-street I carry my milk about myself—I have seen the prisoner's children about the street—my attention was called to the deceased boy somewhere about July—it might have been about Aug. or Sept.—I knew him when they were living in the Colonnade, and in Compton-street, and before that—he was in a very bad state—my attention was first called to him as I was feeding my fowls out at the door—he was coming up the street, and he ran into the road and picked up some of the cold potatoes that I was throwing out to the fowls, and began to eat them ravenously, using both hands—I asked him where he lived, and he told me in the Colonnade—I have seen him pick up pieces in the street two or three times—he was very thin, and very dirty, and had several nasty bruises about him, and he looked regularly deplorable—he had a cap on—he came into my house, and I took off his cap, and fed him in my house, and I told him to come every day about 3 o'clock—I fed him I suppose for about a month; it might have been more—he improved under that treatment in a fortnight, he did not look like the same boy—I continued to feed him until his father moved out of the Colonnade, when he refused his coming to me any more; so the boy told me, and so did his father—he told me he would not allow his boy to come to me any more, because he was encroaching upon me, and the boy told him my wife looked cool upon him—I said my wife did no<lb/>thing of the sort—there was a great deal of altercation in front of his house, and a great mob assembled, and cried shame upon Weed on—it was several parties standing by, not me; I did not interfere, because I had my milk pails and was about my business—I did not see the boy again after that until a day or two before he was taken to the work-house—he was then in a very bad state—he came up to me in the street as I was coming along Old Compton-street, and said, "How do you do, sir? "—I put down my pails, and shook hands with him—he said he was hungry, and asked me for a halfpenny or a penny, which I gave him—I had been in the habit of giving him a halfpenny or a penny—he was in his shirt sleeves—I took up his shirt sleeves, and his little arms were very thin, and very dirty, you could have scratched the dirt off; and there were two very bad places on his head, nearly the size of a shilling, with the hair and skin cut right off—I asked how he came by them, and he said, "That is where father hit me"—some men took him down opposite his father's window, and they called him out to show him the child, and there was a mob round the door—the prisoner came out, and said to me, "Why did you not come to me like a man? "—there was an altercation, and they hooted and pelted him, and he ran in doors.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal dealer, and live at No. 7, Colonnade, Brunswick-square. I have known the prisoner since May, 1854—he took a room from me in May, 1854, and staid there till June, 1855, and then he moved to Old Compton-street—I lived in the same house—I had the shop—the prisoner lived there with his five children—the woman did not live with him at first—she was lodging in the house with a woman in the first floor front—she afterwards lived with the prisoner, and moved with him to Compton-street—for the first three months they were at my house, the children were kept complete prisoners indoors, and were not allowed to go out for anything; then by my persuasion he did let them come down for about half an hour at a time—an old lady and one or two neighbours cried shame on him for keeping them so confined—he did several jobs for me, and I had a chance then of going up into his room, and I have frequently seen the deceased lad—he was a cripple, and very much knock-kneed—I tried to persuade the prisoner to let him go the hospital, but he would not—I have frequently seen him, when the lad has been at work, and has not done something to suit him, hit him on the knees with a hammer, and several times with a last—they were rather harder blows than I should like to have had—I have seen him throw the last across the room at them—they were kept very dirty—I think they had but very little food, for they were always picking up anything they could see in the street, and the neighbours all round were giving them something to eat—they were, as you may say, walking ghosts—I considered them quite starved—I never examined the deceased boy to see whether he had any sores about him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident surgeon at St. Pancras work-house. I saw the children when they were brought in—the deceased child was wretchedly emaciated, scarcely any skin on his bones—the bones had not come through the skin, but there was very little covering—he was very filthy, and covered with vermin—I found no marks of violence about his person—he was suffering from hopping cough at the time—that alone would not have been sufficient to reduce him to the state in which I found him—it scarcely reduces a child at all under ordinary circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But it is fatal sometimes, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is sometimes, in consequence of inflammation of the lungs supervening.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There was no such affection here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the boy was suffering from tubercular disease of the lungs, consumption—there was suppuration, there was a cavity in the lungs at that time—he only lived one month after his admission.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could the very best diet have prevented such a child from being emaciated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but want of proper necessaries might have brought him into that condition, it might have engendered the disease—consumption does often come without that, it is very often an hereditary taint, but it is very often produced by insufficiency of food—the child died from disease of the lungs, but that disease was accelerated by withholding proper necessaries—he was expectorating <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing there were originally some taint in the lungs, would the treatment that you have heard described aggravate that disease? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Unquestionably, and would probably present the appearances I found—it would accelerate the death of the child—in fact, the only treatment for such patients is to give them as large an amount of nutritious food as they can possibly take; and, of course, the withholding it from such a child would accelerate his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you try better diet, after he came in, under your treat<lb/>ment for any length of time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was put on the most nutritious diet that he could take, port wine and mutton chops, and I gave him cod liver oil—for about a fortnight he seemed somewhat to improve under that treatment, and then he fell back again, and rapidly declined, in fact, he was in a hopeless condition when he came into the workhouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you make a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—there was extensive disease—in my judgment, from what I saw of the child, from the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and from the evidence I have heard of the treatment the child received, the neglect contributed to its death, it accelerated it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any other disease of a fatal nature except that of the lungs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the disease was entirely confined to the lungs—it is very difficult to state positively of what standing that disease was, the child had been expectorating <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> for five or six weeks before he came into the workhouse; and it is possible that tubercles might have existed in the lungs for a considerable period before that, for twelve months, or for two years—during all that time the child would have a tendency to be very</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185511260074"/>
               <p>much emaciated; there is always defective nutrition when tubercles exist in the lungs—there is always a wasting of the body, more or less, but not of that extreme kind, until the tubercles soften down, and <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> is expectorated; of course, to expose such a child to the treatment described would be to aggravate the symptoms in every possible way—the girl has since died—the other children have improved very much indeed, wonderfully—at this time they are robust, and in good health—that would assist me in coming to a conclusion as to the state in which they had been kept—I apprehend that they have since had a better diet than a poor man's children would have—they were all suffering from hopping cough, and were, therefore, put on better diet than a man in the prisoner's circumstances could give them—they have had mutton diet and porter—I see no reason why they should not grow up robust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner Q.</hi> You say they were covered with vermin, it was only their heads, was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Their bodies were also covered with bites from vermin—the deceased child was ricketty from its birth, and that would grow from weakness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, made a statement of some length, but in a very feeble and indistinct voice; it was to the effect that for upwards often years he had been struggling through severe poverty and illness to support himself, his wife and family; that after his wife's death his troubles became heavier; his elder children were afflicted and could render him little or no assistance, and being a poor mechanic himself he could only do work of an inferior description, and earn small wages, from</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week, when able to work; and with the aid of the person who, subsequently, came to live with him and take care of his children, about</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">that nearly the whole of last winter he was laid up with rheumatic gout, and unable to work, and but for the assistance of charitable persons they must all have starved; that the children always partook of what he had; and as to the strawberries and fruit alluded to, it was purchased with a penny, and a halfpenny given to the children, and was eaten by themselves</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a housekeeper, and live at No. 4, Wilmot-street, Brunswick-square—I have known the prisoner from fourteen to eighteen years, before he was married—at that time we kept a shoemaker's shop in Kingsgate-street, Holborn, and he worked for us, and has done so, on and off, up to the present time—he was always a very poor workman and not able to do good work, but repairing, and what we term tenpenny work—the children were always in a very poor, sickly state, born and bred in starvation—they were always in a dreadful state of poverty, I have relieved them over and over again when they lived in Bedford-court, with a small amount, such as 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at a time, and a few old clothes—his poor wife then was in the greatest distress—I never knew him do anything wrong in all his life, he was always sober and honest, he would not have a loaf of bread if he could not pay for it—I had no idea there was anything amiss between him and his children—they have been in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to my shop with little jobs of work—his son James was a cripple, he had knock knees—he was in my shop a fortnight previous to this occurrence, and he then had the hooping cough dreadfully; in fact, all the children had it—the boy coughed so badly while he was at my shop that he was obliged to go out and go to the kerb—for the last few months they were very badly off, and were quite objects—I believe the hooping cough began in May or June—the prisoner used to earn from 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week with us some years back, but latterly,</p>

I was in the Star and Garter beer shop, Parliament-street, Bethnal-green—there were some others there—I was playing at bagatelle—the prisoner was there, he was not sober—Todd was there a little while before me—he was as sober as I was—the prisoner was standing alongside, looking on—he had a pint of ale and a glass, he brushed the glass down with the tail of his coat—the publican came and said, "Who broke this glass? "—some one said that the prisoner did—he said he would not pay for it, the landlord was going to turn him out, and I got in between them, and prevented him turning him out—I was standing at the bar, talking to a friend, and Todd said to the prisoner, "You have got 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for the glass"—he then walked out at one door, and came in at the other, and the prisoner stabbed him in the back—I saw the knife in his hand—he then went back towards the tap room door—I went to take the knife from him, and he stabbed me in the left shoulder—he stabbed either at me or the next to me, but I caught the stab on my left arm—I was taken to the hospital—the wound is healing, but is not quite healed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, V</hi> 17). On 22nd Oct, from informa<lb/>tion, I went into the field where Sir William Clay's sheep had been kept—from thence I went to a plantation, where I found this skin and bead of the sheep, and the entrails were rolled up in the skin—on the 23rd I went to the prisoner Elms' premises, which are about a mile and a half from the prosecutor's, and on looking up stairs I saw a shelf, and on it a bundle—I took it down, and found in it part of a leg of mutton, uncooked—this is it—it has been salted—it was not cut as a butcher would cut it; and on the same shelf was a dish full of fat—to the best of my belief, it was mutton fat—I went to a cupboard, down stairs, and found a saucepan, with some fat in it, and a bone—I sent two constables after Elms, and he was brought to the house to me—I asked him if he had any mutton in the house—he said, "No"—I asked him if he had any fat—he said, "No"—I showed him the mutton and fat that I had found—I said, "How do you account for this? "—he said, "I know nothing about it; my wife bought it"—1 afterwards went to the house of Cox and Hayward—I went up stain, in company with a constable—after I came down, Cox came in, and I said to him, "Have you a candle in the house? "—he said, "No"—Roberts, whom I had left below, had been in the coal cellar, and I desired him to go there again—Cox said, "It is no use your going there"—Roberts went down, and found some mutton—when it was found. Cox said, "O my God! this is the room I occupy," pointing to a front room—on the 24th I took Cox's and Hayward's shoes to the field, and at a gap there I found some marks which corresponded with Elms' left shoe—I tried it by putting the shoe in the impression—I found one footstep there—on the morning of the 22nd there was a very heavy dew; and after I had found the akin and entrails, I could see where some person had been, along the side of the hedge, through this gap, on to the hospital bridge, and across some other fields, into a ploughed field—there were the footsteps of two persons in the ploughed field—I examined them with the shoes, and have no doubt they were Elms' or Hayward's—it was Elms' left shoe that corresponded with the mark in the gap—after Roberts had been in the cellar some time, he brought me up six pieces of mutton—he went down a second time, and brought up a hind quarter, and part of a neck—Roberts gave me this bone—I fitted it with a portion of the bone in the head—the hind quarter, which was left in the skin, fits it exactly—here is a part of the inner skin, which is left inside the skin.</p>

I compared the shoes with the marks—there had not been some heavy rain on the Monday night—there was no rain in the neighbourhood of Twickenham—there was a heavy dew—I compared Elms' left shoe by placing it in the mark in the gap—I did not place it by the side, and make another mark—there is not a worn track leading from that gap—there were two fields, and that is where there was a gate—the ground is trodden down, and I believe there are posts on each side of the gap—when I went to the house, I was not aware which portion was occupied by Cox, and which by Hayward—I did not find anything in the part of the house occupied by Hayward—all that was found was found in the cellar.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 96). On Tuesday, 23rd Oct., I went with sergeant Butcher to the house of Elms—I was with him when the piece of mutton was found—I went to apprehend Elms, he was at work—I told him I wished him to accompany me back—he wanted to know what for—I said, "Will you accompany me; if not I must take you into custody? "—he went back with me and Barker—when we got back to the house, Butcher said to him in my presence, "Have you any mutton in the house? "—he said, "No"—Butcher said, "Are you sure? "—he said, "Not that I am aware of"—Butcher then took the mutton from the shelf over the stairs, which was rolled up in a woman's night gown, and said, "How do you account for this? "—he said, "I know my wife bought it in Kingston market"—I went afterwards to Cox and Hay ward's—I went into the coal hole, and under the bottom step of the stairs I found six pieces of mutton rolled up in an old apron and an old child's frock—when I brought them up, Cox said, "O, my God! "—I never knew Cox before—after I brought these pieces of mutton out, I returned to the coal hole, and at the further end I pulled up the bricks and found a smock frock, and in it a leg and a neck of mutton, which have been produced—I went on the Thursday morning with sergeant Butcher through the gap to the ploughed field—I saw the footmark in the gap—I observed the bottom of the shoe which we had, and compared it with the mark in the gap—it corresponded exactly, on looking at the mark, and then at the shoe before it was fitted to the mark—in my opinion the mark appeared to have been made by this shoe—I have not the least doubt on the subject—when we fitted the shoe into the mark, it was put in as nightly as it could be—it corresponded in length and breadth, and every thing else, and with the single row of nails, and the double row—before it was put in the mark I had noticed the mark of the single row of nails, and the double one—these others are the shoes belonging to Hayward—I found thirty or forty marks in the ploughed field corresponding with these shoes—before I put them into the marks at all they appeared to correspond, and when I put them to any of the marks I did it in the same way, gently—here is an iron tip to this heel—I am able to say that the marks corresponded.</p>

I was on the premises, at the corner of Bread-street-hill, Upper Thames-street—I saw some labourers who did not appear to be doing their work—I went round to the foundation, and saw Reddington running up stairs at a much more rapid pace than I ever saw him before—I called him, he did not answer—he ran up to the roof—I did not see him on the roof—he must have heard me call him—I remember about a coping stone failing—I afterwards spoke to Reddington—I asked him what he went up to the roof of the house for—he said to look for Ward—I said, "What business had you to go up stairs? here was your business, down here"—my men had no right to take lead from the adjoining houses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, of No. 187, Oxford-street. I have a partner—on Wednesday evening, 7th Nov., we had a gray cloth cloak hanging inside the lobby of the door on a brass wire frame—I went out of the shop about a quarter to 8 o'clock, and saw the two prisoners crouched down talking together under the window close to the cloak—the younger prisoner was touching it, and the elder was covering her—I went back into the shop, and immediately afterwards my attention was attracted by the rattling of the wire frame against the inside of the window—I went to the door, and as I was going down the shop I saw the elder prisoner pass rapidly away—I missed the cloak, and saw the younger prisoner standing close to the door—she said, "There goes the woman that has taken your cloak"—I looked in the direction she pointed but could not see her—I said to the young one, "I know you are with her;" and took her into custody—she said that there was nobody with her—she was crying—the cloak is worth about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the window is about a foot and a quarter from the ground—I only just saw them for a moment, and then went back into the shop—I did not know Walker before—I saw her next at Marl borough-street on the Monday week following ten days afterwards—this was on Wednesday—she was then pointed out to me as the person.</p>

I went to the address the child gave, No. 18, Clement's-lane, Strand, and found them all living in one room, but we had not gone there during the week that the child was in custody—when we had got the woman we took the child again at another place, over in Lambeth—she was taken before Mr. Hard<lb/>wicke the first time, and the second time before Mr. Bingham, and without further evidence was committed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 498). About 1 o'clock in the morning of 21st Nov. I was on duty near the tunnel of the Regent's Canal, in the neighbourhood of the Caledonian-road—I heard the cries of a woman in the water—I heard the words "Oh, dear!" several times—I immediately ran to the place from whence the noise proceeded, and turned my light on the water—the cries were still continuing—I could not see any object in the water—in a moment or two Pettit, another officer, came up—I went and roused the men at the house, and asked them whether there was not a skiff or some kind of boat—I returned to where Pettit was, in a few minutes—I saw a boat coming along with the two prisoners in it—I ran, and met them some fifty or sixty yards from the mouth of the tunnel, and called out to them that there was a woman drowning in the tunnel, and to save her if they could, and Pettit told them something after the same manner, when they got to where he was—they then went into the tunnel, and Pettit called out to know whether they had got her, and they said, "Yes"—I then went and met them at the other end of the tunnel—I then saw the body of a woman—she was being towed behind the boat some two or three yards—the rope was tied to the stern of the boat—both the prisoners were in the boat—constable N 478, and another man, assisted to pull her out—I saw her pulled out—the rope was round underneath her arms, with a slip noose—her arms were crossed, and the rope was enclosed in her left hand—her fingers were round the rope—it was about 5 minutes past 1 o'clock when the prisoners' boat went into the tunnel, and about 20 minutes to 2 o'clock when it came out at the other end—the tunnel is about three quarters of a mile long—the cries of the woman had ceased when the boat entered the tunnel.</p>

Between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning in ques-tion I was called to the station to see the body of a woman—life was completely extinct at that time—there was slight remaining warmth over the region of the heart, but that is no proof of existing vitality—in my judgment, she had been dead about half or three quarters of an hour—her death was caused by drowning—if she had been taken out of the water at this end of the tunnel, and proper means applied, I have little doubt but that she would have recovered—it is very rare indeed that life is restored after five minutes' complete submersion, but there are two or three such cases on record—there is hope after five minutes, but very little—from the evidence, I have formed an opinion as to whether she was dead at the time the rope was put round her waist—I will not go so far as to say that she had her faculties when she caught hold of the rope—it was an instinctive effort—I cannot say it would be evidence of mind to form a purpose—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined Q.</hi> The wound on the forehead you say was to the bone; that would be about one-eighth of an inch, would it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A quarter of an inch—there was no contusion round it—it was a clean wound—I do not think, if the blow had been violent, it would have produced a greater effect, considering the hard structure of the frontal bone—it was not fractured—a blow inflicted with all the force a man could use might fracture the skull—the wound was unquestionably inflicted with the knife in this state, not pointed—the knife is square and blunt, and it exactly corresponded with the size of the wound—I do not think the wound on the back of the head could have been inflicted with the knife fully pointed—the wound on the fingers could not have broken the knife—I think that wound must have been inflicted at the same time as the other—probably the hand was raised to protect the face, and it fell on the forehead—I think the point must have been broken first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the 23rd regiment, and have been employed lately on the recruiting service—on 29th Oct. a man named Webb, came with sergeant Clary with the intention of enlisting—Webb, Adams, Watts, and Clary all came together—Watts was another witness for the defendant at the trial—I did not say much to Webb—I knew that they came to enlist, and asked them, but they did not feel inclined to at first—I was there two hours, and afterwards Clary came to me and said, "I think they are in the mind for enlisting now"—Adams and Clary were in the box—I asked Webb if he was married or an apprentice—he said that he was not married, but was living with a girl—Adams must hare heard that—on that I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we are not allowed to enlist married men—if we do, the bounty money comes out of our own pockets—when we got to the police court next day a wife turned up.</p>

Q.</hi> They were two hours in the public house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they were playing at bagatelle and drinking—I cannot say what they were drinking—there were not a great many people there—the public house is in the Broadway, Westminster—I believe the men came from Kingston—I thought they were fit for the army, and was very anxious to have them—they were not anxious at first—I did not persuade them, but it is my duty to get every one I can—I asked them to enlist, but they did not feel inclined—I cannot say exactly how long they remained after that—they knew as well as I did whether it was a glorious thing to be in a battle, as I have never been in one—it was not a large box that I went into, it holds about four people—this was in the afternoon—I did not sit down in the box—I stood up, they were sitting down—no conversation had passed before that about their being married—I had enlisted the prisoner before that—I had asked him if he was married—the men were not drunk, they might have drunk a quart of beer in. the two hours—I never enlist persons that are drunk, I treat them to a glass or two—I should have asked them before I did whether they were married or single, but they did not seem inclined to enlist—I thought they came there to enlist—the sergeant afterwards came and said, "I think they will enlist now," and then I went to the box and asked whether he was married or an apprentice—we are not allowed to enlist apprentices or married men, if we do we have the loss—the question I put was to Webb—Adams was sitting in the same box.</p>

               <p>way, and got some more porter for them, and they played at bagatelle for two hours—I got them into a little box in front of the bar, and at the time they enlisted Adams and Webb only were together—I got their minds made up for enlistment, and sergeant Handicott came and asked Webb if he was willing to enlist—he said "Yes"—he asked if he was married or single, and they both said that they were single men—he gave them a shilling.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You seem to be the person whose business it was to ply them with porter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You mean to encourage them to enlist, my captain sent me out on that duty—I cannot say that I gave them more than two pots of porter—there were two of them—they had some more after they enlisted—in my opinion they had not had four pot before they enlisted, but I will not swear it—I have not to give an account of what I spend for beer—it comes out of my own pocket—I do not know whether, when I had got their courage up, I said to the sergeant, "They are all right now, go at them!"—I do not know the exact words I said—I heard the words "married or single"—I was in the box at the time—I will swear that they both said that they were single men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Clay, at Nicholas-lane, as bill brokers and bankers. We have been in the habit, for three or four years past, of having bill transactions with a firm in Nicholas-lane, which traded under the name of Messrs. Covington—they have been in the habit of sending us bills for the purpose of discounting—those transactions have been carried on with Mr. Maude—about 12th April this year, I heard of the death of Mr. Covington senior—about twelve months before that Maude said that there were six partners, Mr. Cov<lb/>ington senior, Mr. Covington junior, himself, and 1 do not recollect positively the others, but I remember some one of the name of H—, which I afterwards learned was Mr. Hill—he named five besides himself and enumerated their names; it did not occur to me as very important, and I did not take the names down—Whitby was not present, but he confirmed it afterwards, I do not know when, exactly—I cannot charge my memory with the conversation, except that there were several partners—I should not like to say that he enumerated them—when Mr. Covington died, I had another conversation with Maude; he came in, and Mr. Clay referred to the death being in the paper, and said, "I suppose there will be more to divide"—I understood that he would get the benefit of that—Maude said, "Yes, there will be"—he also said that there were four more partners remaining; I thought he meant four besides himself—he at that time produced some bills to me—I asked him incidentally, whether they were his usual trade bills—he seemed rather surprised at the question; and I said, "There is nothing of accommodation about them"—he said, "Certainly not, we have no others"—from April to July we continued to advance him money on various bills to between 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and l,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about 14th July, I told Maude that I was going on the continent for. eight weeks, and asked him if he was likely to want any money during my absence—he said that he would let me know—I have a letter here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this other letter is the reply to it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Dear Sir; Nicholas-lane, July 13. We have as you desired us, made a rough calculation of the amount of bills we expect to receive in the course of business in the next six weeks, which we find will amount to about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; our liabilities are, I am happy to say, very light")—that is in Maude's· writing—I returned to town on 26th Aug., and on 27th Aug. Maude called with reference to some bills sent to us in my absence—I had the account of his bills before me (<hi rend="italic">looking at a book</hi>)—I believe the bilk I referred to were one for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Whitbyi, one for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Gane, one for 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Gane, and one for 77<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Eichardson—I said, "I suppose these are genuine trade bills"—he said, "Yes"—I believe Mr. Clay was present, we generally sit together; it is very seldom that we are away from each other—he did not tell us how they came into his hands, we did not like to ask him such a question, as they were regular trade bills—we have two classes of accounts, in one we discount bills at once without any reduction, the other is where we have banking accounts, and a certain proportion is left as a balance—that proportion is 25 per cent.—we have a banking account with Messrs. Covington—I asked Mr. Maude how much he wanted on these bills, he said, "140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—we certainly should not have advanced him that amount unless he had made the representation to us with reference to the number of partners in the firm, nor without inquiry, if we had known that he was the only partner—we certainly should not have advanced it unless we had believed that there were several partners in the firm; nor under any cir<lb/>cumstances if we had not believed that they were regular trade bills—we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185511260108"/>
               <p>had other transactions of a like nature up to 22nd Oct—we saw the name of Gane on one of the bills—we had refused a bill on 18th Oct., and about 22nd Oct. Maude called; he had left three or four bills with that of Gane's, and pressed me to take that bill; I declined—he brought it again, and I declined—he said that there was a bill of Gane's due that day which would not be paid—I said, "Perhaps the better plan will be for me to tell you why I have doubts about it; some little time ago I saw the name of Gane in a list of County Court judgments; and I said that if a man could not pay 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I thought he was not fit to accept a bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he still urged me, I declined, and he took it away—I saw Whit by on, I think, 2nd Nov.—I was not at that time aware that he was the acceptor of those bills which had been the subject of conversation—I did not know him as Whitby, but simply as Messrs. Covington's clerk—he came in, and from the fact of my having called there the day before, and got the information that his name was Whitby from the office, I said, "Is your name Whitby?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Are you the acceptor of those bills which were brought to us from Covington and Co.?"—he said, "I never brought you my acceptance, I purposely avoided it"—Mr. Clay replied, "But you had two-thirds of the money always, you took care not to tell us that you were the acceptor"—he said something which I forget, and my reply was, "Do you think we should have discounted your bills if we had known you were a clerk to Covington and Co."—he said, "Has not Mr. Maude told you all this?"—that had such an effect upon me that I was astonished, and I recol<lb/>lect that remark distinctly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you say your firm is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Thomas Reginald Kemp and George Clay, we hold ourselves out to the world as Kemp, Clay, and Co.—there are no other partners, the "Co." means nobody—we added Co. to our firm when we first began business together; there was nobody then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you not holding yourselves out as you say Maude did, as having partners that do not belong to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Our firm is Kemp, Clay, and <hi rend="italic">Co</hi>.—I do not know that there is any object in the "Co.," I do not recollect why we put it in—there are hundreds and thousands of firms who do so—I do not know what prompted us to do it, it is well known that we are only two—I did not intend to represent that there were other persons in the firm than myself and Mr. Clay, nor would that imply that there were, there is Sir John Lubbock and Co., but there is only Sir John Lubbock in the firm—I had recently been bankrupt, and I believe my partner had been bankrupt some years before, but I had known him twenty-five years, and did not know it; I hear it now, but do not even now know when it was—this matter was investigated on several occasions at the Mansion House—Whitby was charged before Alderman Wire, and discharged—it is not by my directions that he is included in this indictment, nor by my partner's, to my knowledge; I was rather surprised to see him—I do not say that I am not prosecuting him willingly, but I was astonished that the Lord Mayor discharged him, because I thought him the worst of the two, and I was astonished to see him here as the Lord Mayor had discharged him—I did not know that he was in the indictment till yesterday afternoon—I have had dealings with these gentlemen three or four years, to the amount of several thousand pounds, in bills, never in anything else—I found Whitby's name on a good many of them—they were taken up at maturity—I do not think it would amount to 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I should think quite 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—we are left creditors to the amount of 875<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I do not think the plan of keeping</p>

               <p>back 25 per cent. continued during that period, but in the hundreds of thousands we do I cannot recollect, (<hi rend="italic">referring to a book</hi>)I think it began in 1854—we had been discounting for him since 1852—we deducted the 25 per cent in 1854 because he then opened a banking account—instead of paying him the whole of his bills, we deducted 25 per cent—I call that a banking account—we are bankers, and have depositors independent of bill transactions—25 per cent was kept back from the latter end of 1854—supposing Maude has had every shilling on these bills, there would be 875<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing to us, because the bills amounted to more than that; there would have been a balance in hand if all the bills were paid, to the amount of 25 per cent, on 875<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that plan was adopted because we were, of course, more liable with our bills than we were with our banking accounts; in times of difficulty, we feel it our duty to supply money to persons who bank with us, but general customers we should let go elsewhere—we consider banking customers entitled to more allowance than ordinary customers—I cannot say whether that is our only motive, we might feel inclined to keep one customer, and not another—we did not deduct the 25 per cent, because we were inclined to keep Maude, but among the number of customers we have in times like the present, when money is dear, we feel it our duty to find them money</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But it appears that that is like taking their money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You cannot call it that, because we have got their bills—suppose you bring me 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bills, and I give you 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I have not got any of your money—we, of course, keep back 25 per cent, our object in doing that is the same as other bankers would, to keep a balance on the account—it is our practice always to have 25 per cent on every account, for conducting the account</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was your object in making the proposal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We ask them if they are inclined to open a banking account, or they might hare asked us—we have a great number of these accounts, and when we can get them, of course we do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you do so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear that I did. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think that Mr. Maude proposed that when he wanted 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bills discounted, you should only give 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not very likely that either of us would have put it in that way—we never knew that he was pressed for money—I swear that I cannot tell you who proposed it, he or I—it may have come from Maude is 1854, he having 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per thousand in our hands—I call this a banking account, if a cheque had been drawn for it the next day it would not have been paid, but it would have been paid immediately the bills became due—if a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill had been paid next day he would have been entitled to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but if a cheque was drawn before that, he would not get his money, because he would not have any to get—this had not been done with Maude till 1854—I cannot say whether this was held as a matter of security, but if any one were to open an account with us to day we should tell him that it is our habit to keep 25 per sent on every account—we should not tell him that it is for security, because it would not enter into our minds, but we should not, nevertheless, go and discount his bills because he brought them, and there was a balance in our hands—I do not think any such idea as keeping it for security was in our minds—I will not venture to swear that it was, or that it was not—I do not know why we did not adopt it till 1854, except that it was an advantage to both parties to have a banking account—I never heard Whitby's name till that day—we are nearly opposite to Coving<lb/>ton's premises—I do not know that Whitby has been there the whole time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185511260110"/>
               <p>that Maude has been carrying on the business—I have been in the habit of, seeing him for twelve months at least—I do not remember that it is more—I have seen Mr. Covington's clerk it may be two years—I never knew him in any other way—I very seldom went there, Whitby frequently came to us—I never saw him on the Coal Exchange—though his name was on the bills, I never knew that hid name was Whitby—Maude has been in the habit of paying us cheques—they were on Sapte and Co. I think, but it was very seldom, that he paid us in that way, not above once or twice—the bills were usually taken up by the acceptor—we received very few sum of money from him—we have been in Nicholas-lane four or five years—I did not know old Mr. Covington personally, or by sight, or any of the Coving<lb/>tons—I never saw anybody in the business but Mr. Maude—I find now, that the name of Mr. Maude is painted under that of Covington on the door, and I have no reason to doubt that it was there before—I have not been a partner with Mr. Clay the whole five years, only since 1852—I know that there is such a person as Mr. Hill, I know him by sight—I had a conversation with him after this inquiry at the Mansion-house—I did not tell him that I did not believe that Mr. Maude ever intended to defraud us—I swear that—I will not swear that there was nothing to that effect—I do not think Mr. Clay in my presence said so—I will not swear that he did not—I did not say, "We want our money; it is a very small sum for Mr. Maude's father and brothers to make up between them," nor did Mr. Clay in my presence—Mr. Hill requested to know whether he could talk to us as men of honor—I said, "I prefer listen to what you have to say "—he said, "May I say what I wish without a word being breathed?"—we said, "Yes"—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to this, and the rest of the conversation was not given</hi>)—I think Mr. Maude's father and brothers were mentioned—I shall be very cautious with this, to swear to the truth of it, because I should imagine that Mr. Hill's recollection would be equal to mine—I do not believe that Mr. Maude, or his father, or son were mentioned in the way you put it—their names were mentioned—I have not the slightest recollection of what was said about them, because I purposely avoided remembering it—I said, "Mr. day, I shall have nothing to do with this; if anything is to be done let counsel confer together, and let the matter be arranged with them, I will not be any party to this proposal"—I would not even say that what was said about Maude's father and brothers was not said by me, because it was general conversation, and a great deal of it was going on—what was said about Mr. Maude's father compromising the matter, was said by Mr. Hill—it was not suggested by me or Mr. Clay—Mr. Hill came in, shut our door, and asked if he could speak with us in confidence—Mr. Clay said, "Yes" Mr. Hill said, "Can the matter be arranged if the friends meet together? "—I said that I did not know, for I thought it was a felony, and was quite guarded—then the conversation went on again, and Mr. Hill went away under the impression that we were not indisposed to compromise it if counsel were of the same opinion—I did not know what the compromise would be—I was a bankrupt in 1848 for about 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound was offered as a compromise in this case before any charge was made against the defendants—it was made to me personally, but in confidence—the gentleman is in Court—it was Mr. Surr, but without his permission I ought not to say—I have paid a good deal in the pound since my bankruptcy, but I paid nothing at the time; I have really struggled on till the last moment—I bought up the debts to the amount of 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were very old debts and I gave 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I</p>

               <p>bought of my assignees part of my estate certain books and papers which should not be lost—I had three months' suspension, and then received a second class certificate—I have been engaged as a bill broker for the last twenty years—I never was a director of the Tonridge Junction Railway—I have been a director of six railways, but not of all in which my name appears, they put it in without my knowledge or sanction—I did not enter into business before my bankruptcy with a man named Massey—I had business with Massey and Jarvis—I received more than 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from them—more like 70,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say whether I re-ceived about 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., about a month before my bankruptcy; you seem to think I am not wishing to tell the truth, but I do—I retired from business two or three years before 1848—I left a party to carry on my business, but he did not do it with success—I was obliged to resume it, but it had gone too far for me to get over the difficulty—during that part of the business the account with Massey and Jarvis continued, and bills were continually being discounted—I do not think I received anything like 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash from Messrs. Massey a month before my bankruptcy—I would not dare to swear so long ago, but I should hardly think it possible, because I had only been in difficulties some four, five, or six months—I did not receive money from them to the amount of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor yet at many shillings—I was bankrupt in 1848—I had stopped payment several months before—Mr. Massey did not get a farthing from me because I had stopped—I should think he has, but not from me, from the bills and securities, many thousands—there was not also a considerable sum of money belonging to Miss Carter when I stopped payment—she had not parted with a considerable sum to me, the whole she had in the world—she was a ward of mine, and had about 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she had had about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it, and by my recommendation, she invested it in shares, and other things, which became valueless, and she afterwards proved against my estate for it, and got nothing, but she had a good deal after I failed—they had a bill of sale on my property, and realized the whole of that bill of sale—I had given her the bill of sale, because she advanced me a sum of money.</p>

I was a bankrupt in 1847—I know Maude—he had dealings with us, under the name of Covington and Co.—I recollect seeing the death of Mr. Covington in the papers—Maude came after that, and I said that I had observed the death of Mr. Covington, and asked him if it was one of their firm—he said, "Our senior partner"—I said, "Of course, it will be well for the remaining partners?"—he said, "Yes; the remaining partners will be benefited certainly"—I forget whether he mentioned the number of partners—(Mr. Kemp was present)—I asked him if they were all trade bills, as we are in the habit of asking very often of all our customers—he said that they were all <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> trade bills; they never had any others—I do not remember that he said what they were given for—I recollect Mr. Kemp going out of town—he told Maude that he was going out of town for some weeks, and wanted to know what amount of discount he would require during his absence—Maude said that he would write—I recollect Mr. Kemp's return, on 28th Aug.—he came on that day to agree to the account, and receive the bills due to him—(bills had been delivered to him, making about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether)—we then asked him again if they were <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> trade bills, and he replied that they were—Mr. Kemp said, "You must have a very good business, Mr. Coving-ton" (we always addressed him as Mr. Covington) "for so many partners to live out of it"—he said, "Yes, and they do a very large sum too"—I did know him as Mr. Maude, but if I had been asked his name I do not think I should have remembered it—we agreed to let him have 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I wrote him this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the body of which is in my writing, which is an unusual thing—he had said on one or two occasions, after Mr. Coving-ton's death, "The remaining four partners"—we afterwards obtained some information about Gane—before the money was advanced, Maude said, in my presence, that the bills generally were for lighterage, in the way of his business—there was an interview with Mr. Truefit, the solicitor, and he gave certain information—up to that time I had not known that there was not more than one person in the firm—I was not present at the interview—if I had known that Maude was the only person in the firm, I would not have advanced the money—I was present at an interview with Whitby, about 2nd Nov.—he came over by Mr. Kemp's directions, and Mr. Kemp asked him if his name was Whitby—he said, "Yes"—Mr. Kemp said, "Are you the acceptor of these bills, which we have had continually in the name of Whitby?"—he said, "I am; has Mr. Maude said something to you about it?"—Mr. Kemp said, "But you brought these bills?"—Whitby said, "No; I carefully avoided bringing my own acceptances"—I said, "You did not carefully avoid coming for the money for them, because you have generally had about two-thirds of the money put into your own hands"—when Mr. Kemp heard him confess that, he turned to me, and said, "Well, this is, the</p>

               <p>grossest swindle that ever came under my notice"—Whitby has made a statement to me about the partners, but my memory docs not sufficiently serve me to explain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This cheque is Kemp, Clay, and Co., when did you start the Co? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the time I went into partnership with Mr. Kemp, and we thought that we might eventually have a "Co."—we had no particular reason for it—it was done by arrangement—it is no unusual thing—I can scarcely tell you what our motive was—I had been bankrupt in the panic of 1847—I did not know that Mr. Kemp had been a bankrupt till after I became his partner—I do not know whether he knew that I had been—I dare say that I felt bound to mention it—I have no doubt of it—I will not swear that I did—I do not think he ever mentioned to me that he had been bankrupt until I was fairly his partner—I knew Maude by the name of Covington more than Maude—I knew his name was Maude—I do not think he ever represented himself by any other name, but he was Covington and Co. to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not his name over the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that I ever saw the door—I lived opposite, but his office is up a court—I had been there two years before—I can see the gateway—I do not know that his name is there now—our object in instituting this prosecution was to punish people who came and committed fraud—I will not say that it was public justice only—our object was to get what was stolen from us—if we could have got that, I do not know whether we should have let public justice shift for herself—I believe if they had brought the money for these bills we should have given them—we could not have prosecuted if they had the bills out of our hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did not you institute these proceedings to get the money out of the relations of Mr. Maude? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We took the proceedings certainly, and we should not have gone on with the prosecution if they had been paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Burr and Gribble, solicitors, in the city. I knew Mr. Covington, sen.—I am one of his executors—he died in March or April this year—I knew Maude, carrying on the business of a lighterman—I have known him since I think it was about 1851, when he joined Mr. Covington, sen., as a partner in this very trade—Mr. Covington, sen., was not a partner in the house at the time of his death—Mr. Maude certainly had no partner to my knowledge in Aug. this year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there a member of the Covington family whose name was allowed to remain in the firm? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in. the firm, but to be used as a licensed lighterman, which the regulations of the Lightermen's Company require—his name remained in the business, and he took out the license—one son first, and another afterwards—the first son was a partner and the second was not—it was known to me that the establishment was carried on the name of Covington and Co.—I made the arrangement in receiving Mr. Maude into the business—the old firm was continued—I acted for the Messrs. Covington, and Mr. Bower, of Chancery-lane, acted for Mr. Maude—before entering into the arrangements I inquired about Mr. Maude of several bankers, and among others of Messrs. Masterman—I believe he had been in their house—I ascertained the respectability of his friends and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185511260114"/>
               <p>connections—he paid a sum of money to come into the business, and for the purpose of doing so mortgaged a reversionary interest under his father's settlement, to Mr. Covington, who therefore left his money in the firm—that represented nearly 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he brought in in actual cash 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I only know from others the state of the accounts now—up to a certain point I had the highest opinion of him—I know of other moneys which he has brought in—his father and his family have advanced money to the firm—I know that on this very reversionary interest 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. further was raised, and went to pay off some of the bills—Mr. Covington facilitated that—that was not on the presumption that it would pay both—I got some other security substituted for it from Mr. Maude, which I now hold, and allowed him to have the deeds—it is a business requiring a very active life on the part of the proprietors—the Covingtons are a very old established firm, and unless I had been sure that all was right I would not have done it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair dresser, of London, and live at Wanstead. On Sunday, 18th Nov., from a quarter to half past 10 o'clock, I had three tame goats turned out in the forest—I received information about half past 10 o'clock, went into the forest, and found the prisoner taking a sack from round the goat's neck—it was about 400 yards from where I had last seen it safe—I could see the prisoner taking it off, through the bushes before I got up—I saw him move—the goat was trying to get away—I said, "Halloo, my man! what are you doing with that goat?"—he said, "It is my goat, I brought it from my uncle's at Woodford Bridge, and am taking it to Lea Bridge"—I told him I would soon settle that, and would take him to the station house—I took him there, we had to wait some time for a policeman to arrive—he began crying, called me on one side, and said, "Mr. Evans, I stole the goat; pray forgive me, for the sake of my mother"—I found that his mother had been dead some time previously—I am sure it was my goat—it was worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

On Sunday morning, 18th Oct., I was in the forest on my way to church, and saw the prisoner leading a goat by the side of the path, with a sack tied round his neck, and a handkerchief tied to the sack—I knew the goat to be Mr. Evans's, and said to the prisoner, "That is Mr. Evans's goat, what are you going to do with it?"—he said that it was his goat, he had brought it from Woodford. Bridge, from his uncle's, and was going to take it to Lea Bridge—another boy, Benjamin Gouldstone, then came up and said to me, "That is Mr. Evans's goat," and called me on one side and said, "You stop here, and I will go and tell Mr. Evans"—he left, and the goat went into the forest, and the prisoner followed it—he had not let it go at liberty, he let go of it, and caught it again, and then Mr. Evans came up and caught hold of the prisoner, and took him to the station—I did not hear what took place between Mr. Evans and the prisoner.</p>

He was absent on 21st Oct.—Ramsey was his gardener, and Wood was a labouring man under him—on that day I saw Ramsey leave Mr. Mason's premises with a basket full of something—Wood left the premises with him, and he had a bag with something in it—I gave information to a policeman, and he brought them both back in custody—Ramsey had the basket, and Wood the bag—there were cabbages and apples in the basket, and potatoes in the bag—there were apples and potatoes on my master's premises.</p>

I saw the prisoner leave the premises with a piece of board under his arm—it was a part of the 105—we had no other description of boards on the premises—on the following night, I saw him with a box and three other boards of the same description as the other, but they were not the length that they had been, they were sawn into two pieces—I gave information to the police—I afterwards saw some boards that the policeman had—I believe them to be some of the boards off my master's premises—I saw this box—there is a stain inside it—I know it to be my master's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, in the Royal Arsenal, at Woolwich. On Saturday night, 20th Oct., I was in the Bugle Horn, at Charlton—there was a crowd in front of the bar, and in passing through the crowd I felt something at my waistcoat pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner jerk my watch from my waistcoat pocket—I saw it in his hand—I could not get hold of that hand that had the watch—he jerked it over the crowd, and said, "Over, over," and I saw him pass the watch into some man's hand, but who it was I could not say—Mr. Donnelly was with me at the time, and with his assistance I took the prisoner outside—Donnelly told him, if he would give up the watch, he would let him go—the prisoner said he wished his friend was there—the officer came up and took him.</p>

I was aroused about 2 o'clock in the morning by a policeman's rattle, and a knocking—I got out of bed, went to the back bed room window, threw open the sash, and saw a policeman on the wall of the adjoining premises—he called out, "There are thieves in your house, for God's sake come down!"—I came down stairs, and in the shop found several bundles of goods, near the door; they were mine, and had been on shelves and boxes, and some in the window—I had gone to bed about 11 o'clock, the window fastenings were then secure—I believe I was the last person up, but not the last in the shop; my appren-tike has to turn the gas out, and he brought me the key of the shop—I found the counting house door broken open, and almost all my papers in the counting house disturbed, and my desk also, which had not been locked—</p>
