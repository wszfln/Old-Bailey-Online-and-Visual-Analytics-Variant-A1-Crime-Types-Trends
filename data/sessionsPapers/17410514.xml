               <p>John Wall. On Saturday the 11th of April, I had Business which called me out into the City to several Places, where I staid 'till between one and two o'Clock in the Morning, and as I was going past the end of Salisbury-Court in Fleet-street , in my way<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174105140003"/> Home, I met 3 Persons who seemed to stand in a Conference together: I passed them, and when I came to Fetter-Lane, I found myself by them again, and presently the Prisoner was even with me. I turn'd up Bell-Yard as my nearest way Home; the Prisoner followed me, and we went together 'till we came very near the Top of the Yard; then he catched hold of my Coat with one Hand, and with the other he pulled a short Stick out of his Bosom, and with Imprecations demanded my Money. Immediately he fell on me with his Stick and repeated his Blows so fast on me, that if he had not held me up by my Coat, I must have fallen to the Ground. Upon this I cryed out Watch! but none being near , I seized him myself and then he cried out a Sodomite, but some People coming to my Assistance, we were both secured and sent to Prison together.</p>

             . I am a Watchman in St. Clement's Parish, and hearing Watch called several Times, I turned out of great Sheer Lane to see what was the the Matter , and then I saw much such a Man as the Prisoner lying over the Prosecutor with a short Stick: I asked him why he did so, and the Man said the Prosecutor was a Sodomite, and still kept beating him with his Stick, and in a few Minutes the Stick was found on the Ground. Upon this I laid hold of the Man, and when he found that I was going to take him away, he charged me with the Prosecutor, and I delivered them both to a Watch-man belonging to the Roll's Liberty and went back to my Stand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . Did the Prosecutor at that Time say that I attempted to rob him ?</p>
               <p>Tenant. No, he desired the Prisoner might be stopped, but I heard nothing of a Robbery.</p>

               <p>Prisoner . I had been drinking in the Stand, and turned up Bell Yard in order to go Home: this Man met me, and we jostled together ; upon which he pulled out a Stick and knocked me down several Times, and the Constable coming up, asked me what I had lost ? I told him my Wig, and insisted on Satisfaction for it, but he would not give me any, and so we were both committed to Prison together. He knocked me down several Times, and I am sure he is put upon this Prosecution for the Sake of the Reward*.</p>

We all ran out, and saw that there was no person in the Road but the Prisoner, and I saw that the thing which she flung into the Meadow was green. We did not stay to take it up, but I laid hold of the Prisoner, and carried her into a House, and soon afterwards the Child's Coat was brought in, and I believe it to be the very same which I saw the Prisoner throw out of her Hand .</p>

On the 24th of April, we were together in my Shop, and he went up Stairs with some Goods to a Warehouse, which I have, and while he was there, I had occasion to go up after him. When I got into the Room, he seem'd to be in a great Flutter, and would not stand upright; however I pulled him upright, and then this Callimanco drop'd from his Clothes: I said, you Villain, have you robbed me? and he did not speak a Word; so I brought him down into the Shop, and asked him, why he gave himself up to such practices ? and desired him to inform me, if he had robbed me of any Thing else, and how he had disposed of it. As to the Callimanco, he said, he took that to give away to somebody, but he would not tell me who that somebody was. I then asked him, if he had taken any thing else, and he said; if he informed me, perhaps he should not be used the better for it. I kept him some time in my Shop, and then carried him before a Magistrate, and when we were there, we thought it might be proper to search his Lodgings; but he declared he had nothing there of mine: We were not willing to take his Word, so I and the Constable searched his Lodgings, and found these pieces of Leather, some of which I can swear to be mine. I asked the Prisoner, if these were not mine? and he said, they did not all belong to me, for he had bought some of a Leather-cutter in Maiden-lan ; but that Leather-cutter being sent for, said, the Prisoner had bought of him some Time ago, but that none of those peices were ever his.</p>

My Master sent me up into the Warehouse, and the Stick fell out of this Callimanco, and I took it in order to roll it up again, and he came up and said I had an Intent to rob him. As to the Leather, I had it by me, and worked for my own Customers before I lived with him.</p>

            . On the 13th of April, between 8 and 9 in the Morning, the Prisoner came into my House, and said, she was very ill of the Colick, and wanted to go backwards. She sat some time in the Room, seemingly very uneasy, and then went backwards. She came in again presently, and walked about the Room, complaining that she was very ill, and said, if I had a Room and a Bed to spare, she would go to Bed; so I desired my Husband to ask our Lodger to resign her Room, but she would not. After this, the Prisoner walked about the Room some Time, and then went backwards a second time; and she staying longer than I expected, I followed her, and perceived that the Necessary-house had been washed: I asked her the reason of it, and she said, her Nose had bled. As to the Child, I saw nothing of it. The Prisoner lodged with me before this, and I took her for a single person, and a very sober good Woman .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Distance of Time was there, from my going to the Little-house, and your coming to me?</p>

            . My Wife called me to see if the Person who lodges in our House would resign her Room, that the Prisoner might have it, but she would not; and at my Return , my Wife said to me, I hope Betty is not with Child. I then went into the Kitchen , and saw the Prisoner washing her Hands at the Water-tub, and the Bottom of her Apron was very bloody. I informed my Wife of this, and she said, she hoped there was nothing in the Vault, so I got a Candle and looked into it, and saw something which I took at first to be a piece of Cloth. I got Mrs. Watlin to come and see it, and I got a pair of Tongs, and turned it about, and then the Child's Leg appeared . Upon this I went out to get Assistance, and locked the Door to prevent the Prisoner's escaping, and before I returned the Child was taken out of the Vault, and was dead.</p>

            . I was going by Mr. Lucas's Door, and was desired to go in. I went into Mrs. Lucas's Room, and she said the Prisoner was gone backwards, and staid a little longer than ordinary; upon which I went to see what she was doing, and met her in the passage, opening the Door. I gave her Room to go by, and she went into the parlour and sat down, and seemed to be mighty bad. Mrs. Lucas said to her, '' I fear, Betty, thou hast '' been delivered of a Child.'' The Prisoner denied she had been delivered; so Mrs. Lucas desired me to go backwards and see. Mr. Lucas gave me a Candle, and on looking down the Vault I perceived a new-born Infant. I informed Mrs. Lucas what I had seen, and endeavoured to get the Child up; and, with the Assistance of another, I did get it up; but it was dead. I believe it was at its full Growth, for there were Nails on its Hands, and Hair on its Head . The Child was not covered over with the Soil; it lay on its Face, leaning rather to the left Side; and the Face was in the Soil.</p>

               <p>C. Was there any thing about it?</p>
               <p>Davis. Nothing at all; it was quite naked, as it was born.</p>

             . Mr. Lucas came to me, and asked me to lend him a Candle; I did so, and he went up Stairs directly. He came down again presently, and desired me to go backwards with him, and look down the Vault: I did so, and he asked me, what I thought it was; I said, I believed it was paper; upon that he fetch'd a pair of Tongs and rapped it; it founded hard, and on his turning it about, a Leg or an Arm appeared. He strove to get it up, but could not, and he desired me to go into the Room to the Prisoner; I did so, and asked her what she had done? and told her, she had had a Child; but she said, it was no such thing.

               <p>Prisoner. Do you think it possible for Nature to do this?</p>

             . On Easter Sunday last I went out of my House about 6 in the Evening, and returned at 8. I went down into the Kitchen to Supper, and after Supper my Wife and Daughter went up Stairs into the Parlour to set some Tea Things away, and they had no sooner opened the Door but they both made an Outcry: I started out of my Chair, and my Daughter met me in the Entry and said I was robbed. I went into the parlour, and found the outside Window Shutters open, the Sash lifted quite up, and the Blind laid on a Bureau which stands near the Window. Upon this I searched the Beauset and missed a Winchester Quart two handled Cup, a Winchester pint Mug, a pepper-box, a large Spoon and a Punch Laddle, all which I am certain were safe at 4 o'Clock that Afternoon. When I came Home at 8 o'Clock that Evening the Window Shutters were pulled to, but not fastened and the Blinds were bolted, and when I went into the Room they were wide open, and a silver Spoon lay on the Floor. On the Sunday after this happened I advertis'd what I had lost, with a Reward of four Guineas for any Person who should inform me of them , and on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174105140007"/> Monday Morning about 11 o'Clock, a Woman brought me a Letter from Newgate, the Contents of which were, if I would come there, I should be put in a Way to get my Goods again: I took a Friend with me and went to Newgate and the Prisoner was brought to me as the Author of that Letter. When he saw me he fell into a sort of a whining Cry, and on his Knees desired I would admit him an Evidence, and he would declare the whole: whereof I took Pen, Ink and paper and took his Confession, but it did not answer to what I have found out since. He confessed that himself, Flack and Lowther, were concerned together; that Flack went into the Room, Lowther stood at the Window, and himself stood Peter; I suppose he meant that he stood to watch. He told me that he lighted the Candle at a Chandler's Shop just by, and put it into the Dark Lanthorn himself. He likewise told me that the plate was sold to one Brown, but on my making Enquiry no such Person was to be found; and he said he believed his Companions had sunk some of the Plate, for he heard it rattle in their Pockets, and on his asking them what it was, they told him, it was a Tobacco-box.</p>

I went before and pulled open the Window Shutters of Mr. Wheeler's House; - it is in Denmark Court in the Strand: Flack pushed up the Sash, and then there was a Blind which was bolted , and we could not undo it for a long Time; but at last Flack got it out, and put it on the Top of a Bureau. Then we shut the Window to, and sent the Prisoner to the next Door to light a Candle. When we had got a Light, Flack went in, but a Woman coming out of the Chandler's with a Candle, we put the Shutters to again, and after that Flack took a silver 2 handled Cup, a silver pint Mug, a Spoon, a pepper-box and a Punch Ladle, and the Prisoner not minding the Woman who came out of the Chandler's Shop, Flack flew into a Passion with him, and swore he should have none of the Money because he did not blow the Woman's Candle out. We should have taken other Things out of the House, but we let a Spoon fall on the Floor, and thinking that alarm'd the People, we all ran into the Strand and got a Coach, and directly went to Mrs. Bower's, the Ship in Rag Fair.

On the 28th of April between 12 and 1 in the Morning my Servant informed me that the Watchman had found Thieves breaking into my Cellar, but they had made it secure again. I got up and search'd about the House to see if any body was concealed, but found no body. My Man got up again between one and two, and cry'd out Murder! Thieves! and ran about the House to alarm us, and presently afterwards hearing a second Noise, of some body in the Kitchen, I got up, and opened my Window, and called a-cross the Yard: immediately I saw a Man run along the Yard, and he limped with his right Leg, by which I was certain it was the Prisoner, who some Time before this had been my Servant. My Ostler hearing the Noise got up, and I desired him to lay hold of the Prisoner, but he not hearing what I said, the Prisoner made his Escape. After this I got a Candle, and in my Kitchen found the Prisoner's Hat, Shoes, case Knife and penknife, and an Iron Fly belonging to a gaming Table, all which he owned to be his before the Justice. The Day after this I got a Warrant to take the Prisoner on Suspicion, and met him in Drury-Lane. I took hold of him and said, are you here Tom? he made no Reply, but said, I hope Master you will forgive me. I told him as he had broke into my House, I could not forgive him, and he said he would ask ten thousand Pardons if I would excuse him. I kept him fast by the Hand and led him into a Public House, and gave him into the Custody of a Headborough. When we were at the Alehouse he owned that he broke into the House between one and two o'Clock, but said he came for Victuals. He confess'd the same before the Justice, and begged very hard for his Hat, for he had none to wear.</p>

On the 28th of April, just as the Watchman was crying the Hour of twelve, he knocked at the Door, and told me some Thieves were breaking in at the Cellar Window: I got up, and li't a Candle, and the Watchman and I went into the Cellar to fasten the Windows, which were wrenched open wide enough for a Dog to get in. I am positive they were fast when I went to Bed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174105140008"/> and when I got up and found them open, I could not shut them again, but 2 Watchmen coming by assisted me, and then I carried the Key up Stairs to my Master, and went to Bed again. In a little Time afterwards, hearing a sort of a rustling, I went into the Kitchen , and saw a Man which I verily believe was the Prisoner, stand up at the Cupboard . I cried Thie ves! Murder! and ran to lay hold of him, and immediately he ran out at the Window. I went up Stairs and alarmed the House, and this Iron Fly and the other Things were afterwards found in the Kitchen.</p>

            . I happened to be out and met Mr. Tucker in St. Giles's, and he desired me to go with him to see for the Prisoner. Accordingly I went to the Prisoner's House, but he not being at Home, we went to an Alehouse over the way, and in a few Minutes the Prisoner was brought in. He confess'd that he attempted to break Mr. Tucker's Cellar Door, but being disturbed, he went into a Stone Cutter's Yard, got over the Wall and broke in backwards at the Kitchen Window. After this I carried him into a back Room, and there he delivered some Implements for Gaming to his Wife, and when I carried him before Mr. De Viel , the Iron Fly and the other Things were produced and he owned them to be his, and that he left them in Tucker's Kitchen.</p>

            . I had been at a Sale where the next Witness had bought some Goods for me, and came part of the way home with me. When he left me, the Prisoner and his Father overtook me, and one took hold of one Arm, and the other of another; they asked me, if I had any Money, and I said, I had not, for I had laid it all out at the Sale . Upon that, the Prisoner said, D - n him, he has a good Watch, and pulled it out of my pocket. There was a Man to whom I owed some Money followed me from the Sale, and the Prisoner and the other Man, seeing him, they both ran away. This was on the 26th of April, between 5 and 6 in the Evening, and in about half an Hour afterwards they were taken.</p>

               <p>Henry Corner. On Friday, the 24th Day of April, between 5 and 6 in the Evening, the Prisoner Piggot came to me, and asked me how I did, and desired me to drink part of a Tankard of Beer with him. I could not at that Time, but about 10 o'clock I met him in the play-house passage, and he again asked me to drink with him. The other Prisoner, Johnson, was there at the same Time, and we went to an Alehouse, and had two Tankards of Beer, for which I expected them to pay a part, but they said, if I would treat then, they would at another place; and if I would go as far as St. Giles's they would give me something that was good. This was in Drury Lane, and I not having my Hat en, did not chuse to go so far without; so the Prisoner Piggot clapped his on my Head. When we got into the middle of Drury Lane, they knocked at a Door, but the people being a-bed, they led me about; and the first place that we came to, that I knew, was the Duke of Bedford's House in Bloomsbury Square. They then said, they would shew me my nearest Way home; but instead of that, they carried me into the Fields, and the first Word they spoke to me was to borrow Money; immediately one of them threw me down, stopped my Mouth, and got upon me; Piggot pulled out my Watch by main Force, and tore my Buckle out of my Shoe, Strap and all; and then both run away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Piggot. Did he never leave his Watch in my Custody?</p>
               <p>Corner. No, he never had any Watch of mine.</p>
               <p>C. Whereabouts did they rob you?</p>
               <p>Corner. It was in the Field above Southampton-Row . When they robbed me, I cried Murder, and a Watchman coming up, I told him what had happened, and he said he would bring me a Constable the next Day: He did so, and they were both taken at a Milk-cellar in Gray's-Inn Lane.</p>

            . I am a Watchman, and was just going to cry the Hour of 12, when I heard Murder cried twice in the Field. I went up to the Field-Gate, and could see no body, but I afterwards met the Prosecutor very bloody. He told me, he had been robbed, and he knew one of the persons who were concerned; and I told him I would bring him a Constable the next Morning. I did so, and we laid wait for the Prisoners in two Places. Corner and I waited for them at the Bear in Bow-street, Covent-Garden, where we staid 'till we had Information that the Constable had apprehended them at a Milk-cellar in Gray's-Inn Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Corner direct you where to take them?</p>
               <p>Perkins. He said, he knew one of them, and directed us to the place where it was most likely to find him.</p>

            . The last Witness came to me on the 25th of April, and told me, that a Man had been robbed of his Watch and Buckle, and he had told him where he lived, and that he knew one of the persons. We set out about 7 o'Clock in the Morning, and got Information, that a Milkwoman in Gray's-Inn Lane used to come to Piggot; upon which I went to several Milk-cellars in the Lane, but none of them knew him; and at last I came to the right, and on my enquiring for Piggot, the Woman said , he and another were just gone out together, but would be within in a short time. Upon this, I went to the Alehouse, and had Word sent me, from a Fellow-servant of Piggot's at a Bagnio , that he was quickly expected at the Bear in Bow-street ; so I sent the Watchman and the Prosecutor into Bow-street; and

             , the Headborough , and myself went again to the Milk-cellar ; and we had not been there long, before the two Prisoners came in. I catch'd up a poker, and told them what my Business was, and then one of the Women lock'd them up in her Room; but after some Time, they surrendered, and we carried them before Justice Poulson , who examined them separate. They both confessed the Fact; Johnson in particular said, he held Corner down, and stopped his Mouth, while Piggot took his Watch and Buckle, and then both ran away. Horton owned the same, and behaved with great Boldness at the Justice's, and went out snapping his Fingers, singing, At the Tree I shall<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174105140010"/> suffer with Pleasure; and said, he should have a short Life and a merry one.</p>

            . The Prosecutor sent a Watchman to our House, about 7 in the Morning; and soon afterwards Corner came, and said he had been robbed of his Watch and Buckle, by the Waiter at the Turk's Head in Bow Street. He said, that Piggot took his Watch and Buckle, while Johnson held him down. After this, the Constable, a Watchman and I went to Gray's-Inn Lane; we sat at an Alehouse some Time, and then Piggot went into the Milk-woman's, and called Johnson in after him, and the Woman seeing us, she shut the Door, but the Constable jumped in at the Window; and she said, if he went up Stairs, she would fetch a Warrant for him; so he sent me for farther Assistance; and before I returned, the Prisoners were taken.</p>
               <p>DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Piggot. I met the Prosecutor between twelve and one that Day, and he asked me if I was turned Gentleman? I told him I was hired to Mrs. Douglas; he said he should be glad to drink with me, so I met him at 6 o'Clock that Evening as the Prince and Princess were going to the Play. He told me he had a great Fancy to see the Play, and would go into the Footman's Gallery; I having no Livery could not go with him, so I went into the upper Gallery with Johnson, and as we were coming out we met the Prosecutor again. He asked me to drink, and said he must step home and make his Appearance and would come to us; so we went to the King's Head in James Street and called for a Tankard of Beer. He came to us, and we sat 'till the Watchman came half an Hour past Eleven, and then he paid for the Beer; and we not chusing to drink any more Beer, he said, if we would go with him towards Tottenham Court , he would give us something that was good. Upon this we went with him, and when we came into the Fields, we crossed over towards St. Giles's. I staid behind a little to make Water, and presently I heard Johnson cry our Hort! Hort! upon which I went up to him and found the Prosecutor in a very indecent Posture. Upon my coming up, he desired we would not expose him, and he would give us all he had; and having no Money about him he gave us his Watch and both his Buckles; but recollecting himself, he said, '' when I go home having lost both my Buckles , '' the people at our House will think I have pawned '' them, and therefore we gave him one of his Buckles again .</p>

I told him I had a Warrant against him, and he said he would not go, and in a little Time, a great many People came with Clubs, Sticks and Hangers, and swore they would bail him. Immediately they took him from me, and beat me: I got out of the House into the Alley, and Hunt, Cassody, and Timms who are executed, the Prisoner, and several others who are fled to Ireland, knocked me down. Which of them it was that did knock me down, I can't tell, but they were all present, and when I was down, the Prisoner stamped on me, and some of them turned my Left-hand Breeches-Pocket the wrong Side outwards, and took out a Knife, a Key, 3 s. 6 d. in Silver, and about 5 or 6 pennyworth of Half-pence. After this, I followed them into Holsford's Alley , to one South's, and saw Hunt and Timms there; and when I came from thence, I saw the Prisoner at the End of the Alley, and he ran towards Clare-market , and got away. From that Time I never saw him again, 'till I took him, on the 24th of April, in Cary street.</p>
               <p>Q Are you sure the Prisoner was among the persons that used you in this Manner?</p>
               <p>Rhodes. I am certain he was the Man who stamped upon me, and that he was with them, when I lost my Money .</p>

               <p>Rhodes. I believe it was between 9 and 10.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How was I drest at that Time?</p>
               <p>Rhodes. I believe he had the same Clothes on as he has now; but I can swear to his Wig.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. By what Light did he see me?</p>
               <p>Rhodes. The People were coming from the play, and there were several Link-men about the End of the Alley; and if some people had not come with Lights to my Assistance, I believe I should have been killed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. How far is this Alley from the Play-House?</p>

            . I lodged in Mr. South's House, in Holsford's Alley ; there was a Club of Irishmen, which used to meet there and spend 3 d. a piece every Thursday Night. One Evening a Man came from the White Horse in Drum-Alley, to inform the Club, that Robinson was taken: Immediately they went down Stairs into the Yard, and broke the Mopsticks and Broomsticks, and went out with Intent to rescue Robinson. There were Timms, Cassody, Hunt, and the Prisoner, and several others; and they all went out together. They had not been gone long, before they brought Robinson with them. Then they called for Gin and Twopenny, and said, they would make themselves merry with the Constable's Money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is not this House of South's a common Receptacle for lewd Women?</p>
               <p>Swinney . Yes, every body is welcome to come for 3 d. a piece.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How was I dreft at that Time?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Was it a dark, or a light Coat?</p>

               <p>Swinney. I saw him with the Club 2 or 3 Times before this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Has not the Prosecutor, since you have been in Consinement, frequently promised you your Liberty, to be an Evidence against me?</p>

            . I live in Parker's Lane, and work for Mr. Birtworth , his Majesty's Coach-maker . The Prisoner lodged in my House, and I commonly rise to go to my Work, at a little after 5, and always have found my Doors locked and bolted: Besides I have a little Vermin (a Dog) that will not let any Body come in or go out without alarming me, and the Prisoner could not be out of Doors at this Time, for he had but one Coat, which he had given to a Taylor to alter, and could not get it again, so that I was forced to lend him an old Coat of mine. My People are always a-bed a little after 9, and I bolt the Door and fasten it myself.</p>
               <p>C. How long has the Prisoner lodged with you?</p>
               <p>Ginn. About 3 Years, and he always was a civil Man. - He lodged with me in February last.</p>
               <p>C. Have you any other Lodgers besides the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Ginn. Yes, there are 2 young Men, Oliver and Jasper, and they were both sick from the 7th to the 20th of February, and at that Time the Prisoner could not get his Clothes from the Taylor. He then lodged in my House, and was not out all the Time from the 7th to the 20th of February, for he had no Key to the Door, and I have a little Vermin that will not let me or any Body else come in.</p>
               <p>C. For near 20 Days did no body come into, or go out of your House?</p>
               <p>Ginn. Not at Night, my House is constantly locked up at half an Hour past 8, when I return from my Business, for I may be killed as well as another Man.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how the Prisoner employed himself all this while?</p>
               <p>Ginn . He was at Home all the Time, and I supplied him with Necessaries.</p>
               <p>Jury. We desire he may be asked, whether as he daily goes out to Work, he can be positive the Prisoner is at Home when he is abroad?</p>

             . I am Wife to the last Witness. On the 12th of February Mr. Baker, the Prisoner was at Home at my House, and waited on Jasper who had been a long Time Ill. I remember it was the 12th of February by a very good Token, for he came down to borrow a Frying-pan, to fry some Flounders for Jasper's Dinner. He continued with Jasper the whole Evening, 'till between 8 and 9 o'Clock, at which Time, he went down into his own Room to go to Bed. I went up before 9 to ask the sick Man how he did, and I saw the Prisoner a bed. A little while afterwards, the Prisoner's Bedfellow, Oliver came in, and I called to him and desired him to fasten the Door for every body was a-bed. Mr. Oliver, has lodged with us 7 Years, and upon that Account has a Key to the Door. I heard him go up Stairs into his own Room, and talk with the Prisoner, and then he fastened his Door. This is the Coat which my Husband lent him, and he had it on that Day and 2 or 3 Days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Oliver come in?</p>
               <p>Ginn. He has a Key to the Door, and there is nothing to interrupt him, but a little Dog which we keep.</p>

            . I was at the Coach and Horses in Drury Lane on Sunday the 10th of this Month, and one Mr. Berry and Atley were in Company together. Atley told Berry he had been to Rhodes's about Mr. Baker's Affair; that Rhodes was out of Town, and his Wife would not tell him any Thing about it; upon which Berry advised him not to appear against the Prisoner, and Atley then said Rhodes had used him very ill, and he would not appear against the Prisoner , unless he (Rhodes) would give him a Note for 20 l.

            . I keep a writing Office in Horseshoe-Court near Carey Street. The Prisoner was recommended to me by one Beck, in the middle of last March, as a very good Hand, and he worked with me till the Time that he was taken. He behaved very well during the Time he was with me, and has frequently sat up all Night to do his Business.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he use to sit up on a Night, while he worked for you?</p>
               <p>Harball. Sometimes he has sat up all Night; sometimes he went home between 11 and 12 at Night, and at other Times he has had no Occasion to work longer than nine. He told me he lodged in Lewkener's Lane or Parker's Lane; and that he used to have his Victuals given him at a House in Fetter-Lane.</p>

             . On the 8th of April, between 10 and 11 at Night, I was going to the Corner of Plumbtree-Street , for some Butter and Sugar, and as I was coming home to <placeName id="t17410514-24-crimeloc117">Denmark-street</placeName>

I cried out, and turned about, to look in his Face, and saw two Men at a Distance, standing still. I saw the Prisoner's Face perfectly, by the Light of the Lamps. He had a Knife in his Hand, with which, as soon as he had knocked me down, he cut off my pocket. I attempted to cry out again, but he told me, if I spoke a Word, he would certainly cut my Throat. I had in my pocket, a Guinea, and 3 s. and 1 d. or 3 Halfpence; and as soon as he had taken it away, he went up to the two Men, and I strove to creep home as well as I could. The next Morning this piece of my pocket was found by a Milkman, in the place where I was robbed; and it agrees exactly with that piece which was left behind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How came she to know me that Night?</p>
               <p>Connor . I was acquainted with him before; he came into my House, the Day before this, and burst into the back Room, and asked if it was to be lett; so that I took particular Notice of him.</p>
               <p>Jury. What Distance were the two Men from you?</p>
               <p>Connor . About 20 or 30 Yards.</p>
               <p>Jury. By what Light could you distinguish them?</p>
               <p>Connor. By the Light of a Lamp, about 5 or 6 Yards off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her how far she was from a House when she was knocked down?</p>
               <p>Connor . It was in the Street, and there are Houses on each side of the way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Time of Night did she leave the Shop where she went to buy the Sugar?</p>
               <p>Connor . Between 10 and 11 o'Clock, and presently afterwards the Prisoner met me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If her pocket was cut off, why did not she take the Watchman from his Stand, and follow me?</p>
               <p>Connor . I saw no Watchman, nor no body; for the place was quite clear.</p>

             . I took the Prisoner on Thursday in last Sessions, in a Cobler's Shop. When I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174105140014"/> laid hold of him, the Cobler swore he would stab me; and the Prisoner got from me, and ran up Stairs, but at last we took him; and after we had handcuffed him, we brought him to an Alehouse , where he told me. that 2 other Men were concerned with him in the Robbery. This was at Humphries's , the Constable's House, and we were by ourselves. While we were together, a Woman came to him , and put some Money into his pocket, and bid him puff no body.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did he ever see me before that Day?</p>

            . I came from Bristol about 2 Months ago, and wanting private Lodgings, I took a Room in Cornor's House. One Night, about 9 or 10 o'Clock - I can't tell what sort of Time it was, but I believe it was about 6 Weeks ago, I saw Mrs. Connor's Husband give her a Guinea and some Silver, and she went out. She returned as dirty as if she had been rolled in the Kennel, and said, she had been robb'd; that three Men were concerned, and that she knew the person who knocked her down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What did you say to Mrs. Connor when she went out?</p>
               <p>Porter. Her Husband asked her, why she had not got Butter and Sugar; and then she fetch'd him some white , and some brown Sugar; I believe there were about 3 pounds and an half of each .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see any Gold in Mrs. Connor's Hand, when she went out ?</p>
               <p>Porter. Yes, her Husband handed the Guinea over the Counter to me, and I gave it to her.</p>

            . I met the Prisoner in the Street , and he asked me, if I knew one Kennedy , a Smugler , and desired me to go to Connor's, to ask him to bail him: accordingly I told Connor the Story; but he would not bail Kennedy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not Connor threaten what he would do to me, if I informed against any of his Lodgers?</p>
               <p>Kelly. I know nothing at all of that. I remember nothing else said by Connor in relation to the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Katharine Kelly. I am Wife to the last Witness, and what I have to say, I will say very true. I came to the Prisoner's House, the Night before he was taken, between 7 and 8 o'Clock, which was the very Night that Connor says she was robbed: The Prisoner was sitting by the Fire, with some Oatmeal to make a little Broth for himself and his Wife. I was for going Home, but he desired me to get his Supper ready; so I staid 'till near one o'Clock in the Morning; and I declare on my Oath, he never left the House, from the Time that I went in, to the Time of my coming away. His Wife is my Sister, and she and her Children were lying on the Bed at the same Time.</p>

             . I have seen the Prisoner at an Alehouse which I used, and never knew any Harm of him. I was present when Mrs. Connor brought the Warrant to the Constable's House, and then we went to the Cobler's, were the Prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire this Witness may be asked, how long he sat with me at Humphries's House, and whether I was not asked divers Times to make myself an Evidence.</p>
               <p>Ingram. There were 2 or 3 People that asked him to be an Evidence, and he said, would you have me be an Evidence of what I know nothing at all of? I was in the House with him from the Time he was taken, to the Time that he went before Mr. De Veil, and he always continued in the same Story, and never made any Confession at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did he hear me own that there were two other Persons concerned with me in this Robbery?</p>
               <p>Ingram. No, I never did.</p>

             . I took out Letters of Administration, upon Mr. Way's Death.</p>
               <p>The Letters of Administration were read.</p>
               <p>Mr. Maydon . I entered into the House, and was in possession of it; but knew of no Bonds, 'till a Girl gave me Information of them.</p>
               <p>Coun . What were these Bonds?</p>
               <p>Maydon. They were East-India Bonds, No. 11734, 11736, and 11737, for 100 l. apiece.</p>
               <p>Coun . Did you know what became of them?</p>
               <p>Maydon. We heard that they were sold to one Bradshaw . The Prisoner was taken on Suspicion of stealing them, and denied that she saw any Bonds for a great while, 'till Bradshaw was sent for, and then she was sensible that she had sold them.</p>
               <p>Coun. When Bradshaw came, what did she say?</p>
               <p>Maydon. She said, she had sold 3 Bonds of 100 l. apiece, and had received 300 l. for them, and that she had got some of the Money in a Box in Southwark . We went there, and found the Box in a Brandy shop; she gave us leave to break it open, and we found 250 l. which she owned was part of the Money; and she said, she would make Satisfaction for what was spent: she likewise owned, that she had received the Interest at the East-India House, but I did not hear her say, in what Name she received it.</p>
               <p>C. You say, you did not know when Way died, that these Bonds were in the House.</p>
               <p>Maydon. No, I did not know any thing of them 'till a Girl brought me Information, that they were stolen out of the House.</p>

             . I am a Broker, and was employed by Mrs. Way to buy these Bonds, on the 23d of September, 1740.</p>
               <p>Coun . What Bonds were they?</p>
               <p>Sedgewick. They were India Bonds for a hundred Pounds a piece, the Numbers were 11734, 11736, and 11737, and the Penalty of each Bond was 200 l.</p>
               <p>Coun. To whom did you deliver these Bonds?</p>
               <p>Sedgewick. To Mrs. Way, and she paid 300 l. 16 s. and 4 d. for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire Mrs. Alexander may be asked how these Bonds came into her Custody?</p>
               <p>Alexander. Mrs. Way who was my Aunt, was troubled with Fits, and lost 2 Gold Rings, so she desired me to look into a Chest for them, and I found these Bonds there in a Tin-cannister; I expected her to die, and so I took them from thence.</p>
               <p>- Bradshaw . I am a Trunk maker by Trade, but my Father keeps a Public House in Leadenhall Street and I live with him. On the 3d or 4th of last April the Prisoner came to one Mrs. Russel who lives at the Back of our House, and told her she had 3 Bonds to dispose of. Mrs. Russel brought them to my Father, and I fetched one Mr. Lyon a Broker to our House; - The Prisoner was there at the same Time. Mr. Lyon said the Bonds were very good, and if she came honestly by them, he would purchase them: he said the Interest was due the 6th of April, and if she would go and receive that, he should be satisfied that they were honest. She received the Interest, and then desired me to go with them to Lyon's, and bring her 300 l. for them, and I went with him to a Banker's and he paid me for them directly.</p>
               <p>Coun . What Day did you sell these Bonds to Lyon?</p>
               <p>Bradshaw. It was on the 6th of April.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sedgewick . The Premium at that Time was upwards of 4 l. so that there was 12 l. lost by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174105140017"/>Bradshaw . The Numbers were 11734, 36, and 37, and she desired me to get her 300 l. for them. She had a Man with her whom she called Husband, and I said it was a Wonder she troubled herself with these Bonds, and she said she could not trust her Husband with them.</p>
               <p>Coun. What sort of Money did Lyon pay you the 300 l. in?</p>
               <p>Bradshaw . It was in three Pound twelves, and Thirty six Shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Coun. to Mrs. Alexander. You say you saw the Money taken out of the Prisoner's Box, what pieces were they?</p>
               <p>Alexander. They were 3 l. 12 s. and 36 s. pieces.</p>

               <p>Coun . Give an Account of what she said at that Time.</p>
               <p>Roberts. I was sent for about 5 o'Clock in the Evening to the George Inn, in Aldersgate Street, and took Charge of the Prisoner. She would not own any Thing 'till Bradshaw came, and then she began to squeek, and said to Mrs. Alexander, '' Patty, I '' always had a Value for you, and I can give you '' above 200 l. of the Money back again.'' She said the Money was at a Relation's of hers, who was a Distiller in the Maze, Southwark. Then her Box was fetched from thence and brought to the White Lyon in Aldersgate Street, and the Prisoner broke it open herself with a Poker. There was about 250 l. in the Box, and the Attorney asked her if it was the Property of Mrs. Alexander, and she said it was.</p>
               <p>Coun. Did she say it was the produce of these Bonds?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Yes, and that it was all that was left, but she would make Satisfaction for what she had spent when it lay in her Power.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I break the Box open, or Mrs. Alexander?</p>
               <p>Roberts. She sat near the Fire, and rose up, and broke it open herself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mrs Alexander who broke the Box open?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Alexander. At first she said the Box should not be broke open, but afterwards she took the poker out of the Fire, and I broke it open myself with her Leave.</p>
               <p>Roberts. The Prisoner broke it about half open?</p>
               <p>Mr. Webb. I belong to the East India House.</p>

            . I was at the Death of Alexander's Uncle, Mr. Way, and I was attentive (attended) in the Way of my Business on Mrs. Way: she was not capable of looking after her own Business, but was taken to drinking, and I have known he to go to the Bottle 14 or 15 Times in an Hour When Mr. Way was dead, the Brewer came and got Mrs. Way when she was not in her Senses to go, and he administered to her Husband's Will, whereof after they had led the old Woman up in Ignorance for 3 or 4 Days, they brought an Execution into the House; and there was a Country Boy that was a Servant there one Day called me, and said he was afraid his Mistress was dead, whereof I got up, and the Woman was as good as dead indeed, but we smoked a Pipe of Tobacco under her Nose and brought her to herself: whereof she had another Fit, and then the Kinswoman, as I may call her, went to Mrs. Way's pocket Apron and took out the Key of the Chest: then she opened the Chest, and took out 14 or 15 l. 2 silver Spoons, and a Ladle; then she took a Tin Box, and took out of it something which I could perceive was a Bond. She then went to another great Chest, and took a Box of Silver Pence, and went away. She came in again soon afterwards, and took some other Things away, and two more papers out of the Tin Box; whereof she came to me afterwards, and said, that Mrs. Reason had stole the Things which I saw her take out of the Tin Box, and she would hang her, if there was not another Woman in the World.</p>
               <p>Coun. Are you sure there was an Execution in the House?</p>
               <p>Stokes. Yes, Mr. Maydon brought it in, while I was in the House.</p>
               <p>Coun. What do you call an Execution?</p>
               <p>Stokes. Indeed I can't say, - but I know, when the Execution was brought in, Mrs. Alexander fill'd her pockets with Money. Mr. Way is dead, and after her Husband's Death, there was a false Will made, and I was a Witness to it.</p>
               <p>C. to Alexander. When did your Aunt die?</p>
               <p>Alexander. I can't justly tell the Day of the Month, but she was buried on St. Mark's Day, and died the Wednesday before. Mr. Way died the 23d of March.</p>

            . I lived at Mr. Way's. My Master died on Friday and the Sunday following, I was sent down into the Cellar, for a Shovel of Coals, and found some papers in the Coal-hole , and gave them to the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Coun . How came you to give them to the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I don't know what they were, for I can neither write nor read: - I thought they might serve to light pipes of Tobacco. I know nothing, but that I pick'd them up.</p>

               <p>Hatton. They were 3 single papers, like Letters.</p>

               <p>Maydon . No, he never pretended any such Thing. The Prisoner denied she had seen them, 'till Bradshaw came; and then she said the Boy gave them to her.</p>

Flack, seeing the Door open , said, there was a Chance , and thought there had been no body in the Room: They bid me go in; so I went through the parlour into the Kitchen, where there were 2 Children at play by the Fire-side . There was no Candle in the Room, and I happened to put my Hand up just at the Corner of the Room, and felt a Bundle of Linen, which I took away; and the Maid coming up with the Water, we all ran away, as fast as we could to the Prisoner Bunce's, in Green's Rents by Fleet-Ditch . As I was coming through Bride's-Alley , I dropped some of the Linen, and met Bunce ; she said, I was in a great Hurry, not to stay to pick it up, and so she took it up herself, and followed me to her House. When we came there, we went up into her one pair of Stairs Room, and looked over the Things; there were laced Caps, laced Handkerchiefs, Shirts, Caps and Aprons, and she said, they were all Rags, and worth but a Trifle ; so she gave us 7 s. 6 d. for them, and we shared it amongst us.</p>

             . I know that the Prisoner Bunce bought this Linen of Lupton , Lowther, and Flack, at her House in Green's Rents. When Lowther brought the Bundle up Stairs, it was opened , and there were two ruffled Shirts in it, a laced Pinner and Coif, and a laced Handkerchief about two Fingers bread . There were a great many other Things, and she gave them 7 s. 6 d. for them all; but I believe they were worth at least between 4 and 5 l.

             . I am Servant to Mrs. Barnes , and this Money was left in my Care. About 3 Months before this Money was missed, my Mistress told it over herself and locked it up, and then there were 25 Guineas, which she desired me to take particular Care of. On the 15th of last Month , I got up in the Morning to go to be blooded, and left my Mistress a-bed; the Prisoner, who was an Apprentice in the House where my Mistress lives, let me out, and went over Tower-Hill with me, and said he would meet me as I came back , but he did not. When I came back, my Mistress's Curtains were pinn'd together, which gave me a Suspicion that some body had been in the Room, so after Dinner we looked over the Money and missed 4 Guineas. I can't swear who took the Money , but afterwards 4 Guineas were found in the Prisoner's Box, and we thought no one could take it but him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Whitaker. The Prisoner work'd for me in my Warehouse, and having lost very large Quantities of Tobacco, I told my Clerk, I could not go on in this Manner, for either the Thieves must be detected, or I must quit my House. On this Day sev'night some of my Men were at the Water Side, and I went to a Neighbour's House, where I had not been long before the Prisoner came to the Gate, and was followed presently by 2 others: Upon this I stepp'd up to them, and asked them where they were going? They said, to get some Beer. I desired them to go back again, and they seemed a little surprized. I took them into the Compting-house, and told them I had lost above 500 lb. worth of Tobacco since they had worked for me, and should be very glad to find that they were honest, but I must search them. They denied that they had any Thing about them, but on my searching them, I found on each of them, at least 6 lb. of Tobacco squeezed down in their Breeches. <rs id="t17410514-51-verdict226" type="verdictDescription">
