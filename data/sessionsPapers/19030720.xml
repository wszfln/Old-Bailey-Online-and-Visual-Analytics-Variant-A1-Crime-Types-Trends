                  </hi>. I am a reservist, and lived at 4, Queen Street, Edgware Road, in the beginning of June, with my brother Alfred with the object of finding employment as a commissionaire—on Sunday, June 21st, about 5 p.m., I was walking towards Brook Green with my brother and Horace Apps—we were going to Shepherd's Bush to get a tram to come to the Edgware Road—as we were crossing the road Apps said, "There is a black man," my brother said, "That is the big wheel," and pointed to it with his stick—as I looked at it I heard someone say, "If you want to f—me, f—me"—then I felt something warm trickling down my neck—I put my hand up, and found I was bleeding—I turned and saw the prisoner running away after he had made another couple of stabs at me—my brother ran after him—I next saw my brother on the ground, and the native over him—I ran and caught him and handed him over to the police—these are the clothes I was wearing (<hi rend="italic">Produced.</hi>)—</p>

I walked slowly back till I got within five or six yards of Rowan Road again. I then stood and looked at some children playing, when all at once my attention was called to three men, one saying to the other,' Look at that black f—.'I says,' Gentlemen, why should you try to insult a gentleman. I try to go along the road without insulting you or anyone else? "With that they came over to me in a fighting attitude, saying, 'Who the b—f—are you; can you do anything? "I says, 'I am a gentleman, I hope.' One said to the other, 'Bill, give him one,' which he immediately set about doing, pulling his coat off at the same time,</p>

               <p>but I stepped back. The two men then struck at me, and I kicked one in the stomach. Soon as I did that one struck me in the face with a stick, which broke the stick and knocked me down. One man then kicked me, and the other punched me, and it was then, and not till then, that I drew the knife and cut at them.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel McQuaid of 6, Kings-wood Road, Fulham—the deceased was my daughter—she was eighteen last April—she worked at a laundry—I have known the prisoner for ten or twelve years—he and the deceased have played together since they were children—for the last four years they have been very much together—on April 10th the prisoner asked me if he could be engaged to the deceased—I said, "Yes, as you make your bed you must He on it; you can have her with the greatest of pleasure"—he was supposed to give her the ring on the following Saturday week, the 18th, which was her birthday—on that day I saw it—I think she was wearing it—the prisoner had shown it to me on the day before—I saw her wearing it afterwards—on Wednes<lb/>day, July 1st, she came in to dinner as usual—she did not go out again that evening—as a rule she went out every night with the prisoner—next day, Thursday, she came home to dinner and tea, and again at 9.10 p.m.—she took a piece of bread off the table—she went out again, and I saw no more of her until she was lying dead in the Avenue—I saw the ring on that day on her finger—I was called by two boys—I went into Hartopp Avenue—the deceased was lying there covered up all but her feet—I was not allowed to go near.</p>

I am a labourer, and live with my parents at 6, Kingswood Road, Fulham—the deceased was my sister—I know the prisoner and have worked with him at the same place for seven or eight weeks—I have known him for some years—on July 1st we walked home together from our work—I left him about 8.10 p.m.—as I was leaving him I said, "I suppose you are hurrying home to meet Bridget?"—he said, "No, we have had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>"—I asked him what it was over, and he told me he would not humble to make it up to speak to her again—next day he told me that the quarrel was about her going to Scotland with Louisa Turner, and that he did not care for Louisa's company—he said that he had told her that if she went he would have no more to do with her, and that he had used some foul language towards her—he said that my sister replied, "My mother won't stop me, and I am sure you wont"—I was</p>

               <p>working with him on July 2nd—he said he had received a letter the night before from my sister saying that she would return the ring on Friday next, and send her younger sister with it—he said he did not want her to return it but to keep it, and asked me to tell her so—I did not have an opportunity of telling her so—I told her mother—that evening I went to the Salisbury public house with him—he said he did not trouble, that it would not be much, and that he and my sister would be together again before Friday—I parted from him and saw no more of him that evening—I did not notice anything unusual in his manner on that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edmund William Gibbs, of 38, Hartopp Avenue, Fulham—the prisoner is my son—he was twenty-one on July 4th.—on July 2nd he came home about 7.30 p.m., and about 9 p.m. he and I were at the window of a front room on the first floor—I went into the kitchen, leaving the prisoner in the front room—I heard a knock at the front door—I had not seen anybody outside the house when I was in the front room—the prisoner went down to open the front door—I remained up stairs—I went back into the front room—the prisoner and the deceased were there talking together—I went into the kitchen again to light the lamp—I heard a noise down stairs; it seemed like a little bit of scuffling—I went into the front room again as quick as I could—I opened the window—I looked out and saw the prisoner across and on the top of the deceased, who was lying on the ground about six yards from the front door—I screamed out twice, "Tom, Tom; you are killing her"—I did not stop to see what he was doing to her—he was doing something to her neck, but I do not know what—I was frightened—I came down as quickly as I could, and went to the Jubilee police station at Fulham in order to bring help—the prisoner is left-handed—I could not see if he had anything in his hand when I left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the deceased came the prisoner was sitting in the front room—when the prisoner went downstairs, I did not go to the window to see who it was at the door, because I knew—she always came round about that time—when I went into the room they were talking very quietly—until I heard the noise of the scuffling I took no notice—there was no screaming or noise of quarrelling—T could not hear what they were saying—the prisoner is a teetotaler—he has never tasted drink—he is one of twins—when he was at school, a boy threw a piece of state at him and hit him on the head—he was brought home with a bad wound—I had to let him sit on the stairs or in the yard—he has the scar now—he lost his senses—he seemed rather strange afterwards—he was five or six years old then—after that he often went oft in convulsive fits—they used</p>

               <p>to send for me at the school—I had to go and bring him home—I do not know how many fits he had in a year—I did not take that notice—I did not have a doctor; the fits were not bad enough, and I am not very well off—some time ago he had a fit and was taken to the Jubilee Hospital—I do not know if it was eighteen months ago—I know one of his mates named McCarthy; I remember him bringing the prisoner home one day—he was very bad for some time and I had to watch him and bathe his face—he came to and lay quiet—when he came home he stared about and groaned to himself—he lay on the bed; his eyes were rolling; I had to keep his hands down; he was waving them about; he always behaved like that when he was in a fit—about twelve months ago he had some clinkers thrown on the back of his neck, and I had to go to the Jubilee Hospital for him—he came home; he was all right when I got there—I heard McCarthy say that he had a fit two or three months ago—the prisoner played football sometimes—I heard of his having a fit on the football field—I cannot remember when that was; it was some time last year—when he had the fits he went off as if he was in a faint; he went off suddenly; he would fall down; I always tried to get him on the bed and hold his hands down and bathe his face—after he had been off a little time he would come to, crying, and then be quite still for a time as though he was dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The last fit that I remember was one that I did not see—I only heard of it as having taken place on the football field—Mc<lb/>Carthy told me of it—the prisoner was so quiet he would never tell me any<lb/>thing—I did not hear of another "fit after that one—he was very good at his work—he has been working for a number of different people for a long time—he was with Mr. Pickering as errand boy for about 4 1/2. years, from July, 1896, to June, 1900; he was then with Mr. Walker as an engine cleaner from July, 1900, to June, 1901; then with Mr. Bingham from July, 1901. to November, 1901, and then with Mr. Meredith, where he worked up to this time—when he had a fit he would fall down if there was no one there to save him—I never saw any foaming at the mouth—the effect of a fit was that he fell when it was upon him and lay there until he was in some way helped by somebody—I do not know if they were more constant while he was at school than they were lately—he left school in October, 1896—I cannot say how many fits he has had since then—sometimes I have never taken any notice of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner of 252, Daws Road, Fulham—about 10.20 on July 2nd I was called to Hartopp Avenue—I. found the deceased lying on her back, her throat and hands</p>

               <p>were covered with blood, and a large quantity of blood was on the ground—she was quite dead—I saw that there were wounds on her throat, face, and forehead, upon both hands, and below her left ear, such as could be inflicted with the large blade of this knife—on her left side, as she lay, I found a ring case with a ring in it, a pencil, and a key: I handed them to Butt—I examined the prisoner, who was lying four or five feet from the girl's left side: he appeared to be in a dazed condition, his face was very pale, there was a small superficial cut on his right wrist, which was bleeding slightly, and might have been self inflicted when holding the knife—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the 4th—on the forehead I found a wound 1 in. above the right eyebrow, 2 in. long, and the flesh divided to the bone; under the left ear there were two superficial cuts; on the face there was a wound 7 in. in length, commencing on the bridge of the nose, 3/4 in. from the right eye, and passing obliquely down the face, over the cheek to the jaw, dividing the muscles and the blood vessels; that was a serious wound, it crossed over the lower jaw to the neck, and cut through the muscles and blood vessels of the neck; there was an incised wound on the throat, commencing 3/4 in. above the right margin of the breast bone, meeting the other cut and forming a continuous cut, the windpipe was completely severed; in the wound I found this broken blade of a knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), the sharp edge was pointing forwards and outwards; there were five wounds on the right hand, three of which were superficial; the other two were deep, they went between the fingers, and were about 3/4 in. in depth; on the left hand there were two wounds, the first finger was almost severed; there was one superficial cut between the first and second finger; the cause of death was due to shock and hoemorrhage in the throat; I have fitted the piece of blade which I found in the throat with the piece which still remains in the hasp of the knife: they fit exactly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The knife is an ordinary pen knife—great force must have been used; the prisoner must have used all his strength—there were twelve or thirteen wounds altogether—it must have been a very ferocious attack indeed—there is no necessity for the prisoner to be mad to inflict them, an ordinary person may have inflicted them just the same—if a person was attacked by a madman these are the sort of wounds I should expect to find—when I got up to the prisoner he was lying as though he was dead: he was very pale, his eyes were then closed—if a man was recovering from a fit of an epileptic nature, he would be likely to be pale and to lie still—the recovery may be very sudden and very rapid—the attacks may come on very suddenly and without any warning whatever—the origin of epilepsy is the sudden liberation of nervous energy from the nerve centre in the brain—it is a very obscure disease—a person suffering from it may between the fits have ordinary health, as well as immediately before a fit—a few minutes after a fit he may be back in his normal condition—people in fits of this kind absolutely loose control and consciousness, and sometimes have very Little recollection of it afterwards—the fits may be regular or irregular—there may be an interval of months—a fit after a long interval may be much the same as other fits or it may be worse—sometimes the sole symptom of a fit is mental derangement;</p>

               <p>epileptic mania may come on with no symptom except the mania itself—I do not think that is more likely to happen when there has been a long interval—I do not think it would make much difference—twitching of the hands and foaming at the mouth would indicate an epileptic fit, rolling eyes would indicate or be suggestive of an epileptic fit—if a man was tearing at himself and others, that would be quite consistent with epilepsy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Twitching of the hands, rolling eyes, and foaming at the mouth are leading indications of epilepsy—a man may have a fit without foaming at the mouth; it is not invariable, but it is common to have it—the tongue is very frequently bitten, that is also a leading indica<lb/>tion of a fit—I did not notice any signs of it in this case—the patient looses consciousness so as to deprive him of all knowledge of what he is doing or what he was doing whilst the fit lasts, but the loss of consciousness may be only a matter of a few seconds—it is not inconsistent with epilepsy that a man should, while in a fit, cut a woman's throat and leave in it the broken blade of the knife which he had used, and not fully realise that fact; if he had been under the influence of epilepsy at the time he did it it is somewhat extraordinary, but it would be possible—in my opinion the prisoner's condition on this night would not be inconsistent with a minor epileptic attack, that is an attack devoid of some of its leading indications that would render him unconscious for a few moments of what it was that he did—the whole fit might not last more than a minute.</p>

It is possible that the blade of the knife was broken in pulling it out—it was very deeply embedded, and was right behind the spinal column—it is possible that the prisoner was suffering from an epileptic fit, that he may have recovered while pulling out the knife, and may afterwards remember that the blade broke while he was doing so—a man may suffer from epileptic mania without foaming at the mouth or rolling of the eyes; at such a moment a patient is likely to become very violent; in the annals of medical study it is known to have been the frequent cause of violent crime and homicide.</p>

The fit itself may be the first indication of epileptic mania—the prisoner's history would have no effect upon my opinion, if he had fits at school they might gradually get worse, the fits might go on until he got into an epileptic condition—I heard that years ago, while at school, he was subject to fits, but cases may get better and then break out again—I should have expected him to become worse—if a man made a violent attack upon another for purposes of his own that might be likely to bring on an epileptic fit—the fit might be the result of violence and the violence not the result of the fit.</p>

I am a plasterer's apprentice—I am a friend of the prisoner—we used to play at football together—I knew he had fits—I have seen him in them—on October 25th, 1903, he had one on the football field—a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> had his nose broken, and the prisoner came across the field to see who the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> was and no sooner had he seen the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> on the ground with his nose broken than he went off—he had to be helped to the dressing room and was done for the day—I do not remember his having another fit on the football field some time before—I had seen him in fits at other times; once when we described to him how a little girl had been run over in Daws Road; he turned round and fell in the arms of me and a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> named Thomas—he was quite helpless, so we took him home to his mother, a distance of about 150 yards—we had to carry him—his fists were clenched—as we got to the door he seemed to come round—we handed him to Mrs. Gibbs—his eyes were staring—that was-about eighteen month ago—I was coming home on a <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> once when I saw him being carried along—I asked the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> how he was, and he told me he had had some clinkers thrown on his neck—I do not remember the date of that (<hi rend="italic">July</hi>, 1900).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was being carried by two others who worked in the engine shed—he was throwing his arms about—when he saw the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> with the broken nose there was a lot of blood about—he came over faint—he walked to the tent but others had to help him—we never saw no more of him after he was taken off the field.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Rugby Chambers, Gt. James Street, Bloomsbury, and am a journalist—I have an account at the Economic Bank—Massey was the manager of the bank at one time, and in that way I became acquainted with him—in September, 1902, I met Massey in Bishopsgate Street—he showed me some circulars similar to the ones now produced (<hi rend="italic">Exhibits</hi> 11 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 4).—each of them contained the statement, "50 per cent. of the customers' balances invested in trustee securities"—I asked Mr. Massey whether the methods adopted were the same as in the old bank regarding the customers' balances, and he said the same arrangement would be adopted—he asked me to give my account to him as well as accounts of my friends—he said he should like all his old friends to stand by him, that he had only the best men as directors, and they had large head quarters in Covent Garden—I next day opened a petty cash account at the bank for my firm—I paid in various sums, about £187—my balance when the bank stopped was £20 18s. 7d.—after the bank stopped payment I met Mr. Massey—I asked him how the affairs of the bank were proceeding, and he replied that it would be a long-winded affair, because it was in the hands of the Official Receiver, but that ulti<lb/>mately we should receive about 3s. in the £—I asked him how he could account for that if 50 per cent. of the balances had been invested in Trustee and Colonial securities—he replied that the directors had repudiated that resolution—I told him that in my opinion the directors could not rescind such a resolution without notifying us—he said, "Oh, well, that is all right, you will conic out right anyway: I must go, good-bye."</p>

Harding was appointed a director of the bank—I find a minute of October 31st, 1902, appointing titled directors, Mr. Massey being in the Chair, Mr. Frost and Mr. Harding being the other directors present—under date August 6th, 1902, I find a minute appointing Massey a joint managing director—I find an entry stating that letter cards Nos. 51 and 55 were approved and ordered to be posted.</p>

               <p>which were the proceeds of the two forged cheques, Exhibits 1 and 2—by June 22nd I had traced a good number of them—on the 22nd I received information from Miss James, and in consequence I went to the corner of Rochester Square, Camden Town—there I saw Manning, about 1 p.m.—and after hearing something from him, I followed the prisoner—he went in the direction of Euston Road, and I lost sight of him—at 10 minutes to three I saw him enter the Eagle Public House—after leaving there he went to 16, Rochester Square—at 9.30 I saw him with Mr. and Mrs. Fenton leave the Camden Arms in Randolph Street—I caught hold of him, and told him I was a police officer, and should take him into custody, and that he would be charged with being concerned with another man not in custody in forging and uttering two cheques, one drawn for £195 10s. on May 26th, and the other for £325 on May 28th, both on the Capital and Counties Bank, Fore Street, and both purporting to be signed by 0. E.

               <p>then went away, and I arranged to meet him in a day or two to let him know what my master intended to do—I met him and told him that my master-was satisfied with it and would like to see him to arrange the business—a day or two later I went with Soulman to a house in Camberwell to introduce him to my governor—we' were admitted by Sergeant Wensley, and I introduced him to Soulman as my governor—the interview was a satisfactory one, and on the way home Soulman told me that he was satisfied now that he had met my master, and he hoped that the business would finish, and he said he would telegraph the first thing in the morning to the Russian officer—he arranged to let me know the answer to the telegram on the Sunday, and on the Sunday I met him and he produced a letter written in Russian, and read it to me—I cannot read Russian—all our conversations were in German—the letter was to the effect that the Russian officer did not understand the telegram, and that the gold dust was to be sold by the Russian weight, and the exact quantity was 82 lbs.—at the same interview he gave me a brass weight which he said weighed a quarter of a pound, and told me that that was the weight the officer referred to—I afterwards gave it to Sergeant Wensley—a few days later he showed me a telegram purporting to come from some town in Russia, saying that the price arranged by Wensley and Soulman had been accepted by the Russian officer, and gave it to me to show my master—I gave it to Wensley—a few days after I saw Soulman again, and returned him all the things he had given me, and told him that my master would not have anything to do with it because it must be a swindle—he then asked me if I could keep a secret; I said, yes; and he explained to me that the stuff he was trying to sell my master was not gold but brass filings; I was surprised, and told him that he was trying to do me as well; he said, "Never mind that, if we succeed in getting the money we shall have equal shares"—I said, very well, and promised to give him my assistance and tell my governor that everything was all right—a day or two later I saw him again, and he showed me a telegram in German saying, "Left Russia for England"—it was not signed—a week afterwards I met Weinstone at his house, 33, Maidmans Street—I saw Soulman there filling a bag with brass filings—I asked him when he was going to deliver the stuff to my governor, and we arranged the following evening at nine o'clock—I arranged to meet him at 33, Maidmans Street to help carry the filings—he asked me if I was sure my governor would have the money, and I told him he need not trouble about that—he told me that when he got the money he would do it up in small packets, each containing an equal share, and he would ask my governor to allow me to show him the way to the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>, and when we got outside we should go straight to Euston and then to Manchester, and then to Berlin, where there was another busi<lb/>ness prepared—I called at Maidmans Street the next evening—Soulman was there, not Weinstone—he gave me two bottles, one containing aqua<lb/>fortis and the other water—I asked him how I could distinguish them, and he pointed out a small piece of paper in the neck of the bottle con<lb/>taining the aquafortis, and told me to carry the aquafortis in the right pocket and the water in the left—he gave me the bottles in case my</p>

               <p>governor wanted to have the gold tested—when we had got the money, if he asked for the aquafortis I was to give him the bottle of water—we then went together to the Great Eastern Hotel, where we saw Weinstone—on the way Soulman told me that Weinstone was going to act the Russian officer—he was wearing a silk hat when we met him—after having some drinks at the Great Eastern Hotel, Soulman asked me to call a cab—I did so, and we all three got in and drove away—in Christian Street the cab was stopped and the two prisoners were arrested—during the whole of the proceedings I was acting under the instructions of the police.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Serjeant H.</hi>) I got certain information about this case from Marks, and on June 10th, about 9 p.m., he introduced me to Soulman at an address in Camberwell—I knew him as Kaplin—I said to him, "I have tested that nugget of gold you let Marks have, and I am satisfied that it is pure gold: what is the quantity you want to sell, and is the bulk up to sample"—he said, "There is about 90 lbs.; it is all virgin gold the same as the nugget I gave Marks to show you; but before entering into business I want to ask you a question; can you keep a secret?"—I replied, "Yes, I have done so"—he nodded his head in approval and said, "I can see you are a business man, I will tell you; is a great secret, and if you keep it we can make you very rich; there is an officer in a very high position in the Russian Army, and his position enables him to get large quantities of raw gold from the Russian mines across the frontier, two or three times a year; the gentleman who used to purchase it is dead, he died worth a lot of money; we have now to find another buyer"—I said, "Do you mean the gold is stolen"—he replied, "I am surprised you should ask me such a question, but there, you English<lb/>men are all alike, you are not clever, you are too straightforward to be clever, we foreigners know the world best"—I said, "There may be a great deal of truth in what you say, but I want to know my position"—he said, "Of course it is what you would call stolen, but the police here cannot touch you, the risk is getting it over the frontier and would mean terrible punishment if they caught us there"—I said, "What do you want for it?"—he said, "We have always had 25 per cent. below the market value"—I said, "That is a lot more than I should give"—he replied, "Well, what do you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190307200051"/>
               <p>think would be a fair price"—I said, "Considering the risk, 50 per cent."—he said, "We cannot let it go for that, but in order to secure your custom, I think the officer would let you have it at 35 per cent, below the market value, which we will say is £3 5s. per ounce or £39 per lb., and that will work out act at 25 per cent, for me, 35 per cent, for the officer, and 35 per cent yourself, leaving 5 per cent. for working expenses"—I said, "That is more reasonable; how much do you propose to bring, and what are the facilities you intend to offer me to see that the bulk is up to sample? how many do you wish to be present at the transaction, and what do you propose about payment?"—he laughed and said, "You are really more clever than I thought you were; I like dealing with clever men. I shall bring about 90 lbs., and shall bring everything you want, both to test the gold and to weigh it; you can have Marks to look after your interests and my principal the Russian officer will come with me, because although he has got confidence in me I should hardly like to ask him to trust me with such a large quantity, and he would not come alone because he would expect me to look after his interests and do the work"—I said, "Very well, that is understood"—he said then, "I shall communicate with you through Marks and let you know the date and hour when we will bring it; I shall let you know two or three days before, so that you can get the money out of the bank, as we should like to have it in gold"—I then said I had other gentlemen to see and must bid him good night—he asked me for my card—I said, "I have not asked you for your card, I will give you mine, but not now"—they then left—I did not have any other conversation with Soulman—I saw Marks from time to time, and gave him instructions—on June 28th I charged the prisoners—in reply Soulman said, "You only wanted to give me 38s. per ounce, you know"—I did not part with any money—altogether I pretended to buy £2,280 worth of dust.</p>

I am the medical superintendent at the Whitechapel Infirmary—on May 28th, Harriet Clenshaw brought a little girl about nine years old, who I know now as Harriet Clenshaw, to me—I examined her—she was emaciated, her body was covered with bites from fleas and vermin, there was a bruise covering the whole of the right cheek, sores over the right ear, over the left ear, and on the scalp there were sores, the head was verminous, the body was dirty, the feet were extremely filthy as if they had not been washed for months—there were blood stains on the buttock; the clothing was swarming with vermin—the blood stains were due to prolapsus of the bowels—I did not discover that until afterwards—the stockings were footless, and the whole body, on removing the clothing, was found to be greatly emaciated—the child was very drowsy, frequently coughing; there was great tenderness all over the body—she cried out on being touched or moved—she was in a high state of fever and dangerously ill—it took food ravenously, and had to be carefully watched to prevent its taking too much—the pulse was very rapid and small—she was in great distress and seemed apprehensive on anyone going near her—the bruise on the right cheek looked as if it had been caused by a blow from the flat of the hand, and I should say within three or four days—the sores were caused by neglect—the one near the eye was crusted and scabbed over when I saw it—I knew nothing of another blow at that time—the child continued very ill indeed, and died on June 18th—it weighed 30 lb. 14 oz.—the normal weight of a girl of that age would be 52 lbs.—on June 19th I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination externally, the body was emaciated; there was no fat anywhere about the body, and the muscles were very pale and bloodless; there was an excess of fluid in the brain; the whole of both lungs were riddled with tubercle, and there was a cavity in the upper part of the left lung; there was also a tubercle in the spleen and mensenteric glands—tuberculosis would cause emaciation, which I think was partly due to disease and partly to want of food—the cause of death was acute tuberculosis, accelerated by neglect, want of food, medical aid, and attention—it is most difficult to get patients, as a rule, to take food at all when suffering from tuberculosis, but this</p>

Henri and Madame Germain—after the luncheon he said that he was going to London, and asked me if I would go with him—I said I did not want to leave my people—he said I should have fine dresses and lots of money instead of working for thirty sous a day—I saw him again two days afterwards in the street by accident—he complained of my not keeping an appointment I had made with him—he asked me to go with him and have something to</p>

Germain, and M. Henri, travelling alone to Dieppe and on the boat, by the prisoner's instructions—I first went with Mme. Germain to an hotel in Old Compton Street, while the prisoner and M. Henri went to look for lodgings—the prisoner came back and I left with him and went to 4, Reckton Place, Earls Court—a gentleman came with us, the man who lives with Mme. Albert—rooms were taken at Mme. Albert's—the prisoner said to Mme. Albert, "You have to explain to her what she has to do when she goes out"—I was instructed in the following manner: when I went out and a gentleman smiled at me, I was to smile back, and if he said, "Halloa, my dear, where do you live? "I had to give the address, and when asked how much I was to receive, to reply "10s." or "5s." according to the style and dress of the man—I put some black on my eyebrows, some red on my lips, and rouge on my face, and went out with Mme. Albert she spoke to some man, but nothing came of it—I slept with the prisoner, who wanted to have sexual intercourse, but I refused—next evening I again went out with Mme. Albert—the prisoner told me to—I did not speak to any strange man while out, nor did anyone speak to me—the next evening I again went out and spoke to a man, and he went home with me and gave me 18s.—I did not want to submit to him, and he went away, and then the landlord of the house wanted to put me out of doors—I again slept with the prisoner—he told me to continue going out and try to make more money—I slept with the prisoner every night—we left our lodging on June 4th, and went to 4, May's Build<lb/>ings, St. Martin's Lane—the prisoner told me there might be a better chance of earning money in that neighbourhood—we stayed there eight days—I used to go out, the prisoner made me do so, but as I did not bring anyone home he was not satisfied—on June 10th, Inspector Macarthy spoke to me—I am seventeen years old, having been born on June 10th. 1886—I am now living at 64, Camberwell New Road in the care of the police.</p>

               <p>Carlin—I had been to the house on the 14th—I had seen Armand before, and the woman who passed as Madame Dibon—on this Monday I saw Armand enter the house with the girl Laurent—I knocked at the door after he had entered—I asked for him—he came forward—I asked for Mrs. Dibon in French—he replied in English—he has been in this country nearly ten years—I took a note of the conversation—I first asked to speak to him privately—he said, "It is private here"—I said, "We are police officers and are making enquiries about a young girl who was brought from France yesterday morning. We have a suspicion that she was brought to this house"—he said, "There is no girl here at all, the only females in the house are my wife and the servant"—I said, "You were seen to meet a man whom I believe to be your brother, yesterday morning at Victoria Station—your brother had a young girl with him, and there is reason to believe that she is being brought here for the purpose of prostitution"—he said, "No, no: no girl has been brought over here at all; I went to Victoria Station to meet my brother, but the woman who was with us was my wife. My brother had come from Egypt"—I said, "I am sure the girl is here; I have just seen her come in with you. A watch has been kept on the house"—he said, "It is a mistake, the woman who came in with me is my wife"—I said, "I am sure the girl is here, and I am going to look in all the rooms of the house"—I went into several rooms—Armand led the way—he took me to two basement rooms, kitchens—among others I went into a room on the first floor, used as a bedroom—I saw the girl Laurent and a woman, who the prisoner said was his wife, in Armand's presence—I endeavoured to question Laurent in French, but it was impossible to get any statement because Armand was excited and kept interrupting and abusing the girl—he called her a "<hi rend="italic">salle vache</hi>," "which means a. dirty cow, and used other horrid expressions of that kind—eventually finding it impossible to get any statement from the girl, I told her I should take her to Scotland Yard, and asked Armand to come with me—starting to come down stairs Pierre was coming in at the front door—he walked in and was coming up stairs, but turned and <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi>, but Carlin stopped him—I took them to Scotland Yard—on the way Armand said in English, "My brother got her from a man in Paris, I suppose you will want him also"—I asked him who the man was, and his address, in Paris—he replied, "My brother will give you his address, he is still in Paris"—at Scotland Yard I took Armand into one room and the girl into another where I took her statement with great difficulty—upon that statement I got a warrant at Bow Street against both prisoners—I read and ex<lb/>plained the warrant in French and English to the prisoners—Pierre replied in French, and I took his statement down as he said it—this is a translation of it, "I want to explain the thing to you. I have come from Egypt; I arrived in Paris at 5 o'clock last Thursday evening, and met the girl the next day about 3 o'clock. I asked her to have something to drink, and told her that I was—leaving for London the next day. She said she would be happy to come with me. She said that she was a young girl and that she had no parents. She said that she was more than eighteen</p>

               <p>years of age. The next day she told me she had a mother but no father, and that she had not seen her mother for the past two months"—Dibons replied, "I received a letter last Saturday from my brother asking me to meet him at Victoria Station, and saying he was coming with a friend. I went to Victoria and saw my brother, who introduced the girl to me saying she was his new wife—my brother asked me if I had a room to spare, but I had none—he stayed at my place, but went away at night to sleep at a place in Wells Street, I do not know the number, it is over a greengrocer's shop. It belongs to a man I know, who had some rooms to let"—then he asked, "What is there against me?"—I know the woman who lives with Armand is a prostitute, and that she has been convicted as such—the second woman in the house is also a prostitute—she is living in a room let to her and a man, by the prisoner Dubois—I have no evidence of her conviction, but she is known to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not produce the conviction against the woman who lives with Armand—I have sent for it—I cannot give you more than the statement which has been read—it is part of the information upon which the warrant was granted—I know Pierre went to Egypt, why he went, with whom he went, which way he sailed, and when he arrived in London.</p>

On June 15th I was keeping observation on 201, Great Portland Street—about 11 a.m. I saw Dibon leave the house with a man and come back about 12.30' with a girl—a few minutes afterwards I went into the house with Inspector McCarthy—I have heard and agree with his account of what happened there—I was present in the front room when McCarthy, tried to speak to the girl—I said to Dibon, "That is the girl I saw you come in with some time ago—he said, "Yes, there was a woman there"—I stopped Dubois at the door—he tried to <hi rend="italic">bolt</hi>—I had seen him before—he knew me—after he had been charged I went back with another officer to 201, Great Portland Street—there are seven rooms, four are occupied—in the two bedrooms and in the kitchen I found indecent drawings (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—some were on the walls—some photographs were in frames—I saw Madame Dubois—she passes as Armand's wife—I know her as a prostitute.</p>

Barrington—he said, "You won't"—we then struggled again—he got me on to the main line, and said, "The eleven o'clock train is coming through, and we will both die together"—we struggled, and he got my cape over my head—I drew my truncheon and hit him over the head—I could hear a train coming and I could see the lights—he was very violent—I had as much as I could do—I got him off the line just as the train was coming—he said, "You won't get me now; you are only a policeman, and your life will not be safe"—I then hit him across the legs—we struggled and fell up against the trucks again—another constable then came up, and we put him on a truck because we could not get an ambulance—I never lost sight of him—at the station he said he thought there was a £60 cheque in the office, and he did not mind doing a period.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector N.</hi>) I was in charge of the Rotherhithe Police Station on June 15th, when the prisoner was brought in—James Wilton said, in his presence, "This man invited me to com ashore and fight. I came ashore, and we had a fight. He went away, and as I was walking down the Plough Road, I met him coming back with a revolver, and he fired at me three or four times, I think he has shot me in the right side of my back. He got his lot in the fight," meaning a black eye and a contusion of the nose—I said to the prisoner, "You will be charged with attempting to murder Wilton with the revolver, by shooting him"—I cautioned him, and said, "You see five cartridges have been discharged; it is a six chamber revolver, and one has miss fired"—he said, "Yes, that's mine,. I have had it three or four years; the first one "miss fired, or else he would not have been here now, it would have been a job for Billington"—the charge was read to him, he made no reply—I examined the prosecutor—I produce his clothes—he was bleeding freely from a wound on his right side—I sent for the divisional surgeon, who advised me to remove him to Guy's Hospital, where he was taken—there was-also a wound on his right breast, and his clothing was pene<lb/>trated in two places, back and front—two bullets were found in his right sock—I should say the bullet that struck the chest dropped down the pants into the sock—another bullet was found in a-garden near where the affray took place—both men had been drinking—neither was drunk.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Dr. Counsel said that the prisoner would make his own statement in his defence, which was that they had been good friends but had been drinking; that he asked Sweeney what he meant by letting timber drop in the dock, when Wilton said, "What's that to do with you?" called him a foul name, and jumped down and struck him; that he had one hand in his pocket and an oilskin on, and had no idea of fighting, but he was simply battered by the prosecutor, and being wild with pain and the provocation he received, he lost his head and got his revolver from the mantelshelf and met the prosecutor in the road.</hi>

I live in Glengall Road, Old Kent Road—I was in the Ossory Road at 7.30 or 7.45 on July 2nd—I saw the prosecutor pull up at the Ossory Arms—there were three men at the back of the van—they got out first, and then the prosecutor got out—as he got out they held him against the back wheel—I saw some money roll—they then ran away—the prisoner went towards the Lord Nelson and got on a <hi rend="italic">'bus.</hi>
