               <p>Q. How did you lose it? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the day did you take any notice of it? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe it in the fair? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed your watch after you left home? - A. Yes; I missed it about five o'clock in the afternoon, in the fair; Mr. Gearish, the witness, told me to mind my watch; I put my hand to my sob, and it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel it go from you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to suppose your watch was missing, before Mr. Gearish spoke to you? - A. No; there was a great crowed about.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you hustled or shoved about? - A. Yes; there was a great deal of bustling, crowding, and pushing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner before Mr. Gearish spoke? - A. I think I saw him about five minutes before, about one hundred yards from the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at the time Gearish spoke to you, see the prisoner? - A. No; I saw my watch about ten minutes afterwards in Mr. Gearish's hand; the prisoner was then in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. About five in the afternoon, at these fort of fairs, there is a very great crowd? - A. I cannot say, I never was there before.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether your watch was taken from you, or you lost it, you cannot say? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. There was, in point of fact, a great crowd? - A. There was.</p>
               <p>- GEARISH sworn. - On Monday, the 11th of May, I was walking with Laport in Hendon fair, about five o'clock in the afternoon; I saw the chain of his watch hanging out, I desired him to take care of his watch, there was a very great crowd pushing about; in about five minutes after he said to me, Gearish, I have lost my watch; I had observed the prisoner standing for five minutes next to Mr. Laport.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him next to Mr. Laport at the time you bid him take care of his watch? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you observe him stand next to Mr. Laport? - A. Till within two minutes of his missing his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner appear to be pushing? - A. I saw nothing particular at all; he was standing looking as well as we were; Mr. Laport and I then went among the mob, about one hundred yards, and I saw the prisoner with a stick in his hand, clearing the road for the girls to run for the smickets; I went up to him, and said, sir, you have got my friend's watch; he said, no, I have not, I am not the kind of person you take me to be; I said, I am positive you have the watch, you are the only person that was standing next to my friend when he missed his watch; I ordered a man of the name of Wicks, who ought to have been here, to collar him; he laid hold of one side, and I the other, and a man of the name of Bumby, a countryman, searched his pocket, and in his right hand coat pocket the watch was found; he forced himself to try to get away from us; I have had the watch ever since. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Laport. This is the watch that I lost; it is worth three guineas; it cost me about six guineas without the seal; I swapped it away for another in the Minories; I cannot say exactly what it cost me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Is Bumby here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Wicks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. A fruit salesman, in Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never been in any unfortunate predicament yourself - you never have had the misfortune to be charged with any thing? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Dawkins? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Wicks or Bumby? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. They were bound over, were they not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Laport.) Q. How do you know that is your watch? - A. I know it by the seal, and there is the name of Lawrence, and the letters C. P. upon the case.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to the fair to see the country diversions; I was walking in the fair, and was accosted by Gearish, who said, I had got his friend's watch; I told him I was not a man of that description; a great mob came round, three or four hundred, I dare say, and a person outside of the crowd held up the watch; I am innocent of the charge, I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010004"/>Mr. Gurney. (To Gearish.) Q. Have you ever said that the prisoner was not the man that stole the watch? - A. I never have, because I am very certain I saw the watch taken out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not shewn it publicly at Carpenter's coffee-house? - A. Not out of my own hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not take the watch out of the hand of a countryman outside the mob? - A. I did not; I saw Bumby take it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is a person who saw it taken from a countryman outside the mob.</p>

I am a painter and glazier; I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010007"/>known Ronaldson ten or eleven months: On Sun. day I met him in Stepney-fields, in consequence of which he afterwards called at my house for me; I went with him to the Wheatsheaf, near the Spice Islands; he said, where he lived, he had but 16s. a week, and there were little perquisites allowed him by his master; he said they were oil of turpentine; he asked me if I would sell it for him, as I being in the line knew better where to dispose of it than he did; I told him I did not like to have any thing to do with it; after that he called upon me again, and asked me if I had seen any person about it; I told him I was afraid to have any hand in it at all; he said I need not be afraid, for it was safe enough, it was perquisites that his master allowed him; I told him if it was so, I would look out for a person, that was about ten months ago; I was recommended by a person of the name of Beare to Mr. Carruthers; about six or seven weeks before Christmas I went to Mr. Carruther's house, in Pitfield-street, Old-street-road, he is a plumber, painter, and glazier; I saw Mr. Carruthers, and I told him I came from William Beare, and he said he knew him very well; I said I came about some turpentine that Beare had been speaking to him about last club night; he said he understood I did; I asked him if he would have some spirits of turpentine; he said he would; he asked me if it was good; I told him it was very good, as far as I knew; he then asked me if it was safe; I told him it was not mine, but it was very safe, as far as I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you understand by safe? - A. I don't know what he meant.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean when you told him it was safe? - A. I did not know but it was the man's perquisites; he asked me how much there was; I told him I could not rightly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean at this time to swear that you thought it was the man's perquisites, that he came honestly by it? - A. Yes; then Mr. Carruthers asked me when I would bring it, and how much it was a gallon; I told him it could not be dear at 4s. 6d. a gallon; he said that was too much, he would give me 4s. a gallon; I told him I would bring it in the course of a day or two; after I had done work, at six o'clock, I told Ronaldson what had passed; he said, we will take him some, and so be took one bottle, and I another, two days after; Ronaldson and I went together.</p>

               <p>Q. How much do you think those two bottles contained? - A. The bottles contained about four or five gallons, but I cannot rightly say how much there was in each, we both went, I told him we had brought the spirits of turpentine; he said, very well, and took it; we told him what the bottles held; he said, are you sure of it; I said, there was full measure; I believe one bottle had three gallons, and the other two and a half; he paid us at a public-house the corner of Pitfield-street; he put the money upon the table, and I took it up; I gave the money to Ronaldson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he enquire, either of you or Ronaldson, who he was? - A. NO.</p>
               <p>Q. Not how either of you came by it? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you afterwards taken before the Justice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go with any of the officers to Mr. Carruthers's house? - A. Yes; I rung him up, he opened the door; I said, how are you, and then Brown, the officer, went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you work for? - A. Mrs. Baker.</p>
               <p>Q. How much turpentine do you use in the course of a year? - A.About six gallons, but we had hardly and business after my master died; we kept to plumbing and glazing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where the prisoner, Ronaldson, lived? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his mother-in-law? - A. Yes, but not by name.</p>

               <p>Q. What was Beare? - A. A plumber, glazier, and painter, in Long-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Then it was through the representation of Beare that you went to Carruthers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Carruthers, and he said, is it safe, that was before any bargain was struck? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand by that, that he asked whether it was honestly come by or not? - A. I understood so, and I told him it was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when you took it? - A.Between eight and nine in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q.Before the shop was shut up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not measure them, but relied upon the engagement he had made before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the sort of oil, the quality of it? - A. It looked like any other.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know but it might be damaged? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, before the Magistrate, it was damaged? - A. I related that to Beare beforehand; I told Beare it was damaged spirits of turpentine, that was allowed to a young man by his master for perquisites.</p>
               <p>Q. He paid you in the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that any person might see it? - A. yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The oil was not at the public-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he empty the oil out of the bottles that you carried it in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he, in pouring it out, distinguish the quality? - A. He could see whether it was damaged or not.</p>

I belong to Shadwell Police-office: On the 9th of June, about six in the morning, I went to execute a search-warrant at the house of Carruthers, with Mr. Hillery, a clerk of Mr. Shuttleworth's, Sevier, Holebrook, and Elby; Sevier pointed out the house to us; I sent Savier forward to get admittance; when he got admittance, I followed him in: I saw Carruthers without his coat, he was then speaking to Sevier; I told him I was come for some oil of turpentine; he said, he had none; I told him he had bought some of Sevier; Sevier was in the shop with me; I desired him to shew me where he kept his oil of turpentine; he took down a key, and went backwards into the yard; he unlocked a little place like a colour-shop in the shed in the yard; I searched, and found a carboy full of oil of turpentine; a carboy is a glass bottle fastened in a wicker basket; I made further search, and under the bench in the shop there was another carboy, which I examined, and found to be nearly three parts full of oil of turpentine; I then said to Carruthers, how could you tell me you had none; I asked him then again how he came by it; he told me he had it from the young man, pointing to Sevier, and another young man, that they had come together.</p>
               <p>Q. What might this carboy hold? - A. I believe about seven or eight gallons, I am not certain; I then asked him how many times he had had of him; he told me from six to eight times; I asked him how much they brought at a time; he told me from six to seven gallons; he told me he did not always come with oil of turpentine, but sometimes for money, that they always came together; he said he had given after the rate of 4s. a gallon; I secured the property, and Mr. Carruthers was taken before the Magistrate; I was present when Mr. Hillery took samples of the oil; we have the car boys in Court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What is the defendant's shop? - A. He carries on plumbing, painting, and glazing.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he could hear the question that you put to him, whether he knew any thing of any oil of turpentine? - A. He was very close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether, in point of fact, he is deaf or not? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q.However, he afterwards told you he had it from Sevier? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he told you that four shillings was the price? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SEVIER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner, Ronaldson? - A. About ten or eleven months; he came to my house, and we went from there to a public-house; he said he had but 16s. a week, besides some oil of turpentine that was perquisites allowed him from his master, and he wished me to dispose of it for him; I told him I did not like to have any hand in it; he said he was doing right, and swore to it; I told him I did not like to have any thing to do with it; we drank up the beer, and went away; two nights afterwards he came again, and I agreed to look out for a person to buy it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner King? - A.Between three and four months ago, Ronaldson came to my house, and wanted me to go to Mr. King.</p>
               <p>Q. What is King? - A. There is written over the door, Thomas King, oil and colourman, about half a dozen doors from the Police-office, Shadwell; I went into the shop, and saw Mr. and Mrs. King; I had on a brown velvet jacket, leather breeches, and an apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any trowsers on? - A. Not then; I had when I took it; I asked King if he would like to take it; I told him it was not my own, but belonged to another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any enquiry who that other person was? - A. No, he did not, nor I did not tell him; he asked me if it was good, and if it was safe; I said, it was safe enough, he need not to be afraid; he asked me what it was a gallon; I told him it could not be dear at 4s. 6d.; he said, that was rather too much; I told him it was very good, would he like to see it first; he said, yes; I then went to Ronaldson, and told him what had passed, and he gave me some in a small phial, which I took to Mr. King; he smelled it, and said it had not the smell that his had; then he said he liked it very well, and would give me 4s. 6d. a gallon; either the next day, or the day following, I took some to Mr. King in two bottles, one at a time; the same day King was not in the way, and I called again the second time, and saw Mr. King; he weighed them out, and Mrs. King put down the weight; I don't remember what the weight was, but they took seven pounds and a half to the gallon; then he paid for them at the rate of 4s. 6d. a gallon; then he asked me if there was any more; I told him there would be in a few days; he desired me to bring it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how much he paid you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received the money, how were you dressed? - A. In trowsers.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of the skirt? - A. The value of the cloth is two pounds at least, the value of the coat is about two guineas and a half, they would stand me in that; the breeches stand me in about twenty shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it an old hat? - A. It was a new hat; I saw it before it was finished.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever suffer any servants of your's to repair hats in your manufactory? - A.Never, (produces the hat); here is a white mark in the front of the crown, and the same again behind; I had observed it on the 27th, and I put a mark of T. L. in the inside, which I have no doubt, if the hat is taken to pieces, will be seen; I put it between the brim and the crown.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where you saw this hat first, was upon the bench in the shop? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the prisoner brought the hat into the shop for the purpose of being repaired? - No.</p>
               <p>There is a sister of the prisoner's who works in the same shop? - A. In the same house, but not in the same shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not permit your men to sell hats upon their own account, and have let them have them at the wholesale price? - A. Yes, if they go below, and give their orders.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you undertake to swear that that very hat was not sold at your shop to the prisoner? - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. It he has a hat to alter, he carries it into the manufactory? - A. No; he must bring it into the shop, the same as body else.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they not alter hats for themselves in the manufactory? - A. Not to my knowledge, we never permit it; this hat has not yet had the least finish on the surface.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You told me you put T. L. upon the hat; do you put that mark upon every other hat? - A.No; it is a mark that I put upon this particular hat, in consequence of suspicion; I put it on a piece of paper, and, with the point of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010017"/>pen-knife, forced it up between the brim and the crown.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>LESTOCK PEACOCK, jun. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I live with my father, a carpenter and joiner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever purchase any thing of him? - A. Yes, a hat, somewhere about September or August.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you return it to him? - A. Yes, to be repaired; I had my hair cut, and it was rather too big for me, I could not tie it in, it was so stiff, I gave it him to make it smaller, and put a leather in behind.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you returned it him for this purpose? - A. It was on a Thursday in June, I think the beginning, it was about six weeks.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Then it could not have been it June? - A. I cannot exactly say when it was, it must be six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. This day six weeks then you think, do you? - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Have you ever had the hat again? - A. NO.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that hat? - A. This is the band; I am sure it is the same buckle and band.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.How do you know it is the same buckle and band? - A. To be sure there a great many alike, but it is exactly like it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifton. Q. Then all you mean to say, is, that you delivered a hat with such a band to the prisoner at the bar to repair? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>LESTOCK PEACOCK, sen. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, he has been in my service.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever buy any thing of him? - A. Yes; I bought a hat of him for my son, I think in September last.</p>
               <p>Court. (To peacock, jun.) Q.How often had you worn your hat? - A. Not more than a dozen times.(Mr. Larkin cut the lining of the hat, and produced the paper with the mark T. L.)</p>
               <p>Larkin. The hat had never been lined at all when I put the paper in.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury (To Larkin). Q. Did the prisoner leave his own hat in the manufactory? - A. He did, and it is here. <rs id="t18010701-18-verdict108" type="verdictDescription">

            ; last Saturday night I slept in the same room with the prisoner, in a separate bed; it was past twelve o'clock when we went to bed; we were to take a swim the next morning in the river, or pond, or wherever it is; at four o'clock I looked at my watch, I thought it too early to get up; I always kept it under my pillow, for fear my head should hurt the watch; the prisonr's bed-fellow went out at the time I looked at my watch; I had no bedfellow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him? - A. No; I then settled myself, but did not go to sleep; then the prisoner got up and dressed himself in his working cloaths, with his apron on; it was then about five o'clock; my face was to the wall, and my back to him; he pulled my breeches from under my head; I at first thought he might have been getting something of his own that he had left there the day before, but I turned round, and saw him putting my watch and money in his jacket pocket; he then threw the breeches in my face, slapped to the door, and ran down stairs; I laid without a shirt; I got up and run to the head of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he slept in the room with you? - A.About a month; I was ashamed to run naked after him in the street; I came back and put my cloaths on, and run after him; I pursued up and down, but could not find him, till by and by I met him with two brothers-in-law and his fellow-lodger coming out of the Mews, going out of Duke-street and Orchard-street; it was about two hours afterwards; I demanded my property of him, and he began to make game of me and hum-bug me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you all your property back? - A. Not a halfpenny-worth; I asked him for my watch, and he said if I waited till he gave me one I should go without; I asked him what he took it for, and a pressed him, but it was all in vain; I ran to the watch-house for a constable, and while I was gone for a constable he parted from his company and went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you were going for a constable? - A. I did; then the constable would not wait about looking for him, and I was left alone, having no friend with me, till at last I found him and

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Windsor; this is the watch that I took in from the prisoner at the bar, on the 23d of May, for thirty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not let the woman have it without paying the money? - A. The prisoner was not found.</p>
               <p>Q.What is it worth, do you think? - A.Forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. It would be very adviseable for your master to return that money, every farthing of it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SOWERRY sworn. - I am a pawnbroker; there were three handkerchiefs pledged at my shop, but I know nothing of it; I did not take in the things.</p>
               <p>Q.Where is the servant that took them in? - A. I received a subpoena only last night at seven o'clock; it was directed to me, and I thought my attendance would be sufficient.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you so extremely dull as not to know that the person who took in the article was the person to come here; you must send for him; did you never receive a subpoena before? - A.Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Roussell. I was obliged to pay this gentleman four shillings for the handkerchiefs before he would let me have them.</p>
               <p>Court. You must return the four shillings immediately.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WILLETT sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, No. 95, Rosemary-lane: The prisoner pledged two shirts with me on the 23d of May last; I lent her twelve shillings upon the two, I should suppose them to be worth fifteen shillings a shirt; I am sure she is the woman.</p>
               <p>Roussell. These are the shirts that I lost; they have the gentleman's name that they belonged to; here are two that are the fellows to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went out of this woman's house, and as I came to the top of the court, I picked this bundle up; I was very much distrest<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010021"/>for want of money, and I parted with these things at the pawnbroker's; she came to me while I was in Newgate, and said, she would not hurt me by any means whatever, if I would pay for them; but this woman is jealous of me, and her husband, because her husband, as soon as he saw me, said he would not hurt me.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. By the direction of my mistress, I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday evening the 20th of May, going away, about two hundred yards from the warehouse; I told him my master wanted him in the accompting-house; he came back to the accompting-house where Mr. Compton was; I searched his coat, and nothing was found there; I found concealed in his breeches five pewter plates; accordingly, the runner came in a few minutes afterwards, and took him into custody; he desired to be let go, and he would go away, and not come back any more; he said, it was the first offence in this country, or any other; my master said he should prosecute him; the plates were delivered to Vickery, the officer.</p>

               <p>- WICKSTEED sworn. - On Saturday, the 20th of June, about half past eight o'clock in the morning, or rather better, I was going to my breakfast, in Little St. Thomas Apostle, I saw a young lad following the prisoner; he desired me to stop him, that he had stole some pieces of ribbon from his warehouse; I asked the prisoner if he had any thing belonging to the lad; he told me, no, he had not; upon the lad persisting that he had, I took hold of his arm and requested to search his pockets; he told me I was welcome to feel in his pockets, and turned up his coat; he told me there was nothing in his pockets but two loaves of bread and an orange; the young lad then turned him about, and said, there is a piece in his breeches; I said, how could you say you had none, when there is a piece in your breeches; I took it from him; the young lad said, before I took it out, it was a piece of mazarine blue, which it was; I detained him, and sent the lad for an officer; I saw him very busy with his hands, I looked, and observed him very busy with a piece of white ribbon in his hat; and, in the false crown, there were four pieces more; we took him to the Compter, and there, with a deal of difficulty, we searched him; I found one piece of blue, and the Compter-keeper pulled out two pieces; he was taken before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.You had never seen this man before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a more extraordinary looking creature in your life? - A. I cannot say I ever did.</p>

            , wine-merchant, in Miles's lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the 26th of June did you know any thing of the prosecutor? - A.Nothing; I don't know that I ever saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Or of the prisoner? - A. Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any alarm of stop thief, was your attention directed to any thing, and what? - A. On the 26th of June, while I was standing at the door with Allden -</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A.It was after five, I think it was not six, I heard the cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner followed by two or three persons, not more.</p>
               <p>Q.Amongst those two or three did you observe Bean? - A. I did observe a man who is to be a witness here, I don't know his name; the prisoner was a little way before them, running up the lane; me and the other witness, Allden, immediately followed after the other two or three; and before I got up to the prisoner, within about six or seven yards, I saw the prisoner take from his pocket a pocket-book, and throw it down in or near a baker's shop, not more than fifteen yards from where I had originally stood.</p>
               <p>Q.During the time of your pursuit did you or any body else cry out stop thief? - A.Almost immediately that I pursued from the door the thief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010026"/>was caught, and therefore it was unnecessary; stop thief had been cried before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make such observation of the pocket-book, as to be able to tell the colour of it? - A. It was a red pocket-book, with a strap.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt it was the prisoner at the bar who threw down that pocket-book? - A. I have no doubt of his person, though he is not dressed the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you lose sight of him at all before he was taken? - A. Not more than a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of the man after he had thrown away the pocket-pocket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And are you sure that that man is the prisoner? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe who picked up the pocketbook? - A. No; there became a crowd immediately, and I could not discern who picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the pocket-book since? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. At half past five you heard a cry of stop thief? - A. I think so, as near as I can tell, between five and six.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell whether you had had your dinner? I suppose you had been taking your wine after dinner? - A.That is as it happens.</p>
               <p>Q. If the prosecutor has spoke to a transaction between two and three o'clock, it cannot be the same transaction? - A. I cannot say, I think it was about that time.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, will you swear that you saw the prisoner that day? - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q.When were you first brought into this business as a witness? - A. It was after his commitment.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not offer to be a witness before the Lord. Mayor? - A. I was not asked.</p>
               <p>Q. Who asked you to attend here to-day? - A. I received a subpoena.</p>
               <p>Q. With whom had you any conversation, before you had your subpoena? - A. The constable; his name is Lewis.</p>
               <p>Q.How came he to find you out? - A. He lived in the lane; he gave me the subpoena before any any conversation took place; he knew that I had seen the transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a man they called a waterman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see him pick up a pocketbook? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said, you never lost sight of the prisoner from the time you first saw him, till he was taken, and yet you cannot tell who picked up the pocket-book? - A. I cannot tell, but from hearsay.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you never lost sight of him? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps it was only hearsay, that he threw it away? - A. No; that is a fact I have sworn to.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, if you will venture to swear that the waterman did nor throw away that book? - A. I do swear that the waterman did not throw it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you could distinguish the hand that threw it away? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you tell the prosecutor that you had seen it? - A. It was an unpleasant business, and there were other persons saw it as well as myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You dine between two and three, and then drink your wine after? - A.Occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, were you drunk or sober, because we have had that insinuated? - A. I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I only meant it to shew the difference as to time, between the prosecutor's account and his.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutor, Captain Thompson? - A. Yes, I saw him on Friday last, in Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mrs. Kallard? - A.Not by name.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that lady? - A. I saw her along with the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember taking any pockot-book out of her hand? - A. I stooped down and picked up a pocket book; a woman and I stooped at the same time; but I do not know whether this is the woman or not; I took up the pocket-book and gave it to Captain Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour? - A. To the best of my knowledge, I believe it was red.</p>
               <p>Q.However, the same pocket-book you picked up, you gave to Captain Thompson? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I know him since I have been in the habit of appearing against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on that Friday? - A. Yes, in Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in Miles's-lane? - A. Yes, he ran, and I ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the cry of stop thief? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run at the cry of stop thief? - A. Yes, he was running at the time when I ran after him to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you by at the time he was taken? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And assisted in taking him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are sure the pocket-book you picked up at the time the woman was stooping down, was the same you gave to Captain Thompson? - A. To be sure; I did not change it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. I will not ask you whether you stole it; because that is not a fair question; but if any body has said you took it out of a woman's hand, that is not true? - A. No, we both stooped together; I made a snatch at it from her hand; the woman might have hold of one end of it, for any thing I know; it is very probable she might.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010028"/>Q.Had not you the pocket-book in your hand, before the woman ever saw it at all; I am not now asking whether you stole it? - A.Upon my oath I cannot say; I believe the woman might have hold of it before me.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again; had not you it in your hand, before the woman ever saw it? - A. I really positively cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the gentleman that the Lord Mayor threatened to commit? - A. I never was so flusterated in my life; he thought I was concerned, or said something similar to it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable, (produces the pocket-book) I took the prisoner into custody, last Friday, in Miles's-lane, Crooked-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave him you in charge? - A.The Captain, Moore and Allden helped to secure him; I took him to the Compter, and going along, he said he picked up the book; that he was a fool for doing it; that it had brought him into this trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the charge upon which you took him? - A.For stealing the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Thompson. This is my pocket-book, the inside is green; it contained the ship's register; but the Lord Mayor desired me to take the register out, which I did; there is a 5l. note, and a 1l. Bank note in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am not guilty of the crime, with which I am charged; upon hearing a cry of stop thief; I ran as another person might, and they seized me, and said I was the prisoner; I know nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010701-28-verdict164" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>- HOUGHTON sworn. - I am a carpenter, in William-street, Curtain-road; about a quarter of a mile from the public-house I heared the cry of stop thief, and being an officer, I took charge of the prisoner; I asked him what was the matter; he said he had only picked up a snuff-box and an old night-cap; the old woman came up, and told me, in the hearing of the prisoner, that she had lost these things from the Hare, at Hoxton; she said he had also taken from her some duplicates, and one shilling and sixpence; he acknowledged he had taken the box and the night-cap, which, he said, he had given her back, but the one shilling and sixpence and duplicates he said he never had seen; they have never been found.</p>
               <p>(To Osborn.) Q. How came you to leave the things upon the bench? - A. I put my hand in my pocket for some halfpence to pay for my beer, and put these things upon the bench at the same time, and went away and forgot them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in the public-house, and saw the rag and the snuff-box, and the old woman said she had lost them, and I gave them her; there was no money in it. <rs id="t18010701-29-verdict169" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q.How long had they been sitting down by you before he threw down the five shillings? - A.About five or ten minutes; he threw down the five shillings, and challenged to fight him; upon which, the prisoner repeatedly asked him if he was in earnest; he said, he was; upon that, the prisoner put five shillings upon the table, after great hesitation, and they both went out together; I did not follow them out immediately; I went out just at the finishing of the fight; I got round, and picked up the deceased; he was lying upon the ground when I got into the yard; he was quite motionless; I carried him, and put him upon the bench that is in the yard; Mr. Wood, the landlord of the house, came and took him from me, and I went home, and saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q.Had there been any quarreling between them in the box? - A. I heard no more than the prisoner hesitating, and asking him if he was in earnest; the deceased kept urging him to fight him.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very extraordinary that these two good friends should think of fighting, without any angry words? - A. I heard none that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your conversation during the ten times that you speak of? - A. All the discourse was about fighting.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said before the five shillings were thrown down? - A.Nothing particular, that I know of; I did not interfere.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a very extraordinary story; you were sitting in the same box with them, you might hear what passed without interfering; who else was there? - A. A relation of mine,

             sworn. - I went into the Crown between the hours of nine and ten; I happened to sit down at the same table where the deceased and the prisoner were sitting; I was an entire stranger in the house; the prisoner and the deceased were laying a wager how many beans made five; they produced five beans, two white beans, two black, and one red one, and that won the wager.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by how many beans made five? - A. I do not know; I have very often heard it expressed, but don't know what it means; after the wager was settled, the prisoner was smoking his pipe, and the deceased began to aggravate him to fight him; he kept continually aggravating him to fight; he wanted to fight with him for any money, he would fight him for a guinea, or five shillings; the prisoner laughed it off, and would not take any offence from him; then the deceased got up, and stood in the middle of the tap-room, and swore he would lick the prisoner, whether or no; then the prisoner said, laughing, if he gave him a good hiding, he thought it might be of service to him; then, after that, the deceased turned to beat him, and the prisoner asked him if he was in earnest; he told the prisoner he was, and that he would give him a d-d good hiding; then the deceased deposited five shillings in a man's hand; the prisoner was very loth to put down five shillings; he put his five shillings down, six or seven minutes afterwards, quite in a flurry; the deceased asked the prisoner it he was ready; the prisoner said, he did not want to fight with him, and asked him again, was he in earnest; then the deceased pulled off his coat, and hung it upon the bannisters of the box where we were sitting; I did not go out to see them fight; the prisoner went out so good humoured, I did not think he would fight with him; in about ten minutes, the prisoner returned with his shirt torn to pieces, and his face besineared with dirt; I said, what have you been fighting; he said, yes, I have, and have conquered him; after that he sat down, and called for some porter to drink, and began to smoke a pipe, when the news came into the tap-room that the man was dead; when the information came in that the man was dead, the prisoner's countenance changed immediately; he seemed very much concerned indeed, and surrendered himself up to go any where with any body that pleased to take him, and he waited in the house till an officer came.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the deceased sober, or how do you account for this strange behaviour of the deceased? - A. I don't know whether he was drunk or sober; I never saw either of them before, to my knowledge; he seemed to know what he was doing.</p>

             sworn. - I was going to the Crown about ten o'clock at night, and saw the prisoner and the deceased coming into the yard to fight; Connop twice asked the deceased whether he was in earnest; he said he was, and then went a step or two further, and had a round, but there was no blow struck there to hurt; I then went up to Connop, and said, surely you are not a earnest to fight; he said, yes, he was; I then went to the deceased, and said to him, Lewis, do not you fight; he said, ah, Mr. Balmer, if I had fair play, I should beat him, by g-d; he was struck upon the left side, he then fell, he afterwards got up, and had another round; he was struck then upon his left side again; he fell, and was picked up by Webb; when I looked at him, I saw he was incapable of standing; I went up to the prisoner, and said, Connop, do not fight any more, the man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010030"/>came to me, as if he could not stand; well, says he, I do not care, but I will have the five shillings for the tearing of my shirt; after that, I stopped in the ground a little while to see how the deceased was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not the deceased strike me twice before I struck at him? - A. I saw the deceased strike at him once; I cannot say whether he struck at him more than once, or not.</p>

             sworn. - I am a surgeon: I examined the body of the deceased on Saturday night, the 8th of June; at first, I observed no appearance whatever of external violence; I opened him, but could find nothing internal that could lead to the cause of the man's death; I could find nothing internal nor external that I could account for his death; I have no doubt he died in consequence of the injury he had received; it is impossible to say whether it was from the blows or the fall.</p>
               <p>Q. If the man died in consequence of injuries received in a battle of this sort, how could that be without some appearance of injury? - A. There was none, either external or internal.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you suppose that his death might be occasioned without any appearance of violence; was there no rupture of the vessels? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open the head, so as to examine the brain? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been any rupture upon the brain, you could not see that through the skull, I suppose? - A.Certainly not, but there is generally an hemorrhage.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you account for the man's death, then? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you say, we should be disposed to think the man would have died, if he had not been fighting; can you say that his death was occasioned by that which happened in the fight? - A. I could find nothing; there was no fracture nor rupture.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had heard nothing about the fight, but had been sent for to examine that man, what would have been your opinion; that he died a natural death? - A.Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, It seems to me to be unnecessary to sum up the evidence, because it is not proved that this man died of the injury received in the fight; in order to six upon him either murder or manslaughter, you must be satisfied the cause of the death was some injury received in the course of the battle; now, the surgeon says, there was no external or internal appearance of violence, and if he had not heard of the fight, he should have supposed he had died a natural death; he does not give you any reason to suppose he died in consequence of any injury he received in the battle; as there is no proof of that kind, I think he must be acquitted. <rs id="t18010701-30-verdict172" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. Q. Are you a customer of Mr. Wright's? - A. Yes: On the 25th of May, my wife, in my presence, paid the prisoner sixteen shillings and ten-pence; here is a receipt for it, which I saw him write. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, as follows:</p>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, It is customary, in the baking business, for the master to make out the weekly bills; on Monday, the 25th of May, I carried out bills, and received money to the amount of near four pounds, but having the misfortune to lose two seven-shilling pieces through a hole in my pocket, and ashamed to tell my master I had lost them, I meant to conceal it from my master till I received my wages; on Tuesday, through the vexation of losing the two seven-shilling pieces, I went out, and got intoxicated; the next morning, going out to have a pint of beer, being at work without my clothes, meaning to come back immediately, but seeing two persons in the house who knew me, and being a country person, and easily persuaded, I got drinking with them till between eleven and twelve; I left the house very much intoxicated, and went to a neighbour's house, and laid down to sleep, but my master got intelligence where I was, and came to me, and through teasing me to wake, I rose and struck my master, which I am very sorry for, having lost my senses; I told my master I had received the money, but had lost it through a hole in my poc ket; at that time, my master held eleven shillings in his hand, wages due to me; and my friend would have paid him the rest, but my master is determined to prosecute me, because I struck him; I hope it will appear that I did not mean to wrong my master, or I should have kept the whole I received that day.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Wright). Were there any wages due to him? - A. There were seven or ten shillings, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer to let you take that as part of the money? - A. Not till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you at any time that he had lost the money through a hole in his pocket? - A. He never mentioned that till he came up for re-examination at the office, and the Magistrate asked him if he had learned that since he had been in Bridewell. <rs id="t18010701-32-verdict182" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I am al bouring man, at Hampton-court: On Monday, the 11th of May, in consequence of information, I went in pursuit of two women, and a man in a cart; I first went the London road, and after some information, I took the lewerl road; I was on horseback; in about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, I overtook the horse and cart, with two women and a man in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a horse was it? - A. A little bay poney; I rode on the off side of them, and asked how far they were going; the man told me to Ewell.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you address them, as one traveller may ask another? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Not so as to excite any alarm? - A. No; I then said, you are the people that have just changed a note at Hampton-court, and you must return back along with me; then one of them, I cannot tell which, said, I do not know that we have been at Hampton-court; I told them they had bought a loaf of sugar, and so much tea; then one of them, but I cannot say which, said, if we did change a note, they should have looked to it at the time; we had nothing to do with it; I laid hold of the horse, and turned him round.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect if any thing occurs to you, that the man said particularly? - A. I don't recollect any thing particular; I turned the horse round, and brought them back, as nigh as I can guess, one hundred yards, all three of them in the cart; then the man said, I will not go any further, you have nothing to do with me; then I said, I will go to Ewell, and fetch a chaise, and bring you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010035"/>backs, upon that, the man returned his horse; the women got out, and he went on towards Ewell, and offered to give me change for the note; that was before the horse was turned round.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect which of them spoke, and what was said? - A. I cannot say which of them it was; but one of them said, we will give you change for the note, what more do you require of us; I told them I had nothing to do with their note or their money, they should go back with me; and then I turned the horse; the first time after the man was gone, the women came back with me almost to the Red-lion, walking alongside.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that Red-lion from Hampton-court? - A. About four miles.</p>
               <p>Q.What time was it? - A.About ten o'clock, or it might be a little after, it was very dark; they went with me as far as the orchard hedge; one of the women, Mrs. Thomas, put her gown tail over her head, and jumped over the ditch, on to the common; I could not get the horse over; I got off and followed, but she was out of my sight in an instant, being so dark; and while I was pursuing her; I lost the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since seen the person who is called Miriam? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she the person who was with the two prisoners? - A. Yes; she was the other person; she was then in black.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was the man that you saw in the cart? - A.That is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the two persons at the bar, and Miriam, were the three persons, who were in the cart; - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.What notes did he give you? - A. They were Bank of England notes, I believe; they were lapped up, and I did not open them: I received from Cartwright a small parcel of notes, but did not open them.</p>
               <p>Q.Could you see that they were papers which purported to be notes? - A. Yes; Thomas looked at them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those blank, or filled up? - A. Those were filled up.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had delivered them to him, what became of the prisoner? - A. He went away, and I saw no more of him at that time: he said he should be in town again soon, and should call upon me.</p>
               <p>Q.When he said in town, you understood him Birmingham? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon after this did the prisoner make you another visit? - A. It might be three weeks, or it might be more, I cannot say justly to the time; he came to our house again on the Sunday night, and asked me if I could get him any more notes; he said, he wished to have them got without being filled up, for the writing part to be filled up afterwards; he gave me a guinea, and I went on the Sunday night to one Beat, and got some.</p>
               <p>Q.How many did you get? - A. I cannot justly tell the number; a woman, who is the wife of Beat, told me to take them, and see if they were approved of; I brought them down to my house, where he was sitting waiting for my return; I did not shew them to him at that time, because there was a stranger in my house; he asked me if we would go, and see him set off, where his wife was, at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that in the presence of the stranger? - A.The stranger did not hear it. I went, and they were going to tea, I drank tea with them.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see his wife? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that the person at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you do with the notes? - A.I gave them to him in my own house, but not before the stranger; he went away by the stage, and asked me to procure him some more, for he should soon be down again; I understood from him that he lived at Hounslow-heath at that time.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon afterwards did you see him again? - A. I do not think I saw him again till this last time.</p>
               <p>Q.When was that? - A.On the 2d of May; he wrote a note at Birmingham for me to go to him at Edgbaston, I went to him with the person that he sent; he asked me if I would have any thing to drink, and the person with me; the note directed me to pay the bearer a shilling, which I did not do, but when I went to him be paid the man a shilling; he told me he was come down again, and wanted some more notes; I told him they were ready for him.</p>
               <p>Q.Were those blank, or filled up? - A.Blank he asked me to stay and dine with him, but I declined, and told him I should go and dine at my mother's, for my sister and myself had made up our minds to come to London.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was your sister? - A.Hannah Hall; then he said he would go with me, and he and I went to my mother's; my youngest sister was gone to get some dinner, and I went to Mrs. Beat's and got the notes.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you get at Beat's? - A.Forty notes of one pound, and fourteen notes of five pounds each, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the price of those at Birmingham at that time? - A. I did not pay for them; for he had but a guinea; he disired I would see what I could l do for him, for he had no more.</p>
               <p>Q. You were to obtain them upon credit? - A. Yes; and if he sold his horse, or his cart, he would pay for them; he then sent for some paper, and wrote a letter; I gave him the notes in the bundle as I had received them from Mrs. Beat; after he had had them a short time, he took out, as he said afterwards. two of them, out of the bundle, to inclose in the letter.</p>

               <p>Q.Had Mrs. Thomas any others money abnout her that you knew of, besides these three notes? - A. Not that I saw; we went to a toy-shop, and Mrs. Thomas purchased a pound of hair-powder, and a child's drum; she paid a one pound note for them.</p>
               <p>Q.The one pound note that had been given to her by her husband, do you mean? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he send his wife to that shop? - A. Yes; he said, there is a shop where you may go and buy some articles; then she and I went to a grocer's-shop, lower down, where she bought some tea and sugar.</p>
               <p>Q.Of whom did she cheapen the articles of grocery? - A.I believe the man and woman were both present.</p>
               <p>Q.A boy or a man? - A. A man and a woman; she bought three ounces of tea, and a pound of sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not Mrs. Laffecock's? - A. No; she there offered a one pound note.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it taken? - A. No; she asked me if I had any change, and I sent her half a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you got from that first gorcer's? - A.To where the cart was, Mr. Thomas was waiting for us to come to him.</p>

               <p>Q.And then you two got into the cart? - A. Yes; then we went to Mr. Pepperday's, a linendraper.</p>
               <p>Q.How far is that from Hampton-court? - A.Some little distance, I cannot say what; he drove very fast, I think he drove beyond Mr. Pepperdays's.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he stop at any public house? - A.No, I think not, nor near a public-house; Mrs. Thomas and I got out and went to Mr. Pepperday's shop, Mrs. Thomas purchase some dark cottons and a small quantity of cambric mussins; she paid a 5l. note.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that one of those that had been given her by her husband, and that you had proceured from Beat? - A. I should suspect it was.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010038"/>Q. Do you really believe it to be one of the same? - A.I do.</p>

               <p>Q.What became of you after that? - A. We returned to him, we found him near his cart.</p>
               <p>Q.At the place where you left him? - A. Yes; then we went, I believe, back again to Hampton-court, but I am not acquainted sufficiently with the place to say; we drove past Mrs. Lasscock's door; and Mr. Thomas said, there was a shop, or something of that sort, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q.How far did you go past? - A. Not far; for while I was in Mr. Laffcock's shop waiting for the boy coming back with the change, I saw him standing at the head of his horse.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you think it was more than the length of this Court? - A. Yes, it might be rather more than twice the length of this Court.</p>
               <p>Q.Who did Mrs. Thomas bargain with at Laffcock's? - A. A little boy I think was in the shop at first, and then Mrs. Laffcock came in.</p>
               <p>Q. What articles did she purchase there? - A.Some tea and some loaf sugar, which she paid for with the 5l. note.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you believe that to be the same that he had given to his wife? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And that you had brought from Birmingham? - A. Yes; the boy went out to the public-house where the cart was-standing for change, the change was delivered to Mrs. Thomas, and then she and I went away, I believe I carried the tea, I am positive I carried one of the two; when he saw us coming, he went on with the cart for us to follow a little way; he went on one side of the road and we on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might you go before he took you up into the chaise? - A.Not far.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of the articles that you bought? - A.He put them into the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you proceeded on your way home? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.You mean a man of the name of Groves? - A. Yes; he came up on horseback, and asked, how far are you going this road; Mrs. Thomas made answer, and said, they were going to Ewell; he said they must stop and go back; Mr. Thomas asked what for; he said they must go back in consequence of a 5l. bank-note, which had been paid to a grocer, at Hampton-court; Mr. Thomas said, I will not go back; he said he could have no charge of him, he had done nothing; there were some words passed about the note; he said, addressing himself to his wife, my dear, you know where we took it, and he offered the man the money; he said you can go and settle it yourself, take the money and you can go and take up the note yourself; the man said he could not do any such thing, those who had paid it must go back with him; then the man endeavoured to stop the horse; Mr. Thomas turned the cart round and would not let him; he said, if she had paid it, she must go back and settle it herself; she said we might as well go together, and I said I had no objection; he said he would go to Ewell and get a chaise; we got out; Thomas turned his horse, and appeared to me to drive on as hard as he could.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you remember any observation being made about what the people of the shop should have done is it had been offered? - A. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Mrs. Thomas then continued to walk with Groves? - A. Yes; we had not gone far before she flarterd, and left him and me together.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of her? - A.I do not know; it was so sudden, and so dark, I could not see; he wanted his horse to go after her, and the horse refused; and then he got off his horse, and left me.</p>
               <p>Q.And you had not the complaisance to wait for his return? - A. No, I walked straight on home, as they told me.</p>

               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a Police-officer belonging to Worship-street: On the 27th of May I was at Mr. Powell's chambers, and saw a half-guinea, a seven shilling-piece, two half-crowns, and a sixpence delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the money marked? - A. I do not think I did: On the 28th I went to the Three Mariners with Clarke, the Marshalman, Ray, and Mason; we waited at the Golden Lion, and Mrs. Sullivan was to bring us a signal; before Dumphy went I searched him, and found upon him the money I have mentioned, but I cannot say whether it was marked or not; upon the signal being given I went into the public-house; I saw Dumphy and Wife at the bar; I caught hold of Wife by the collar on one side, and Clarke on the other; we then got Wife into a passage that leads to a parlour, his back was then against a partition, and I observed a motion of his hand, upon which I immediately said there is something gone; I then gave him into the hands of Clark and Ray, and went towards the cellar stairs; we were close by a door that went into the cellar, and I called for a candle, and at the bottom of the cellar stairs, I found this paper, containing four half-guineas, eight seven-shilling pieces, and two shillings, all counterfeit, (produces them;) I brought that up, and then we took him into another parlour, and in that room, Dumphy produced two half-guineas, and two seven-shilling pieces, which he said he had bought of Wife, and which Wise denied, Wife said, he had sold him nothing; I went again to the stairs, and on the third stair I found a good seven-shilling piece, which I believe to be one of the same that I saw in Dumphy's possession, before he went there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not search Macneal? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear Macneal say, he was indebted to the prisoner three shillings? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Did you ever tell them; that they were to receive five shillings a day? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley Q.There was no bad money found upon the prisoner? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the offices of Worship-street; I was with Armstrong, on the 28th of May; I saw Dumphy at the Golden-lion; before we went to the Three-Mariners, I searched him, and he had no money about him but what Armstrong then gave him, a seven-shilling-piece, a half-crown, and a sixpence; I am not positive exactly what it was; his shoes were pulled off, and every part of him searched; we went to the Three-Mariners; Mr. Armstrong and Clarke laid hold of Wife, and a scuffle ensued; I observed a motion of the prisoner's arm when he was close to the cellar-stairs; Armstrong immediately said, there is something gone, and called for a light: I took the prisoner into the kitchen, we proceeded to search him, and Mr. Clarke took some money from him, which he will speak to; we then took him into a back parlour; Armstrong asked Dumphy what he had been about, and he said, in the presence of the prisoner, that he had been buying bad money of him; to the best of my knowledge, the prisoner said, he had bought none of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the seven-shilling piece that Armstrong found, produced? - A. I took no particular notice of it.</p>

               <p>Q.Did he submit quietly to be apprehended? - A. No, he behaved rather obstreporous to Armstrong and myself; I had hold of his other arm, when he threw something down the cellar stairs; Armstrong immediately said, there goes something; the prisoner did not say any thing to that; I took him into another room, with Ray; we searched him in the back parlour, and I found upon him a half-crown and a sixpence marked; they were marked in the same way with those that I saw given to Dumphy, at the Golden Lion, we secured him, and took him into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been in that office? - A.Eleven or twelve years: On the 27th of May I sent for Ray and Armstrong; they met Dumphy; the money was marked by me, given to Armstrong, and delivered by him to Dumphy.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at this halt crown and sixpence, produced by Clarke? - A.This is one of the marked half-crowns that I gave to Armstrong the day before, and this is the sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that seven-shilling-piece, the one found on the stairs? - A.This is the same that I delivered to Armstrong, and which he delivered to Dumphy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Macneal receive a 2l. note from you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. For what? - A. I gave it him on account or some general informations that were then going on.</p>
               <p>Q.Were those informations relative to the coin of the country? - A. They were; and among when the present was one.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard of two persons, O'Brian and Mahony, being indicted for a conspiracy, and Dumphy being a witness against them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By whole direction and advice was that indictment for a conspiracy preserred? - A. By the direction of myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What sanction had you for preferring that indictment? - A. It was not under any body's particular sanction; I thought it necessary, and I conferred with those whom I thought proper; if it had been a felony, I should have consulted the Attorney-General.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it done at the desire of Dumphy? - A. No; we do not consult witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time that indictment was prepared, was it then known that either of them was to be a witness for Wife? - A.Certainly; I did not know till last night that Mahony was to be a witness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean, upon your oath, to swear you did not know till last night that O'Brian and Mahony were to be witness for this man? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you had not an intuitive knowledge, but had you not been told so? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there been any certiorari lodged in this case? - A. There has.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon an indictment for a conspiracy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When was that done? - A. To-day.</p>
               <p>Q. That was to remove it into the King's Bench, after you knew that these people were to be witnesses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You know, that in that case these men cannot be bailed before a common Magistrate? - A.Certainly they cannot.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore the effect of lodging the certiorari to-day, has prevented their getting bailed to come here as witnesses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. As we are now upon law, I would ask, does it prevent a babeas corpus being obtained? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I wish to ask, whether you, acting as Solicitor for the Mint, employ men, and pay them to hunt out informations in this sort of way against your fellow-subjects?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys objected to the question.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Powell's answer certainly calls upon him to explain it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Are you, acting for the Solicitor of the Mint, in the habit of employing that man, Macneal, and paying him, for the purpose of hunting out felonies against your fellow-subjects? - A.Whenever he has had any informations, which he has been put to any expence in obtaining, I have given him money to reimburse those expences; at I never gave any thing to any purpose, with a view of inducing them to do that which is wrong.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, this Brown, to whom I allude, having offended the very people who have conspired against me, was indicted last October, by one Mary Cook, for a street robbery, and not having been taken before a Justice, he had no idea such a charge was exhibited against him until the latter end of April last, when I informed him; and as I had learnt, that the man who had prevailed on this Mary Cook to prefer the indictment against Brown, intended to obtain a certificate of the indictment, and take him into custody upon a Judge's warrant the day after the present session, and thereby keep him confined during the long vacation, I advised him (to prevent such a proceeding) to surrender and take his trial, which he did, and the Court and Jury saw so clearly through the persidy of the prosecution, and that the whole was a fabrication, that they would not permit the prosecutrix to go through her evidence, and recommended that she and her accomplices should be indicted for a conspiracy.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I shall now briefly relate the means adopted by Gibbons to give a colour to this prosecution, which were as follows: He prevailed upon one Macneal to assist him in his project, who came to me, and requested me to lend him three shillings for a sew days; this I was easily prevailed upon to do, as I had known him for some time, and been frequently in his company, and having no suspicion of any design upon me; when they had proceeded thus far, Macneal being a soldier, obtained the witness, Dumphy, who is also a soldier, to join them, and they immediately went to the solicitor for the Mint, and informed him they knew where they could purchase had money. In consequence of which, a half-guinea, a seven-shilling piece, a half-crown, and a sixpence were marked, and given by Mr. Powell and the officers to Dumphy to make the purchase with, and in the forenoon of the 28th of May last, Macneal and Dumphy came to the Three Mariners in Fore-Street; I was in the kitchen, Macneal opened the kitchen door and called me into the tap-room, and said, he was come to pay me the three shillings he had borrowed, and gave me a half-crown and a sixpence, which I put into my waistcoat-pocket, and was about to return into the kitchen, when Macneal asked me if I would not drink with him, I answered no, for I had not dined; and the first time I ever saw Dumphy, was at this moment, who rose from one of the tap-room boxes, and called for a quartern of rum, saying, don't Jet the gentleman go till he drinks with us; at this instant, the officers came in, Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Clark, seized my arms, and Ray my collar, and in that position I was forced into the kitchen, where I was handcuffed and searched, and amongst my silver was found the half-crown and sixpence Macneal had paid me, and which turned out to be a part of the marked money which had been given to Dumphy to purchase bad money with; Mr. Armstrong then asked Dumphy what brought him there? he answered, to buybise money for me; I then, for the first time, had an insight into the plot laid against me; Mr. Arm<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010049"/>strong, on going into the cellar, found a paper containing a quantity of bad money; and some time after; on a second search, found a seven-shilling piece which was marked, and had also been given to Dumphy, but neither of these were ever in my possession, they must have been placed (where they were found) by Macneal, for how could it be prossible for me, seized as I was, without the least previous intimation, to have put my hands in my pocket, and to have thrown to the bottom of a winding staircase the counterfeit-money found there by the officers, and which being wrapped in a white paper, would have been very easily perceived if it had come from me, but the officers candidly stated on my examination, that they saw nothing go from my hands, though they saw my arm go as if something did; but, - Gentlemen, does it appear at all reasonable, that being firmly held by four persons, I could get my hands near my pockets, or throw any thing away from me, particularly without their seeing it. I was taken to the Compter, and closely confined till the next day, when, on my examination, Dumphy swore that he purchased from me two counterfeit half-guineas, and two counter. seit seven shilling-pieces for ten shillings, and that he paid me for them by giving me the half-crown and the sixpence (which I had received as beforementioned from Macneal), and the seven shilling-piece which was found on the cellar stairs.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I understand Dumphy was searched by the officers, previous to his coming into the Three Mariners public-house, to see that he had no base money about him, or any thing but the marked money; but was the same precaution used with respect to Munceal, who accompanied him? I am certain it was not, for if it had, I should not have been here before you taking my trial, for on him would have been found the base money pretended to have been purchased by Dumphy from me, and also that found in the cellar by the officers,</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Gibbons furnished Macneal with this base coin, according to the plan they had agreed upon, and that Gibbons was in a way to obtain it no doubt can be entertained, as his house has for some time past been the haunt of the utterers of base money, insomuch that it has become a common nuisance, and is now indicted as such, and there is scarcely a lodger in his house who has not been convicted of selling or utterring bad money.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, if my case rested here I should feel myself confident of having your verdict of acquittal; but I have still stronger facts, the declarations of Dumphy, who, either from remorse, or from not being satisfied by those who employed him, has been frequently with me, acknowledged his villainy, and wished me to furnish him with money that he might leave me countly, and not be under the necessity either of publicly confessing the infamy of his conduct, or of abiding by his former false story to avoid punishment.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Dumphy has confessed that Gibbons is the contriver of the plan against me, that Macneal acknowledged to him that Gibbons gave him the bad money found in the cellar, and also that stated to have been purchased from me; and that he, Dumphy, directly he came into the Three Mariners with Macneal, gave him the seven shilling-piece and the half-crown and sixpence which he had received from the officers, and that it was previously agreed upon between them that Macneal should pay me the three shillings he had borrowed, with a part of the marked money, and likewise that I never was in the yard with him.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I must again apologize for the great portion of your time I have occupied, but I hope my former apology will be a sufficient excuse, as I am not a great deal more interested than yourselves in the verdict which you shall pass upon this occasion; but if, unfortunately, you should pass a verdict of guilty, I should thereby be prevented the possibility of endeavouring honestly to maintain a virtuous wife and three small children, which I have hitherto done by industriously working at my trade of a shoe-maker, and was never before a Judge or Jury in my life until the present occasion.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am extremely sorry to be under the necessity of stating, that two persons were yesterday taken into custody, while attending at this place under their supoenas to give evidence on my behalf, upon a bill of indictment preferred against them for a conspiracy on the prosecution of Dumphy; and the prosecutors having obtained an order of Court to receive forty-eight hours notice of bail, I cannot now have the benefit of their testimony, which Dumphy well knew would satisfy the Court and Jury of my innocence and expose his villainy, as they would have proved his acknowledgement to them that he had false sworn himself at Guildhall, that he was sorry for it, and that he had done it at the instance of Macneal and Gibbons. Gentlemen, Mr. Powell, the Solicitor for the prosecution, on those witnesses being taken into custody, observed, that if I wanted their evidence I might get it how I could; but he well knew I could not obtain their attendance, as they must remain in custody for forty-eight hours after their being taken up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q.On the 25th of June, did you give him directions to go to Mr. Hedge for mahogany boards? - A. I did not; they large boards for pannels.</p>
               <p>CHARLES HEDGE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a builder, and reside in Crown-street, or Hog-lane; Messrs. Holmes occupy a shed of mine in which these boards were deposited: On the 25th of June last, I saw the prisoner, Gwynn, go past my window; I never saw him before or after; in consequence of information from my man, which I communicated to Mr. Holmes, I watched at home; the prisoner, Ranger, met me as I was coming out of my yard; a person of the name of Jones was with him, who has escaped; he presented to me a note, saying, it was an order from Mr. Davies, Messrs. Holmes foreman; I refused taking it; he said, he was come for some mahogany boards; I ordered him to go to my foreman, Russell; I then saw Ranger take the boards out of the lost, and put them upon the ground to Jones, who took them, and set them by the side of him; Jones took the first four out of the yard; then Ranger came down from the lost, and took the remaining three out of the yard; I did not see Gwynn at that time; I ordered Russell and Smith to follow Jones, and I, with Robertson, followed Ranger; he put the boards down to rest; he then saw me looking, and immediately turned to the right, left the boards, and went away; I had waved my hand to my man Robertson to apprehend him; he stopped him, and took him directly to Mr. Holmes's, with the boards; Mr Holmes, in the presence of the prisoner, denied the order.</p>
               <p>- ROBERTSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am servant to Mr. Hedge; I went in pursuit of the prisoner, Ranger; I saw him put down the boards and walk away; Mr. Hedge was a little behind, and put his hand out for me to lay hold of him, which I did; he asked me what I laid hold of him for; I told him it was not the way to Mr. Holmes's; I brought him to the boards, till Mr. Hedge came; he wanted to get away, and said, if I did not let him go, he would beat me.</p>
               <p>- RUSSELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was employed by Mr. Hedge: On the 25th of June the prisoner, Ranger, came to me, between two and three o'clock, and said, he had an order from Mr. Holmes's people for some mahogany boards; I did not see the order; he said he was ordered by Mr. Holmes's foreman, Mr. Davies, to come for the pannel-boards that had been stopped; I told him I could not let them go by any means without Mr. Davies came; he asked me if I should be satisfied if he went back and got a written order; I told him I should not; he said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010052"/>would go back and get a written order at any rate; he went away, and before he came back, Mr. Hedge ordered me to let him have them upon a written order, and to watch him, (produces the written order; reads it). -" Deliver the bearer,

I said, if that came from Davies, he might take the boards; he then gave a signal to a person of the name of Jones, and he delivered seven boards to Jones from the lost; I then went in to put on my coat to watch them, but I did not see either of them go out; I saw Jones with the boards in Moor-street, in Earl-street; I saw Gwynn walk by the side of Jones as far as the corner of Tower-street, and he put down the boards, and the prisoner, Gwynn, then took the four boards, and proceeded towards St. Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>HENRY DAVIES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am servant to Messrs. Holmes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that order, and tell me if any part of that is your hand-writing? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you give any directions on the 25th of June for Ranger to go to Mr. Hedge's for some of your master's boards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Ranger's defence. I met Jones, and he said he would give me a job; he sent me to Mr. Hedge's for the boards, and they told me they were stopped; I said, I supposed I must have an order; then I went back to Jones; he said, he would go to Davies and get an order, and he brought me an order; I went for the boards, and they delivered them to me; I went with them into West-street, and stopped to rest against the chapel; I put down the boards, and was going across the way to speak to a fish-woman that I knew, and just before I got to her, she took up her basket and went away, and I was going to return to the boards when they laid hold of me.

               <p>My Lord. As your prisoner has been drawn away from her parents by a wicked and base woman, and as your unfortunate prisoner has not arrived at the age of fifteen, and not knowing the consequences of so diabolical a deed, not having the fear of God before her eyes, and not having sufficiently withstood the devices of that wicked being, hope your Lordship will commiserate your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010053"/>prisoner in mollifying her offence, as your petitioner has become sensible of her horrid crime, and truly penitent, and your petitioner hopes to be a comfort to her parent, and an ornament to society in future.</p>

                        targets="t18010701-47-defend447 t18010701-47-deflabel261"/>: On Saturday, the 13th of June, I received information from Gandon, in consequence of which I gave him direction: On the Monday morning I went to Mr. Gandon's and found a cask of molasses there, but I cannot say whether it is our's or not, the cooper can speak to that; I examined the warehouse on Sunday, and missed one puncheon of molasses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long has the prisoner been with your father? - A.Five or six years.</p>
               <p>Q.Gandon coopered the hogsheads when they wanted repair? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it must have been pretty well known that Gandon maintained an honest, good character? - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Suppose you had wanted Gandon to cooper a cask, should you have sent for him to your house, or sent the cask to him? - A. We always send for him.</p>
               <p>- GANDON sworn. - Examined by Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010054"/>Gurney. On Saturday, the 13th of June, the prisoner came to me between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and asked me if I could send three puncheons; I told him, yes, or three dozen, or some such thing; I serve all the puncheons; the prisoner followed me, and said, I am going to send some molasses to your house on Monday morning; I said, yes, as much as you like; I am in the habit of housing sugars for Mr. Walker, but not molasses; he said he should send one puncheon; I informed Mr. Walker of this conversation; on Sunday morning he called at my house, and said, I am going to send out some sugars to-morrow morning, I shall send you the molasses at the same time; I said I should be up at five o'clock, and he said he should send off the sugars at half past five; they accordingly came by Jewell, a carman, about six o'clock, under the crane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose cask that is? - A.That is a cask I had supplied Mr. Walker with; I believe it was one that went in on Saturday, but am not quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you quite sure it was one that you had supplied Mr. Walker with? - A. Yes, I am; it contained about ten hundred weight of molasses, it might be more or less.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.This was a full cask? - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner knew that you got a good deal of your bread by working for Mr. Walker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.He knew that you had always bore the character of an honest man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he make any other application to you, but to leave it at your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You took it in as you would any other goods of Mr. Walker's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had asked you to assist him in disposing of it, you would have taken him for a thief? - A. I certainly should have had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had housed molasses for Mr. Walker before? - A. I had six or seven years ago, and about two years ago, but they did not come from the sugar-house.</p>
               <p>Q.If he had desired you to conceal it from his master, you would have said he was wrong in supposing you would do it? - A.Something of that sort I should; I thought it was rather odd in Mr. Walker to send a single puncheon.</p>
               <p>Q.The prisoner has borne a good character up to this time? - A. As good a character as any man.</p>

On the 15th of June I put some bank-notes into my desk, behind the shop; among them was a bank-note of one pound, and another of two pounds, that had been marked in my presence by a friend of mine, in consequence of having missed money several times; I placed myself in a small room adjoining, and bored a hole where I could command a view of the desk; my brothers left the house, and I saw the prisoner go to the desk and take four wires from his pocket; he tried the hinge, which was rather loose, he then put some wires into the desk, some shorter and some longer, and some crooked at the end; after attempting it about half an hour or more, he pulled out one bank note, and in about five or ten minutes he came again. took the same course, and pulled out another; I then sent for Carpmeal, the officer, who found the notes upon him.(

To shew me the way; we came back again at four o'clock in the evening, and then we took a walk to St. Paul's church; then we came back again to the Queen's Head, and then went to his mother's, on College-hill, and slept there all night; the next morning one of my ship-mates that came from American called for me to go to see the boatswain of the ship that we came up in; we went to <placeName id="t18010701-51-crimeloc277">the Gun, at Wapping</placeName>

               <p>Q.Was that woman so near as to take any thing out of Sutton's pocket? - A. No, it was impossible; I returned the change, and in a short time he missed his pocket-book; I immediately insisted that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010056"/>no person should go out till they were searched; I asked Drury if he was certain Sutton had brought the pocket-book into the house; he said he was sure he had, and he was sure he was robbed in my house; he was sure the woman who had gone out for the change had stole it out of his pocket; I immediately insisted upon her going into a private room with my servants, as there were men in the tap-room, but she would not, but stripped to her shift in the tap-room; I searched her, and all she had was three farthings; I then went to Sutton; I thought he might have put it somewhere and forgot it; I felt all about him, but could find nothing; I had asked the prisoner if he had got any thing belonging to Sutton; he said yes, he had got Robinson Crusoe, a song-book, and his protection-box; I asked him if that was all he had belonging to Sutton; he told me yes; I put my hand into his left hand pocket and found nothing but a knife, I put my hand into his right hand pocket and found a pocket-book containing what Sutton had described, three guineas and a one pound note; I then asked him why he suffered the woman to strip to her shirt when he had got the pocket-book; he said Sutton owed his mother a great deal of money, and he had procured the pocket-book to pay his mother; I sent to the Thames Police-office, and kept the prisoner till the officer came, and I gave charge of the prisoner and the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>- WARNER sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Thames Police-office: On the 9th of June, I took charge of the prisoner from Mrs. Breese; she gave me a pocket-book containing three guineas and a one pound note. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Sutton. This is my pocket-book, it has my name in it and the money that I lost.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you owe this man's mother any money? - A. I owed her, I believe, three shillings, for washing some clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you had never seen him till the day before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his mother before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you owe her any thing for lodging? - A. No; I lodged with a young fellow that paid her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in this young man's company at the Queen's Head, on College-hill; he came in and asked me if I could get him a lodging; I told him I could; I walked about with him all day of the Monday; on Tuesday morning he asked me to boil some milk for him and his shipmates, and then we went to Wapping; we had been both of us drinking, and he gave me the things to take care of while he went out with a bad woman, and while he was gone I laid down upon the table to sleep.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell her it would be better for her to confess? - A. She was going away on Saturday, the 6th of June, Mrs. Machdougal had given her warning to be gone in a week, she was going away that night, and would not stay the week, and I was sent for; when I came back, a coach was at the door to take her things away; I went up to the room that she slept in, and there were two tablecloths and some other things lying upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she then tell you of the table-cloths? - A. She did, and said there were other things pawned there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney, (Counsel for Mills).</p>

               <p>Q.How much money have you got back? - A.There were about six pounds got, I think, about the 11th; I was unwell, and a man of the name of Saunders, and the mother of the prisoner, came to our house; the man said, he came at the request of the prisoner's mother to pay for the things that were not come back; he asked Mrs. Macdougal what they came to, and she said they came to about six pounds; I sent word down that I would not take the money till I knew whether it was legal or not, as I took it for things that were not forthcoming; I was told there was no harm in taking the money, and then returning it to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. You took six pounds, then, upon condition that you would not prosecute her? - A. My wife took it.</p>
               <p>Q. In your presence? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You have got the six pounds, have you not? - A. Yes.</p>

            : On Friday, the 19th of June, between twelve and one o'clock, I was coming from the back part of the shop, I saw the prisoner crossing the street with a bundle of our paper under his arm; I immediately called to out lad; he instantly ran after him, and stopped him just before he got to the pavement on the opposite side of the street; I attempted to take it from him, but the prisoner let the paper fall upon the ground and ran away; our lad took up the paper and brought it to me; I was standing just outside the shop door; our lad then instantly pursued the prisoner, not losing sight of him, down Threadneedle-street; the lad came back with the prisoner, followed by a crowd of people; seeing a crowd of people assembled before the door, a constable came into the shop, and and I gave charge of him, and he took him before the Lord Mayor.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010058"/>WILLIAM WOOLLARD sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Gardiner: on Friday the 19th of June, my master called me to go after the prisoner; I saw him going across the way, he dropped the paper from under his arm; I was close to him when he dropped it, my master was standing just by the door upon the pavement; I picked up the paper, and gave it to my master; I then went after the prisoner, down Threadneedle-street; I kept pursuing him, and holloaing out, stop him; he was stopped about the middle of Threadneedle-street; I never lost sight of him after he dropped the paper; I laid hold of him, and brought him back to the shop; a constable came past, and he was given in charge, and taken before the Lord Mayor; the paper was tied up in a bundle, and put by itself.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of paper was it? - A.Demy marble; I know it to be my master's paper, I could distinguish it from twenty more, it was so remarkable.</p>
               <p>Gardiner. If it had been tied up in a bundle, as paper commonly is, I dare say I should have suffered him to pass; but it being such remarkable paper, I knew it immediately to be mine. (Francis Bailey, the officer, produced the property, which was identified by Mr. Gardiner.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This gentleman first said, I was not the person, and told me to go about my business; he asked me my name, and where I lived and he took it down; he told me he would call upon me, and then the constable came in.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you take down his name, and place of abode? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mean to let him go? - A. I cannot say I had quite made up my mind whether to let him go or not; he begged very hard, and said he was very sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt of his being the man? - A.None upon earth.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she was taken up in the middle of April last, and no bill being found was discharged by proclamation, and returned her prosecutor thanks accordingly; but that as she was taking leave of her daughter, who was going to a creditable place, the was again taken up by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Q. How came you not to follow up this prosecution in April last? - A. I came to Mr. Shelton's Office to give instroctions for a bill, and I was informed that it I came on Friday morning, I should be in time; and when I came, the Grand Jury were discharged; I applied to Mr. Humphrey's the attorney, and he advised me to come to the court, and make an affidavit of it.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you know it was Austin's apartments? - A. He was sent for from work in the neighbourhood, and he came to these apartments; he was pretent when his box was searched, but nothing particular was found in it, except some combs, and some soap of my own manufacturing.</p>

               <p>Q.How recently had you seen the prisoner Austin upon your premises? - A. A few days before I gave her warning, he came in and asked for Mary; I told him she was up stairs in the kitchen, and he went up.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM CHAPMAN sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Public-office, Hatton-garden: on Friday, the 22d of May, the prosecutor applied to our office for a search warrant, to search the apartments of Austin, No. 69. Cow-cross, where I found in a box, four pieces of soap, and a number of other thing, which the prosecutor cannot swear to. (Produces the soap.)</p>
               <p>LEVI OBURN sworn. - I went with Chapman to the apartments of Austin, Austin produced a key to open the box; then Chapman searched the box, and found these things; I then went with Austin over to Lambeth, where we took the prisoner Denham; then the took us to her lodgings, and we searched her, but I found nothing upon her,</p>
               <p>JOHN READ sworn. - I am an officer; in consequence of a warrant, I went to search Denham's box; but found nothing; we than got a warrant to search Austin's box; there I found these two ivory combs, (producing them) after that, we went with Austin, and apprehended Denham, over the water; I searched her, and in her pocket I found a gold bracelet buckle, and a gold soap.(The property was identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Denham's defence. Mr. Dewdney neither allows victuals enough, nor any thing else in the house, to supply a servant; I never made away with any thing in my life; I have been obliged to buy victuals for myself, and likewise for his youngest son, about thirteen years of age; young Mr. Dewdney gave me the combs; the apprentice has frequently brought soap up to wash his hands, and knowing Mr. Dewdney would not suffer them to use it in the kitchen, I have frequently bought soap, and I thought I had a right to them in return; their general character is, that of scarcity and starving, he has had three or four servants in a month; Mr. Dewdney has a son, that has a great deal of company, and takes things away unknown to Mr. Dewdney.</p>
               <p>Austin's defence. I went to see this young woman on Sunday, and I stopped to tea; she said she was coming away the next day; and as I was coming away, she gave me a little bag to take care of, till the next day; I had no thought to ask what was in it; and about five days after that; I was taken up.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM DUNN sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Allen; on Wednesday the 10th of June, the prisoner came to our shop for the waste; I went down into the cellar to hold the bag; he filled first the soft waste hair, and then the hard waste; I heard a quarrel between Mr. Allen's apprentice, and the pot-boy, next door; I stepped from one cellar to the other, and when I returned, I observed the prisoner coming from the hair binn, with a bundle of hair, endeavouring to put it into the bag, but I was too quick upon him, and the bundle broke, part of it went into the bag, and part into the waste binn; they are hogs' bristles; he picked up some of it, and threw the rest into the waste hole; I took no notice then, but asked him what those hairs were upon the ground; he said, he did not know how they came there; he then tied that bag up, and began filling the second, and the second or third handfull that he pulled out was all hair, part of which he threw in; I then said, it was very extraordinary I could not turn my back, but he must be taking the hair out of the binn, and immediately fetched Mr. Allen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You are servant to the prosecutor? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.The prisoner has been in the habit of coming to your house for waste hair? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The hair that you charged him with stealing was in the bag? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a cellar is it, light or dark? - A. It is a light cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. He never came out of the cellar while you were below? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had your eyes upon him; he could have done nothing without your knowledge? - A. He did it while I had turned my back.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear that it was not done by mistake? - A. It could not have been done by mistake, because the two bins were not in the same cellar.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER - sworn. - I am journeyman to Mr. Allen; I saw the bristles taken out of the bag; I took part of them out myself.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Did not the prisoner say, at the time, it was done by accident? - A.He said he did not know how it came there.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DOVE sworn. - I work for Mr. Allen; I went down to look at the bin, and missed a bundle of hair.</p>
               <p>Mr. Allen. I believe these bristles to be mine; they are a very peculiar article; they cost me two shillings and nine-pence three farthings a pound, and he was taking away this at a penny.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a soldier in the Coldstream regiment of Guards, and so is the prisoner: On the 21st of May, coming off guard from the Tower, I saw the prisoner; he said, what is the matter you look so sackless this morning; why, says he, I have had a poor guard, without any money in my pocket; he told me to go to a public-house and order a pot of beer, and he would come to me; he came to me, and then we both went to a public-house in St. Catherine's; he said, landlord, can you give me change for a ten pound Bank-note; he replied he could; then the prisoner pulled out two notes and gave them to me to look at, because he said he could not read them; he said one was a ten and the other a forty pound note; I went to the bar and got change for the ten pound; I think there were about five guineas in cash and the rest in notes; he desired me to take those notes that I had from the landlord and put them in my pocket-book; when we were coming away he said, I wish you would take this forty pound and get change for me; he said I want to buy a new suit of cloaths, and I cannot read, I may take bad notes; I put it into my pocket-book, and the next morning I went to the Blue Anchor, in East Smithfield, and there I met with a sailor, we were drinking together; I said I wished to buy a coat; I said I had got a forty pound note, and I wished to get it changed; the sailor went with me to a cloaths shop upon Tower-hill; I bought a coat for fifteen shillings, and I gave the man the forty pound note to get change; the master of the shop went out to get it changed, and he was so long that I began to be uneasy, as it was not my own note; the sailor then said, I need not be uneasy; for he knew the man, and he was sure he would come back; he said, if I would give him a trifle he would give me change for it; he said, if I would give him a guinea he would do it; I said I had better lose a gui<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010063"/>nea than the whole, and he gave me four ten pound notes; I was in liquor, and I thought I would go to the Tower and lie down; I went to lie down, and in about three quarters of an hour, the sailor and Levy came to me and told me the note was stopped at the Bank, they thought it was too much for a soldier to have; I said I will go with you down to the Bank, and so I went with Levy, and I met the prisoner somewhere about the Tower; I told him what had passed, I hoped he had come honestly by it, I was afraid he would bring me into a hobble; he said, yes, I came honestly by the notes, I found them; I said I should go to the Bank, and he might as well go too, and accordingly he did, but he did not go in, he stopped at the door; I told him I had got the four ten pound notes, and I gave them back to the sailor before we went to the Bank; the sailor did not go to the Bank; I then received the change in a ten, a twenty, and the remainder in twos and ones.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell them at the Bank where you got it? - A. No; then Walton and I went to a public-house, and I gave Walton the change upon the table; I was taken up on the Wednesday night following, and the next day I gave an account of it to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You asked him if he had come honestly by it, did you suspect him? - A. Yes, I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you tell them so at the Bank? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they not ask you if it was your own note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And you told them it was? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not true then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you quartered at the same house? - A. No; I have been three times in the house.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you there on the 21st? - A.No.</p>
               <p>ISRAEL ISRAEL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live with Philip Levy, upon Towerhill: On the 21st of May, Riding came to the shop, with a sailor, to buy a coat, and then he gave me a forty pound note, which I gave to Mr. Levy.</p>
               <p>PHILIP LEVY sworn. - On Friday morning Israel gave me a forty pound note; I took it to the Bank to know whether it was a good or a bad note; they told me it was a very good one; I told them how I received it, and they stopped it till Riding came, and then they gave him change, a twenty, a ten, and the rest in small notes.</p>

James Walton, having a wife and two children, one of them near four years old, which I pay 2s. 6d. a week for, and have been a soldier thirteen years and upwards, and never had a stain in my character before this, and I now declare I know nothing of the robbery laid to my charge. The landlord says, he was robbed between twelve o'clock on the 20th of May, and twelve o'clock on the 21st of the same month, I was at an hospital; at five o'clock on the 20th of May, I went to my quarters, stopped there half an hour; I went out, came back at eleven, and went to bed; a great many lodgers go in and come out at all times; the next morning I got my breakfast, and went out at eight o'clock, the mistress was then in bed in the same room they state to be robbed; about a fortnight before this they lost a large kettle, which they laid to my charge, and abused me very much for, and afterwards found it upon another man who worked in the house. My father was in the Lancashire militia 26 years; my four brothers are all in the army; and the one that has been in the shortest time has been seven years.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>

               <p>The prisoner also called a corporal of his own company, who had known him from October last, and gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Stephens's defence. I was standing at the door, engaged with a customer, when the lad came; he went in, and my wife called to me to know what the brass was worth; I told her to pay sixpence a pound for it; I told her I thought it was about the price of cock-metal, and then returned to the customer at the door.</p>
               <p>Evidence for Stephens.</p>
               <p>- PHILKINS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. - I am servant to Mr. Stephens; I was present when the boy came with the brass; my master was standing at the door, talking with a customer; I weighed the brass, and my mistress cut a bit off with a knife, to see if it was brass; she called to my master, and he looked at it, and said it was worth about the same as cock metal, and desired my mistress to give him sixpence a pound; and he returned to the customer at the door.</p>
               <p>ANN KEITH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was present when the boy came with the brass; I was purchasing a bedstead, he was with me at the door; the boy went past me into the shop to Mrs. Stephens; what he carried in, I do not know; but his wife came and asked him what she should give for it, and he told her sixpence a pound.</p>

               <p>- sworn. - This is not brass, it is a mixture of lead, it is cast and filled up; sixpence a pound is more than I would give for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Is your shop and premises under the same roof? - A. Yes; on the 4th of April, the premises were safe at nine o'clock at night; I was up that night till twelve; the next morning, Easter Sunday, about nine o'clock, I perceived the lead-work of two windows cut; they were half-circle windows, to let light into the warehouse; it was perfectly safe the night before; it was so conspicuous a part of the shop, that if it had been broke before I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q.Were the rest of your premises safe? - A. Yes; I then examined the warehouse, and found all the goods taken from the window; the whole window was cleared; there were between nine and ten dozen of boot-legs, I cannot speak to the quantity exactly, but I think thereabout, and some calves-skins, and sheep-skins, and two graining boards.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the use of a graining board? - A. It is to raise a false grain in the leather before it is dry.</p>

               <p>Q.Would it amount to 10l? - A. Yes, and upwards; I received no information till the 18th of May, I then received information; in consequence of which I took out a search warrant, and went with the officers

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Queen-square, Westminster; I went with Mr. Fell to the prisoner's lodgings, where I found seventy-one pair of boot legs at the top of the house in the back garret, and five pair in a cupboard in the same room; I did not find the graining boards; I have had them ever since. (Produces the property.)</p>
               <p>Q.Did you afterwards apprehend a person of the name of Beetle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any note in your possession? - A. No; Marlden has it; I saw it delivered to Beetle at the office by a woman, and by the desire of the Magistrate I went after the woman, and I was obliged to bring her back by force; I took her to Tothil-fields Bridewell and shewed Harris to her, and she said he was the man that desired her to deliver the note to Beetle. Harris at first said, he did not; she said, do not deny it, for he had got it; I held it up in my hand, and then he said he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing respecting these things? - A. Yes; he said he could bring a person forward that could speak concerning purchasing these things in Whitechapel; I did not know he was a shoemaker; I know the man very well, he used to go about with a horse and cart selling potatoes and such things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. - Q. I believe he not only said that he had bought them in Whitechapel, but produced a person to prove it? - A. There was a person there, but I did not hear him examined.</p>
               <p>JOHN MARSDEN sworn. - Examined by Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010073"/>Knowlys. - I am a police-officer; I went to the prisoner's lodgings; I was at the apprehension of Beesle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of any note? - A. Yes; in consequence of what Messenger told me, I took this note from Beetle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before he was examined? - A. I believe it was the prisoner owned it to be his writing (it is read) "You know nothing, for nothing has been said about you."</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Fell.) Look at these things, do you know that any of them are your property? - A. Yes, they are all mine; the sheep-skins have had the mark cut off; here is one of these boot-legs that I can speak positively to; it is my man's dressing, and has his mark upon it; I have no doubt, from their appearance, of their all being mine; the growning boards I buy of a person of the name of White, and his name is upon the side of them; Martin Bignell is the man's name who dressed this skin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Did you manufacture these bootlegs yourself? - A. I did; part of these I had bought of a shoemaker, and part I manufactured; my man was a young beginner, and spoiled best part of them; this is one that I gave him to try.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever sell any boot-legs of his dressing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they were sold with the mark on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This graining board is just the same as every other graining board that any other currier might have? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Every graining board made by White would have his name upon it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. A graining board is an instrument used in your business as a currier? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that an instrument made use of by shoemakers? - A. No; they cannot use them.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure that the night of this robbery you lost two graining boards of that description? - A. I cannot say that I did, for there were more in the window.</p>
               <p>MARTIN BIGNELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a journeyman to Mr. Fell; this boot-leg I know to be Mr. Fell's; it has my own mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you make any more at the same time? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. A dozen or more? - A. Yes, about a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of them? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BIDDLE, sworn. - I am workman to Mr. Fell.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at these boot-legs. and tell me if they are your master's? - A. Yes, I believe them all to be my master's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Your master is in a good line of business? - A. Yes; he is in a capital line of business.</p>
               <p>Q. And makes a great many of them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear that a great many more bootlegs like them have not been sent out and sold within these two years? - A. No; these are what are called Basil legs.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never sold any since Christmas? - A. I cannot say; Basil legs are very uncommon; I never saw any Basil legs in any other currier's shop in my life but Mr. Fell's.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Do you mean to say the whole seventy-one are your master's? - A. I really believe they are.</p>
               <p>Court (To Fell.) Q.How do you deal in these things? - A.These Basil legs are what I bought of a shoemaker; he bought them at a sale, thinking he was buying a bargain, and was taken in, and I meant to cut them up as useless things; they are cut out of sheep-skins, and, upon my oath, I never sold a pair in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever sell to shoemakers? - A. Yes, I have sold twenty dozen at a time.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DAVIES sworn. - I am a journeyman to Mr. Fell.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at these boot-legs? - A. I believe them to be my master's; I have worked for Mr. Fell two years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Are you a journeyman in the retail way? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. About the beginning of March, I was going through Whitechapel, with half-a-dozen pair of men's shoes to Mr. Philips's; a little below Whitechapel-church, on the opposite side going down Whitechapel, I met with Mr. Philips, who returned back with me, on account of saying me for the shoes; Mr Philips stopped to make water, I stood on the pavement, a man came up and pitched a bundle of leather on the pitching-block that stood there; seeing me with shoes in my hand, he says, Well, Mr. Shoemaker, how goes trade? my answer was, middling; he then asked me, if I was a master or a journeyman; I told him I was a master; he asked me what I gave a pound for cordovan; I said it was according to the quality of it; he said he could tell what he had for more money than I said; he then asked what I gave for wax-leather bellies; I told him I very seldom used any thing of the kind; he then asked me if I would buy some calf-skins, he said he had got a dozen and a-half of small ones; I told him I should like to see them, if they would come reasonable; he said they would; I then proposed to go back to his shop or house to look at them; he said, they would be ready for sale in a day's time and I might call and see them if I would give him my address, and that he would go back with me then, but the load he had was heavy, and he was going home with it to a man that had bought it at his shop; I then gave him my address and he called; when he called at my house, I agreed with him for the skins,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010074"/>and paid him part of the money; he called in a few weeks after that for the remainder, and then said he had got several pairs of boot-legs to sell, if I would like to see them; I told him if he would let me see them, if I liked them I would buy them; I told him I had been spoke to by several of my masters to make them boots; it is a common thing were a shoemaker keeps a shop, for masters like me to serve them with both shoes and boots; after this he came according to his promise with the boot-legs; that was on Friday the 10th of April, he brought the boot-legs, and I bought them of him, and paid him 5l. in part of the money; I bought them at 3s. a pair; there were eighty pair of them; I do not immediately recollect what they came to; it is in my pocket-book, but my pocket-book is not here; he called afterwards, and I paid him 5l. more, and after that he called again, and I paid him the remainder, but I do not recollect how much it was; the officers took my pocket-book while I was not at home, and they looked over the things in it, and I suppose the receipt was rather torn, but I found afterwards but one receipt and half another; the one that was ripped in two was the first; they took away some duplicates too from my pocket-book; I was not at home when the officer came; when I came home, I saw two men on the stairs loaded with leather; I might have made my escape if I chose; when I came in, Mr. Marsden said, well Mr. Harris, we are come to borrow some leather, I told him, if they had more right to it than I had, they were welcome; as to these graining boards, I was at one time intending to get up my own leather; I dare say Mr. Fell knows I had a convenience for currying my own leather by one man.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mr. Fell.) Q.Was there any appearance of currying going on? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not see a currier's beam? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In the course of that enquiry did you see the prisoner? - A. I saw him between five and six o'clock; he is a pen-man; I asked him three times and he denied knowing any thing at all of them; Mr. Key came to the market about a quarter before eight on Monday morning, and I told him of it; then in consequence of information that I received, I went to the Golden Horse in Goswell-street, where I found them shut up in a coach-house; they were the same lambs that I had lost, with the marks altered; there was another mark down the neck of each.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there such marks remaining upon these two lambs as to enable you to swear they were the same two lambs that you lost? - A. Yes, there are marks on them that I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then the marks are not altered, but added to? - A. Yes; I then went to the market and the prisoner was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Parker? - A. Yes; Parker was present when the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. - Q. When you say you asked the prisoner, and he said he did not know any thing of them, did you tell him the marks as you have now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner said he had not seen lambs with these marks? - A. He knew the lambs as well as I did.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH PIGEON sworn. - I am a coachman, and live with Mr. Davis in Golden-Horse-yard, Aldersgate-street; my coach stands in that yard; on Monday morning, the 15th of June, about a quarter before four in the morning I saw the prisoner coming down; I am sure he is the same man; I was washing my coach; he came down and said he had got some sheep there, and he would thank me if I would give an eye to them, and he would give me sixpence; I said I will, how long will you be gone? he said about half an hour; in about half an hour Parker came, then I saw the prisoner coming down the yard; I said to Parker, this is the person that left the lambs; they were all in the yard together, all laying down but one sheep; when Parker came, nobody went near them or disturbed them from the time the man left them, till he returned back.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were there not some lambs, in some other place? - A. There were no lambs in no other place that had been sorted from the sheep, till that man that left them came back again; he said I should like to leave two lambs here; Parker then said here are two halters, I will lend you; he said it will not do so well to have halters, it will hurt their horns, or they might get loose; Parker looked about, and saw Mr. Key's place open; I said they would do in there, there are doors to it, which shut and lock up; he put them in there, and then Parker said, I shall have a nice jaunt back to Bow with these two lambs; I went about my business, and he took them away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did he not say they were lambs that had strayed to his flock,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010077"/>and therefore would not take them to market? - A. I did not hear him say so.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, tying them by the horns would do them a mischief? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you considered this as a fair transaction? - A. Yes; I did not imagine there was any thing wrong.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know what the man brought them there for? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the doors shut? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when these doors were shut, you could not see? - A. No.</p>

               <p>- PARKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I came down the yard, and saw the sheep in the stable; I was talking to Pigeon, and in the mean time the prisoner came; he said, I will give you a shilling if you will lock them up for me; I said, we have no room for them, but I can get a couple of halters, and you can tie them under that coach, they will be safe there; he said, no, the children might play tricks with them; then I put them into Mr. Key's place; he gave me a shilling, and said, don't you think I shall have a fine piece of work to take these two down to Bow; I said, I think so, and he went away; four or five hours afterwards I went with Mr. Key and another man to Smithfield, there I saw the prisoner, and he said, did not I give you a shilling to take care of them till I came to fetch them at twelve o'clock to have them down to Bow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The story that he told you relative to these lambs, he repeated again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he, at the time you desired him to halter them, or at any other time claim them as his own? - A.No.</p>
               <p>A.What are you? - A. A horsekeeper.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you live near Smithfield? - A. I live in Little Sutton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, that when sheep are driving, they will sometimes stray? - A. Yes; I afterwards shewed them to Burbidge.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Burbidge). Were the lambs that this witness shewed you, the same that you had lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Parker). What was the conduct of the prisoner? - A. He made a great difficulty in being taken; he said he knew nothing about the lambs, he did not know whose they were; I then went home and went to work; I heard Mr. Billings say, Jack, I do think you stole these lambs, and he said he did not.</p>
               <p>NAAMAN KEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. Q. Did you see any lambs upon your premises? - A. Yes, I saw them; I then went to Smithfield, and made some enquiries, Burbidge went with me, and owned the lambs; after that two officers came to me, my man went with them, and the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am servant to Mr. Curtis; I saw the sheep and lambs at Holloway.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two sheep that you saw at Mr. Key's, two of the sheep that you had seen at Holloway? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were sorted in Smithfield, there were two missing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN BUTTS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am drover to Mr. Billings; about half past eleven at night, I saw the prisoner; I did not see him again till half past four o'clock on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows:</p>
               <p>"My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. The drover drove the sheep and lambs, 206 in number; he told me that he believed I should find some strange sheep, and when I parted my sheep and lambs in the last lot, I found, instead of 33, there were 35, upon which I conjectured that my man had brought them from Mr. Porter's field, from which place he had brought six wrong sheep the Friday before, which I returned to Mr. Elliott; Mr. Burbidge asked me if I had seen two lambs, upon which I asked him how they were marked; he told me, one white lamb, branded on the the near side, and the other was marked loin and rump; I told him I had none of that kind, they not answering the marks which Burbidge describes, so that I left Burbidge, and went about my business.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN ADAMS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am drover to the prisoner; I drove 206 sheep and lambs from Mile-end to Smithfield; I came by Church-street and Bishopsgate-street, up Aldersgate-street, where the whole broke away, and went up Aldersgate-street; I headed them, and turned them back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an uncustomary thing in driving all at one time, for the sheep to get into a wrong drove? - A.Very frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether that happened to your master lately, and whether any sheep were returned in consequence of it? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q.However, it is not uncommon? - A. It very frequently happens; I said to the prisoner when I got to Smithfield, that I really thought there were some strange ones among them, by their fighting and not agreeing, and that I had six from Mr. Elliott the Friday before, I thought they might belong to him, they had been returned the Friday before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q.You drove them to Smithfield-market? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the trouble of looking when you got there? - A. No; I told my master.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The first thing you do when you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010078"/>get to Smithfield is to put them into the pens? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you separate them and look them over? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who generally does that? - A. I do, only I did not stop that night, because there were but few, and therefore my master did it himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you got to Smithfield market that night? - A.Near eleven.</p>
               <p>- SHARPE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk of Smithfield-market; the prisoner has been my servant these seven years, I have always found him honest and a most upright man in whatever he has done with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you mean to say that that has been his uniform general character? - A. As far as I have had any dealings with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is his duty? - A. I depend upon him for the account of the number of sheep in the pens; I have never found him any way deficient; if there is a shilling to be got, at all times he always brought it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You are called here to speak to his general character, do you mean, that uniformly and without exception, he has borne an honest character? - A. I cannot say so much to his general character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was recommended to his Majesty's mercy by the Jury on account of his good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any demand upon Mr. Cock? - A. Yes; the whole bill was 2l. 17s. 11d. for wheelwright's work; here is a bill and receipt in his own hand-writing - "Settled,

               <p>Court. That you may put in your pocket, for it is a fraud upon the revenue, I shall not hear any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You were not brought up to the business of a wheelwright? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the business was conducted by the prisoner? - A. He was my foreman; I succeeded Mr. Webb in the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long the prisoner was in the service of Mr. Webb? - A. Ten years and more.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010079"/>Q.And when did you come into the business? - A. In 1792, with my late partner, Mr. Roake.</p>
               <p>Q.During all which time he has been employed in your service? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were so well satisfied with him that you held out to him expectations of a partnership? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard before you took him up of his intention of going into business apart from you? - A. No; I heard of it after I discharged him; I did not know a word of it till after I took him before the Alderman; I did not commence the prosecution till I came here; I heard he had been round to some of my customers to solicit their favours.</p>

               <p>Q. You had heard that he intended to commence business on his own account, and had been soliciting custom? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up? - A. I think it is three weeks ago yesterday; it may be a month ago yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you turned him away on the 16th of May; upon your oath, did he not come to you on the 27th of May or thereabouts to desire to settle accounts with you? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor at any time before you took him up? - A. He came to Mrs. Bayley, he was very drunk then, and told her, he was come to square the yards with his master.</p>
               <p>Q. That was intending to settle accounts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not understand from your wife that he came to your house for the purpose of settling accounts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was some days before you took him up? - Yes; I did not then know that he had taken any money on my account.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were you not in the habit of settling accounts from time to time? - A. On a Saturday I used to give him a list of a few bills for him to collect, and when he brought me the money I scratched it out in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you paid him his wages at that time? - A. Yes; and he owes me 9l. 2s. 9d. now; he was always in my debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever met to balance the account? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore it still remains open? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you make it appear that he is indebted to you upon the account? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose hand-writing is that account? - A. It is all my own hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Q. Has he acknowledged that account by signing it or any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not call upon you after you had discharged him to settle accounts with you? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call upon you? - A. Yes; but he was so drunk I could not understand him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - A.He was in such a state of intoxication I could not tell what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after he had called upon your wife to settle the account? - A.Before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know where he was gone to live after he had left you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear that it was in Stamford-street, Blackfriars-road? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Tilley your foreman tell you that he had taken a piece of ground for the purpose of carrying on the business? - A. Yes, he told me he had taken a piece of ground, but I did not know where.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after you discharged him? A. After I discharged him.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you took him up or after? - A.Before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell me just now that you did not know of his going into business till after you took him up? - A. He told me both before and after I heard of his taking a bit of ground.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell that Jury that you did not receive that information till after he was taken up? - A. That has nothing to do with what I charge him with.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes it has a great deal; upon your oath do you not believe he would have obtained a great deal of business; is he not a very clever workman? - A. No, there are better workmen.</p>
               <p>Q. And you kept him ten years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Webb kept him ten years before you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Tilley tell you that he was going to join him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the article, that you charge him with, the last that he received for you? - A. No, he has received some since from other people and paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not a few minutes ago swear directly the reverse? - A.He was in my service some time after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say but two questions before that he had not paid you money since Mr. Cock's demand? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COCK sworn. - I am a carpenter; I I was indebted to Mr. Bayley in the sum of 2l. 17s. 11d. the prisoner brought me in the bill (produces it) I found fault with the charge, and told him I should not pay the bill till I saw his master; some time after that, I think about the 5th or 6th of March last, the prisoner came and asked me for payment of the bill; I asked him if he was fully authorized to settle the bill with me, he told me he was; I asked him how much he was to take off the bill? he said a few shillings; I told him by taking off 6s. 11d. it would reduce it to 2l. 11s. which I paid him with my own hands.</p>
               <p>CHARLES ROWLEY sworn. - I am a constable, I know nothing but the apprehension of the man; he said he was very sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I received this money,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010080"/>it was late on the Saturday night; when I came home, I did not settle with Mr. Bayley; I was to have taken but half a crown off the bill, and I went to Mr. Cock's house, to return the money that he had paid me; and I saw Mr. Cock's son.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Bayley.) Had you any conversation with the prisoner, about deducting any thing from the bill? - A. Yes; I told him to deduct two or three shillings.</p>

            , the man who was tried last Sessions, came in, and borrowed half a crown of Mrs. Hayes. for coach hire; she gave it him, and he went out, and came in again in about ten minutes with a box.</p>

            there were other letters, but I did not see what they were; then the soldier and Mrs. Hayes went up stairs, and stopped about ten minutes; then they came down into the bar, and I saw Mrs. Hayes with a diamond necklace, and a pearl necklace upon her lap. a pair of pearl ear rings, and large drops; I made an observation, and said, what a handsome necklace that was, and she told me to mind my own business, and go into the tap-room, and see if any thing was wanted; when I went back again, I saw several other articles; there was a comb for the hair, cut out in the shape of a star, set in diamonds; I believe in the shape of a star, or a half moon; and a gentleman's breast pin, that was not set in diamonds; I did not observe any thing more that night; there was a large supper that night; the next day, Mrs. Hayes sent the child down to a public-house, in Golden-lane, to Mrs. Hinton; she sent a pearl necklace, and likewise the pearl ear rings, to Mrs. Hinton, to ask if any of them would suit her; the child returned back again, and said none of them would suit her; and afterwards Mrs. Hinton came up, and examined the rest of the articles upon Mrs. Hayes's knees; but whether she took any thing away, I do not know; then between ten and eleven o'clock, on the Thursday, the soldier came; Mrs. Hayes said, come, Putty, take your money; they agreed that night for the things, and she gave him six guineas in gold, and one pound in half-pence; he had something to eat and drink, and I saw no more of him till eleven or twelve o'clock that day; then Mrs. Hayes called me to the bar, and told me to go to the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between the soldier and her that night? - A. After he brought the box, he had something to eat and drink, and then joined the company that he used to be with; between eleven and twelve, my mistress desired me to go to the prisoner'house, and tell him he was wanted to go out with Mr. Hayes; I went, but he was not at home; I delivered the message to his wife; he came about one o'clock, but I saw nothing pass more than usual; he went into the parlour, and had a pint of beer, and then went away; but whether Hayes went with him or not, I cannot answer; I saw no more of Falkner till nine or ten o'clock in the evening; he came as usual to have his refreshment at night; that is all I know of him.</p>

             sworn. - I did live at the Bell, in Red-lion market, near Whitecross-street: On the 30th of April, or 1st of May, I am not certain which, Putty, or Collett, came to my house, about five o'clock in the afternoon, as near as I can guess; he asked me, where Mr. Falkner lived; I told him he lived in Whitecross-street, and in about half an hour, Falkner came to our house; he said, he could not stay now, he had got somewhere else to go, and he would call again; he called again in about three quarters of an hour, or an hour, he came in, and was speaking to Putty about some things that he had wrapped round him in an old coarse apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the things tied round him? - A. Putty; then they had a glass of gin a piece; I was at the door; and Putty said, will you go along with me down to Falkner's, and Falkner said, will you go with me and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010082"/>Putty; I went with them to Mr. Falkner's house, in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Q.What is Falkner? - A.Something in the melting of gold and silver, melting gold and silver off buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. He keeps a melting pot? - A. Yes, that is his business, what they call a white-washer, and sweeper; I believe, when we got there, Putty untied his apron, and put all the things upon the counter, gold and silver, and what things there were.</p>
               <p>Q.Describe what things there were? - A. Mr. Falkner said, must I light a fire, a fire was lit in the furnace, and then he came in doors; the first thing that I saw, was a large gold snuff box, full of stones, set round in a row or two, they glistened very much; but I did not know they were diamonds, nor Putty neither; Putty asked for a hammer, but could not break it; there was a diamond necklace, with a pair of black strings at the end of it, two pair of silver buckles set with stones, one pair of women's buckles, and one pair of men's buckles; he hammered them a little, and got some of the stones out; one was an oval pair, I did not take much notice of the other; there was a pair of men's gold buckles, and a large gold fan; Putty gave Falkner two pearl pins for Mrs. Falkner, with a kind of a rose at the top; there were several other articles, that I did not take particular notice of; after that, all the silver things were put into the pot, stones and all, and I saw it all melted; and after it was all melted, he took a pair of tongs, and poured it all into a thing, just the same as they pour lead in, about two inches and a half wides and about ten inches long, as near as I can guess; after that, the gold was put in; the snuff box and stones, and altogether; Falkner took hold of the fan, her, says he, this will soon be disfigured; the fan was rather damaged on one side, rather cracked, it was set with gold, and pictures, that was all melted, and then poured out the same as the silver was; then they put it into water to cool it as quick as they could; after that, Putty and Falkner were dealing for the silver, and Falkner asked him if he could give him change for a 20l. note, Putty could not, and then we all three came up to our house; Mr. Falkner came into the bar, and asked my wife to give him change for a 20l. note, and she could not give him change; then he borrowed 2l. 16s. or 4l. I am not sure, of my wife; then he came into the parlour, and paid 4l. 10s. to Putty, for this silver; then they began dealing for the gold, Putty asked him 50s. an ounce, and Falkner would not give him but 2l. an ounce; then he said, he would not let him have it, and I do not think he bought the gold at all, for he did not deal for it in my presence; Putty told me, he had sold the gold for twenty-one guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you then, that you went with Falkner and Putty from your own house, to Falkner's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the girl that has been examined,

             sworn. - I am a carpenter, in Dickson's-court, Mary-le-bonne-street, Golden-square: On Friday, the 1st of May, about nine o'clock in the evening, I went to the house of Mr. Hayes, I had a pint of beer, and staid there about three quarters of an hour, when Hayes, Falkner, and Putty came in together; sat down in the bar; Putty sat down; he had the appearance of a glazier; he took from his apron two pieces of metal, gold and silver, about eight inches in length, as near as I can guess, about an inch and a quarter wide, and about the thickness of two-pennyworth of half-pence; the gold was of the same dimensions, except it run irregualar; one end was very thick, and the other end very thin indeed, it ran quite to a feather edge; Putty said to Falkner, you shall not have this under 50s. and he said he would not give it, but he would see whether it was worth it or not; he took the gold bar, and bit a piece off the end, and was going to bite another, but he said he had not enough; he returned the gold bar to Putty, and took the piece that he had bit, put it into a paper, and put it into his pocket; Falkner took the silver bar himself; he wanted change for a note, I cannot say how much; then he wanted to borrow some money to pay for the silver, but how much I cannot say; I heard something about four pounds; he said that was not enough, or something of that sort; Mrs. Hayes's back was towards me, and I could not see what money passed; then Falkner went into the parlour with the silver bar, and Putty with the gold one; I know no more of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This was bargained for in your presence? - A. I heard him ask 50s.</p>
               <p>Q. But the silver was bargained for in your presence? - A. No; I suppose they bargained coming along.</p>
               <p>Q.Hayes was by at the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And the money was paid on account of the silver, in Hayes's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you at Bow-street? - A. yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sworn at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the Magistrate at Bow-street what you have been telling the Jury to-day? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that? - A. I told them then I knew nothing but by hearsay.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did you say at Bow-street that you knew nothing about it? - A. I did not; I said I knew nothing but by hearsay.</p>
               <p>Q. What relation are you to Mr. Hayes? - A. I am brother to Mrs. Hayes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, Mr. Hayes has sworn very falsely againes me; I know nothing at all of the transaction; he, I understand, stood in the situation I now do last sessions; I know nothing at all of the business; he is now come forward under a promise of getting his wife's pardon if he will appear against me.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I filled up this affidavit; it is an affidavit that some person made in the name of the prisoner; but it is impossible for me to identify the person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp (To Rance.) Q. Do you know the prisoner's hand-writing? - A. I believe it to be his hand-writing; I have seen his writing, but I never saw him write.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you received letters from him, which by any act that he has done, he has acknowledged it to be his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010085"/>hand-writing? - A. I had forgot, I have seen him write; I saw him write when he took out the licence for his first marriage, and I saw him write at the church.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q.You have seen him twice write John-Willian Bishop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You are not to take other things into your consideration; do you mean to say, that from the knowledge you derived from seeing him write the words John-Willian Bishop twice, that that is his hand-writing? - A. I should be very sorry to swear that it is his writing, but I think I may venture to say it is his writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Have you had any applications from the prisoner for money by writing, and you have lent him money in consequence of it? - A.Not in writing.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt that that is his signature? - A. No; I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the signature to that bond, is that his hand-writing? - A. I think it is. (The affidavit and the bond read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Rance.) Q.Where did Bishop live? - A. In Red-Lion-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell? - A. Yes it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Birkwood.) When an oath of this sort is administered, where is it administered? - A. Sometimes at the Surrogate's Chambers, and sometimes in the Common Hall or the Dining Room.</p>
               <p>Q. And sometimes in the Proctor's house? - A. No; unless people are infirm, and then the Surrogate attends out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the oath is never taken but in the presence of the Surrogate? - A. The Surrogate always administers the oath himself.</p>
