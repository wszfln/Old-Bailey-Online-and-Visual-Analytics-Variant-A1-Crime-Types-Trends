The deceased, John Stack, was my husband—he was a labouring man—On Sunday, the 23rd of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was at the prisoner's house—the prisoner, his wife, John Spurling, and several other persons were in the room drinking—we had a bottle of rum, and half a gallon of half-and-half—about a quarter to twelve o'clock Mrs. Houlahan came in rather tipsy, and wanted more drink—the prisoner was tipsy as well, and Stack also, we were all tipsy—I stood up and took Mrs. Houlahan into her bed-room—she got sick, and said she did not like two persons who were in the room—I said I would get them out as quick as I could, and not to mind them—I came into the room, and told them all to go home to their own places—my husband was in the room—when I told them to go home the prisoner seemed not to like that, and began to show insolence to me—Stack did not like that, and the prisoner and Stack had some words together—Stack said he thought himself as good a man as the prisoner—the prisoner said, "I don't know that"—Mrs. Houlahan hearing that, came out of the bed-room—I took her to her room again, and had not been there five minutes before this happened—I did not see the blow given, as I was in the bed-room—my daughter came to me and gave an alarm—I went out and saw my husband lying on the floor, between the stairs and</p>

On Thursday morning, the 19th of March, I went to the Mint public-house, and in a stable near there found five trusses of straw in one corner—I have always understood Smith let that stable to Culverhouse—I have seen Captain Abbott's men go into the stable—Dowsett was with me—it was the stable from whence the staple had been drawn—on undoing the straw I found two bottles, and one broken—one was ginger brandy, one was wine, and the third had contained wine, but the bottle had been broken—on the same day I went to the stable, in Bedford-row, and found Culverhouse in Mr. Abbott's yard—I told him I should take him into custody, on suspicion of robbing Mr. Smith of wine and other articles—he said he would put on his jacket and come—I waited and he came—he afterwards said he knew nothing about it—on the 11th of April I went to the town of Buckingham, and found Kimbrell in the tap-room of the Wool-pack—I said to him, "Well <hi rend="italic">Knockey</hi>, I suppose you know what I have come about?"—he said, "Yes, my boy, I will come with you directly if you will wait till my mother comes"—I showed him the warrant—he said, "Yes, that is all right, my boy"—his father came in and said, "What is all this about?"—he said, about a bit of a spree that took place in London, but he was innocent—his father said, "They would not come down here and take you if you were innocent"—I took him to the gaol, and they locked him up for the night—on the way to Woolverton he said he never was in the stable at all, and no one could say he was, and if he got transported for seven years, or for life, it would be an unjust thing, and he desired to have fair play—he repeatedly looked at his handcuffs, and said it was all through keeping bad company.</p>

On the 19th of March I went with Hughes to the Mint—I searched the stable where the mail-horses are kept, and in a truss of straw in the second stall under the manger, in a corner of the stable, found a bottle of ginger-brandy and one bottle of cham<lb/>pagne—there were five trusses of straw standing there I think—in one of the five Hughes found three bottles—at ten o'clock the same night I took Dawes</p>

I am a gardener, in the service of Lord Desborough—I was on Battersea-bridge on this Saturday, in a cart, and saw the prisoner on the bridge—she crossed over, and put her hands and her left foot on the parapet to throw herself over—I got out of the cart, and stopped her—I asked her what she was going to do—she said, "Look there! do you see my chil<lb/>dren?" pointing over into the water—I looked over, and saw two children floating on the surface of the water—one of them was picked up by some men in a boat—it was a little girl—she is alive—the prisoner appeared to be very much excited—she said she threw the children in through distress—I asked her what she <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it for—she said her husband had ill-treated her, and gave her great threats that he would do for her—I called for a boat, and saw one child picked up—she said it was far better to see the children <hi rend="italic">go</hi> before herself.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday, 2nd of May, I was called in to see the body of a child—it was dead, and appeared to have died from drowning—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, which still more satisfied me it had died from drowning—I saw the prisoner at the station-house within an hour after the fatal occurrence—she was sitting in a chair, apparently calm, her countenance pale and haggard—I sat by the side of her, and felt her pulse—I counted it, and found it at 180—that is a state of high fever, amounting almost to delirium, between delirium and coma—the pupils of the eyes were dilated, the skin hot and dry, the tongue clammy and furred—I put some questions to her—she had a tremulous motion about her tongue when requested to show it—I asked her if she knew where she had been for the last hour or two—she appeared not to understand the question—she seemed lost—on my repeating the question, she. burst into a violent paroxysm of tears, and exclaimed, "I wished to see them <hi rend="italic">go</hi> before me; <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was the cause of it; he beat my head through the door, and he beat me when I was in the family way"—I did not ask her more questions then, because she was taken into a room to be searched, where I accompanied her—she was asked to empty her pockets, and drew out a dirty cloth, which she said was her pocket-handkerchief, and an. empty purse—the searcher said, "The purse</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184605110028"/>
               <p>is empty"—she said, "Ah! that is it"—then she said, "I wish to see my I baby, I should like to see my baby"—I said, "You know where your baby I is, don't you?"—she hesitated a few seconds, and replied, "It had a straw I bonnet on, and a pretty cap"—this was all I staid to hear her say—I left im<lb/>mediately—I considered her in a state of high nervous irritation, and her I brain, I should say, in a state between coraa and delirium.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The skin being hot and dry, and the tongue clammy, and I furred, could that have originated within the last hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say that I was progressive—it certainly could not have begun and got to that state I within the hour—it might have commenced some hours previously—I judge I that it commenced within a few hours, not within the last hour, but to have increased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Having heard a description of the facts which occurred on Battersea-bridge about an hour before you saw the prisoner, in your judg<lb/>ment, with the experience you have had of persons in such situations, is it your opinion that at the time she did these acts, by which the child met its death, her mind was unsound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly, I should say—if she had been I describing something to have happened to her which had not in fact happened at all, such a description would be a symptom of a deranged intellect—from what I have heard her allege to have happened, and what she herself afterwards did, and from the state in which I found her, I should say decidedly her mind was in a state of aberration an hour before—I draw that conclusion from the state of her pulse, which was 100 above the general standard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a person to commit a great crime, and was in a great fright? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My lord she did not appear in a fright—she was calm—I speak from the state of her pulse, and the eye, which is not capable of being governed by the will—I had, unperceived by her, noticed her, and there was that which is characteristically indicative of aberration, what is termed a mowing of the mouth, and a bragging of the lips, as if in internal communion—the tremu<lb/>lous motion of the tongue is characteristic of mental aberration.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Like a man in a sleep? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—not properly speaking a perversion of the understanding, but like a man in delirium jumping out of a window for instance—a state of delirium from fever—there would be no pre<lb/>vious appearance of perversion of intellect, but like a person cutting his throat in a paroxysm of fever—not that the mind is wrong, but like a person with<lb/>out a mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do all the circumstances you have heard detailed confirm in your judgment that was the nature of the disorder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They do—I am decidedly of that opinion—this is a character of madness which may come on on a sudden, and equally rapidly subside—mental causes produce physical effects, which may subside after the cause has subsided—she was not aware that I was looking at her—I appeared to be talking to the inspector, and observed her unknown to herself—I saw her again at the police-office, on the Wednesday—she appeared then in <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>, more distressed—I did not speak to her—I at that time most decidedly thought her mind deranged—similated madness is very easily distinguished by the faculty, the symptoms are too well known—there was no reason to suppose that on Wednesday, there was any opportunity of deceiving me by any simulation—there was not the slightest reason to believe there was not mental derangement.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The contents of the letter appear addressed to the husband, and the letter itself addressed to a relative, would that in any degree interfere with your conclusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the contrary, it will assist it.</p>

               <p>five or six different times io the course of the night—the prisoner was one of the persons engaged in the disturbance—there were four or five of them altogether—having left them tolerably quiet, at half-past eleven at night I heard a call of "Murder!"—I went up the court, and saw Dennis Ragan there fighting—ha knocked me down, he said some wicked words, and dared me to touch him—I believe he is the prisoner's brother—the prisoner was there, and when I endeavoured to take him into custody, four or five of them tried to pull him away from me—the prisoner caught hold of him, and tried to pull him away from me—there was a large lot of people round—I got assist<lb/>ance, and got Dennis Ragan as far as Commercial-street, and there an attack was made, and an endeavour to rescue him—a gentleman said he would run to the sta<lb/>tion-house, and get assistance for me—they got me down on the ground—Dennis Ragan went down with me, as I would not let him go—they kicked me on the back while I was down—the prisoner was there at that time—White came up—I was standing with Dennis Ragan at the corner of Fashion-street, and there was a struggle with a policeman going on—185 came to my assistance first, and tried to help me take Dennis Ragan to the station, but was pre<lb/>vented by the prisoner—I saw the prisoner knock him about—I did not see him down on the ground—I saw blows struck upon White by Sullivan with a policeman's truncheon—Sullivan had then got a flannel jacket on—after he struck White, I saw him throw the staff over the railing—I only saw him strike one blow—White's hat was off at that time—I saw the prisoner there at that time—I did not notice whether he had anything in his hand or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There were three policemen, yourself, White, and 185? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—more came directly afterwards, but not at the time the blow was struck—Dennis Ragan, John White, Sullivan, the prisoner, and two more were present, one of whom I can swear to, but the other I cannot—I saw Sulli<lb/>van strike White, the constable, on the head with a staff—he got the staff from 185—I did not lose my staff—I never took it from my pocket till I got hold of the prisoner—I only saw one blow struck—after striking that blow, Sullivan? threw the staff away, and made his escape for some time—I did not see any more of him, till after twelve o'clock—it was a dreadful blow on the side of the head—I could not see what became of the policeman immediately after the blow—there were two or three people round him—he was knocked down on his hands and knees with the blow, and some of the men got round him—I could not see whether he got up, for I went on with Dennis Ragan, who I had got.</p>

On the 19th of April, j about twelve o'clock at night, I was sent for to the station—the policeman, Francis White, was there—I found two very serious wounds on his head, one on the right side, and the other on the forehead, which was not quite so severe as j the other—it was a contused wound, about three inches long, and extended to the bone—it must have been a very violent blow done by a blunt instru<lb/>ment—he remained ill for three weeks—he was in considerable danger at first—a good deal of head-ache and symptoms of internal injury.</p>

On the 19th of April I went to Commercial-street, Whitechapel, and saw Dennis Ragan striking some of the police—he was lying down on the ground and kicking some of the policemen—Ames and another were there—I assisted in taking Dennis Ragan towards the station—in consequence of information I went back to where I the other men were, in Commercial-street—I saw Hope there on the ground—White and William Ragan were both down on the top of him kicking him—I only saw two on the top of him—there were several by—I cannot swear to Sullivan—there was a man of his appearance and height there, with a flannel jacket on—William Ragan was dressed as he is now, and White also—I took hold of White and pulled him off Hope, and received a blow in my face from White—I afterwards went and found White in a house in Sugar Loaf-court—I produce a hat which was on him—it was bloody at the time, and his head was bloody—it appeared to have been lately bleeding—his head was wet—I picked up another hat in Commercial-street, where the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was—it was claimed by William Ragan.</p>

About half-past eleven o'clock on this night, in consequence of a communication from a gentleman, I went to Commercial-street, and saw Ames with Dennis Ragan in custody—he was kicking and resisting—I sprang my rattle for assistance—William Ragan took it out of my hand, threw it on the ground, jumped upon it, and broke it—the handle was picked up by a gentleman directly afterwards—Ames sprang his rattle—I was struck by a man not here—a few minutes after White came to my assistance, I saw a man with a flannel jacket on strike him on the head—I remained there about five minutes before my rattle was broke, and about half an hour after that I lost my staff—I do not know who took it—I was on the ground at the time, and three or four upon me, I do not know who—I saw Hope knocked down by two or three—I cannot positively swear who it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am serjeant of G division of police. On the 20th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, by direction of the Mint, I went to a house in New-court, Duck-lane, Westminster, with Tate and White, policemen—we were in private clothes—I forced my way into a first-floor front room there, and found a man in the act of casting counterfeit half-crowns—I proceeded to secure him, and handcuff him—whilst so doing, a number of persons assembled in the court, and I saw from the window the prisoner Laurence, throw a brick through the window, which it broke—it hit White on the face, and knocked him down—the window was up, but the brick came through the glass—I found the window open when I got into the room—I called out to Laurence, "I am a police-sergeant, and shall have an opportunity of knowing you another day, young fellow"—I cannot say that I had ever seen him before—there were from eighty to 100 people in the court—I called out that I was a police-sergeant loud enough for them to hear me—I noticed the prisoners Morris and Smith there at that time, and they each threw a brick or stone through the window, one of which struck me on the side, in the room—a great many bricks and stones were thrown into the room the floor was nearly covered—we could scarcely walk on it—from eight to twelve people rushed in at the window, and at the same time others rushed in at the door—there were twenty or thirty there—they overpowered me and the officers after a desperate struggle, and got the man out of our custody—I sprang down stairs alter him, but he escaped with the handcuffs on—I was knocked down at the foot of the stairs, and stunned—I recovered myself shortly after, and went staggering out into the court—as I staggered down the court I received a blow at the back of my head from a brick or stone, which felled me into the kennel—I was stunned—I knew nothing more till I found myself in a baker's shop, bleeding profusely from a wound in my head—I received many kicks and blows when I was knocked down at the foot of the stairs—I was confined to my bed several days from the injuries I received, and am now under medical treatment—Laurence, Morris, and Smith were outside the house when they threw the bricks—I did not notice either of them inside—the mob outside cried out, "Give it to the police, give it to b—Brannan." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

I am a tailor, and live in Oxford-market, Oxford-street—on Tuesday, the 7th of April, I was on my way home from Whitechapel, with the materials for two coats, wrapped in a black wrapper—about half-past six o'clock I had to turn up by a dead wall in the Kingsland-road, it being the nearest way—I saw two or three men standing at the corner of the wall—I went on, and the two prisoners followed me from the corner—they had ftntianr jackets on,—Meredith asked me if I would have a drop of beer—I said, "You are quite a stranger, I will have nothing to do with you; walk on"—they stood back, and in two or three minutes I received a violent blow on the back of my head—I believe it was struck by Meredith—I was senseless a few minutes—it knocked me down, and my bundle rolled into the gutter, and they ran away with it—Meredith ran away with it, I think, but they were both together—in about ten minutes a policeman came up—I went with him to the station, and gave a description of their persons and of the bundle—on the Thursday morning I saw them in custody at the station—I knew them—they are the very two men—the black wrapper which was round my bundle was found round Clune's neck—it has a private mark on it—I have not recovered my property—it was worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of an omnibus running from Islington to Chelsea. There are other omnibus proprietors on that road—the foreman receives the receipt of each omnibus from the conductor, daily, and sends it to the proprietor of that omnibus—in July last the prisoner was conductor of my omnibus—it was his duty to pay what he received to the foreman, Midwinter, daily—he is foreman to all the proprietors who run on that road—we generally reckon five journies each way daily, but it depends on the business of the day—on the 6th of July he performed six journies—Jones is the driver—it was the prisoner's duty to receive money from the passengers—at the end of each journey he takes a ticket, with the number of passengers inside and out, with the money received, and places the ticket in a box, and next morning he accounts for the money received—it was his duty to fill up the ticket and sign it—on that day he made no ticket of any journey, but at the end of the day filled up one, and inserted the whole day's journies—his duty in the morning, was to pay the total ticket with the money to the foreman, who should send it to me: and once a week the foreman makes up an account of each omnibus's earnings, and we meet and divide the money—if my omnibus earned more than another, I should have to hand a portion over <hi rend="italic">to</hi> another to make the amount equal—that arrangement is on purpose to prevent racing, and give better accommodation to the public—we do not divide the gross profits, but the earnings—each man works his own omnibus at his own expense—the conductor pays over the receipt of the day, short of his own wages—the prisoner did not come to work on the morning of the 7lh, which he ought to have done.</p>

On the 6th of July the prisoner was conductor of Mr. Trevett's omnibus—there is a box kept at the Peacock, in which each conductor ought to leave a ticket at the end of each journey, to show what he has received, and on the following morning he pays the money to me for all the journies performed the previous day—he should give me with the money, the last ticket, which is an account of all the journies—I should forward the total money received to Mr. Trevett, in a bag marked</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publisher, and live in St. John-street. I have one partner—I have employed Elizabeth Larkin to stitch books for the last two or three years—her daughter Eliza was employed by her mother—she has worked for about the last six months at our present premises—I had not missed these prints—they are such as we publish, attached to our own works—this paper forms part of works we are publishing—the prisoners had the opportunity of possessing themselves of those prints and paper on our premises, but had no right to dispose of them—our stock is so large we could not miss it—I dismissed the prisoners on the 14th of March—I afterwards accompanied the officer to Bartholomew-close, where the prisoners were living—I saw these prints found there, and the officer took possession of them—this book was found at the lodging where the prints were—I removed it myself, from the prints to the paper—the officer was not aware of it.</p>

               <p>I did miss, and told them of it, but I was satisfied we had a bad lot, and I told the prisoners they had better go about their business—they used to have a great quantity of this paper—the pile of paper they would have in six months would be as high as the room—they often came and stated that the prints they had given them were too few, and got an additional quantity from the warehouseman, because we had not the means of detecting then that they had the plates, but there is no doubt about it now, because here they are—they returned a few plates on the Saturday right when I dis<lb/>missed them, and therefore these that are here must have been taken before that—they have not asked for their book half a dozen times—they would bring the book to our clerk.</p>

               <p>which leads into Basinghall-street—that was still in my road, the way I go and return night and morning—we went on till we came to ana avenue called Sambrook-court—previous to coming there I begged her not to stop—I said, "I cannot stop, I am very late"—she pulled me a few yards up that court against my will, and she began to be very loving—I begged her to let me alone, but she seized tight hold of me, and held me very tightly—I said, "You are a <hi rend="italic">rum</hi> one at all events"—then all in a minute she let me go and ran out, and in came two men to inquire if that was a thoroughfare—I thought it was very strange—I put my hand into my pocket, and my purse was gone—I had in it three new Victoria sovereigns, two half-crowns, three shillings, and a sixpence—I rushed out of the court, and turned fortunately to the left—I did not like to be robbed in that kind of way—I met the policeman—he said, "What are you looking for?"—I said, "I have just been robbed"—he had seen the woman run that way—we went down Lawrence-lane, and found the prisoner and another under a doorway, and I heard the purse drop on the stones—this is my purse.</p>

I am a cooper in the service of the East and West India Docks—it is part of my duty to examine all the casks landed at the rum quay, in the West India Dock—on Tuesday morning, the 31st of March, about ten o'clock, I attended at the unloading of the barge <hi rend="italic">Blucher</hi>—I examined the whole of the puncheons that came from it—as the men rolled them over to me I observed one, No. 815, had two new plugs in it—it was marked H. &amp; Co., S. P. &amp; Co.—the plugs appeared to be newly made, and to have been smeared over with dirt, to take off the freshness—in half an hour after another puncheon was landed which had the same marks on it, No. 819—I found in that two plugs similar to those in No. 815—I made a communication of the matter to Mr. Taylor and Mr. Harris.</p>

               <p>as he has correctly stated—I perceived they had been recently plugged—I drew a sample from each of the puncheons and delivered them to Mr. Hampton, the Customs' gauger—there were twelve of those puncheons which had the same marks on them, dipped by the Custom's gauger—they averaged a defi<lb/>ciency of about four gallons each—Nos. 815 and 819 were dipped also—one of them was five gallons deficient, and the other six gallons—between the two there was a deficiency of three gallons more than the average deficiency of the puncheons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gauger in the service of the Customs. On Tuesday morning the 31st of March, a bladder containing rum was brought to me in the proof-room, in the West India Docks, I measured, and found it con<lb/>tained one gallon of rum—I ascertained its strength—there were two samples of rum brought by Mr. Taylor, one from the puncheon, No. 815, and one from No. 819—the strength of the rum in the bladder was 36.2 per cent, over proof—the strength of that from No. 815 was 36.1 per cent—and that from 819 was 36.3 per cent—I have compared these samples—I have no doubt whatever j that they are in all respects the same with those in the bladder.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Moulin and Co., stone contractors and wharfingers. We were employed to pave the carriage-way of the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-fields—the prisoners Sealey and Bunce were out carters—On Wednesday, the 29th of April, they were employed in carrying paving-stones from James-street, Covent-garden to St. Martin's-street—we had occasion to take the old stones up in James-street, and to take them to St. Martin's-street—Sealey and Bunce were employed in carrying them—the men have what is called rubbish after the stones are taken up, if permission was obtained from the foreman—we never considered it any perquisite—we never knew anything could be got from it—the stones which were conveyed from James-street to St. Martin's-street could not, by any conception, be mis-taken for rubbish—it was their duty to take the stones from James-street to St. Martin's-street, and nowhere else—they stated that that day seven loads had been taken by them to St. Martin's-street—about seven o'clock that evening I was walking in the neighbourhood of Lisson-grove, and I saw two of my own carts of stones—Sealey and Bunce were with them—it was no part</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184605110079"/>
               <p>of their duty to be there—I followed the carts—they turned into Earl-street, and from there to Little Grove-street—they stopped opposite the prisoner Hales' premises, which are down a street that is open at both ends—they shot the stones out, and I went for a policeman—(they had taken seven loads to St. Martin's-street—this was the eighth load—if they had done their duty they should have deposited that load in St. Martin's-street, and then have returned with their empty carts to have given their account)—I was not gone more than ten minutes for a policeman—when I returned, the stones had been removed from where they had shot them, to just inside the door of Hales' premises, and there appeared to have been some ground shovelled up upon them—Hales' premises are a coach-house, with rooms over—there are large folding doors—I found Hales standing against the door of the coach-house—I saw a boy there with a shovel in his hand shovelling a little loose ground outside—I went up and said to Hales, "Who do these premises belong to?"—he said, "To a person at Vauxhall"—I then called in the policeman and he put the same question to Hales—he at first said they belonged to a person at Vauxhall, and then he said, "If I must tell you, they belong to me"—the policeman put some other questions to Hales, but I took very little notice of them—I recollect Hales said that he bought the stones for rubbish of two carts which had brought them there—the stones were in a damp state at the lower end, as if they had just been taken up in the street—the stones I saw Sealey and Bunce shoot were worth from 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—there were not less than two tons of them certainly—if they had been such stones as are broken up for macadamizing they would have been worth from 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton, but these were better than would be taken for that purpose—they were very good ones—it sometimes happens that stones are not good enough for a place where there is a great traffic, but good enough for a place where there is less traffic.</p>

Bagley came to my shop about six o'clock in the evening, for a sheet of paper, and offered me a half-crown for it—I immediately detected that it was bad—I made up a small parcel of paper to detect the person, whoever gave it him—I told him to take the parcel to the man who gave him the half-crown—he went out with the paper—I followed him—he went towards the prisoner, who was about the centre of the crossing, within sight of my house, about fifty yards from it perhaps—he joined the prisoner, and by the time he got to him I came up to him—I had seen the boy beckon him—I cannot say whether the prisoner made any advance to meet him—I was looking for a policeman—when I came up, the boy and the prisoner were not more than four or five yards from each other—they were having communication—I laid hold of the prisoner, and said, "You have sent this boy to my shop with a bad half-crown"—he said, "No, I did not"—I collared, and led him on towards the top of the street, and on arriving at Mr. Bagley's shop I pushed him in—he sat down on a chair, with his arm resting on a tea canister—he then got up from the chair and ran down the street—Mr. Bagley and I followed him, with a cry of "Stop thief!"—we never lost sight of him—we took him and brought him back to the shop—it all took place within five minutes—the policeman Loveless came, and I marked the half-crown and gave it to him—it had been in my possession—it had passed to Mr. Bagley.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman; I live at Wapping, and am employed on the Thames; the prisoner was my apprentice for nearly five years. On the 31st of March he was to take my barge, the <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi>, alongside the barge <hi rend="italic">Albion</hi>, to work sixty-one quarters and five bushels of peas—about the middle of the day I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Jlbion</hi>, and was there nearly an hour—there was a meter measuring the peas, and I waited till he had done—I then desired the prisoner to take the <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi> to St. Andrew-wharf, and to ship the peas on board the first Glasgow trader—he afterwards produced to me a meter's bill, and told me he had taken the barge to the <hi rend="italic">Dunchatton</hi>, and they would take the peas on board the next morning—the next day he told me the peas had been taken on board—I went to the wharf, and got the receipt from the wharfinger for 123 sacks and a cotchell—the prisoner told me in the evening that he had been to the vessel, and put the cotchell into three other sacks, which he had distinguished by putting a cross upon them: and he said the sacks were all taken from the <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi> on board the ship—I said he should not have done so, for I had taken a receipt for the full quantity—he said his object in doing so was to reserve the sack in which the cotchell was—on the 20th of April I received a letter from Glasgow: in consequence of that I asked the prisoner what he had done with the cotchell of peas—he stated he had put it into three sacks, and marked the sacks—the <hi rend="italic">Dunchatton</hi> went on its voyage, and it returned to London about last Tuesday week—I then received some information from the mate, and I spoke to the prisoner again about the cot-chell—he said he knew nothing more of the peas than he had told me before—I asked what sack it was he had brought from the vessel across the wharf—he said it contained the sweepings of some oats that he had gathered up in the barge—I said I did not believe his statement, and gave him into custody.</p>

On the 4th of May, in the afternoon, I was in my kitchen, at dinner—I had articles of drapery in the shop—I had been absent half an hour—I had fastened the parlour door inside, and left the key in the lock—I heard a wooden roller fall down above me in the parlour—that and the shop are all one—I heard two people walk out—I rushed to the kitchen window, and saw the prisoner stepping from the upper step of the street door of the house—that is not the door of the shop—there was another person going out before him—he stepped out, stopped for a minute or two, and then walked on—I saw his face so as to be able to swear to him—the prisoner is the man—I went up stairs, found the parlour door open, and saw a wooden roller of silk serge lying three or four yards from where I had placed it—a piece of doe-skin which I had left on my cutting-board was gone—I afterwards dis<lb/>covered that other property was gone—not more than a minute after I had seen the prisoner on the step, I went into the street and saw him walking down the street from my door—I ran after him—he stood still and I passed on—I said nothing to him—when I got round by a public-house, I saw two other men running away—I do not know them—I have every reason to believe one was the first man I had seen go out—he had a bag with him—I called out as well as I could, and pursued him—he saw me, and dropped a bag" containing the goods—I went after him instead of stopping for the bag—I was intercepted by some of the prisoner's party, who got before me, and wanted to know the particulars of it, and I thought it was high time to go back to the bag—I did so, and gave it in charge of the constable—I after<lb/>wards saw the prisoner about twenty yards off, walking deliberately on the other side of the way—I pointed him out to Walters, who stopped him—the prisoner wanted to know what he was stopped for—we told him for enter<lb/>ing my premises—he said, "You may take me if you like, it was not me," or something to that effect—I examined the bag—it contained this doe-skin, cloth, and satin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is my property—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person I saw going out of the shop.</p>

I am a surgeon—on the 30th of April I was sent from the Thames police-court, and saw Shea's head—there was a lacerated wound on the scalp—I probed it—it went to the bone—it was a bad wound—there was another, half or three quarters of an inch from it, but not so deep—it was such a wound as might be done with this instrument.</p>

On the 22nd of April, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I heard a "scream from a house in Marsh Gate-lane—I went to see what it was, and saw two men lying on the ground, one upon the other—the deceased was uppermost—Wilcox was underneath—the prisoner was standing up—I saw him kick the uppermost man on the nose, hard—the <hi rend="italic">blood</hi> flowed immedi<lb/>ately—he rolled off the man he was upon, and that man got up and picked him up—I took hold of the deceased's hand and said he had better come away, but he pulled away from me and made towards Lancaster, who was coming towards him, and they had two scuffles after he had received the kick—I did not see any blows struck—they were only struggling together—he fell down again, and after that I persuaded him to come away with me—he came to the ditch and washed his face—there was a great cut where the blow had been, and blood coming from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not he struggling and fighting with Lancaster and Wilcox when you came up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not see struggling—I saw him on the other man on the ground, outside at the back part of the house where the yard is—I did not see the prisoner do anything to him but kick him—I did not hear him call out to him—his wife was there after he received the kick—she was calling out to him—she was outside in the yard screaming when I came up—she asked me to get her husband away—his nose was sore across the bridge—it looked like a great piece knocked off—I lent him a handkerchief to wash it.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the deceased on the 23rd—there was blood flowing from his nose at that time down his face—I saw the prisoner about a month before that—he had been speaking to me about the deceased—he said he (the prisoner) was going to be removed from one length of work to the other, and that it was Emmons's doing, and he said his garden-ground was down one way, and it was done for that, that he should be removed away from it—he said he was a hog of a fellow, but if he could not get him out by fair means he would get him out by foul.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer on the Eastern Counties Railway—on the 22nd of April, in the evening, I was at my lodging—the deceased came into my room, he inquired something concerning a sixpence, and asked for George Evans—Evans came into the room while he was inquiring for him—the prisoner and Wilcox and deceased were there—a quarrel took place, in consequence of my taking Evans' part—he attempted to hit Evans—I took Evans' part, and then a quarrel took place between the deceased and me—we had a scuffle together in the room—I struck the deceased—the pri<lb/>soner took him under his arms to clear his house, and with our assistance we put him out at the door—we all got into a small court—the prisoner came and scuffled with me again, threw me down, and fell on me—they pulled him off me, and I got up as soon as I could—Wilcox tried to pull him away from me, and being a powerful man, they both fell down together—Wilcox was under<lb/>neath, and the deceased upon him—I did not see the prisoner do anything then—I do not know how the deceased got up, but he got up as quick as he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On the night of the 22nd of April the deceased came to my house—he had a contused wound on the bridge of the nose—the bone was not observable—the skin was completely cut through—the wound might have been inflicted by a kick—it was a fresh wound—he had no other wound or bruise that I saw—it did not appear to me to be important—he called occasionally, and had his nose dressed by my assistant—the next time I saw him was on the Thursday—I found him labour<lb/>ing under symptoms of tetanus—I tried everything, but he died on the Friday—my opinion is, that tetanus arose from the wound—a wound of that nature might occasion such a result—a contusion might produce lock-jaw, but wounds are more liable to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe tetanus is commonly called lock-jaw; that proceeds from many other causes than wounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a violent cold producing inflammation of the bowels, might occasion it—worms will occasion it—if a person received a kick in the body irritation of the bowels might follow that, and tetanus from the inflammation—it is possible that a strain in carrying a heavy weight might occasion such irritation, as might terminate in lock-jaw, but it is not probable—I would not undertake to swear in this case that the locked-jaw was the result of the wound on the nose—it would be the probable result.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you trace any connexion between the tetanus and the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first symptoms of tetanus came on about the time that it is usual for tetanus to appear after a wound—there had been no inflammation of the bowels—I examined the body after death—the stomach was inflamed—I have no doubt that followed from the tetanus—there was no symptom of inflammation of the stomach that I am aware of previous to the tetanus—I had not seen him for a fortnight—there was nothing in the state of the body to which I could refer the tetanus, except the wound—in cases of tetanus we are generally able to ascertain from what it has arisen—I should find on examining the body some cause to which to refer it—there was in this case no cause to which I could refer it, except the wound—a concussion of the brain might occasion inflammation, and inflammation might produce tetanus—there was a slight inflammation of the membrane of the brain—that was the cones<lb/>quence of the tetanus—I believe the wound to be the cause of tetanus, but admit that inflammation of the brain would produce tetanus.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the rope-yard, Woolwich.

               <p>I saw the three prisoners in the Broadway, Deptford, near the house of Mr. Fleay, a linen-draper—I saw some goods at his door—Prior went into the passage, and came out again—I then saw the three prisoners talking together—Davis then crossed the road, and looked at a blanket which hung at a pawnbroker's door, and I think she went on the steps—I am not positive whether she went into the house—she then went and joined the other two prisoners, then went into Mr. Fleay's doorway again, and Eldridge went in also, just on the step—Davis was outside—I saw Eldridge take something off the side of the door, and put it into her lap—Davis was behind her—I do not know whether she saw what Eldridge did—they then all three left, and after going about twenty yards they separated—I saw the policeman stop Eldridge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Robert Weather<lb/>don, of Palace New-road, Lambeth—he is a tailor. I knew the prisoner Tap<lb/>son at Launceston, in Cornwall—I had a very slight knowledge of him—I had seen him when I was there with some friends—about a week before the 31st of March he came to my father's house—he said he had seen me at my friends, and came to let me know how they were—he asked if we could re<lb/>commend him a lodging—we said he might have a bed at our house, and he stopped—on Tuesday, the 31st of March, he said he was going out, and would take my little brother, and bring him home in the evening; that he was going <hi rend="italic">to</hi> meet my cousins, who live at Launceston, and were coming by the railway, and he should bring them to our house—I was not aware they were coming up—their name is May—he went out with my little brother, Edwin, a little after ten o'clock—I did not see him again till a quarter past ten o'clock at night—I went out in the afternoon, and returned at a quarter past ten—Tapson was then up stairs at my father's house, and the prisoner Beard was down in the kitchen—my brother Edwin was at home—Tapson came down stairs in about a quarter of an hour—he said he could not get the key to fit his box, and he should be obliged to cut it—he had got a knife before I came home—he said this in Beard's presence, and Beard asked if he had got any cream—he said no, they had not sent anything of the kind—he had cut the box open then—when Tapson was up stairs Beard said he wished he would make haste and come down, for he wanted to get home—he remained about a quarter of an hour after that in the kitchen—a few words passed, and then he left—he said as he left that he should try and get Tapson in to hear the trials at this Court next morning—Beard was quite a stranger <hi rend="italic">to</hi> me before—I am sure he is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Foyle, a pawnbroker, in the Westminster-road. On Wednesday, the 1st of April, a few minutes after seven o'clock, the prisoner Tapson came to the shop, and brought a satin dress, a black satin pelisse, with a cape to it—I valued them at from 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them—that created my suspicion—I asked him whose they were—he said they were his own, that a young woman gave them to him a fortnight ago—I asked him where he lived—he said at Gravesend—I asked him the reason of his coming all the way from Gravesend with them—he said he slept with a friend in Red Lion-street the night before—I asked him the reason he came all the way from Red Lion-street, Holborn—he said he came with his friend to Charing-cross, and just came over the bridge to pledge them—I said I should be justified in detaining them till I inquired further into it—he said something about law to me, and I sent the boy after a policeman—he went away before the policeman arrived, leaving the things—when the policeman came he went after the prisoner, but could not find him, and about half-past nine, or a quarter to ten, the prisoner returned—I asked why he left the things behind him—he said he had been to acquaint a friend of the circumstances he was placed in, as he did not wish to be locked up—the boy was gone after a policeman then the second time—Tapson was talking to Mr. Foyle, and said a young woman gave them to him the day before to pledge for her—she had come out of the country, and spent more money than she ought to have done, having been seeing the gaieties of London, and he being a friend, she gave them to him to pledge for her—Radford, the officer, came in and took him.</p>

On Thurs<lb/>day, the 22nd of Jan., some of my men were working at a house on Royal-hill, Greenwich—I know the prisoner William Richardson—he resided in that house towards the autumn—in consequence of a communication from Pearce I came with him to the house, and saw a coffin, which was taken out of there and placed in the kitchen of the house—I left the house locked up, and I kept the key till next day—nobody lived there—I gave information to the beadle that day—I saw the coffin again next day—it remained in the house-locked up that night—on the following day I went with Herrington and an<lb/>other constable to the house, and took it away to the Morden Arms.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184605110148"/>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mentioned Reinsche's test, which is considered, I believe, the best? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is different altogether—it is with copper—we boil the bright copper and the suspected liquor, and the copper comes out a dark colour, these ex<lb/>periments led me to that conclusion—I never tried Reinsche's test before—the jar, containing the remainder of the body was with me part of the day, till conveyed to Mr. Heisch—it was under lock and key, tied over and sealed—it was delivered to me on the 29th—I took the four pieces of the body to Dr. Leeson on the 30th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant chemical lecturer at St. Thomas's hospital. Dr. Leeson is the principal—on the 30th of Jan. I removed a iar to the hospital from Mr. Mitchell—it was covered with leather, and sealed over—I was present when it was opened the following day—in the meantime it remained sealed up in a small room at the back of the laboratory—when it was opened Dr. Leeson and myself were present—we found it contained part of the remains of a child—we experimented upon them, and discovered a certain portion of arsenic—the first thing we did was to fill the jar with boiling distilled water, with the body in it—the contents of the jar were then washed out in a perfectly clean dish, made of Berlin porcelain—two legs and one arm of the child were then taken out of the dish, as not likely to contain poison—the other arm was so decomposed that the flesh all came off—I could not take it away, and the rest was placed upon a sand bath and boiled for about half an hour—as many of the bones as possible were then taken out, and a portion of perfectly pure hydrocloric acid was added to the contents of the dish, which were boiled, except the bones—it was boiling at the time I added the acid—it was then boiled a short time longer, and filtered through a linen cloth, and a portion of the liquor, which was filtered through the cloth, was boiled with a piece of perfectly pure and bright copper—this cop<lb/>per, after being boiled, appeared covered with a dark coating, which coating we believe to be arsenic: but further to ascertain whether it was so, the copper was introduced into a piece of hard German glass tube, which was heated, and the whole of the dark appearance disappeared from the copper, and was transferred to the glass tube—this tube was then heated, and a small amount of air being allowed to pass through it, after the copper was re<lb/>moved, the dark stain which had before been on the tube disappeared, and we obtained a white crust, which being examined with a microscope, con<lb/>sisted of white octohedral crystals, which confirms the presence of arsenic—a small portion of pure distilled water was then boiled on these crystals in the tube, by which the crystals were dissolved—the liquor was then poured into a glass to one portion of which we added ammonial sulphate of copper, which gave a green precipitate—to another portion we. added ammonial</p>

               <p>nitrate of silver, which gave a yellow precipitate—to a third portion we added sulphurated hydrogen gas in solution, which also gave a yellow precipitate, and from these tests we were able perfectly to conclude that arsenic was present—as nothing but arsenic could have produced all these results—other experi<lb/>ments were used, simply with a view of ascertaining the quantity of arsenic present—we separated from other portions of the body which we had, about four grains and one-tenth of a grain of arsenic—I had rather not give an opinion whether that was sufficient to cause a child's death.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You state arsenic is sometimes found in combination with copper—you used copper with the experiments? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but the purity of the copper was ascertained before we used it—we tested it—no arsenic was present there—the purity of the copper was ascertained by boiling it in pure hydrocloric acid—it was not necessary to try the arsenic on animals to satisfy me.</p>

                  </hi>. M.D. I am physician to St. Thomas's hospital, and lecturer on chemistry and forensic medicine—I received from Mr. Heisch a jar, containing the remains of a human body, upon which I per<lb/>formed experiments—I have heard Mr. Heisch's evidence, and agree in the correctness of his details—I made, however, other experiments, in addition to those described by Mr. Heisch—I conducted the analysis myself, except the first boiling, which was done in my presence and under my directions, by Mr. Heisch, in distilled water, the purity of which, and of every other article used in the analysis, was examined—the Berlin dish, the cloth, the water, the muriatic acid, everything else used, were previously tested by myself, to see that they were perfectly pure—I will produce the two pieces of copper with which the examination was made—I took two pieces of copper made clean and bright, by dipping them in a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acid, which re<lb/>moves from the surface of the copper any impurity that may be present on the surface—I took a portion of the liquid in which the body had been boiled.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184605110150"/>
               <p>and taking a similar quantity of the muriatic acid employed, and mixing it with an equal quantity of the distilled water previously made use of, I then took the two pieces of the bright copper, and put one into the one liquid and the other into the other liquid, and then boiled them—the one piece of copper which was put into the muriatic acid and water remained bright, whilst the other piece had a coating of arsenic deposited on it—this is Reinsche't test that arsenic was present—to prove that the deposited metal was really arsenic, I placed a portion of it in a German glass tube, as detailed by the last witness, and subjected the end of the tube, containing the copper, to a strong heat, which had the effect of subliming the arsenic from the copper—I put my nose to the end of the tube and smelt the strong characteristic smell of arsenic—I then allowed a current of air to pass through the tube—after removing the copper, the arsenic being sublimed on the surface of the tube, and forming there a dark metallic crust, which is peculiarly characteristic of that metal, this current of air converted the metallic arsenic into an oxide, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the arse<lb/>nious acid, which formed on one portion of the tube minute crystals, which are peculiarly characteristic of arsenic being present—when I examined it with a microscope, I ascertained it to consist of small octohedral crystals—I dis<lb/>solved the crystals in distilled water, one portion of which when tested with the ammoniac nitrate of silver produced a light yellow precipitate—to another portion I added ammonia sulphate of copper, which produced a green preci<lb/>pitate, called Scheele's green—by this method of analysis we get rid of all the fallacies which ordinarily attach themselves to these tests, when organic matters are present, and I consider no fallacies can arise—I took another por<lb/>tion of the liquid in which the body had been boiled and subjected it to the action of galvanism, using a platinum pole at one extremity of the battery, and a portion of clean copper to the other and in this manner also obtained the precipitate of metallic arsenic, which I have here—this when first preci<lb/>pitated was very bright and silvery, but by keeping it has become partly oxidated—there is now a small portion of white arsenic on the surface, which is also another indication in my mind that the liquid contained arsenic—hav<lb/>ing obtained by sublimation from another piece of the copper the metallic arsenic in a glass tube, I subjected it to a further test, which is a modification of a test commonly known as Marsh's, which in the manner generally used is subject to objection—I took a quantity of pure sulphuric acid and water, and a portion of pure zinc—the zinc was placed at the bottom of a tube, and that tube placed in a glass vessel containing the dilute sulphuric acid—to the inner tube was attached another tube, for the purpose of collecting the hydrogen formed by the action of the acid and water on the zinc, and this tube dipped into a second double necked bottle containing a solution of ammonia sulphate of copper—the gas after bubbling through this solution was then passed through the tube containing the metallic arsenic, which was attached to the second neck of the bottle—my reason for doing so was that if any impurity had escaped me as existing in the acid or the zinc employed, the ammomia sulphate of copper in the second vessel would have separated it, and thereby rendered the hydrogen gas perfectly pure—the hydrogen gas thus formed being thus led through the tube containing a portion of the metallic arsenic sublimed from the copper, and the other extremity of that tube being drawn out to a fine point, I held it over this small vessel of porcelain, on which it deposited by burning a portion of the metallic arsenic resulting from the decomposition—I have here the small cup with the black metallic stains, but, from keeping, a small portion of the stain has disappeared—when I first w it, as even now, it exhibited a black metallic stain of arsenic</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your opinion from the various tests of the existence of arsenic which you formed by boiling? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not the least doubt that the body contained arsenic acid or common white arsenic—I would explain with regard to the amount of arsenic stated by Mr. Heisch to be present, it is quite obvi<lb/>ous that in making a great variety of experiments, and particularly the preli<lb/>minary experiments, which I made with a view to discover arsenic or any other poison which might exist, that portions of the liquid must be used for the purpose—the plan I proceeded on was to divide the liquid into several measured portions, and it was by the examination of one such measured por<lb/>tion that I ascertained the total quantity present in the liquid to be 4 1/10 of a grain—there were eight or nine portions into which the liquid was divided—I am perfectly sure that from the whole liquid there was 41/10—it must have been equally diffused through all the liquid, and I was very careful in measuring it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would that quantity be sufficient to cause death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would in a child—I believe less, but it would depend in a great measure on the state of the child's stomach.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing arsenic to be given to a child whether in food or otherwise, what would be the appearance on the child afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> First of all we might expect very great pain in the stomach—we should probably observe a redness in the throat and the internal part of the mouth—there would be in a short time after small vescicles or blisters about the tongue or throat.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Something like the thrush? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very much like the thrush, and we should have the general symptoms which attend inflammation of the stomach, such as great thirst, a burning sensation in the throat—vomiting is one of the earliest symptoms—there might or might not be foaming at the mouth—it would be attended with very great pain—I examined some earth which was brought to me by the witness May, to ascertain whether there was arsenic in it—there was none present.</p>

               <p>there would be great danger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not in the present case—if the articles you use themselves contain poison, then your whole results may be fallacious, therefore I always make it a matter of examination to see the articles themselves do not contain the substance—I made a further examination after Reinsch's test—I examined the copper made use of in the first instance—I took a piece of the whole copper, and ascertained it was pure copper by dissolving a portion of it and examining the solution thus obtained—there was no arsenic in it.</p>

I</hi> saw none—I am sorry to say I believe there have been cases where poison was said to be present, but I consider the experiments to be fallacious—as to the individual test of Reinsch's, which consists in the deposition of arsenic on the surface of the copper, I should not be satisfied with that alone: it is by further examining the deposit, and from all the tests used, that I conclude that there certainly was arsenic present.</p>

The male prisoner made a statement, which I tendered to him for his signature—he said, he would rather not sign it—he gave no reason—I read it to him, and asked by the direction of the Magistrate, if it was what he wished to say—he said, "Yes"—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—The prisoner William Richardson says, "I wish to speak the truth, however much the awful circumstances are against me; I never wished to conceal the birth or death of the child; I could have had it buried in London for a few shillings much more secretly: my desire was not to have the remains of the child disturbed: in June last my daughter was unwell, and Mr. Sturton was engaged to attend her; I went away, and when I returned I found she was pregnant, and I withheld any medicine which would tend to procure abortion; there was no concealment; I engaged a nurse and a doctor: on the 15th I took my daughter to the apartments I had engaged, and I returned home")—he then read this letter—I have no doubt it is the same—it was handed to the prisoner, and subsequently came into my hands—"No. 3, Weston-place, Weston-street, Sept. 16th, 1845,—My dear William,—Ann has passed a sleepless and miserable night, slow wretched pains almost reaching each other has never left her. We had the doctor this morning about ten o'clock. He said it was her labour, and that all was right; but, that it would be some hours before she would be out of her trouble. She is very much exhausted, being three nights without sleep, and never free from pain. I shall remain until she gets it over. The doctor is going to call again at two o'clock, bnt he said it might be midnight, or even longer, before it would be over, but I can say no more, hoping all is well at home, with kindest love to your<lb/>self and children. Yours A. R. Mind dear Billy." The prisoner then went on and said,—"This shows the care which was taken of my daughter, and the infant; on the 17th I heard that the child was born; I believe I went up to see my daughter; on the 25th, I received a letter from my daughter"—(I believe this to be the letter—it came into my hands in the office)—"No. 3, Weston-street, Sept. 25th, 1845,—Dear father,—I wish you would come up this afternoon to see the baby, for he seems very ill. His cold has gradually gotten since you were here last. We had the doctor yesterday afternoon, and he said there was something the matter with the blood, and unless that cleared he would not thrive. He has bad a cold from his birth: it seems to be now on the lungs: his throat is very sore; he can scarcely swallow anything. The doctor sent him powders, and lotion to wash him with. Last night, from about ten to twelve o'clock, he was low and seemed scarcely to breathe. That Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds thought he would not live through the night, but he seemed to get a little better after twelve o'clock. I am very poorly. I have gotten a very severt cold, sore throat, and head-ache. Hoping your cold is better, and the family are all well. Give my love to mamma, and all the dear children—the same to you.

The prisoner further says—"I have never done anything <hi rend="italic">to</hi> contribute to the decease of, or cause the death of the child, and God knows it; my sole care was to preserve the child: I declare be<lb/>fore God and this people that I never saw the article, or bought any arsenic; the only thing which caused me to bury the child in my own ground was, that it should not be disturbed; I might have eluded this inquiry; all my children and my wife know that I have ever mourned the death of the child." <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.
