               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030008"/>
               <p>the original sum—I had no security on the property in the Grange-road—I had nothing whatever to do with them—he owed me money as a new debt, a debt contracted subsequent to those due to me on the mortgage deeds—I was not a party, directly or indirectly, in erecting those premises—I have no interest in the premises in Grange-road—I lent him 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, towards the insurance—I understand part of the money he had from me paid the insurance—those premises were burnt down—there have been a good many bill transactions between me and Reuben Hunt, jun.—an action has been brought against me by the prisoner on the three bills produced—I got an order to inspect them—I took a man named Nethercliff to inspect them, and Messrs. Adlard, the engravers—I did not inspect the I O U s, but the bills, and denied their being my hand<lb/>writing—the order did not permit us to inspect the I O U s—I do not recollect whether this was after I had pleaded to the action—there was hardly a month elapsed between the pretended claim being made and the matter coming on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After taking Adlard and Nethercliff to inspect the bills, did not you instruct your attorney to apply for leave to add a plea that the bills were given for the accommodation of William Hunt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave him no in<lb/>structions whatever beyond defending the action—I swear I did not so instruct him—I did not know that the plea was made till I heard it in Court—I did not know of the application—I did not know what was done in the action—I first heard of it at Kingston, at the trial—these bills are accepted by Scammell and Davney, and drawn by Reuben Hunt, jun., on him—they are the bills I saw in the hands of Reuben Hunt, about two years after they were overdue, about two years ago—he applied to me several times to lend him money on them—my name was not on them then—my name appears on them as in<lb/>dorser, after Reuben Hunt, jun., as drawer—nobody was present when I saw them in his possession—he came to my house to borrow money—I refused—he offered these bills as security, and I refused them, saying I was a holder of 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of bills on the same party—I had many bills of Scammell and Davney's, and every bill I had bears a number in my bill-book, which is now in Court, and have passed through my books, kept by my clerk—I have a great many of Scammell and Davney's bills now—I had no connection with them whatever—Reuben Hunt originally built this new paper-mill in Berners-street at my expense, especially as he said for Scammell and Davney at a rent of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and they gave their acceptences to Reuben Hunt—he brought them to me, and I ad<lb/>vanced cash, and subsequently obtained a mortgage.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you were never indebted to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never in my life, not a single farthing—he was indebted to me consider<lb/>ably—I never lent him my name to endeavour to raise money, or give him credit in the world—he was not entitled to it—he was not in business—I did not put my name, or authorize him to put it, to the I O U, or to have any instrument of this sort, to show that money was apparently coming to him—I never authorized him or anybody to put my name to an I O U, or any other document.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Till he took proceedings about this debt, did you charge him or any of his family with having set fire to any of these premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nor had I any idea of it, except what I have heard subsequently from other people—I have not lent my father-in-law money since his premises were set on fire—the Hunts had nothing to do with that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Lord Chief Justice. I was present at a trial of an indictment for perjury against Thomas Rogers, on the 8th of July, 1844—he was acquitted—the I O U which I have produced was put in evidence—I think the prisoner produced it—he spoke to it certainly—I received all the documents at the trial, and detained them, by order of Mr. Justice Wightman, who tried the case—according to my recollection, the prisoner spoke to the handwriting of Rogers on these I O U.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in partnership with Mr. Wright as attornies and solicitors. We were Mr. Rogers's attornies for about five years—Mr. Wright acted for him in the action brought by Hunt—I was then in the office—the case was referred at the suggestion of Lord Chief Justice Denman—I attended every meeting before the arbitrator—we had a difficulty in getting them to go on with the reference—I was obliged to press them on—I saw the I O U for 1739<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. produced on the reference by Mr. Lewis's clerk, acting as the prisoner's attorney—he also produced the three bills of exchange and another I O U for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner was present when they were all produced and used.</p>

               <p>of the prisoner—I received this order from the prisoner to repay Mr. Rogers five guineas out of some money that he expected to receive from an action that we were about to bring—it is dated "June 22nd, 1843," and states the money to have been borrowed on the 4th of July, 1842.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever heard the defendant say anything at all about any debt he owed to Mr. Rogers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When he gave me this, he referred to particular money, borrowed on a particular day—I was to pay it out of that, and he also gave me instructions to bring an action against the assignees of his brother Reuben, and I was to hand over to Mr. Rogers half the money recovered by that action, in payment of the money that he owed him—that was sometime in 1842—we declined to bring the action—I do not recollect his coming to me for a loan of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and telling me anything about Mr. Rogers—I was not concerned for him—he wished me to bring the action—he was talking to me then as his attorney—he had an action brought against him in Oct. 1840, by a person named Davney, for trespass—judgment had been allowed to go by default—I declined to appear in court for him at first—he said, "Well, if you will lend me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I will give Mr. Chadwick Jones a brief to appear for me"—I declined to lend him the money, or to give a brief to counsel without the money—I was not then acting as his attorney.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you speak from the character of the handwriting, or from any circumstances which have come to your knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the character of the handwriting simply—I try to keep the circumstances away—there is one thing in particular, there is an upstroke to the T in "Thomas" which Mr. Rogers never makes—there is a similitude, but still a stiffness—it is not like a genuine signature, it is too fine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw these documents at the trial at Kingston, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw some of them—I saw the bills of exchange, and the I O U for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see the other I O U there—I cannot tell whether it was produced at Kingston—to the best of my belief it was not—several witnesses were called at Kingston, a dozen, I think, to speak to Mr. Rogers's handwriting on the bills of exchange—clerks to solicitors—I do not think there were any banker's clerks—they were persons quite independent of the case—a Mr. George, clerk to Mr. Alder<lb/>man Wood, was called, and several others—they stated they believed these to be Mr. Rogers's handwriting—there were also witnesses called at the trial at Guildhall—I believe some of the same that were at Kingston—defence at Kingston was that they were forgeries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And on the evidence having been given for the plaintiff, Lord Denman said this matter ought to be inquired into by an arbitrator, where both the parties could be examined? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not at that stage of the proceedings—it was after Mr. Sergeant Channell had addressed the jury for some time, and was reading the letters, borrowing small sums</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030011"/>
               <p>of money, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and so on, Lord Denman said, "There is something more in this case than I can try; it ought to go before an arbitrator, who can examine both the parties"—there were two or three meetings before the arbitrator—I am not positive which—I do not know whether it was after the last meeting that Mr. Rogers gave the prisoner into custody—it was not done by my'advice—I heard of his having been given into custody a day or two after—I do not think that was before the indictment for perjury was preferred against Mr. Rogers—there are some figures on the back of this I O U for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not present at any settlement between the pri<lb/>soner and Mr. Rogers at any time—there was no bill at any time given at my office by Mr. Rogers to the prisoner—I am positive of that—not to any of the Mr. Hunts—I was present at Mr. Hewitt's office when the Hunts and Mr. Rogers were there—I think there was then a bill given by Mr. Rogers to the prisoner—I cannot tell the date—the date of the release will tell—I dare say it was about the 7th of Nov., 1840.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you meet at Mr. Hewitt's office for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was an action brought against Mr. Rogers by Scammell and Davney for some trespass he had committed on their premises in Berners-street, which were in the occupation of Hunt—Mr. Rogers agreed to advance money to settle the thing, and a bill was drawn by Hunt, which Mr. Rogers accepted—it was paid to Mr. Lewis to settle the action—the Hunts and Mr. Rogers were connected in some way with it—releases were signed on both sides, and all bills drawn on Scammell and Davney, who are the acceptors of the new bills, were professed to be given up to Mr. Rogers—the Hunts were parties to those releases—at the time of those releases there were in the hands of Mr. Rogers several bills of exchange, drawn by Reuben Hunt, jun., the drawer of these bills, on Scammell and Davney, the acceptors, and Mr. Rogers at that time returned all those bills to Scammell and Davney—there was a general settlement of the account, as far as Scammell and Davney were concerned, and they were to give up the premises—after the action of Hunt against Rogers had been going on, two engravers were taken to see these bills—there was one from the Bank, and one from the Post-office—I do not know their names—they were taken to Mr. Lewis's office to inspect the documents on which the action was brought—they went as men of skill, accustomed to forged handwriting—they went into Mr. Lewis's room to see them, but he de<lb/>clined to allow anybody else to go in but these two gentlemen—they were taken by me, under the Judge's order—after they had been taken to inspect the documents, I applied to the Judge to allow me, in addition to the plea that Mr. Rogers did not endorse, to plead a plea that the bills were given by Mr. Rogers for the accommodation of Hunt, but not in consequence of anything that they said, nor with the knowledge of Mr. Rogers—it was done under the advice of counsel, on the production of these letters, and I do not think it was the same day that Mr. Netherdiff and Mr. Adlard were examined—it was soon after, within two or three days after—I have no papers which will help me—neither Mr. Nethercliff nor Mr. Adlard were called as our witnesses at the trial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030012"/>

Between one and half-past one o'clock in the morning, the 28th of Dec., I was on duty in Chiswell-street, and saw two persons at Mr. Tarrant's shop there—the prisoner was one—they were close to the shutters—I heard some glass break, and said, "What is up?"—they both came towards where I was—I said, "What has been up now?"—they then saw me and ran away—I followed, and called, "Stop thief!"—they ran to the corner of Finsbury-place and there separated—the prisoner ran across the square—I pursued, and never lost sight of him till he was stopped by Green in the square—I took him back to the shop, found the shutters shifted, and a square of glass broken—I saw some cigars on the pavement, on the very spot where the men turned round and started from—they are in this basket, and are cigars and cheroots—it is a cigar shop—I aroused Mr. Tarrant—he came down—I took the prisoner into the passage of the house—he denied having done it—at the time the window broke there was nobody near enough to have done it but him and his companion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's sister, and live in the same house with her. On the Saturday evening before the accident I brought in a quarter of a pound of moist sugar, and put it into the sugar-basin—from that time till Wednesday I took breakfast and tea with my sister, and used this sugar—I perceived no ill effects from it—on Wednes<lb/>day morning when I came into the room my sister was sitting at breakfast—she had just poured out a cup of coffee when I came in, and she thought the milk had turned—she drank it, and said what a peculiar taste it had—I observed it was as if the milk had turned—the milk had been put in—the coffee was boiled in milk and water—she poured out another cup, and I suppose must have put rather more sugar into that, for it turned a great deal more than the first—she had put no milk to that, but it was boiled in milk and water—I did not notice any curdling before the sugar was put in—I did not drink any of it—she poured some coffee into a basin, and it was very good till she put the sugar to it—we then had suspicion that it must be the sugar—I took the sugar and coffee in the basin to Mrs. Peddle, and afterwards to Mr. Chave the chemist—I tasted a few of the curds out of the second cup—it made my mouth feel very rough—I have heard the prisoner say he would poison his wife—he often said he would kill her—he said he would <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for her and the child, and then go for a soldier—I heard him say so I believe the week before this occurred—I thought he was in fun, and said, "Would you give me a dose too?"—he said no, he would spare my life—I felt nothing more from what I took—I once saw him sharpen a razor, and next morning my sister told me he had put it under the pillow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five weeks before—we were laughing when he spoke of going for a soldierv—he gave me the money to get the sugar on Saturday, and on Sunday he said he was sorry he had given me the money for sugar on Saturday, as his mother had got some, and he had mixed them together—my sister was present—there was no more sugar got after that—I slept in my sister's room on Tuesday—the prisoner got up about eight o'clock—I was in bed then, and remained till he got up—we lodge there with Mrs. Peddle, who has a husband and two children at home—my mother lived with us—it is my mother's lodg<lb/>ings—we have lived together since the prisoner has been out of work—I do not remember my mother threatening to send him to prison if he did not marry my sister—I was not at the wedding—I did see my sister strike him with a poker—he left her once, and she sent him to prison for refusing to support her when she was ill—he was then in a situation—his mother lives nearly opposite us—they were married in Dec., and I think in April he went to a situation at Mr. Anderson's—he is twenty years old next month.</p>

                  </hi>. On Wednesday, the 17th of Jan., Margaret Haynes brought some sugar to me in a basin, I analysed it, and found it contained oxalic acid, I part in 20—a tea-spoonful or two of such a minute quantity taken by a grown person would have no immediate dele<lb/>terious effect—a tea-spoonful would contain three or four grains—I can<lb/>not say whether it would produce any ultimate danger, that is more the province of a medical man—it might produce pain and sickness—some coffee was brought in a basin, but I did not examine that—the milk was curdled, which might be produced by oxalic acid or any other acid—I believe there was acid in the coffee.</p>

I will give it to you for this"—I heard no answer given to that—he repeated it twice—I was sitting up in the bed, because there was a noise all the time—I heard the deceased make a strange <hi rend="italic">wheezing</hi> noise—I never heard her speak at all—it was a noise as though she was pressed, and had not the power to halloo—I heard something fall on the floor, and after that I heard a lump like a body falling on the floor, and I heard the prisoner say, "Mary, my dear, what is the matter with you?"—I heard no reply to that, I only heard a groan—the prisoner came out on the landing, and said, "Will any female come to my wife? she is very ill"—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Grey-coat-place, Horseferry-road. I was called in on the morning of Sunday, the 5th of Jan., to the house in Peter-street—I went along with the prisoner—I saw the deceased on the floor there—she was dead, but warm—I made in<lb/>quiries as to who was present at the time she got on the floor—I was referred to the prisoner for an answer—I asked him how she came on the</p>

               <p>floor, and somebody answered me that she fell on the floor—I cannot tell who that was—I asked the prisoner how she lay in the bed—he said on the further side of the bed, next to the wall—I asked him how she could fall out there—he said he helped her out for a natural purpose—I lifted her up, and passed my hand over the head, throat, and chest—I did not per<lb/>ceive any mark of injury—a noise ensued between the prisoner and some females in the room as to whether he had his clothes on or not at the time—I then left the room—I saw the prisoner again on the Monday morning—he called on me—he was very violent in temper respecting the female who had gone and demanded an inquest—I told him to leave her alone, or he would go to Queen-square—he said that he had only just got into the room at the time of his wife's death—I was sent for to attend at the inquest on the Tuesday evening, and, by the direction of Mr. Higgs, the Coroner, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the body on the Wednesday—Mr. Payne, a medical student, was present at the time—I first looked over the surface of the woman—I found a mark of injury on the skin of the loins—I could not consider that to be any evidence of violence—it was more like the nature of an accident, from the situation of it—I could not discover any other external indication of violence—I opened the chest—I found that she had got a long-standing disease of the heart—there was a dilatation of the right side of the heart, and I found the vessels of the brain extremely congested—with those exceptions, the other essential parts appeared per<lb/>fectly healthy—the immediate cause of death was congestion of the brain—the brain had been previously healthy—the stomach and bowels were healthy, and empty—she was in the first month of her pregnancy.</p>

               <p>the 19th of Jan., I went into a public-home opposite St. Andrew's church, Holborn, a few minutes before twelve o'clock, and had some wine—the prisoner, who was there, solicited me to treat her with a glass of gin—she followed me up Holborn close behind, at my elbow, and kept asking me to treat her, and in turning up Gray's Inn-lane she was more pressing than before—I said if I was so disposed it was too late—she said she could get it at any hour at a gin-shop down the court there, and asked me to go in that direction—I did so, and at the farther end of the court is a dark passage—she immediately turned round, and said, "Come on," was not I going to have a glass of gin—I expressed a desire to return, but she immediately put one hand into my right hand waistcoat pocket, and thrust her other hand forcibly into my fob, and extracted from it a small paper parcel well bound round with thread containing eight sovereigns—it was done momentarily—I had put them into the parcel at twenty minutes past nine that night—I immediately accused her of robbing me, and got hold of her hand containing the parcel by the wrist—she made no answer till I repeated the charge, and at that same moment my hat was knocked off my head—I turned to the left, and taw I had a man to contend with—he put his right hand behind me, and the prisoner dropped the parcel containing the sovereigns into his open hand, which was beyond my elbow, so that I could see it—I still held the prisoner by the wrist—she said something to the man in a language I did not understand—I immediately collared him, at the same time holding the prisoner with my right hand—I called "Police" repeatedly—nobody came at the moment, but five other men came from the opposite side of the court the instant I hallooed, and commenced a furious attack on me with their fists right and left, and succeeded in libe<lb/>rating the two prisoners from me—the prisoner said something to the men which I did not understand, and they immediately set off running out of sight—she followed them, and I followed her—a policeman came and took her at the turn of the court—at the station I missed my pocket-book from my inside coat pocket.</p>

J. <hi rend="smallCaps">BOLTING</hi>."—Bolting was a customer of ours—we inquired of Ashley whether it was intended to be stoves or metal unmanufactured, as Mr. Bolting always had metal, not stoves, fitted—he said he would go back and inquire—he did so, and in about three hours returned, saying they were to be stoves—at that time he said Bolting's lad would come and sign for the three stoves—I did not see the other prisoner outside—the stoves were delivered to Ashley—he did not sign the book himself, but said Bolting's lad would come in and sign for them—Allen came in while I was talking to Ashley—he signed the book in my presence, and both went away with the stoves in a truck—I have the book here—my fellow clerk wrote the body of the receipt in ray presence—it is signed "Wm.

                  </hi>. I live at No. 6 1/2, Bowling-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone. I am the housekeeper—on Sunday morning, the 12th of Jan., about half-past four o'clock, I came down stairs, and discovered two of my bird-cages had been taken off the nails on which they hung, in the shop where they usually were, and were standing on the table, and the birds were gone—I also missed a bird-cage, and when I came to look round, I found that my till had been opened, and about a pound's worth of copper money gone—it consisted of halfpence and farthings—I had locked it myself about ten o'clock the night before, just before I went to bed—the door between the dairy and shop was open—that was fastened the night before—it was locked I believe, but I am not positively certain—I know it was closed and shut, and I believe it was locked inside—we generally lock it inside—that opens into the dairy—there is a door that opens out of the dairy into the yard—I found that door ajar—I saw it shut at ten o'clock over night, but not fastened, only on the latch—I know the prisoners—Settle lived about four doors off in the next street—about two o'clock on the Sunday afternoon, I saw Mrs. Palmer, the mother of Palmer—I went with her to her house in North-street—I found a box there, and in it I found my birds, and the cage that was taken—I found six birds in it—I firmly believe them to be mine—I can positively swear to the cage—this now produced is it.</p>

On Sunday, the 12th of Jan., the prisoners came to me with another boy, named Spencer—I knew Spencer and Palmer—they had two canaries in a cage, and asked if I would buy them—I would not—Settle asked me if I would buy seven cock canary birds that he had got at home—I said I would if he would bring them—he said he would bring them on the Sunday following—he did not come—the policeman came, and I gave him information of what had passed—on that same Sunday I met the two prisoners about two o'clock in the afternoon—I spoke to them, and Settle ran away—I informed Palmer what had happened—he said he knew all about it, that the birds were at his mother's, and he told me to go and tell his mother to take them back—he said at the same time that he did not know they were stolen—I went to his mother's, and saw her—I should not have known where the birds were if Palmer had not told me that—I afterwards told Palmer what had passed between his mother and me—Settle was with him—I told him I had told his mother to take the birds home—he said he was very glad of it—I asked Settle about it—he said it was him that did the robbery—that he got in at a window at the back of the premises, that he reached through the panel of the window, got the key out, opened the door with it, walked in, and took 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Palmer was by at the time—he said to Settle, "You have got me into a nice trouble"—Settle replied, "Oh, I won't get you into trouble, I will go and give myself up."</p>

                  </hi>. In 1837 I was a farmer at Ruislip, and still. I had a boy named John Brill, in my service in 1837—on Thurs<lb/>day, the 16th of Feb., I went to Uxbridge market—I saw Brill before I went—I had a wood belonging to my farm, called the Young wood—it was in my occupation—about half-past nine o'clock in the morning I sent Brill with three cows into the meadow, with a bill and a glove to fill up the gaps in the meadow, in the path leading to my house, and then to go into the Young wood, to watch the wood, that the underwood should not be stolen—it had been cut a few days before—I told him to watch the wood till towards one o'clock—I told him if any one came to cut it, to let them cut it, and take what they thought proper, as long as he got near enough</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030050"/>
               <p>to see who they were, for I thought it would not be a stranger—he dined at my house of a day at one o'clock—he was to go home to his dinner at one at my house—as I was going to market, in con<lb/>sequence of something I heard at the Six Bells, I went to the meadow to see after the boy—I found him at his work in the meadow where I had sent him, filling up the gaps—I should say that was about half-past ten in the morning—I never saw him after that alive—he was then in good health—he was fifteen years of age—I returned from market at three—I used to return at any time I could get my business settled—the boy ought to have been at my gate on my return to let me in—it was his habit to let me in—he was not at the gate—I thought it very strange that he was not there, and I directly went into the wood to search for him—I was alone then—I could not find him—there are four woods, the whole of them making 132 acres—three of them are about an equal size—one is a very small one, about six acres—there was a good deal of underwood in the wood—he was only to watch the Young wood—it is standing, growing wood—I could not find anything of him on the Thursday, and came home—I directly went to his father, who came directly, and he, and me, and another man, went into the wood to search for him again—we continued searching the wood till between nine and ten—it had been dark a long time then—we searched for hours after dark, but could not find him—we searched again on Friday morning as soon as it grew light, but did not find him—there was no search on the Saturday—I proceeded to search again on the Sunday—I cannot tell the names of the persons who were with me—Lavender was one of them, and the boy's father—we began to search at half-past eleven—we had not been search<lb/>ing more than half an hour when Lavender cried out, "Murder here!"—I went to the spot, and found the boy lying on his back in the wood—it was a very thick, high place, high standing wood—it was all leaves and moss where he laid—it was a soft place—he was dead—I saw that his front teeth were knocked out—the glove was lying at his feet, and the bill too—his cap hung on a bush close to him, about four feet from the ground—there was a bough hanging over his head, belonging to a small tree that stood at a distance from him, but the branch hung over him—the body of the tree, was, I should say, six feet from him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any recollection of the thickness of the bough, so as to form any judgment whether the boy might have fallen from it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not bear him—it was about ten feet from the ground—the ground on which he lay was soft—Lavender lifted up the body—I saw the blood running from his ear—the boy was taken away to the Six Bells, on Ruislip-common—I went into the wood again about ten on Monday morning—I saw there had been some underwood cut in the wood, between twenty and thirty yards from where I found the body.</p>

                  </hi> I live in the parish of Ruislip.

Q.</hi> Then you have never seen the ground at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not speak with certainty as to the weapon which produced the injuries, I only say it must have been a weapon with a flat surface—the bruise extended over the left temple, and the whole of the left ear—I cannot state its circumference—perhaps four or five inches—it extended over the entire ear—the weapon must have been applied sideways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a portion of the ground to have been bare, instead of having moss and leaves on it, and, as we have been told by one of the witnesses, it was a very fine dry day, in your opinion might not a very violent fall from the tree above have produced the appearances you saw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not, from the position of the blow—if he had fallen from a tree, he would have fallen on the top of his head—there is every probability of it—the gentleman who took the principal part in this examination was my junior, he was not my assistant—he did take the principal part in the examination, and was the person who was examined on the former occasion—I heard him examined—I did not hear him state a very different opinion to mine—I heard him state that either a blow or fall would have produced the same consequences, as to the internal portions—I did not hear him say that, in bis opinion, the blow was caused by a stick—to the best of my recollection, his evidence was, that it was done by a flat instrument—I do not deny that it might have been a stick—I say it was a flat instrument—a fall would not have produced the external appearances, and, to have produced internal symptoms of that sort, he must have fallen on the top of his head, and on hard ground, not on soft ground—it gene<lb/>rally happens that when we find much extravasation or congestion on one side of the brain, that it is the result of a violent blow on the other side of the head—I found that the extravasation and congestion were principally on the right side of the head—I should certainly not have expected to find that the case if he had fallen on the top of his head.</p>

I know the prisoner, and have done so rather better than twelve months—during that time I have not been living with him anywhere—I have been living at Harefield—he lived at Harefield also, 300 or 400 yards from me—I have come to-day from the House of Correction—I have been intimate with the prisoner at times during the last twelve months—I was out with him about four months ago—we were on the hide and seek, because we would not come to the House of Correction—we had done a deed we should not have done—we had been out poaching together, and were at hide and seek to avoid the officers—about a fortnight before I was taken to prison we were coming from Rickmansworth to Harefield, about five or six o'clock in the afternoon—we were talking about how soon we could get into trouble, but we could not get out of it again very soon—I said, "No, we cannot"—he said, "I have heard that the House of Correction is a bad prison; you have been, how is it?"—I said, "Of course it is bad enough"—he said, "I would sooner be taken for my murder than I would go there"—Murder!" I said—"Yes," he said;" I went to get a bundle of wood in Mr. Churchill's wood, and a boy came round the wood, by the name of John Brill, and he saw me, and he came up to me, and I took and struck him and knocked him down; so I stood a few minutes, and I hung his cap up in the bushes, and his bill and his cuff I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> down aside of him, making believe as if he had tumbled out of a tree—now," he lays, "there is no one knows of it but you and me, and if I happen to hear that you tell any one, I will kill you"—we were walking along the road together at the time—I was taken up, I believe, about seven or eight weeks after this conversation, but I cannot rightly say—I have been in prison ten weeks—the prisoner and I were not living together all that time—I did not go to Harefield—he did—I stopped by Woodcock-hill—I left him by Woodcock-hill—I was taken to prison for the poaching—he was taken before me—I mentioned about this, about three weeks after I got to prison—I made a communication to the yardsman or turnkey—I was in the House of Correction, Coldbath-fields—the prisoner and I were confined in the same ward—I never had any quarrel or difference with the prisoner—I cannot recollect the name of the wardsman—Mr. Hoare was one that I spoke to—he is the head wardsman—the yardsman told some-body, and then I repeated it—I told some of it that night, and next morn<lb/>ing I told all of it—I was examined by a Magistrate in the gaol next morning—I remember being brought face to face with the prisoner—that might be a month after I first communicated it to the wardsman—I was afraid to mention it before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if you were afraid of mentioning it before, how came you to mention it when you got into prison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why I thought as we were both in there together, if I told them, that somebody would get hold of him, as I should not be hurt—there was another reason why I then mentioned it—I had such dreams, and could not sleep.</p>

               <p>my lifetime—Harcfield is two miles, or two miles and a half from the wood where the boy met his death—I knew John Brill, and I know Mr. Churchill—I am married, and have been so six years—I have lived with my wife during the whole of that time—I have been four times in gaol—I had two calendar months at St. Alban's for fishing, and three weeks twice, for fishing, and six months for poaching—I have not been taken before a Magistrate on other charges—I have never been before a Magis<lb/>trate but on those four occasions—yes, I was once had up for half a sor<lb/>reign, but nobody appeared against me—a man named George Tebbald <hi rend="italic">lost a half-sovereign, and charged me with stealing it at a public-house</hi>, and after that he had it cried—I was not before a Magistrate any othet time, I am quite sure—that is all—I do not know what my wife did for a living while I was in gaol—I do not know that when I was out of gaol she was leading the life of a common prostitute—she has not, over and over again, told me that I lived on her prostitution—I got my living by hard work—I was not at work all the year round—I was out of work sometimes a month, sometimes a week, or a fortnight, and sometimes two months—I have been as much as three months at a time out of work.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you live on during that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I went to my father and mother—I did not live all upon them; I supported myself by jobbing about, doing little jobs, digging gardens up, and doing work for the people about the town and other places, for my father for one—he is a labouring man—he gets 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he is a farmer's labourer—I do not say he has 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. all the year round—I think he gets 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the winter—he has eight children at home—the youngest is five or six years old.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, if you had those dreams before you went to prison, and knew that the prisoner was in prison, and could not hurt you, why did not you tell your story then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I thought that he had told some one out, whilst he was in prison, and if I told whilst he was in prison, they would get hold of me, and hurt me for telling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mechanical engineer. At the time of this robbery I lodged at the prisoner's house, No. 24, Charles St. Stepney—I rented one room of him—on Monday, the 6th of Jan., my wife and I were out—I went out about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and returned about a quarter past nine at night—I found my room door burst open, the bolt of the lock was about half an inch out, the bed was tumbled, the drawers broken open, and the lower drawer was on the ground, and things which had been in the drawers were distributed about the room—I missed the articles stated in the indictment—my wife went in next door to get a light, and the landlord and landlady of the Rose and Crown came in—immediately I saw what state the place was in I ran round to the pri<lb/>soner's sister's, where his mother resides, and where the prisoner sleeps—he has not slept in the house since I have been there, which is between four and five months—I did not find him at his sister's—I then went to the Thames-police station, and gave information of the robbery—two or three policemen came back with me—the prisoner's mother came in soon after—the prisoner came home about eleven o'clock—he said it was a bad job—I said it was, for I had lost a great many things, I was afraid every thing, but I did not know what at present—I said, "You had better go and see what you have lost"—he said, "Oh, I have nothing of any consequence to lose"—I said, "I think I have lost all I have got"—he did not go into his room that night in my presence—his mother did—he went away without going to his room—next morning he came again, between eight and nine o'clock—I said to him, "Well, have you made out an inventory of anything you have lost"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I have made mine out, and taken it to the police station; what have you lost?"—he said, "Two or three coats"—I had found his room door open as well as mine—he went down stairs, and I went out to my duty—I returned in about two hours, and saw the prisoner in the passage—he opened the door to me, I believe—Mountford,</p>

               <p>the policeman, was with him—Mountford said that Mr. Tofield had told him he had lost sixteen sovereigns—I said it was a bad job then—I went up stairs, and saw Sergeant Graves talking to my wife—we went down, and Graves asked Tofield what he had lost—he said sixteen sovereigns—Graves said he should like to see where he had put the sixteen sovereigns in the room—at first he objected to let the Sergeant go into the room, for the room had been searched two hours before, and he did not think there was any necessity for it—he mumbled something in a low tone, opened the door, and me and my wife, Mountford, and Graves, went in—as soon as I went in I saw a pair of my trowsers part on one chair and part on another—I took hold of them, and said, "My God!" or "Good God! why, these are my trowsers"—I could swear to them—they were part of what I lost—when I left on Monday morning they were on a chair by my bedside—the prisoner was present when I found them, and he said, "Then you or Mrs. Morgan must have put them there"—we could not get into his room, his door was locked—I had not put them there—I never saw them after they were missed till then—Graves said to him, "Have you any objection to go to the station-house to give an account of these trowsers?"—he said, "No, not at all," and he went—Graves said, "Mind, you are not in custody, you go of your own free will"—he was asked about the trowsers, and said he did not put them there—the inquiry dropped that day—I did not give him into custody till the Thursday—I did not know that I was justified in doing so till I saw the officer, who had searched the room two hours before, on the overnight—I have never found the rest of the things.</p>

I forget which, "here are my trowsers"—the prisoner directly said, "Then you must have brought them down," or, "You must have placed them in the room"—before we went in the door was locked—the prisoner had the key, and unlocked the door to let us in.</p>

On Monday afternoon I was in Portman-market, standing over the other side of Mrs. Stevens's, not very far from Mrs. Rowghans' shop door, about as far as across this Court—I saw Medhurst and Self with a bit of iron—Medhurst took it from Self, and put it into the lock, and broke it open—Self was helping at the time—as soon as the lock was broken the door was opened, and Self and Burke ran in and took some oranges—Medhurst also went in, and took some oranges—I informed somebody of what I had seen—Med<lb/>hurst was taken up by a boy named Shelley—he had some oranges in hit pocket at the time, and the padlock—I picked up the iron—I saw Cannell there, but did not see him do anything—he was standing there at the time the shop was broken open—I did not see him go into the shop—some oranges were thrown out to him, and he picked some up.</p>

You are soon back from France"—he said he had not been—I said I came to inquire about a silk dress—he said, "Me lost a pin in your house, if you give me pin I will tell you about the silk"—I think there has been a deal of undermining work through the whole piece—there were two witnesses bribed to keep away, and a woman has been brought up to say anything against me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the London Docks. Between the Western and Eastern Docks there is a small dock, called the Tobacco Dock—between the Western Dock and the Tobacco Dock there is a bridge—a person standing on it can see a shed which is near the Eastern-quay warehouse—there are two cranes near the shed—the roof of the shed is not so high as the warehouse—a person by the cranes could get on the roof of the shed, and then to the top of the warehouse—the eastern side of the Eastern-quay warehouse is bounded by Bird-street, and the wall of the warehouse on the Bird-street side is very steep, and is thirty-five feet high—in going over the roof of the shed to the top of the warehouse there are several lanterns—my attention hat been called to two of them in particular—they shut with a swing sash, which is fastened by a cord—&amp; person out<lb/>side, by cutting the cord, could get into the warehouse, and they can cut the cord outside—Bird-street and Tent-street meet, and form a right angle near the East-quay warehouse, and there is in that angle a privy, the dome of which is fifteen feet high, and the top of the wall of the Eatt-quay ware-house is ten feet above that—a person could easily get down there by means of a rope or line—there is a lantern on the top there—opposite that there is Johnson-street, which is at right angles with Bird-street—on Saturday morning, the 4th of Dec, I went on the roof of the warehouse, between four and five o'clock—I looked at several of the lantern—I did not find that the cord of any of them was cut then, but between nine and ten I found that a cord of one of them was cut, and near to it I found tome lucifer-matches, some of which appeared to have been tried to be ignited—there was another lantern nearer to Tent-street opposite Johnson-street, the cord of which had been cut—I found some small pieces of leaf tobacco on the roof, in a direction from the lantern which I found open nearest to Tent-street—they had carried the tobacco from there to the light opposite Johnson-street—I went to the angle formed by Bird-street and Tent-street, and found an iron hook fastened in the wall, under the cap-stone—this is the took, and this thimble and rope were attached to it, and the thimble was lying over the edge of the cap-stone, towards the street—I could per<lb/>ceive a cord had been drawn through it, and there were marks on the cap<lb/>itone of the rope having been drawn over that—I examined the tobacco warehouse, and found one hogshead of tobacco, with the head out lying almost immediately under the lantern nearest to Tent-street.</p>

On Friday evening, the 3rd of Jan., about eight o'clock, or a few minutes after, I saw Cantelo on the top stairs—there was a man with him, and they were trying the top door—after they tried the door I came out of my rcom, and Cantelo asked if I would lend him my key—he said his sister, or the woman, had given him a wrong key—I said "You can have my key, but I do not know that it will open the door"—I gave him my key—I held the candle in my other hand—he opened the door, and they went into the room—Cantelo came and returned me my key—they remained in the room a little time, and then went down stairs—I was at home the following morning, when Hurley was taken—during the night I had heard footsteps going up and down continually to that room over my head—on the following morning three men came up the stairs as I stood at my door, talking to Nash—they said, as they passed up, "We will go and see how the fire goes on"—I said, as they passed, u That is the man I gave the key to," meaning Cantelo, who was one of them—I think Johnson was one of the others—I do not know which of them spoke about the fire.</p>

At half-past twelve at night, on the 3rd of Jan., I was at the window, and saw two men standing at the corner of Johnson-street and Bird-street—they stood there about five minutes, and then went away—about two o'clock in the morning I saw two men come from No. 3, Johnson-street, which is next door but two—they went towards the dock wall, and were joined by a man and a woman near the wall—I told my uncle—he and I went down after the men, but they were gone—about three o'clock I heard a noise like something falling from the dock wall in Bird-street, at the bottom of Johnson-street—I looked in the direction where something had fallen, and saw a female come from Bird-street and go into No. 3, Johnson-street, and directly after I saw a man go into No. 3—he had something with him—I saw two other men go in there—I did not see any one come out.</p>

I don't deny taking the room for the purpose of placing my wife and children in it; but I could not have a room without a stove, and I did not occupy it. I did not know what key I had when I was taken, nor know I had any; it might have been the key of the room I was living in. As to Riley having known me a length of time, it is doubtful whether he knew me at all; I have seen him often, but be never spoke to me, and if he had known me as a suspicious character, why has he not spoken to me? he asked the policeman which was Clark, and then he said he had known me, and the same with Hurley; I am satisfied he did not know Hurley; he said he saw us on the bridge on Thursday, and I have a witness who was with me on Thursday afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother, Lucy Eliza Mackey, at St. Leonard's. She had a house at No. 47, Baker-street, which the pri<lb/>soner's mother had charge of at different times—she gave up possession on the 8th of June, 1840—in consequence of another robbery which took place in Sept., 1841, we missed a variety of articles which had principally been kept in a cheffonier at the house in Baker-street—they were not dis<lb/>covered to be missing till Sept., 1841—we then missed the property now discovered—I recollect the cheffonier perfectly well—it had remained un<lb/>searched from June, 1840, till Sept., 1841—the house had been let part of the time, and another party had been put in charge of it—the cheffonier was in the drawing-room, locked up, and to the best of my belief the principal part of these things were safe in it when the prisoner's mother had charge of the house—this gold seal, set with diamonds and emeralds, is my mother's—this opera-glass this gold-mounted snuff-box, and ivory fan, are my mother's—this necklace, these two miniatures, and some other articles, are my own—all the articles which were in the cheffonier are now present, but some which were in the house are still missing—this minia<lb/>ture was missed in June, 1840, but I was not confident whether it had been taken out of town or not, till I went into the country, and not find<lb/>ing it there, I knew it was missing—I am sure it had been in the cheffonier—the property which was missed in 1841, was traced to some pawn<lb/>broker's, but that had nothing to do with this property or this party—I only knew the prisoner as the daughter of the woman who had charge of the house—I never noticed anything particular about her—I supposed in 1841, that these articles had gone the same way that the other things had.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister-at-law; I have chambers at No. 2, Middle Temple-lane, and sleep there; it is very near to Fleet-street, just below the stationer's-shop. On Sunday evening, the 12th of Jan. I was tired, having taken a long walk, and went to bed earlier than usual, at a few minutes after nine o'clock—I had distinctly heard the clock strike</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030094"/>
               <p>nine before I went to bed—my chambers are on the first landing-place, fifteen steps from the bottom—there is an outer door to my chambers, which opens outwards, and fastens with a latch-key, and immediately in<lb/>side that an inner door, which opens inwards—I locked the outer door before I went to bed, and went again to see that it was fastened—these two doors open into a lobby—there are folding-doors which open from my bed-room into the sitting-room, and they were quite open—the outer door, which was locked, is easily opened—this is the key which opens it—after I had been in bed ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I heard a noise at the outer door, as of some one trying the lock—no suspicion passed my mind, for, having been out of town the previous evening, I thought it pro<lb/>bable my laundress was coming to see that the fires were laid, or to bring something for me the next day—I listened, and presently the outer door opened—I then heard the inner door open—there is no lock on that; still no suspicion crossed my mind, it being so early in the evening—I then heard in the lobby, which is on the same level with my bed-room, a rust<lb/>ling noise—supposing it was the laundress, I called her name, Mrs. Bant<lb/>ing—no answer being made, I instantly concluded it was some person attempting to come in improperly—I jumped out of bed, crying, "Stop thief!"—I went through the door at the bottom of my bed, so that I had no turning to make—I rushed through the doors, which were all open, and followed the noise of persons whom I heard going down the stairs, hallooing at the top of my voice all the way down, not having stopped for a second to put on my slippers or anything—my impression was that there was more than one person—at the bottom of the staircase is a lamp—I turned my eyes towards Fleet-street gate, and it was shut—it is always shut on Sun<lb/>days—I stood at the bottom of the stairs till Mr. Gingell and Mr. Green both came up—I am confident that no person could have gone out at the Fleet-street gate without my seeing them—the prisoners were brought back in a short time into my chambers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman of the Middle Temple. On Sunday night, the 12th of Jan., I was on duty in Brick-court, which forms part of Middle Temple-lane—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," about a quarter-past nine—I am quite sure it was after nine—the cry proceeded from the top of the lane near Temple-bar—I looked up the lane and saw two persons running down the lane towards me, from the top of Temple-lane—I went across Brick-court to meet them—in coming along there are two lamps—in crossing I got near to them, and could see them plainly—they went across Brick-court into Essex-court—along the top passage, from Essex-court to another passage into New-court (there is in New-court a small wicket-gate which opens into Devereux-court, which a per<lb/>son might get out at if it were open—it is open on Sunday morning till eleven, but it is shut afterwards—it was then locked, and no person could get out) I followed them to the end of the passage, and saw them returning from the gate—knowing they could not get out, I came back to Middle Temple-lane, and went round by the Hall into Garden-court, where I saw the prisoners coming up the steps, walking separately, one on one side, the other on the other—I laid hold of both of them—I can swear that they are the boys I saw come down Middle Temple-lane, and whom I had been chasing—the prisoner George had an open collar on, the same as he has now—Haddon, another watchman, was with me—he went through the lower passage into Brick-court—Gingell, the head-por<lb/>ter,</p>

The prisoner was in my service—I directed my wife to look after him—I marked ten or twelve penny pieces, and some other money, and on the Sunday morning, previous to the prisoner's leaving to go home, I asked how he was situated for money, whether he had any—he said he believed he had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he was not aware that he had more—I asked if he had any copper money—he said, "Not a halfpenny?"—I said he must turn out his pockets to satisfy me—he turned out six sixpences and the other money stated in the indictment—part of it was marked, and I know it was mine—this cork-screw was found on him—he heard me ask for it on Saturday night.</p>

About five o'clock in the afternoon of the 4th of Feb., the prisoners came into the shop together, and asked for bonnet-ribbons—I showed them some—they said we had none to suit them, they wanted black satin with stripes, and we had not one of that sort—Smith then went outside to see what sort we had, and I went with her—she did not point to any, and came in again—I had, before she went out, seen Davis take a ribbon from a drawer I had on the counter, and put it under her shawl, and when I came in again I told a young man that she had it—she said she had not—I said, "If you have not got the piece of ribbon, you have given it to the other girl"—Smith then said, "If you don't give us in charge, I will tell you where it is"—Smith after<lb/>wards gave it up from under her shawl—this is the ribbon—it is my master's.</p>

                  </hi>. I carried on business as a grocer, in Narrow<lb/>I street, Limehouse, last year—I gave up my business, and am at present residing with my son, who is a grocer, in Cannon-street-road—in Feb. last year I was acquainted with a person named William Sprigging, of Water<lb/>loo-terrace, Commercial-road—I have known him some time—he applied to me about raising the sum of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I suggested that I could obtain it from the St. Pancras Loan Society—he proposed that I should apply for it, and he become security, as he was in better circumstances—I went to the King's Arms, in John-street, Bedford-row, and made application—I saw Mr. Tyhverly there, in the office up stairs—he belongs to the Society—I saw Mr. Potter—I have seen another party there—I was there on the 20th of Feb.—I did not see the note in question on that occasion, not till the 21st—the sureties had all signed, the last signed on the 20th, but I did not—Tuesday the 20th was the regular day of meeting—they told me I was too late then, and it was suggested I should go on the following night, sign the note, and receive the money—I went and signed it on the evening of the 21st, in the bar parlour, at the back of the bar, in the King's Arms, not in the office—Mr. Tyhverly and Mr. Potter only were present when I signed it—20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced to me on that occasion—something was said about ray coming down there specially, and having something to drink at my expense, and I handed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Tyhverly, one of which he banded over to Potter—a few days after I received the balance, after deducting the common interest and expenses—I think that was rather less than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the money was to be repaid by weekly instalments—that was the understand<lb/>ing—the half of it was paid so.</p>

               <p>I went to Cannon-street-road with my son—lie is about twenty-five years of age—he was not apprenticed to me, but to a Mr. Jones, a dentist at Canterbury—he gave up his apprenticeship in his twenty-first year—he staid his time—he then came to London—he did not set up for himself—he came to my shop in Narrow-street soon afterwards—he was in practice in his own business occasionally before that—he used to do part of his work at home—I do not know exactly where he did the other part, at different workshops of mechanical business—he continued to carry on his profession of a dentist up to the time I left Narrow-street—he had no fortune left him—I was in bad circumstances—he was to pay 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for the house in Cannon-street-road—he purchased the stock of different tradespeople—one was Broorme and Co., grocers, of Lawrence Pountney-hill—they gave him credit, not me—I did not go for the goods—I will swear that, or apply for them—their traveller called on my son, and he gave the order—it was the traveller from that house—it was not the traveller I had employed when in Narrow-street—I knew nothing at all about it—Mr. Dean, of Tower-street, was another—I knew him—he supplied me, when in Narrow-street, in two instances, not the whole time—there were several others—there was Mr. Hopkinson, the tallow<lb/>maker—I was an old customer of his.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell me anybody else with whom you or your son dealt that you were not an old customer of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was Mr. Wing, of East-street, I never dealt with—I think that is the only one besides Broome's—my son purchased several of his household things—one part of my furniture he was obliged to buy under an execution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did he get the money from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh money he has always had from his boyhood up—his mother, from his early youth, saved money for him, up to the time of his apprenticeship—she had 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year of her own—she died six or seven years ago—my son did not take this business till Sept. last—he did not keep the money at any bankers—some was in the Savings' Bank—his mother made no will.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now you say you borrowed this money as a principal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—cannot say whether I told the society it was for Spriggins—I think I said the money was for myself, and that Spriggins, my former security, would be my security again; I do not recollect exactly; I dare say it was so; I rather think I told the secretary that I was borrowing the money for Spriggins—I do not know that I told anybody but him at that time—I did not pay back the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Spriggins did—it was paid back on my ac<lb/>count,</p>

               <p>and then I did not pay any more—an action was then brought against me—that went on to execution—I pleaded the general issue—when the execution came to the house in Cannon-street-road, my son gave notice to the sheriff that the goods were his, not mine, and the execution was withdrawn—nothing has been paid since, I believe—my son set up in Cannon-street-road in Sept.—it was in the early part of Sept. that he took the house—he set up business on the 25th—Spriggins is not here, to my knowledge, nor Adams; White is here I believe—the society objected to Adams as a security in the first instance, and required a third, namely, White—they would not advance the money without another security—I carried on business in Narrow-street up to the end of Sept., or the early part of Oct.—I think it was in the early part of Oct. that I disposed of the business to Mr. Perry—I did not remain till the end of Oct—it must have been the end of Sept, or the beginning of Oct., that I left, that would be it—my son had not set up at the new place before I had done with the old—he set up about the 25th of Sept—he was there before me—I think I finished at Narrow-street in Sept.—I gave up my business to Mr. Perry, and then went and lived with my son—I am wrong about Oct.; it was in Sept., not in Oct., that I left Narrow-street—I then went to Cannon-street-road, where 1 acted in the business similarly to what I had been acting in the business in Narrow-street—my son printed 4000 bills—I did not send out circulars to my customers, announcing that I had given up business, and that my son had began—I did not employ any attorney in the action; I pleaded in my own name and person—I pleaded that 1 did not make the promissory note set out in the declaration, and that I was not indebted to the society—I pleaded that I did not owe; that is similar—it was true that I had signed the note, though I pleaded 1 had not—it was not true that I was indebted to them the balance of the money—I did not owe the money myself; Mr. Spriggins owed the money—I knew I was liable for it—Spriggins said he would pay the money, but he would wait the end of the action—Spriggins is still in the Commercial-road—I had borrowed the money, and Spriggins had paid half of it back—the society has received only half—I believed Spriggins to be in better credit than myself—he is very well off—I have not sued him for this money—I ex<lb/>pected the society would have sued him, but they did not; they never called upon him—it is the sureties generally they look to—Spriggins said he would be here—he is a tobacconist—he had all the money—I paid it to him.</p>

I was secretary to the St. Pancras Loan Society for four years, or somewhere thereabouts—I have been with them altogether six years—I remember in February last year Mr. Watt making application for a loan of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we meet on Monday nights for some part of the business—none of the parties signed this note on the Monday night—on the Tuesday night, I believe, two of them signed—one of them signed—Mr. Adams signed at the so<lb/>ciety—the others signed at their own houses, I cannot tell when—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the note</hi>)—this is my dating—Mr. Watt came on the Tuesday after making the application, the 20th—he came too late for receiving any money that night—three others had already signed the bill on the 20th—there was Sprigging, of the Commercial-road, Waterloo-place, I believe it is called, I saw him sign at his own house; Mr. White, a carpenter, in Hoxton, he signed at hit own house, I saw him; the third was Mr. Adams, he signed at the society, on the 20th, I saw him sign it—it was after Adams had signed it that Mr. Watt came too late—an appointment was made for him to come on the following night—he said it would be of great use to him on the follow<lb/>ing morning—he came on the following night, Wednesday—that was not our regular night of meeting—when I came into the public-house he had just gone into the bar-parlour—that was not the place we usually occupied as the office—that is up stairs—Mr. Tyhverly was there—he is one of the partners of the Society, and the head one, I believe—Mr. Watt then signed his name to that bill—he had not signed it before—Mr. Challis, the landlord, was at the counter, but he never interfered—nobody was present but myself, Mr. Tyhverly, and Mr. Watt—Mr. Kennett was not present—he had nothing to do with it—the landlord was at the counter, minding his own business.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the counter command a view of the bar-parlour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, if you turn your back to it—the bar-parlour is just behind the counter—it is not in the same room, it is parted off—they open one into the other by a door—I should say a person at the counter could see what was going on in the bar parlour if he turned round to look.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it that White signed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The week previous to Adams's signing, at his own house at Hoxton—I really cannot tell the date, my books are away from me, or I could have told you exactly—it might have been on the 13th—there are two nights of meeting—sometimes there used to be a mistake, in signing at the bottom first—I cannot say ibout that, that is very often the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I understand you to say just now, that Mr. Watt came and said the money would be very useful to him next morn<lb/>ing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he would like to have it then, most decidedly—after he was too late he stood a few minutes, and said to Mr. Tyhverly it would be very useful to him in the morning, as he had to make a purchase; and Mr. Tyhverly said, "If you will come to-morrow night at seven o'clock," (<hi rend="italic">which he very often did, to oblige certain parties</hi>,) "you shall have the money"—Mr. Kennett used to put his name sometimes—he sometimes witnessed the signatures of parties—he is the brother of Mr. Kennett, the partner to Mr. Gregory—I was discharged from the society on the 1st of Oct., I believe—it has happened, that when there was business to be done at the society, I was not there, but was drunk elsewhere, but not so that I could not do the business—sometimes it was done the better for that—it has not haopened a good many times, I will swear that—I do not know how many you mean—it has happened a good many times—it has hap<lb/>pened, perhaps, a dozen times within six years—I do not know whether it has happened twenty times—I never kept any account of it—I should say it has not happened twenty times in 1844—I have kept no account of it—I will not swear it has not—I was insured in the Sun office—I took my policy to get money advanced on it—I did not get an advance of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at least I borrowed 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that was left as part security—I did not afterwards go to the Sun Fire-office, and represent that I had lost the policy—I never wrote them word so to my knowledge—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—this is mine—after I had got 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had depo<lb/>sited my policy with the Sun Fire-office as security, I represented to them in writing that I had lost the policy—I got another, and got more money advanced upon that—allow me to explain it—I borrowed 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of a Mr. Hodge, a postman, which I was to pay him back by instalments of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—in the first place, he took a per centage of 30 per cent., and out of that 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I have paid him 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which, if I had known I was going to be asked the question, I would bring his signature, when I paid him back 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. besides, after the 30 per cent, to make 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that policy was out in a week or two—I was very unfortunate, and went to Hodge, and said the policy was out such and such a day, I had the. letter from the office, and asked whether he would take it and pay it, for it was impossible I could, and it was a pity it should be lost—he said he should not do anything of the sort, that it was no use to him—I then asked Mr. Elliott if it was any use to him; and after considering two or three days, he gave me, I believe, about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and I had paid two years—now that is the history of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you have not explained the only part that wanted ex<lb/>planation, whether you made a false representation to the office that you had lost it, and applied for another? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why it was lost.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you represent that you could not find the policy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No more I could find it—I went down to Mr. Hodge for it—Mr. Elliott is the party that had it, because it should not be lost—I told Mr. Elliott that Mr. Hodge had it—I told him I left it with him—I do not know that I told him that Hodge had it—I told him I had depo<lb/>sited it, and the party would not pay for it, and whether it would be any use to him—that was what I told him—I think I got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Elliott, and he went and paid the policy himself—there was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for the policy for the year—I was not discharged from the society for having taken money of theirs that I had given no account of—allow me to hand you this letter—(<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>)—that will tell you different to that—that will speak to character for six years from the treasurer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why was not the business of signing this note, by the party who appeared to be the principal in it, conducted in the office up stairs, instead of the bar-parlour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was an extra night, and we never went up stairs on any business then, only on the two nights we had the room up stairs to conduct the business in—it was not occupied the whole of the week, only two nights, Monday and Tuesday, from seven till nine o'clock—we always get the sureties on a note before the principal—when a person applies for money, he puts down 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., if it is for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the same as Mr. Watt did—he does not bring the note executed by the sureties—the note is detained by the treasurer, till he is quite satisfied that the securities are responsible persons—he would get all the sureties' names to the note, before the borrower's—(<hi rend="italic">The letter shown to the witness was here read; it was addressed to the managers of the Sun Life Insurance<lb/>office, informing them that he had assigned his policy, for</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">to William Eltiott, and stating, in a postscript, "the policy at present cannot be found; as soon as found, it will be forwarded to Mr. Elliott forthwith"</hi>)—the bar-par<lb/>lour is not the office for conducting the business on extra nights, only the treasurer and myself were in the habit of going in to sit down—there is business done there—the same two officers attend to conduct the business there, that ought to be conducted up stairs—for the pur<lb/>poses of the transaction it was the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Hodge refused to make the payment on this policy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, so that it would have been lost—when I went to Mr. Elliott I wrote that letter—that was the form I was to go through—Mr. Elliott told me, and therefore I did not scruple to do so—I was dismissed the service of the society on the 1st of Oct.—I have brought an action against Mr. Tyhverly, the treasurer, for remuneration for my services—he is the treasurer, and everything else—he is the proprietor—no charge was made against me of malversation in the accounts, embezzling the money, or anything of the kind—solely for inattention, as it appears lately.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the evening you saw this one of your drunken even<lb/>ings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am sure I cannot tell—I will undertake to swear I was not drunk, for I had been to Brompton-square, and left a gentleman there it twenty minutes past six—I came home by the omnibus, and ran home on purpose to oblige the man—I was not drunk before I went there—we do not do it that way—I went to wait on the gentleman—I got no refresh-ment there, nor on my way home—the omnibus did not stop any where—the gentleman I went to wait on was Mr. Frederick Metcalf, No. 58, Brompton-square—I believe it was on the 21st—it was the same evening, the Wednesday evening—Mr. Watt attended on the Tuesday evening in</p>

               <p>the hope of getting the money—he was very pressing to get it, and as<lb/>signed as a reason that he wanted it the following morning—he did not sign the note then—they do not often sign till they are going to have the money—the bill was in the office—he could not sign without it was taken out and given to him—Adams signed on the Tuesday, but not Mr. Watt, because he was not going to be paid that night—the bill was not presented to him at all to sign his name, as he was not going to be paid that night—that would be quite an unusual way of doing business—I am sure he did not have the money that night—there is no attesting wit<lb/>ness to Mr. Watt's signature—that is the case with a great many of these notes that my name is not to them, for some come from the country—I should not, if I had been sober, have put my name to it, not when there is one name—Mr. Kennett is the attesting witness to Mr. Adams—you might say he is the attesting witness to all these notes, when they were signed miles off from him—according to that he is the attesting witness to all the signatures on the note—I never saw marks pot on them before, not the marks that say which ones he attested—I never saw that before—they were not there when I saw the note—there was no mark to denote when he signs his name at the bottom, which of these he was witness to—I never saw them before—I never saw a bill done so—I never saw any on the bills in the office, where there is a line marked or drawn to say which was attested—I never saw these marks on this bill before to-day—I never looked at it, only the night Mr. Watt signed it, and they were not there then—if you look over fifty bills you will tee that Mr. Tyhverly has thought proper to go himself without my knowing I have attested, without seeing the signatures—I can swear which I did see signed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean you were in the habit of putting your signature as attesting witness to things you had never seen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When the notes were finished—you might see hundreds—I usually put ray name at the corner—that was not one of the reasons of my being dismissed—I do not know why I am dismissed—I am very glad it is a dismissal—I did not know it before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Great Russell-street, and am one of the proprietors and treasurer of the St. Pancras Loan Society. I remem<lb/>ber Mr. Watt applying for a loan of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about the 12th of Feb. last year—he proposed two sureties, Adams, who is here in Court, and Spriggins—our society meets on Monday and Tuesday evenings—he proposed the sureties through the late secretary, Potte—Potter proposed them in the week—on sureties being proposed, we institute some inquiries into their responsibility—I went with Potter to inquire into the respectibility of these sureties—at the meeting in the following week, Tuesday, the 20th, I remember Mr. Watt coming to ask for the money—Adams was with him—(Spriggins</p>

               <p>had signed the note before)—the business was conducted in the office, up stairs, on that occasion—I do not remember who was present when Adams and Watt came in—there were a great number her of persons there, perhaps—I was there—Mr. Watt asked for the money—I said no, we could not advance the money on those securities, that we must have another person—he said he could give me another, and he gave me the name of White—I then said to him, "As you have Mr. Adams here, you and Adams can join on the note; put your names on the note, to prevent Adams coming again;" and it was done—they both signed, and I desired Mr. Kennett to witness their signatures—he was in the office at the time, which he always was—occasionally he was absent—I am quite certain that Mr. Watt, as well as Mr. Adams, signed the note that night—Mr. Kennett was employed in the office—it was the usual course for Potter to witness the signatures—that was departed from, because he was not in the room, I suppose, or being intoxicated, which he often was, or some other thing—I requested Mr. Kennett to witness these signatures, or it would not have been done—I saw him witness them.</p>

               <p>time I called on him, since Christmas, I believe—I did not call on Adams or Spriggins, nor give directions that they should be sent to about Mr. Watt's signature, only to White—I swear I have not been to anybody but White before the action was tried, and after it was brought, to endeavour to prove Mr. Watt's signature—the money was paid to Mr. Watt, I be<lb/>lieve, on the 21st—I was there—he signed the bill on the Tuesday—I kept the bill after he had signed it—he had nothing to show then, and no money—that is usual—it happens so occasionally that the principal signs without getting the money, and leaves the bill in my hands, having nothing to show, when we want another security—we do so when we know who we are dealing with—I believe 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid to Mr. Watt—that sum was handed over to him at one time—I gave it to Mr. Potter, which I always did—he was to hand it over to Mr. Watt—I gave Potter 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Wednesday evening, the 21st—I do not know how many persons were present when Mr. Watt signed the bill—there are generally a great many persons present, sometimes a dozen, and sometimes two or three, as it happens—it is impossible for me to state whether there was a dozen on this occasion—I have no doubt there were some there—I was there, and two or three more persons might be there—I cannot recollect how many there might be in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Presland, and keep a shoemaker's shop at Stratford, in the parish of West Ham; My husband is very is, and has been so for some time. On Friday morning, the 10th of Jan., I was called down stairs by my son a little after seven o'clock in the morning—I found the show-room door open—the staple had been wrenched off—the door of the show-room opens into the passage, another door opens into the shop, and another into the sitting-room—a bureau that was standing in the show-room was broken open, and from it I missed from 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, more than 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of copper, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, and a check on Smith and Co. for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I also missed a great coat of my husband's, and a great coat of my son's—I went to the next room and found all the cupboards open—they were without locks—from them I missed nineteen silver spoons and a table-cloth—an old pair of spectacles, which laid on the table when I went to bed, were also gone, and many little things—on returning into the show-room I missed from twenty to thirty pairs of ladies' boots from ft glass-case—there was a pair of old kid gloves in my husband's coat pocket—I had put them in myself—I went to the back of the premises and found the parties had got in by boring a large hole with a centre-bit in the back door leading into the yard, big enough for my son to get through—the yard is surrounded by a paling—after getting in at the back door, they would be enabled to reach the other part of the premises, but not without wrenching the staple off—they could get into the other room because the key was in the door—I and my son saw the house safe over night at nearly eleven o'clock—the back door was then safe with two bolts and a chain, and there was no hole.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at Greenwich. On Mon<lb/>day evening, the 13th of Jan., I was near Blackheath-terrace, on the high-road, walking on the footpath, from Shooter's-hill to Greenwich, on the right hand side of the road—I was in the direct road that leads across the heath to the Green Man—I saw a wagon with three horses going in the same direction as myself, at a regular pace, walking—I saw the deceased standing on the left hand shaft—I could not see that he had any reins<lb/>there was a glimmering moonlight—the wagon was about the centre of the road, which is sufficiently wide for three carriages to go along easily—I observed the leading horses bearing to the right hand or off side of the road—at that time I saw a fly coming along, and it took the near side of the wagon—I was about five yards off the fly, abreast of the off hind wheel of the wagon—there was sufficient room for the fly to have passed on the off side of the wagon—the fly was going at a gentle trot, at the pace I have generally observed a fly go—I did not hear the driver call out before he went on the near side of the wagon—I was near enough to hear, and if he had called out very loud I must have heard him—the wagon continued going on—I heard the carman call out, and saw the horses turn towards the near side—at that time the wagon was between me and the fly, and I did not see what occurred—the wagon still went on—I lost sight of the fly—I could not tell whether the wagon went at the same pace as before, or whether the horses walked or went on faster—it was a covered wagon, which would hide the fly from me—I continued on my road, the wagon and fly being both ahead of me—when I got about sixty yards further I per<lb/>ceived something lying on the near side of the road—I went across, and found the deceased lying, with his face buried in the loose gravel stones—he had his carman's whip in his right hand—I stood by his side for a quarter of an hour—I could not get him to speak—at the end of that time I said, "Do you think you can rise if I assist you?"—he said, "Yes"—at the time I found him lying there I had lost sight of the wagon and fly—I asked him if he had been knocked down—he said, "Yes"—I said, "By a fly?"—he said, "Yes; where are my horses?"—I said, "It is Pearce's wagon, is it not?"—he said, "No; Davis's;" and that was the last word</p>

               <p>then ran to the yard to ask my husband if he had taken it, and during that time the prisoner contrived to tear a hole in the pillow-case, and put it in there—when I came back to the room I went to look again—I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the things that were in the cradle on the ground—the prisoner took up the pillow and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it on the ground, and said "There is something in the piliow, there is a hole here"—I put my hand in, and there I found the watch—I then told her to walk out of ray place directly—I swear that there was no hole in the pillow-case when I put the watch in the cradle—the pillow-case had the appearance of being torn down the seam part of it—it was made of calico—I missed a habit<lb/>shirt and a handkerchief—I asked the prisoner about them—she walked about the place, and said she had not got them—I saw her take the habit<lb/>shirt out of her bosom, and put it into the pot where the clean clothes were boiling on the fire, and she stirred it down with the stick—she had taken it from the dirty clothes where the woman was washing, but I did not see her do that—I found it in the pot—she had incurred the expense of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at my house—I had left this handkerchief in the parlour, and found it there.</p>

If I had been in the habit of using these things, I should have had a more secure place for them than the middle shelf of the cupboard, where anybody opening the door could see them; and had I been making these things the metal would have been in a liquid state, instead of which it was hard and in pieces, exactly as I found them. I declare I am innocent of making either the coins or the mould; neither of these females even knew I had these things in my possession; Jones asked me what they were, but I never satisfied her; the handkerchief they were in was an old piece of black handkerchief, which I burnt on the Monday afternoon; I sell things in the street for my living.</p>

During his lifetime, William Shorter took a furnished lodging of us in the name of William Smith, and in the evening Isabella Shorter came—they staid there a week, and left without giving notice or paying—on the evening they left I went into their room, and missed the articles stated—William Shorter said that this woman was his wife.</p>

I had a quantity of linen hanging in my garden, which is inclosed, and has a ditch at the bottom—the linen was safe at a quarter past seven o'clock, and was missed at half-past seven—I have seen some of them since in the hands of the officer—I have seen a pair of stockings belonging to Isabella Bagnall, some aprons and other things of Jane Jones, who is my servant—I know all the things.</p>

On Thursday morning, the 23rd of Jan., between eleven and twelve o'clock, I took Newman into custody on another charge—he looked bulky, and I found this table-cloth round his body, which Mrs. Sherriff has identified—I took him to the station—he said be resided in the Mint, in the Borough; but I had reason to believe he did not—I went to York-street, and found some lodgers had come to a house in a little street, called James-street—I went there, and knocked at the door—Early looked out, and I said, "I want to speak to you"—Deacon and another were at the window—Early then put down the window—I waited, and then knocked again, but got no answer—I waited some time, and then went through the next house, and got in—I went up stairs, and found the two female prisoners in the room I had seen the men looking out at—I asked them where the men were—they said they did not know anything of any men—I then asked what the front door was locked for—they said the landlady was out, and had taken the key—I asked which way the landlady was gone—Probert said she did not know—I said, "I suppose you are landlady yourself"—she said, "I am," and said Parsley took that room of her which they were both in—I then came down, and saw a quantity of linen hanging to dry in the front parlour—I asked them both who that belonged to—Probert said, "It belongs to me part of it, and part of it I have got to wash for a person"—I asked who the person was—she said she could not give me any name or residence—I then said to Probert, "I shall take the linen and you too"—I packed part of the linen, and another officer packed up another part—we took it away—there were three shifts, two night-gowns, and an apron, which have all been identified—Probert said, "I brought this all upon myself; I had no right to be here; my friends are respectable; I wished many times the things should not be brought in"—I asked who brought things in—she said different youths, and she would say no more—I found this poker in the lower room, which answers the purpose of a crow-bar, and a skeleton key was found in the house—I knew all the prisoners before—Probert cohabits with a man named Brent, and I have frequently seen Parsley with Early, whom I knew by the name of Jackson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Isabella-place, Black-friars. On the 15th of Jan. I met the prosecutor in Blackfriars-road and went into a public-house with him—we had been to a coffee-shop first and then went to the public-house, and had part of four half-quarterns of brandy—he got rather the worse for liquor, and I led him away from the bar, as there were so many coming in and out—he fell down on the pavement, and his hat fell off—the prisoner came up to him and I thought he was going to pick him up—instead of that I saw him put his hand into his right-hand pocket and take some money out—he left him lying there and went off—I called "Police!" and another female said "Stop thief!"—I ran after him and the policeman stopped him half-way down the next street—he struggled with the policeman, and I heard some money fall as the prisoner was given in custody—I saw a half-crown and several shillings with the prosecutor before he came out of the public-house.</p>
