                  </hi>. I am a widow—my husband's name was William Agar Hall—he died on 6th May, 1868—previous to his decease I knew the defendant—I knew that my husband had monetary dealings with him—at my husband's death I was left with five children—I came to London to seek advice—I went to the defendant, who, at that time, had an office in Pall Mall while his house was under repair—I subsequently went to him at 18, Warwick Street, Regent Street—I took him a policy of insurance for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. long my husband's life—he looked at it, and said, "I am very sorry for you, Mrs. Hall; I regret to hear you are left as you are. Leave this with me, and I will get this for you free of expense"—I left it with him—this was in June, 1868—I told him when I handed it to him that it was a policy on my husband's life in the Equitable Insurance Office—I went to him again on 10th September—I had my little boy very ill, in fact dying; and I begged of him to give me some money—I went to him then in con<lb/>sequence of receiving a letter—my sister was with me, and Charles Pointer was also present—he was one of Mr. Cook's clerks—I was always given to understand Mr. Cook had a deed prepared for me that he was to advance 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., exclusive of the insurance money—he said it was to enable me to go into business, he felt so deeply for my situation—I had no provision for my family, and with my insurance money he would advance me 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for</p>

               <p>which T was to sign the deed—he said, "I have mentioned your insurance in it, but that has nothing to do with it, that is yours"—he said he thought a public-house would be the best thing I could take—he said that I was to pay him 5 per cent, for this 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and date it from the same time that my husband's mortgage was to run—I was aware that my husband had had an advance on mortgage from Mr. Cook—he asked me if I should require an advance of some money, and I said if he pleased—he asked me how much would do, would 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. do, and my sister replied, "No, my dear, not less than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he then gave me a cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the deed was read to me—Charles Poynter read two or three leaves of it, and Mr. Cook took it out of his hand, and read it in a quick and hurried manner—he said Poynter did not know how to read—he did not read it correctly; but he was reading it correctly, so that I could understand I—Mr. Cook said this was merely a deed for me to assign over, at 5 percent., for the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not mentioning the insurance at all, to assign to him the Interest for the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not receive 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that occasion, only the <hi rend="italic">I.</hi> cheque—I also signed a cheque for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Lewis, of Great Marlborough Street—if Mr. Cook had handed the money over to me at once, I might have been making a provision for my children—I was advised by my friends to prosecute Mr. Cook, to punish him for his unkindness towards me—I am doing it to show his conduct to others, that he should not deprive the widow and her family of her only subsistence—that is the way I am spend<lb/>ing my money—I never intended to gain anything else by it, I never expected it—I know that my husband represented the Irish property to be worth about 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know that it was worth nothing of the kind—my brother-in-law is a trustee—I don't know from him that the property</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186911220007"/>
               <p>is worth nothing like that—Mr. Cook was aware that my husband's family were not very fond of me—I don't believe that the property is not worth a so much, I believe the contrary—my brother-in-law never enlightens me upon anything as to what the property is worth, merely sends me a few accounts—I have not taken any means to ascertain what the property is worth, only what Mr. Cook has taken himself—he took out administration for me—he charged me for it—I have not taken any means since I have been out of the hands of Mr. Cook to take out administration, because Mr. Cook had had my administration previously—I have never seen them—I have not directed anybody to apply to Mr. Cook for them—I have never tried to take out administration in Ireland, because I thought Mr. Cook had already done so—he told me he had, or otherwise the pro<lb/>perty would not be secured to him—I don't know thai there is a farthing coming to me out of the Irish property—if I did take out administration, I don't know whether there is or no—my friends have not enlightened me upon the subject—I really don't know whether I shall get a penny out of it—I know how much money my husband actually had from Mr. Cook—he had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides, the rest was for bonuses—the property is at Limerick—I took the policy to Mr. Cook because he was always very polite to me, and I took it to him to show it to him, and ask how I was to obtain it—I did not know of everything that had passed between my husband and Mr. Cook—my husband was often at Mr. Cook's without me—I knew that the policy was mentioned in the deed, but Mr. Cook said, "That is nothing, it is yours"—I was in such deep affliction, my husband dying, and three months afterwards I lost my little boy, and I had no money to pay the funeral expenses—that was what I wanted money for, and I thought to get my insurance money for it—I thought I was to obtain that and the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he was to advance—I firmly believed it.</p>

I was to receive from Mr. Cook—I was under the impression that he would deduct the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the insurance money, and hand me the difference—he led me to believe that I had something to do with the Irish property—I thought at the time that he would deduct it from the insurance money—my hus<lb/>band had agreed to the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a bonus—I never had any agreement—I did not understand I was to give back 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I knew that he had taken out administration for the property that was in England—he told me he had</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not learnt that this property in reality will not pay its in<lb/>cumbrances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Cook has, I have not learnt it; but Mr. Cook was in Ireland at the time he made ray husband an advance, and certainly when he was in Dublin, within a few miles, he went to see what the property was worth, no doubt—the annuity that has been mentioned was upon the life of my husband's mother—I don't know her age; I dare say she is past sixty—I don't know whether she is in bad health—I don't hear from her—I received from my brother an account of the value of the property for Mr. Cook, which I took him, and he has it; but, allow me to explain, there are lime<lb/>kilns, and at the time the account was rendered to Mr. Cook they were not at work, which brings in much more—I took the account to Mr. Cook, and left with him; I think it was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when the taxes were deducted—I think that was the annual produce of it; I really can't say—that was a paper I had obtained with a view of explaining the value of the property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Civil Service, and live at May's Cottage, Bounds Green, Tottenham—on Monday, 4th October, I was on the platform of the Holloway railway station at 5.5—after I had been there about five minutes, I saw two persons there—I did not know who they were at that time—I afterwards ascertained they were Boyd and the deceased woman, Maria Death—I also saw two musicians on the platform at that time—I saw Boyd speak to them, and one of them played a tune, and the other sang, on the platform—shortly after that the 5.10 down train arrived from King's Cross—I saw Boyd and the two musicians get into that train—I did not take sufficient notice to say whether Maria Death got into that train or not—I got into the same train—I saw nothing of either Boyd, Death, or the musicians, until the train arrived at Wood Green—I got out there, and proceeded from the station, over the bridge, on my way home—after I had crossed the bridge, on looking forward, I saw Boyd recovering himself, getting up from the ground—I had not reached where he was at that time, and I noticed a severe wound on his cheek, it was bleeding—directly afterwards the woman Death ran past me towards the station, and the prisoner in pursuit—she was some few yards in front of him—she was running, and he was running in pursuit—he caught her, and caught hold of her by the waist—I looked round, and waited a minute till they passed me—he was still holding her by the waist—I did not interfere at all—I heard the woman say to him, "<hi rend="italic">Fred.,</hi> you know what you have said to me," or "told me; I am afraid of my life"—at the time she said this to him he I was taking her home, using no more violence than was necessary to take her home—he had got her right hand under his left arm, and was partly dragging her home—I walked behind—a little further on there is a corner; they turned that corner—after I had turned the corner I saw Boyd and the two musicians—the musicians were wiping the blood off Boyd's cheek—the prisoner and deceased passed them—a little further on there is a stile—the prisoner had to lift the deceased over the stile, she would not get over herself—when I was near the stile I saw Mr. Whitton, and he and I walked on together—at that time the prisoner and Death were in front of us, and Boyd and the musicians behind—there were two more stiles, and the pri<lb/>soner lifted the woman over both—a little further on is a road called Bounds Green Road; when they got into this road the prisoner and Death increased their pace, and by the time we reached Truro Road they were just about turning into the gateway of Nella Cottage—we still followed them—we were on our way home—we stood at the corner of Truro Road for a minute—we then walked nearly to Nella Cottage, Mr. Walter Gray accompanying us—he had joined us at the corner of Truro Road—I did not at that time know that there was another residence behind Nella Cottage—while we were fronting Nella Cottage I heard the report of a gun; I did not hear anything before that—after the report I heard something which appeared like blows—before the report I heard a scream, one or two screams—I looked in the direction of the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the War Office, and live at Maidstone Road, Colney Hatch—I joined Mr. Sawyer on the evening of this occur<lb/>rence, as he was walking home from the Wood Green station—I had seen the prisoner a few minutes before—he was running after the woman—he was going towards the station at the time I first saw him—the woman was running from him—I saw her at the moment he bad caught her—I scarcely saw any running—he held her by the waist and told her to come with him—she said, "No, <hi rend="italic">Fred.,</hi> I would rather not; do let me go"—he then turned her round, and they went in the opposite direction, and walked across the fields—he held her hand very tight under his arm—you could scarcely call it dragging her along, but he caused her to go with him, evidently against her will—there were three stiles on the road—he lifted her over the first two; and the third, my impression is, she got over by herself—the last stile is perhaps 200 or 300 yards from Nella Cottage—I was following on after them—I saw them turn down the Truro Road and turn into the gate of Nella Cottage—I remained in the road, supposing they had gone into Nella Cottage—I then heard the report of a gun—I can't say exactly how soon that was after I had seen them turn into the gateway of Nella Cottage, but I should think certainly within two minutes—I also heard the sound of a blow and saw a figure fall, apparently the figure of a woman—before she fell I saw a stick, as I thought it at that time, raised above the figure, in motion, but I could not distinguish the person who held it—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186911220029"/>
               <p>then saw the prisoner come out of the gate by the side of Nella Cottage, with a weapon in his hand resembling a bar of iron—I have since found it was a gun barrel—some one in the road, standing not far from me, said, "The woman is shot"—the prisoner, apparently in answer to that, said, "Yes, I have shot her; there is no mistake about that, and I will now kill," or, "do for the other"—I then saw him go round the corner, and saw him enter the gate of Boyd's cottage—I spoke to some men in the road, and told one of them to run as fast as he could to the station and bring some policemen, which he did—I saw the prisoner again in a very short time, indeed, it might have been a minute—he was then passing between the gateway of Boyd's cottage and the end of Truro Road, perhaps ten or fifteen yards from Boyd's cottage—I followed him, and saw him again enter the gate of Nella Cottage—I next saw two policemen running round the corner of Truro Road, and I called to them, or one of them, and pointed to the gate where Hinson had gone in, and they went in there—I afterwards saw a sort of struggle—it was very confused, and nearly dark, but I saw a figure on the ground, and a figure bending over him, apparently—I afterwards saw the body of the woman—when I first saw it closely it had been mored into the little iron house, Hinson's cottage—I had seen it previously among the bushes in the garden of Nella Cottage, within two or three yards of Hinson's cottage—from the time I first saw Hinson take hold of the woman to the time I saw him struggling with the policeman in the garden, I should think about twenty or twenty-five minutes elapsed.</p>

I am a railway clerk, and live in Clarence Road, Wood Green—I was a passenger by the 5.10 train from London, on 4th October—I got out at the Wood Green station—on my way home I overtook the two last witnesses, Mr. Sawyer and Mr. Whitton, at the comer of Truro Road—Mr. Sawyer spoke to me, and from what he said I remained with them—I went with them in front of Nella Cottage—whilst standing there I heard the report of a gun—I saw a flash, and saw the form of the woman fall—after the report I heard a violent beating—I afterwards saw the prisoner come from the garden of Nella Cottage into the Truro Road—I heard him say "She is dead enough; I shot her, there is no mistake," or words to that effect—I don't remember anything else that he said—he muttered something—he then went into the garden of Elder Cottage—he tried the front door, and finding it locked, he put his foot to it, and smashed it open with his</p>

I am a chemist, of 67, Bedford Street, Mile End—on 9th October, about 11 o'clock, the prisoner came in for a pennyworth of plain powder—she then asked for something to take out ink stains, and I recommended her salts of lemon, and supplied her with a pennyworth, which is about three quarters of an ounce—she said that that would not be suf<lb/>ficient, and wished for more—I supplied her with a twopenny packet, and she wished to know how to use it—I told her to dip the linen in hot water, and put the salts in it afterwards, to wash it—salts of lemon contains two parts of oxalic acid and one of potass—both packets were labelled, "Poison," with my name and address—I observed nothing remarkable about the prisoner, and had no suspicions—it is not an uncommon thing to be asked for, for that purpose.</p>

I am the wife of Martin Markham, a bricklayer, of 71, Rutland Street, Mile End—the prisoner came to lodge with us on 19th July, and on 12th September she was confined of a girl, a very delicate child—she treated it well, as a mother would—it was very weak and low—on Saturday morning, 9th October, between 10 and 12 o'clock, the prisoner came to me and said, "I have poisoned myself and the child"—she seemed in a very wild and excited state—I said, "You have never done such a thing as that?"—she said, "Go and see for yourself"—she put her hand to her head, and said, "Oh dear, I shall go mad; troubles will drive me mad, they are so great"—I had a conversation with my husband, and went up stairs, and found the child on the bed, foaming at the mouth—I took it up, and it died my arms—the prisoner came up after me and said,</p>

               <p>"My head is so bad I shall go mad, my troubles are so great"—she seemed quite unconscious of what she was doing—my husband fetched a doctor, and I saw him administer an emetic.</p>

Q.</hi> When she repeated that she was so bad and that her troubles were so great, did she add, "Let me die! let me die!" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "Yes"—that was up stairs—when she said that she had poisoned her child she was very excited; her eyes were rolling in her head, and there was something very strange about them—the child seemed in a dying state—I was looking for its 
death hourly, before she told me that—the child was unable to take the breast, the mother paid it all the attention and devotion which an affectionate mother could—she was always very affectionate towards it—ever since she received the letter from her husband the prisoner has been wild and vacant at times, and since the birth of the child I have observed her to be in a low, melancholy state, and she used to cry a great deal—irrespective of that I have frequently seen her wringing her hands and putting them to her head, and crying—the whole of the week before the 9th the state I have described was more intense—there was a restlessness about her eyes, and she was still more vague, and she used to come and talk to me, and then run away in a strange manner in the middle of a sentence—they administered an emetic to her the moment the doctor came, and he ordered her to be taken to the hospital at once.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the medical officers of the London Hospital—the prisoner was placed under my charge there on 9th October—I examined her when she was brought in—she was very pale and cold, and I had reason to believe from her state that she had taken some sort of poison—I gave her an emetic, and came to the conclusion, from what came from her stomach, that she had taken oxalic acid; salts of lemon would be practically the same—she remained in the hospital two or three days, and was then taken in custody.</p>

Q.</hi> From the instructions you received, did you think it necessary to keep close watch over her while she was in the ward? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she was very low and depressed while she was in the hospital, and on the Sunday evening I found a pocket-handkerchief twisted round her neck, and I believe she tried to strangle herself—it was on Monday, the 11th, just before 9 o'clock at night—she had been left alone for a short time, and when I came back I found the handkerchief in that state, and took it off and said, "You should not do this, because you are getting people into trouble"—she said, "I do not wish to do that."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long was she in the hospital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the 9th to the 13th—I only spoke to her for about five minutes on the 9th—she appeared to speak sensibly, but she was very low spirited—she was unable to do anything for herself, she was too ill—the handkerchief was not tied in a knot; it was so twisted that I thought she had been trying to strangle herself.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">MORRISON</hi>. I am a surgeon—I attended the prisoner in her confine<lb/>inent, of a female child, in September—it was a very sickly child—I was called in again on 9th October, and found the child dead, and the prisoner partially insensible—my assistant had administered an emetic to her before I arrived—I was at a labour, and was sent for—I had her taken to the hospital—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body of the child on the following Monday, and came to the conclusion that it died from an irritant poison—the symptoms were consistent with poisoning by oxalic acid—I put the stomach into a jar, and sent it to Dr. Letheby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you attended her, day after day, two or three times a week, since her confinement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Every day, or every other day—there was a suppression of the lacteal secretion—I observed between her confinement and 9th October that she had a wild, vacant look; not so much as to warrant interference to have her confined in a lunatic asylum, but sufficient to attract notice, and make me suspicious of her sanity—the had the peculiar look of puerperal mania, which is a well-recognised form of insanity with women about the period of their confinement—it affects them when they are not able to give milk to a child, and is the consequence of it—this form of puerperal mania develops itself sometimes by acts of violence to the nearest and dearest, and to the offspring of the woman—there it no fixed period at which it arrives at intensity, sometimes one and sometimes two weeks after confinement—there are two forms, the acute, wild, raving, and the other is the melancholy sort, with which there are no delusions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell us that again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One is violent, with debates, coming on usually within a day or two after confinement, and the other coming on after the 15th day—that is the melancholy, and is without delusions—they both lead to acts of violence—the second form is the melancholy type, and is what the prisoner's symptoms indicated—the second form is a recognised form of insanity; there are no delusions, but it leads to acts of violence—I do not believe that persons who have that melancholy form have sufficient control over themselves to prevent them committing crime.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are women in whose family there is ah here<lb/>ditary taint of insanity more likely than others to become afflicted with this terrible complaint? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are—for a week before the 9th the prisoner seemed wilder—she had a peculiar look, which it is very difficult to give a definition of—it is not the look of a sane person—the appearance of her eyes was not so marked at the Police Court as I used to notice it in her bedroom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this your opinion (<hi rend="italic">reading from Dr. Taylor's work</hi>) that "In a person labouring under puerperal mania the killing of a child may be the result of an uncontrollable impulse seizing her at the time the act is done; but it may be done with a knowledge on the part of the mother that the act she is doing will cause 
death?"Knowing that the act of giving poison or cut<lb/>ting a child's throat would cause death, might she still be under that un<lb/>controllable mania which would cause her to do it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that she would know the result of what she was</p>

               <p>doing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—sometimes persons hare been known to kill other people in order that they may be hung themselves—I believe that in this form of mania they would be conscious that they were doing wrong, and still not be able to prevent themselves from doing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this your opinion in respect to puerperal mania, that "Wherever there exists an hereditary family taint of insanity, the mind of the medical man should be particularly alive to the chance of its developing itself during a confinement?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but I was never in<lb/>formed that there was insanity in the family till after the deed was com<lb/>mitted—a large proportion of the cases of puerperal mania are in persons whose families have had an hereditary taint.</p>

GRIFFITHS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where you find melancholy puerperal mania, do you often find acts of violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In both sorts of puerperal mania you may have infanticide—more kill their children than kill themselves—I draw a distinction between puerperal mania and homicidal mania—I did not observe these symptoms before she was confined, not till about a fortnight after, and then they did not appear to be at all alarming; there was a pecu<lb/>liar expression of the eyes, but no other symptom—there was only sufficient for me to warn the friends; my assistant warned the sister, and I spoke to her myself—puerperal mania may come on as long as six weeks after a confinement.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you agree with Dr. Morrison, that she would know the probable result of what she was doing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think the depression, the melancholy, may be so great that, though she knew the result, still it would be an uncontrollable impulse—the mind may not be so disordered as to render the individual incapable of judging between right and wrong, yet the melancholy may be so great that she might commit the act, and try to poison herself as well—I think she would know that what she was doing was wrong; but if carried to its greatest extent, it might prevent her know<lb/>ing that it was wrong.</p>

About 11 o'clock on the night of the 28th, I saw this broken window—I was aware the church had been entered—I saw the window again in the morning, and the hole was much larger, and there were some burnt matches—a few minutes after 4 o'clock I heard the cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner and the con<lb/>stable running across Commercial Street, into the market—I followed the prisoner, and caught him—he was very much exhausted—I said, "What have you been up to?"—he said, "Nothing; I am going home"—I said, "You must go back along with me, and see what is the matter"—I took him back into Spitalfield's Market, and there met Cable, who said, "That's him; I saw him jump over from the churchyard into Church Street"—he produced this piece of velvet, and said, "I saw him throw that away"—I took him to the station, and he gave the address of some coffee-house in the White<lb/>chapel Road—when I saw him running he was going in a contrary direction to the Whitechapel Road—I went with Sergeant Saunders and the sexton, and examined the church.</p>

I live at Queen Street, Bethnal Green—on 19th October I was in Brick Lane, near the Great Eastern Railway Station—about 1.20 I saw the prisoner there with a horse and cart—when I first saw him he was dragging a sack of oats out of Mr. Fieldhouse's shop—the horse and cart was opposite the window—I did not see him drive up—I first saw him in the shop—he was about three yards inside—he laid the sack just outside the shop, in the street—he went into the shop again after that—he called Henry George Fieldhouse out into the shop, and wanted him to serve him with some oats, and I took no further notice, because I thought he was a customer—the prisoner wanted a bag to put some oats in, and said he would lend some money on the bag; but Mr. Fieldhouse had not got a bag for the oats—the prisoner went out of the shop, got up in the cart, and drove away—Mr. Henry Fieldhouse pulled the sack of oats into the shop again, and put it where it was before—he did not see the prisoner drag it out—he could see the corner of the sack from the shop, while the prisoner was there—I did not hear what the prisoner said to Mr. Fieldhouse about the sack.</p>

I am living at Wells Street, Poplar—I was cook on board the <hi rend="italic">Old England,</hi> which left Cardiff on 15th June—and was a ship of 1200 or 1300 tons—Bulman was the captain, and Helburn the carpenter—after leaving Cardiff the vessel was pumped every four hours, every watch, from the time we left—the pumping lasted fifteen minutes at a time—that continued for about a fortnight, after which she was pumped every two hours—I observed that the pumps sucked—I remember Saturday, 24th July, the day before the ship was abandoned—it was fair weather—the ship had been pumped every hour that day, for fifteen or twenty minutes—the pumps sucked, but they were not in good order—about 4 o'clock that afternoon we saw a Portuguese brig, and the captain went on board about 6 o'clock—the ship was pumped the last time at 8 o'clock—the third mate gave an order not to pump, but the captain was not present; he was on the poop—as far as I saw, the men were willing to pump—the second-mate, the car<lb/>penter, and two sailors, went on board the Portuguese brig with the cap<lb/>tain—on Sunday morning, the 25th, about 9 o'clock, I saw the carpenter with a parcel under his arm, wrapped up—he went into the fore-cabin, and I asked him where he was going—he said, "Into the hold—I followed him—he went down the fore-cabin after-hatch, which is in the fore-cabin—the steward was with him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a model of the ship—the carpenter afterwards put the parcel on the deck to take the hatch off, and I then saw two augurs in it—I afterwards saw the carpenter in the hold, on the top of the cargo of coal—he had the parcel with him—I saw no water then—I was close to the bread tank, in the fore-cabin, and could see into the hold, because the after-hatch is in the fore-cabin—there are two hatches in the fore-cabin—the ship had a between decks, the fore-cabin was in the after part—I was in the fore-cabin, which is on deck—the after<lb/>hatches are in that cabin, and he took up the hatches, and went down into the hold—I said to the carpenter, "I believe the <hi rend="italic">Old England</hi> don't leak no more; I don't see the water"—he said nothing—he was then in the hold, on top of the cargo—he called for the captain about half an hour after that, and I went to the captain, who was on deck, sitting on the rail, and said, "The carpenter wants you in the hold "—the captain went to the carpenter, and I followed him to the after-hold—he was away about four or five minutes, and then came back with the carpenter, who went to his work; I did not notice where, and the captain came on deck—about 12 o'clock I went down between decks, in the fore-hatch, and saw water in the hold, for the first time—it was between 5 ft. and 6 ft. from between decks to the top of the water—I went on deck, and told the carpenter, "Water; come quick!"—he answered, "Six," or "Sixteen inches?"—I do not remember which—I left the ship about 2.30, and went on board the Portuguese brig—I have been at sea about seven years—we had good weather all the way from England—the ship was floating when we left her, and as long as we could see her—I did not see the water in the hold after 12 o'clock—the Portuguese Captain came on board the <hi rend="italic">Old England</hi> on Sunday morning, and I inter<lb/>preted between him and our captain—I can speak a little Portuguese—the Portuguese captain asked me when we left pumping—I did not tell Bul<lb/>man</p>

                  </hi>. I was an able seaman on board the Old England—I have been at sea eighteen years—after the vessel left Cardiff, she was pumped every four hours first, and then every two hours—we began to pump every two hours after we had been about three weeks at sea, I think—we had fine weather—the last time she was pumped was 8 o'clock on the Saturday night, before we left her, on 24th July—the pumps sucked then at 18 in.—the ship drew about 18 ft., but I am not certain——she was a flat-bottomed ship, not a clipper—when we went to the pumps, at 9 o'clock, the second mate stopped us—he said, "What are you doing there"—I said, "We are going to give her a jog out"—he said, "Come away from there, and let the pumps alone"—we turned in between 2 and 3 o'clock on Sunday morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did anybody tell you to sound <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did it because I wanted to see what water there was, and how the vessel stood, as I heard on Saturday night that we were going to leave her next morning—I did not think much of it—I turned in after that—I knew it would be a good spell to pump out the 30 in. of water, but that was nothing for such a ship as that—she might have gone round the Cape, but we could not tell what she might have done if we got a gale of wind—I did not tell any of the officers—I made no remonstrance about leaving the owner's ship—I did not tell the captain how much water I had found in the hold.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 29, Cloudesley Square, Islington, and am a cheesemonger, but now out of business—in December last I carried on business at 22, Everett Street, Russell Square—a man named Penny bought some goods of me, amounting to between 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had previously dealt with me on two or three occasions—he did not pay for the goods—I gave him credit, because of his being in conversation with a livery-stable keeper, that lived in the same neighbourhood, whom I knew—Penny represented that he belonged to a firm of veterinary surgeons at King's Cross—on the 24th he brought us a cheque and borrowed a sovereign—he said I need not take the cheque, as it was Lieutenant-Colonel Craufurd's signature on it, and he would call on the Saturday and pay for the whole—on the 26th he brought a cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which, after paying me what he owed me, left a balance of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he would call for it, but he never did—I paid the cheque to a wholesale firm, who paid it through their bank, and it was returned—I wrote to Penny, and he called to see me—he said he would be very sorry for me to think he was anything else than a gentleman, that Colonel Craufurd's pay was due on a certain day at Cox's, and if I went it would be paid.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was Penny living at his time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 18, Bury Street—I sent the goods there—they consisted of turkeys and geese—he said he wanted them for presents—I believe Colonel Craufurd was in the cab when Penny borrowed the sovereign, but I cannot be positive—when Penny called on me he said he hoped his arms would drop off if he did not pay me—I cannot say how long that was after the cheque was dishonoured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk at Messrs. Cox's, the army agents—I know Lieutenant-Colonel Craufurd—he belongs to the Royal Artillery—he retired on half-pay four or five years ago, and he has had an account with us a little more than eighteen months—his half-pay is about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and that is subject to a reduction of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which has to be paid to the Insol<lb/>vent Debtors' Court—we received it from the Paymaster-General—he had</p>

               <p>a cheque-book—I have not brought our books with me, but I can say he had no effects for three of these ceases—these cheques are all in the Colonel's handwriting—they were presented at Messrs. Cox's, and dishonoured—there was not sufficient to pay—the payments were made at the expiration of each quarter—I told him certain cheques had been presented and dishonoured, and requested him to discontinue the practice of drawing them.</p>

I said, "What business have you in my parlour? you have stolen that coat; I will give you in charge," and he swore at me—he dropped the coat and went out—I afterwards went to the police-station, where I saw the prisoner—I said, "That is the man who took the coat; I have no doubt at all that he is the man."</p>

I reside at 37, Albemarle Street, and at Chiswick—I am a fellow of the College of Physicians—I have had great experience in cases of mental disorder—I have been about twenty-one years in practice—I have been present in Court during the hearing of this case to-day, and have heard the evidence both for the prosecution and defence—I hare also had a personal interview with the prisoner in Newgate, on Monday last—I should think his mind then was perfectly sound, although it was weakened, I presume, by confinement, and the nature of his position; but it is a perfectly sound mind, I think, now—I have heard the evidence as to his previous good character, and the change in his disposition; that would be exactly compatible with a temporary attack of insanity at the time of his committing this crime—from my own examination of him, before I heard the evidence, I also came to the conclusion that at the time he com<lb/>mitted the crime he was of unsound mind—it struck me that he was a man of remarkable kindness of disposition, naturally—he told me his rela<lb/>tions with this woman, whom he took out of charity—there was no attempt on his part to assume insanity, and he had no recollection.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the Southwark district of the Metro—I politic Fire Brigade—about 2.30, on the morning of the 2nd August, I was called to a fire at the Dolphin public-house, in Red Cross Street, Borough—upon entering the house I noticed a strong smell of spirits pervading the house—I went over the house—in the cellar I found casks piled up in four different points, one on the top of the other, reaching nearly to the joisting—some wine laths were nailed to the joisting over the casks—they were charred—on the top of the top cask, in each place, I found some spirit, a kind of paraffin—that was also on the top of the casks—there had been fire at each of the four points—there were four of those pillars in the front cellar and two in the back, probably from 6 to 8 ft. apart—they could not have caught one from the other—there were four different fires—I went into the bar, and there saw two pie-dishes containing the same kind of side—there were two tubs with them—they appeared to be nine-gallon casks sawn asunder—the pie-dishes were on the floor, and the tubs along-side—there were marks of fire in both places—one was on the under<lb/>neath part of the shelves under the counter, and the other at the back of the bar—there was a cupboard under the stairs, which had been burnt out—I found an earthenware pan in that cupboard—it was broken, but a portion of it contained a spirit like paraffin, or benzoline—the stairs to the</p>

               <p>five or six Irishmen would attempt to roast him iii bio bed some day—I naked him if he had the letter, and he did not produce it—that conversation was in the front room, second-floor—when we came out on the landing I said, "You see there are some more of these tubs, Mr. Cusack"—he said, "Oh, I can plainly see somebody has set this place on fire; it was not me; I don't want any insurance money"—he was quite sober—I found altogether fourteen distinct fires in the house—I mean fourteen actually prepared for fire, and some had been on fire—it is a twelve-roomed house, reckoning the basement as two.</p>

I was potman to the prisoner for two years and a half—I am sixteen years old—my father assisted in the house when my mistress was away—he was there on the evening in question, the 1st August—there were only Mr. Cusack and myself in the house that night—he has a sister, who I call my mistress—she left on the Friday, and had not returned—my father left soon after the house closed, at 11 o'clock—Mr. Cusack has a nephew, who lives in the house; but he left on the Saturday—he was generally away from Saturday till Monday—when the house was closed, all the people had cleared out—I closed the two front doors, and fastened them with two bolts and a bar—I only went into the kitchen—that was all right, and the bar also—I turned the gas off, and went up stairs to bed with the prisoner—he slept in the same room, the first-floor front—I went to bed directly—we had different beds—the prisoner undressed and got into his bed—I went to sleep very quickly, and did not wake till I was called, at 2.30, by Mr. Cusack—he said, "George, the place is on fire"—I jumped out of bed and ran to the window—he said, "Stop, and put your trowsers on," and while I was putting them on he tied the sheets together, and we then went down, out of the window—I went down first—there was no fire in the room in which we slept—the door was doted—I could not see any fire at the time—the prisoner had his shirt and trowsers on—I did not notice whether they were buttoned up or not—he had no coat—when I woke the first thing I saw was the prisoner standing at the window, halloa<lb/>ing out "Fire?"—that was after he had called me—before I went to bed I had not noticed any furniture piled up in any of the rooms, or anything of that sort—I had not been into any of the up-stair rooms, except my bedroom—I had not been in them for some time, nor yet the cellar—it was not kept locked—Mr. Cusack attended to the cellar—I have gone down when I wanted anything; but I had not been down for some days—I did not notice any pie-dishes, or any furniture about before I went to bed—I had been in the bar all the evening, and that was all right—the pie-dishes were kept in the kitchen—I had not seen them in the bar that night—I have seen the tubs down in the cellar, not in the rooms—I have burnt some pieces of tubs, that were sawn up for wood—that was a week or so before the fire—the pieces that were not burnt were kept in the yard—there was some benzoline kept in the kitchen—that was used for lamps—I had fetched a quart the week before, and I used to get a quart each week—it came to 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we burnt gas as well—I have seen this hammer-chisel before—there were tools all over the place—the prisoner is an amateur carpenter—I have seen him working with tools—I don't remember where I have seen this hammer before.</p>

I went to St. Thomas's Hospital on, 17th November, and said to the prisoner, "I have come to apprehend you on a charge of attempting to murder Mary Ann Talbot, by cutting her throat with a knife; it is my duty to tell you that any thing you say will be given in evidence against you"—he first said, "I know I have done wrong, I am very sorry for it"—on the way to the station he said, "I think she tried to make me do it; I was very ill before this happened; I think my heart is diseased, as I often feel queer; three months ago I was taken to St. Thomas's Hospital in a cab, and fainted on the way; they refused to attend to me, but I was attended by Dr. Chabot afterwards"—he afterwards said, "She has been the cause of this, by going out with other young men; I have been keeping company with her four years,"</p>
