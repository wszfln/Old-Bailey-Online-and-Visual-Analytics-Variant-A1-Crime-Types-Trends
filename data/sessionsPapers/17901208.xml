I will serve you the same; when I saw the man stabbing the woman I got as soon as I could on the landing-place; I bawled out, murder! the woman is done for; then I called out, Mrs. Thorpe! Mrs. Thorpe! the woman is done for now: Mrs. Thorpe lived in the floor facing me: she sent me to the shop to get a man to go up; I could not get ever a man there; then I went to look for the patrol, and when I came back I found Mrs. Thorpe and the patrol at the door; I was not absent half an hour: we went up stairs in the prisoner's room, and found her on the flat of her back, on the floor; we all went into the room: the prisoner was standing on the landing place, in custody of a constable: I supported the deceased's head; I saw her guts out of one side: the poor woman said nothing to me, only to undo her stays and things, for she was swelling up so much, she said, and to send for the doctor, and the gentleman, the clergyman, that she should confess to him: as the prisoner was taking to the justice, he said to the deceased,</p>

               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice ASHURST.</p>
               <p>Proclamation being made, the Recorder passed sentence as follows:</p>
               <p>Prisoner at the bar. You have been convicted after the patient hearing of a discreet jury, to whom you could make no objection, of the very heinous crime of murder; that you may make the best use of the short space of time that is allotted to murderers to remain among us, I announce to you the dreadful information, that the court are perfectly satisfied with the verdict of the jury, by which you are doomed to almost immediate death: bad as the crime of murder is in every case, your crime is highly aggravated by the consideration, that you by cohabiting with this woman had taken her under your pecullar protection; the blow given by you to this woman is not only unlawful as a member of civil society, but it was disgraceful to you as a man; it was an attack made by the strong on the weak; it was an attack made by a man with a deadly weapon in his hand, on a poor defenceless woman; it was attended with a Brutal ferocity, and accompanied with expressions that would disgrace the most ignorant and the most inhuman savage; such as I shall not repeat, because they are too shocking for the hearing of such an audience: this, prisoner, was a conduct which nothing could justify or even mitigate, but a direct and violent attack on your own existence: your mind must have been callous to the feelings of humanity, and to the well-being of others. Let me most seriously now recommended to you, to pay some attention to your own welfare, and to your present situation, and to make the best use of your time; cut off from all hope in this world, if possible, to make your peace with God hereafter: and I, prisoner, pray to the Almighty God, that the execution which you are now about in a most publick manner to suffer, may become a serious example to deter others in future, who may be disposed to commit such violent outrages, against, and in defiance of, the laws of God and man, and to the injury of society. Nothing remains for me but that I pass upon you the sentence of the law; which sentence is, That you be taken from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence on Monday next to a place of execution, there to be <rs id="t17901208-1-punish5" type="punishmentDescription">

               <p>Did you understand from them, if they hired it for themselves, or for another person? - I asked him if he was the gentleman himself; he told me no, he was employed for a gentleman about one hundred and fifty miles off in the country; we came down together, the prisoner walked before me, and I observed the parlour-door that I left open was shut; it was locked, and the key gone, and the street door half shut and half open; I ran and shut the street door, and put my foot against it, and seized the prisoner by the collar, and told him he must give me an account of the other person that came along with him; at the same time I knocked with my heel for the little girl, and she came up, and he was beating me with this stick (produces one) on my head and my shoulders; then I took the stick from him, and with his fist he knocked all my teeth down; she came up, and saw me all in blood; I told her to call the people at the next door; she went out and left the door wide open, and the servants next door came in, and seized the prisoner; they were a man and maid servant, and the woman took the stick from me; the parlour door was broke open, and there was a white Marseilles quilted counterpane gone, and a great long cloak made of padusoy, and a pair of gloves, and a pocket book; the counterpane and long cloak were worth five pounds; I never saw the things since.</p>

I beg leave to ask two or three questions; whether on my entrance into the house, I did not, previous to that knock at the door, and she let me in; whether I treated her with any incivility, and did not behave with the greatest politeness, till we came down stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether or not I had any acquaintance with the person that followed me in, and whether he did not pull off his hat in the passage, and hang it up in the passage; whether I ever spoke to him or he to me? next, which is the last favour, please to ask her whether I offered to strike her till she first assaulted me, by seizing me by the collar of the coat, and charging me with what I was perfectly innocent of? if I had time I could produce the gentleman that sent me there to enquire after a ready furnished house for six months.</p>
               <p>Court. The two men came in together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did both of them speak to you? - When they knocked at the door they asked if the house was to be let; they both went into the parlour, and said it was a pretty parlour; they both went up one pair and two pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080012"/>stairs; only one spoke to me, the other never spoke a word to me.</p>
               <p>Did this man speak to the other at all? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did the other man go up stairs with you? - Yes; they both said it was a pretty parlour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I hope you will hear the truth: I had no intention, as I hope for mercy at a future day from my great Creator, of committing any violence or depredation whatever; I went with this only intion of enquiring what the rent might be, and to know how many rooms there might be on a floor, and what situation the house was in; with respect to the furniture, I never spoke to the man, nor had I any previous knowledge of him, nor did I speak to him in the place; I presumed from his following me in at the door, that he belonged to the house; not speaking to the gentlewoman that let me in, or to me; I neither took any thing, nor attempted to take any thing from the place, nor was it my intention; and further, the only reason of my striking that gentlewoman was in consequence of knowing the aukward predicament I stood in, being a returned convict, before the expiration of my time; and I did not know in what manner to extricate myself from her hands, she having her thumb through the button-hole of my coat; my only apprehension was, I thought I might be taken before a magistrate, and known by those sort of people who make a trade of living on human blood, and of detecting unhappy and unfortunate men for a reward.</p>

               <p>Mrs. De. Petron. The cloak was my own, and the counterpane belonged to a family that lodged last winter in our house.</p>

After what has passed at this trial, it is impossible for you to expect mercy on any terms whatever; upon the first case, though we could not help suspecting all that you said to the Jury was destitute of foundation; and the more so, because you shewed by your conduct, that you were very well practised in the arts of this place; not contented with slating facts which might be easily proved, you artfully laid by to throw in some suggestion after I had stated the case to the Jury; and you have done the same on this second trial; and it is now too apparent, that it will be injustice to the public, ever to suffer you to be at large again to commit such depredations on them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I humbly beg for mercy.</p>

               <p>Had you fastened them when you went out? - I fastened them before I went away, and locked my door; I bolted my window about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>How was it broke open? - It was pulled open, and the bolt fairly off, and the window was open; there were six panes of glass in the half-sash, and it was fairly open.</p>
               <p>Was the glass broke? - No, the glass was not broke.</p>
               <p>How could they pull the window out without breaking the glass? - They pushed the window up, and left it wide open; I went and opened the street door, and unlocked my parlour door, and the people in the kitchen brought a light, and I missed three sheets immediately, and a shawl from off the line.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to impute this to the prisoner? - He was the person I saw in the court.</p>
               <p>You are sure? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough to describe by a certainty that he is the man? - I met him just by the lamp, and gave him the wall, and was going to speak, but was afraid.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to have any thing on him at the time you met him? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Did you hear of your property again? - I did, last Thursday was a week, a person came and told me it was in the advertisement.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You say, as you was coming home, you met a person, but you declined speaking to him? - Yes, I did; he was a tallish man which I met first, and when I went a step or two farther, I saw the prisoner,</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Therefore you had no reason to remark the man? - No; still I thought it odd for one man to come before, and another behind.</p>
               <p>You never had seen them before? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>This was on Sunday? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Are you sure it was so late as five o'clock in the evening? - It was six o'clock when I went out, and I came back a little after seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Had you left any body at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many persons had you left in your house? - Nine persons; there were people in the kitchen, in the one-pair of stairs, and two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>What are they? - They were all married people, and all of them got husbands living with them.</p>
               <p>You have not a single person in your house? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you call to any of these persons to shew them how your shutters had been broke? - I did; the people of the kitchen came up; I cried out, my God, my God! what have you let me be robbed?</p>
               <p>Did you let no one else know immediately that you was robbed? - Yes, I told it to another woman who lives in my house, who has got an husband; he does not come home to sleep.</p>
               <p>How soon did you tell her? - Directly.</p>
               <p>Have you any of these persons here that you gave the alarm to? - No, none.</p>
               <p>Then whether you went out earlier or later, we must rely on yourself for the truth of it; do you know it makes a difference as to this charge, whether it is done in the light? - It was done when it was dark.</p>
               <p>Do you know that it is a capital offence if the matter is done when it is dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That it is a burglary then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then in this house of yours there are nine people living in it, they are all married<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080017"/>women, and it is not true that your house is visited by people not married? - Sometimes servant maids, out of place, are there a week or two, till they are provided.</p>
               <p>Has there never been any enquiry at your house after young apprentices that come after single women at your house? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Was there never an enquiry after an apprentice of the name of Levi, whom it was said was concealed in your house? - Not that I ever heard of.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Holmes? - He has never been above two or three times in my parlour.</p>
               <p>You knew him? - I believe my daughter knew him.</p>
               <p>He visited your daughter at your house? - No, not in my house; I did not admit him into the parlour above two or three times in my life.</p>
               <p>If he did not come into your parlour, he came to your house, did not he? - Yes, but he used to stand at the door, or in the entry; he never spent a pot of beer in my house in his life.</p>
               <p>What became of that Holmes? - He is in Newgate, under sentence of transportation.</p>
               <p>Was there a man of the name of Mantondillon that used to come to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there a man of the name of Roberts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he happened to have the same good luck as Holmes: how long was you acquainted with that man? - I was not acquainted with him; when he came to me, I had a very honest character with him, and he kept to his work, and behaved very honestly while with me.</p>
               <p>Was you never called to account about a pair of silver buckles? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Are you a married woman? - No, I am not; I am a widow, and have been for this six years.</p>

I cannot positively say, whether it was the prisoner or not, but he was in different cloathing to what he was the next day; he brought it in the evening; I do not perfectly know the day; I took no notice of the time; I am clear it was not half past six, if it was six; I told him it was only fit for old iron, he said it was his, and he was obliged to make a fire without it: was found in the front of my shop, the porter said how long have you bought this grate, says I, how long have you lost it? says he, a fortnight; then says I, it cannot be this, because I bought it last night; then says he, by God, it is the very thing I want.</p>
               <p>What do you deal in? - Old iron and cloaths, and second hand things; I suppose if I had said the grate had been stolen for a month the man would have owned it.</p>

               <p>I am a Jew; on Friday morning, I do not remember the day of the month, it was this day five weeks (5th of November) the prisoner called clothes, and he went into a house for a minute or two, and he came out again, and said come this way; I went to him, and he asked me to do him a favour; I said I would if I could; he asked me to go to No. 38, Portland-place, that he was going for a soldier, and was to have five guineas; I shewed him the way, and going along he pulled out a tea-spoon, and asked me two shillings; I felt the weight of it, and offered him one shilling and three pence for it; I bought it of him, and gave it to Mr. Raw the prosecutor; he found me with the prisoner at No. 38, he bid me wait for him, to sell me some more old clothes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What house did I go into? - I do not know, I went in no house with him but a public-house before we got to Portland-place.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found the prisoner and this witness in Portland-place; I took the child with me, and when she saw the Jew standing at the door, she said, daddy, that is one of the men: the prisoner was in the gentleman's house at that time; the child pointed to the Jew, who stood at the door; as soon as the prisoner came out I seized him at the door; the child said that was the man, she knew them both.</p>
               <p>Court to the little girl. You said nothing about the Jew man? - No, Sir, the Jew stood over the way, right opposite our house, at No. 4, during the time the other man came in; they both went together, I am sure of the Jew man.</p>

On Friday the 3d of this month, about six in the evening, I was going down Fleet-lane; I turned up Seacoal-lane; I got up about twenty yards, and I observed the prisoner coming along with a box on his head; I had a suspicion, and turned back, and saw the prisoner turn into Fleet-lane; I followed him; he had taken the box off his head, and put it under his arm, making off very fast; I ran up to him, and I stopped him; I asked him what he had got? says he, it is a box; I asked him the contents? he said, he knew nothing at all of them, that he was going into Fleet-market with it; he said, one Manby knew of it; I knew Manby; he asked me to go up to Manby's house with him; I went, but Manby was not at home; we saw his wife; she said she knew nothing of that box; I took the prisoner to a public house; the box was locked; he wished a person to go to Manby's again; he said he got the box in Holborn, and begged of me to be as merciful as I could; he did not say how he got it; I took the prisoner to Wood-street Compter; a person that is here carried the box; after I had put him in the Compter, I went again to Manby's; he was come home at that time; I told him what had happened; he said he knew nothing of the business.</p>

               <p>I employed Mr. Manby to move my goods from Gray's-inn-lane to Union-court, on the 3d of this month; when the cart came, he sent two men with it; the box and a picture we missed; there was D. A. on the box; it contained the articles in the indictment: (enumerates them): Newman came to me to ask me if I had lost any thing? I went the next day to Guild-hall, and I saw my box and the man; I can swear to the property: (the box produced, and the things deposed to): amongst the other things, there was the certificate of my marriage.</p>

               <p>The case opened by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>May it please your lordship. Gentlemen of the jury. Gentlemen, I am counsel in this case against the two prisoners: the indictment imputes to them the offence of a highway robbery; and as the circumstances by which this offence is to be brought home to them, are attended with some peculiarity, it will be my duty to state to you some of the leading features of the case, and the law as I apprehend it. Gentlemen, in order to constitute the offence of highway robbery, it is unquestionably necessary that an attack should have been made on the persons of those that come to complain, and that their property should have been taken from them against their will, with some degree of force: on this occasion the terror which has been applied to the prosecutor, and which has induced him to part with his money, is not that which has been applied by any weapon threatening him with personal danger, but it is that which, under the authority of all the judges in England, constitutes as effectual a terror in a highway robbery, as if the most tremendous instrument by which personal mischief can be committed, was produced, and threatened to be applied. Gentlemen, the prisoners, as you may collect from their appearance, are soldiers in the guards; the prosecutor of the present indictment is, and for more than twenty years last has been, a porter to a very considerable manufactory in Covent Garden: some time before the 22d of July he was passing through St. James's Park, on his master's business, where he saw the prisoner Templeman then on duty, and discoursing with his fellow soldiers; he was describing something about a person's being drummed out of the regiment; he listened; Templeman asked him to give him something to drink; the man said, there was no publick-house near, or he had no objection; they parted for that time: soon after this, on the 17th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080033"/>August, the time which constitutes the present, among many other complaints; as the prosecutor was passing through Great Queen-street he saw the two prisoners, one of them Templeman, the man he had seen before, crossed the street to him, and said to him, how do you do? the prosecutor said, he was very well; Templeman said, will not you give us something to drink? the prosecutor said, for what reason? to which Templeman made this reply, you know soldiers pay is very small, they cannot live by it, and we must have money some how; the prosecutor said, that was no business of his, they were not to live by him; upon which he swore he would be d - nd if he had not something; the two prisoners joined company, and they both pursued him for a considerable time, threatening him with vengeance, and that they would charge him with an unnatural practice, having behaved indecently to them, and other crimes of the same nature and tendency. Gentlemen, in the publick streets of this great town it is not very much to be wondered at, that the prosecutor should submit to these men; he did so, and gave them half-a-guinea; they pursued him; they insisted he should make it up two guineas, that he should go into a publick-house, and sign a note for the two guineas, and after a great length of pursuit the man parted with seven shillings more of his property, under a promise to meet them at a particular house that was mentioned; at that time he got rid of them. Gentlemen, I know it has been asked by former juries, how it happens that a man submits to part with his money on such an imputation as this; but I am afraid no man is quite equal to the task of deciding how even a wise man, and a man of firmness would act, till brought to the trial; one thing I am quite sure of, that the moment a man has been foolish enough, and indiscreet enough to part with the smallest portion of his money on such a charge, there is no end to the pillage that shall be committed: so it happened on the present occasion, this man having parted with his money, submitted himself to the attack of all the bad men in the regiment, and it forms an important confirmation of the testimony of the prosecutor, so as to involve the prisoners in the guilt. Gentlemen, from time to time the prisoners, sometimes together, sometimes one of them alone, sometimes one of them with other accomplices, continued to harrass this unfortunate man, and extort from the produce of his very hard labour, to the amount of several pounds, in the course of a very few months: I state it to you, that at last worn down by those repeated solicitations, he was driven to apply to a friend, and what passed between one of the prisoners at the bar (for the other was not present at that time) will be extremely material and important for you to take into your consideration. Gentlemen, the prosecutor, Sharpe, after having been repeatedly applied to, and as repeatedly pillaged of his property, applied to a person of the name of Simms, who keeps a greengrocer's shop, for his advice and assistance, and at one of the meetings Simms was present, and he seems to have acted with as much propriety as one would expect; he applies to Templeman, who was with another man, not included in this indictment; coming into the room in which they were together, he says to Sharpe, are these the men that have extorted money from you? this was in the hearing of the prisoner Templeman; the prosecutor said, yes; upon which Simms proceeded to state to them, that he wondered at their conduct, as they were subject to a capital charge, and that he should think they might be in liquor; the reply made by Templeman is of extreme importance; he said, he was not in liquor, he knew very well what he was about, and admitted he was one of those who had already extorted money from the prosecutor: gentlemen, Mr. Simms still proceeded, he said, for God's sake has there ever been any thing indecent passed between you and any of these men? to which the prosecutor protested his innocence, as he will do to night on his oath; and both the persons then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080034"/>present admitted there had been no charge whatever against this man, that they might as well have made the charge against a person a thousand miles off; that they admitted in the most ample, full, and unequivocal manner: upon this they proceeded to write what they called a discharge, Templeman having previously written the letter, which I will read to you;</p>
               <p>"Sir, I should be much obliged to you if</p>
               <p>"you will please to step out to me, I have</p>
               <p>"got something very particular to say to</p>
               <p>"you; I did not like to have talk in your</p>
               <p>"shop, as I thought you would not like</p>
               <p>"it; I expect you to attend me immediately." Gentlemen, in consequence of this the prosecutor went out of the shop, and adjourned to the place, where Simms met them, and the result of the meeting there, when Simms was present was, that the prisoner Templeman wrote this, which he called his discharge, and which was signed by him and another person; -</p>

               <p>"disturb Mr. Sharpe on any pretence</p>
               <p>"whatever." - Gentlemen, the question for you materially will be this, is the story in the main, which the prosecutor, shall tell you, true? is it true that he was attacked by two persons, at the time he will describe to you, on the king's highway, and that in consequence of the conversations I have stated, or indeed alluded to, he parted with his money? if so, the next question is, who were the persons who so procured the money from him? were they the prisoners? about that you will have this evidence; first the positive testimony of the prosecutor, who saw them on several occasions, and who had great reason to observe them; the testimony of Simms, an indifferent witness; and the declaration of these two men themselves, after they were taken into custody. Gentlemen, in justice to them, if it could be of consequence to them, I ought to state the whole of those declarations; they did not deny the circumstance of their having obtained money from the prosecutor; but they seemed to have thought, that if there was any foundation for the charge that they had extorted it, they extorted it with impunity, for they stated before the magistrate, that this man had been guilty of those indecencies, and that in consequence of those indecencies, they obtained the money from him. Gentleman, if a man is of unnatural practices and tendencies, in the name of God let those who know it, and can prove it, thrust him to the bar of criminal jurisdiction; let such a man meet with the punishment due to his merits; but God forbid that should be made a pretence upon which bad and guilty men should extort from the king's subjects the money from their pockets; even if that afforded a defence, if it should throw a shade on the testimony of the prosecutor, such a case does not exist in truth; the man will himself deny it; the man himself will solemnly tell you, that he never saw these men but under the guilty circumstances I have stated, and he will confirm this by the testimony of Simms; and I have material witnesses to shew you that the character of the prosecutor excludes all suspicions of such a kind. Gentlemen, I already hinted to you, that there is a degree of doubt excited in the mind of many a man, when he hears of money being parted from; I have already told you that some of the best men that ever ornamented society, have been weak enough not to be able to bear up under the terrors of accusations against their characters, so alarming and so terrifick as the present; that they have submitted with the most perfect consciousness of innocence, to part with a little trifle of money, to prevent being called into a court of justice. Gentlemen, I shall lay before you the evidence. On the one hand, the growing experience of the times shews us that these accusations, which are very easily made, which are extremely difficult to be refused, which may be made by the worst of men against the best members of society, have grown to an amazing height, and it is a duty you owe to the publick to make the prisoners the sacrifices of their own delinquency, if you believe them guilty; but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080035"/>on the other hand, however much you may abhor and detest the crime imputed to the prisoners, in your abhorrence of the crime you ought not to involve innocent persons in the consequences of guilt. Gentlemen, I have no doubt but you will attend to the evidence with that care and impartiality which ought always, and which, thank God, always does, characterize an English jury. I shall call the witnesses with no anxiety about the result of the case, having no doubt but publick justice will be satisfied.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am foreman of the carpet-warehouse under the Piazza, Covent-garden, and have lived there 24 years; I saw the prisoner Templeman first about a year ago, and coming down the steps into the Park from Dartmouth-street; it was of a Sunday; he was telling some persons something about a soldier being drummed out of the regiment; he said it was very cold; he asked me for something to drink; I said, there was no publick-house near, or I should have no objection; he said, he should soon be off guard; I said, I should not be there. On the 17th of August, about eleven in the forenoon, I was going to Queen's-square, Bloomsbury, to lay down a carpet; I saw the two prisoners near the pump in that street; Templeman left Platt, and crossed to me, and said, How do you do? I says, very well; he says, Will not you give me something to drink? I says, no, for what? He said, every one knows soldiers pay is very small, such as they cannot live by, and we will have money somehow; I said, What is that to me? you are not to live by me; he replied, he would be d - ned but he would have some money; I made answer, in the same language, I would be d - ned if he should from me; he said, if I did not, he would charge me with indecent behaviour; I asked him what he meant by that; he said, that the Duke of York gave such encouragement to soldiers, that he would give them five guineas for charging any man with indecency: Platt, during this conversation, walked slowly on behind him; he took no part in it; then Templeman turned round, and waved his hand for Platt to come to him; accordingly Platt came up, and Templeman says to Platt, he will not give us any thing; they both said they would be d - ned but I should; for I had behaved very indecently to them at a publick-house, one Johnson's, down at Westminster; they both repeated, over and over, that the Duke of York had given a man five guineas lately for charging another.</p>
               <p>Did they explain what indecency you had been guilty of? - Yes; they said I wanted to search his privates; them were the words.</p>
               <p>Who used that expression? - Templeman.</p>
               <p>In the hearing of the other? - Both close together: I said, I was very much surprised that they could behave in such a manner, they knew nothing of me; they said, damn their bloods, they did not care, they had so much encouragement, that they would do it, and if I did not give them money, they would have me pilloried, as a man was in Bond-street, or Hay-hill, or somewhere that way: I being very much alarmed indeed with such threats, I could not tell what to do; I was afraid of my life from the people; I told them, if they behaved themselves like men, there was a shilling for them, and I gave Templeman a shilling.</p>
               <p>What induced you to give that shilling? - Fear, Sir.</p>
               <p>Fear of what? - Fear of being exposed to the people, and my character; I in short was in such terror, that I did not know which way I turned: they said, that would not do; Platt said, what was a shilling between both; they went on abusing me through Gate-street, Little Turnstile, into Holborn, and up Dean-street, still repeating their request, that they would swear indecency against me, and have me punished, if I did not give them more money.</p>
               <p>What were the expressions they made use of? - Damning their eyes but they would swear an unnatural crime against me.</p>
               <p>Repeat the very words. - Them are the very words; d - n your eyes, if you do not give us more money, we will charge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080036"/>you with an unnatural crime; in this way they kept following me for some considerable time, till we came to the top of Red-lion square; then Templeman says to a lad that was there, d - n him, where is a constable, we will charge a constable with him; the lad made no answer; upon which the prisoner Platt said, what should we do that for, he will give us more money. We passed the corner of Red-lion square, they still repeating their demands; there I was so much alarmed; and in Lamb's-conduit passage Templeman swore it would not do, he would have two guineas, and gave me the shilling back; I told them I had not two guineas to give them; they were both close together, both joined in the conversation, all the way; they kept repeating their demands, d - n their eyes if they would not charge me with an unnatural crime: when we came into Lamb's-conduit-street, Templeman said, d - n his eyes, a magistrate lived there, and they would take me before him, if I did not give them the two guineas; I told them, if I had done any thing wrong, to do it; I bethought myself where I was, and I turned back up East-street into Devonshire-street, and to Queen-square; and in Little Ormond-street, by the church of St. George the Martyr, we stopped; there they still demanded two guineas, or else they would follow me the whole day, go where I would; I told them I had not the two guineas; Templeman desired I would go into a publick-house, and give them my note of hand; I told them I would not, let the consequence be what it would; Platt asked me if I had not property enough about me, where was my watch; I told them I had none, but I would give them what I had more about me, which was 7 s. more and upwards; Templeman said that would not do, he would have two guineas, and would follow me the whole day: while we were in this conversation, a well-dressed gentlewoman passed; it took, I believe, her attention; to wave, I suppose, the conversation, Platt said, if your brother's note is not paid tomorrow, we will arrest you: then they said, if I had no more money about me, I should meet them at night, and make it up two guineas: Templeman said they would not let me go; Platt said, let him go, his name is Mr. Reynolds, he lives at No. 5, James-street, Covent-garden, he is a carpenter and undertaker: Templeman said it must be that evening, at 8 o'clock; no other time would do: I said, I did not know I could raise two guineas that evening: Platt mentioned the King's-head, James-street; I appointed the Fountain, Round-court; we did not meet; and we parted: on the Friday following I saw Platt alone; I saw the two prisoners together, the 20th of September, on a Monday, I think, about two in the afternoon, at my master's shop; Templeman opened the door and came in, Platt and another was without the door waiting; I followed Templeman out; in consequence of what passed that day, I went to Mr.

             on the Tuesday; I was so exceedingly uneasy, I could have wished myself out of the world a thousand times: on Wednesday, between 9 and 10, I went with Simms to find the prisoners; they were not on the Parade; they belong to the 2d regiment: on that Wednesday, about one in the afternoon, the prisoner Templeman and another man came into the shop again, and gave me this letter into my hand; he said it was an order from the Duke of York to attend his Royal Highness at the orderly room: Platt was not there at that time: this is the very paper: (Read.)</p>

               <p>"I shall be much obliged to you if you will please to step out to me, as I have got something very particular to say to you; I did not like for to have talked to you in your shop, as I thought you would not like it; I expect you to attend me immediately.</p>

               <p>Upon this letter, I followed him out of the door, and looked at it; I asked him to step along with me, I did not say where, but I went to Mr. Simms's stall, as Simms and me had agreed before; he went with me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080037"/>Simms was not at home; I sent for him; Mrs. Simms went for him: Templeman said I must go directly, for the Duke was waiting in the orderly room, and he would be gone; I said I would not go without a friend, though I had no objection to go; I desired him to stop till my friend came; he said, d - n your friend, what have we to do with him; if you will not go with us, we will fetch them that will make you: Templeman and the other were very abusive; I really was afraid of a mob: I desired them to go to a publick-house and call for a pot of beer, and I would pay for it, but I would not go till somebody came to go with me: they were very clamorous about my going, and we went to the Northumberland-arms, Great Russel-street; Templeman asked me for some writing-paper, and pen and ink, to give me a discharge, never to trouble me on any pretence whatever; Simms was not yet come; I sent a girl for a sheet of paper, and we went into a back room; I left them, o fetch some money; they came down then to a guinea; I came back with Simms, and we both went into the back room; there were Templeman and Smith; Simms asked me whether them were the men that had extorted the money; that was in their hearing; I told him they were two of them: Mr. Simms got up, and came close to them, and said, Good God, you must be in liquor, you cannot be in your senses; they said they were as sober as he; then he told them they could be but little acquainted with the laws of their country, for, had I acted any thing that was improper, they should have taken me to a justice, for by extorting one shilling in the manner they did, it would most likely affect their lives. Simms asked me, Sharpe, have you, or have you not, at any time, behaved indecent to those men? I declared, as I do now, as God shall never receive me, if I ever knew whether they were men or women, or ever took any liberties with them: Templeman said I was innocent of the charge they had laid to me; they both said, he is an innocent man, but we want money, and will have it somehow: I begged from that time forward that they never would think of such a way of life; I said how unwilling I was to take away the life of fellow-creatures; and they said they were very thankful to me, and would never trouble me again: Templeman wrote this paper, and signed one as his own name, that is,

               <p>At that time what money did you give them? - Ten and sixpence. The prisoners were taken into custody the 4th of November. Templeman came to my master's shop between seven and eight in the evening; I went to know what he wanted with me; I said, what are your demands with me? he said, money: I desired him to step with me; he said he knew where I was going; he cared neither for me nor my friend: I sent for Mr. Simms; he was making his demand for money; in about two minutes Simms came; he said, Sharp, what would you have done with this man now? I said, take him to Bow-street: he went pretty peaceable till we came near to the end of Bow-street; then he swore he would be d - ned if he went; Simms collared him; he was very resolute; but we took him to Bow-street: Templeman was secured; the other man, Platt, was taken that evening, in consequence of some information Templeman gave: on the examination before the magistrate I was present, and Platt declared he never saw me before, over and over again: they were examined separate: Templeman said he had something to say that he could not say at the public office; Mr. Bond said that was the time; he said, he was on sentry, in the time of duty; that I came up to him and asked him to drink; he said, he could not till he was off duty; that I said I would go to a publick-house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080038"/>and call for some beer, and he came, and I sat with a pint of beer before me, and I asked him to drink; when that was out, I called for another, and another, and then I asked him where he should be posted the next sentry; he told me it was very uncertain, but he was stationed somewhere at a box facing the recruit-house; it was between eight and nine, or near nine; that I said, halloo, is it you? I said, yes, it is, I know by your voice.</p>
               <p>The result was, that Templeman had said some indecencies passed between him and you in the Park? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoners; are you quite certain to them; are they the two men who on the 17th of August got the ten and sixpence and the seven shillings from you? - Very certain; I saw Templeman four times before he was apprehended, and Platt seven times; I have not the least doubt in the world but they are the two men; they were following me near half an hour.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>In consequence of a representation made by Sharp, I went to the Northumberland-arms, on Wednesday, I am not cert in to the day of the month; I went with the last witness; there I found Templeman and Smith; I went in just before Sharp, and asked them if they did not want the porter at the carpet-warehouse, naming him; they said, yes; Sharp instantly came in, and I arose from my chair, and I said, Mr. Sharp, are them the two men that extorted the money from you? he then said yes; and I asked the two men what they could think of themselves, to threaten a man with such a crime as they had done; I then asked Mr. Sharp whether he was guilty of it or not; he then said, no, he was not; they both of them then declared that he was not guilty; I told them then that it was a very odd sort of life that they had taken, and as they were both young men I would wish them to apply their minds another way; I asked them if they knew the meaning of extorting money, for I thought one shilling extorted would take their lives, or something to that purpose; Templeman then said my talking to them had taken that effect on him that he would not go that way any more: then they got more money: I saw Templeman write the paper, and sign his name, as he pretended, and give it to the other, who made his mark: this is the paper that Templeman wrote.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Platt. Do not you know the sign of the Horse and Groom, in Eagle-street, some years back, a house of a very infamous character? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Whether it was not a house that was used by a person of the same description as Mr. Sharp, who is now confined in New Prison, who knows the connection of Mr. Simms for eight or ten years back, who is of the same description as my prosecutor? he is in New Prison, and we cannot get him out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you ever been married? - I have had three wives.</p>
               <p>Have you had children by them all? - Not by the present, but by the other two I have had a great many, two at a time sometimes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER TEMPLEMAN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The first time I saw the prosecutor was when I was standing at the Cockpit steps; it was within a quarter of three; he asked me the hour; I told him; he asked me if I chose any thing to drink; I told him no, there were so many officers passing, I was likely to come into trouble; he asked me what house I used; I told him we generally used Johnson's, the corner of Queen-square; he asked me what time I came off guard; he said he would be there; I went there, and found him sitting there with a pint of beer before him; when I called for a pint of beer, he said I had no occasion to call for any, he had some; he asked me to sit down by him; I did; he asked me if I chose any thing else; he called for another pint; he asked me how old I was, how long I had been in the regiment, and whether I was married; I told him; he asked me when I went on guard again; I told him at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080039"/>eight o'clock; he asked me what post; I told him I was a sentry at the Bird-cage walk, near the recruit-house; he said he would be sure to be there at eight o'clock; he came, and asked me what it was o'clock; he said he knew my voice; he walked up and down, and asked me several times if I knew one Tillotson, one Jameson, one Stringer; I told him no; he said they were young lads he had a very great regard for, and they had had many pounds of his money; he asked if there were any girls about; he asked me to go into my box; I told him no; he said, you are very hard-hearted; I asked him for what purpose; he went behind my box (if there are any ladies in court, I hope you will desire them to withdraw), and he called me to him; I asked him what he wanted, and he had then unbuttoned his breeches, and got his privates out, and wanted me to feel them, and asked me to feel mine; I said no, is this the purpose for which you have followed me this four or five hours? he immediately buttoned up his breeches; I took hold of him by the collar; my firelock was in my hand, and that was falling down; he got away from me, and I never saw him till the latter end of July or August: going down Queen-street, I was with Platt, and I said, that is the man that used me so ill; he said, how do you do, soldier? I said, how do you do? I mentioned the circumstance; he said, says he, I remember something of it, but I hope you will not hurt me; there is a person behind with a carpet on his head, who belongs to the same shop, and I hope you will not hurt me; he gave me 18 s. 6 d.; says he, I have no more money; if you have a mind to meet me at the Fountain, in Round-court, I will give you another guinea; but, for God's sake, say nothing of it: I took the money, and saw him no more till we went to Mr. Sharp: I was talking with a comrade; Sharp came out and tapped me over the shoulder, and said, do not say any thing, here are five half-crowns, go about your business. I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>

               <p>PRISONER PLATT's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>About the latter end of February, Sharp came to me; I was talking to the sentry; he asked me to have a drop of porter; he gave me a shilling to fetch a pot of porter; I went to the Horse-guards and fetched it; I went to give it to him; he bid me drink, and told me to keep the change for myself: after the beer was out, he went away, and stood by the Horse-guards; he stopped me again, and asked me to have a glass; I told him I would rather not; he asked me my name, and if I could meet him that night, at seven o'clock, at the Black-horse; I told him I could not that night, but the next evening I would; I met him, according to promise; he had a pint of purl and gin, drinking it: just about eight we set off; he paid the reckoning: going up the Park, he kept squeezing my hand, and hugging me; he said it was very cold; he thrust his hand into my breeches, and wanted to kiss me; I knocked him down; he told me then his name was Reynolds, and he lived in James-street, Covent-garden; he was a carpenter and undertaker: when I first found out where he lived, I was waiting for some potatoes; he came out and tapped me over the shoulder, and put five half-crowns in my hand: several other men in the regiment know him. I find Mr. Simms, by all accounts, is as noted a man as any going; he used to live with one Mr. Young, at the Horse and Groom, in Eagle-street, as man and wife.</p>

               <p>If the door had been opened, and the bolts drawn back between those times, should you have heard it? - I am sure I heard nobody; and it was dark when the watchman rang; my wife's mother was in the house, besides the people that have been mentioned; I did not open the door in the night; I found her at her lodgings; nobody was there but herself, from whence I conclude they were her lodgings; on searching her pocket I found a tin box, and to the amount of two pounds six shillings; we found nothing else that belonged to me; there were some duplicates, one for two shillings, the 26th of November; after we had taken her into custody, the officer and me went back to her lodgings, and found a tinder-box which I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You heard no question during the course of the night? - None, it was a remarkable dark morning, it was dusk when I went out; there was a brass kitchen candlestick standing behind the door, without any candle in it, or grease or ashes.</p>

            , for the commission of an offence, which must deserve a severe reprehension; the offence of using fire arms, and shooting at a boat, in the service of the revenue; and likewise at an officer in the execution of his duty; gentlemen you will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080045"/>agree with me, and I dare say, you go before me, in the observation, that the use of fire arms differs most materially from any other obstruction of the revenue; because it is not possible a man should be protected otherwise than by using fire arms against fire arms; and by that means introducing bloodshed; and perhaps the necessity of introducing those who best know the use of fire arms; and by that protection which the law provides: gentlemen, if the last species of protection is in due and fitting cases in time given, it will answer the end of all human punishment; namely, that of mercy to numbers, tho' perhaps of severity to individuals: for if some are deterred from that species of obstruction, which may possibly introduce that which I have alluded to, it may operate with a salutary effect to deter other persons: gentlemen, in the present instance, I would generally state to you, that this is not the sort of a case that some times happens; namely, that a quarrel, small in its origin, may, by the heating of men's minds, rise up to a pitch that was not intended; but you will find, that the intention to use fire arms was deliberate; that the arms were provided at Rotterdam, for the purpose of resisting the officers, if they had met any, and here the first thing that took place, was to fire on any officers they might meet, and they shot one man in the shoulder: gentlemen, on the 4th of November, 1789, a revenue officer, of the name of Vitty, was informed a vessel was expected that night on the coast; he went into a boat, to see whether this vessel had any illicit cargo on board, and it happened that it was so: the night was peculiarly favourable, and particularly bright; they were enabled very easily to discover the vessel, upon this they made towards the vessel, and on coming within thirty or forty yards of it, they were asked who they were: gentlemen, they had understood, that the crew on board were to be met by a person of the name of Ringwood, who had property on board that vessel, and they masked themselves under the name of Ringwood, and said it was Ringwood's boat. [Here the witnesses were ordered to be examined separate]. Gentlemen, upon saying they were Ringwood's, they were invited on board, but having got nearer the vessel, they directed the vessel to bring to; upon this, the vessel fired on them, and the consequence was, one man was shot in the shoulder; the persons on board the vessel could easily distinguish that they were a Custom-house boat, and the men were determined not to proceed any further, but rowed back immediately; the vessel therefore with the cargo escaped, and they effected the purpose for which they made the resistance. Gentlemen, the sum and substance of the whole is this, that with deliberate intention, these people provided themselves with the means, and the only effectual means, of preventing the revenue officers from doing their duty; you know the dangerous nature of their emploment, and it is necessary these officers should be protected, and that this case should be made out in a full, and clear, and satisfactory manner to your understandings; if it is, you will be under the disagreeable necessity of pronouncing a verdict against these persons; but if it should so happen, contrary to my expectations, that there is any ambiguity in the relation, or any uncertainty in the case, you will avoid doing that which is a much greater evil than that these men should escape, namely, that of giving a verdict against men, against whom there is no satisfactory evidence: gentlemen, I trust this case will be made out; but it becomes me to shew you what the witnesses are; one of the witnesses is subject to exception, or at least subject to much scrutiny, being one of those that were on board the vessel; cases like these make it necessary to have such assistance, but he must be very narrowly and carefully watched by you, and if this man was the principal witness, or if he was unsupported by other testimony, unquestionably I should have hardly thought of giving you this trouble; nothing but extreme necessity could have induced me so to do at any rate, but in fact, he is but a confirmatory witness, for you will find by the evidence of Vitty, that they could with ease<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080046"/>discern who the persons were, that were on board the vessel, and you will hear who they were, from one that was invited to go on board; he declined, and he afterwards, in conversation with his fellows, learned from them all the circumstances of the transaction, therefore you have that testimony which will be corroborated by the testimony of all the persons on board: gentlemen, if this story is confirmed in the manner I expect, it will, I hope, be of use, in order to prevent confusion, contest, and bloodshed, on any future occasion; gentlemen, this is the nature of the case, and I shall call the witnesses to prove it.</p>

               <p>Jury. Could you distinguish whether it was a pistol or a gun? - I could not at the distance I was, which was about thirty yards; the ball came close past my ear; I heard it hiss as it past me.</p>

               <p>Court. At the distance of thirty yards, if it had been a pistol, could you have heard the hiss of it? - I do not know whether it was a pistol or a gun; I rather think it must be a gun; I could not tell: a second and a third gun were fired, which hit

               <p>Is it within the limits of the port of Lynn? - Yes; within the limits of the port of Lynn.</p>
               <p>For what purpose was you going on board this sloop? - To take her as a smuggler.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner Breeze's Counsel.</p>
               <p>The nearest distance that you was, was thirty or forty yards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long do you think this might take up? - After I called to them to come to, Graver knew me very well, and the shot was fired immediately.</p>
               <p>How long do you think this might take up? - Very little time.</p>
               <p>You were glad to sheer off, no doubt? - After we got the man wounded, we were glad; I would have staid, but could not.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - I live two miles from Hunstanton, and two miles from Thornham.</p>
               <p>This was so late ago as November, 1789? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Breeze I believe was not taken up, till May following? - No.</p>
               <p>I believe you know Breeze lived at Hunstanton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you been there frequently between the 4th of November, and May? - Frequently.</p>
               <p>Had you seen Breeze frequently in that time? - I had seen him, but did not know him.</p>
               <p>Therefore you knew perfectly well, that Breeze was at Hunstanton? - As far as I knew.</p>
               <p>How many times did you see him at Hunstanton? - I cannot say; I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Therefore you have seen Breeze at Hunstanton several times? - I have, several times.</p>
               <p>And he, as of course every body in that part of the country did, knew that you was a custom-house officer? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Was he taken at Hunstanton? Yes he was, by a warrant.</p>
               <p>I believe he was in custody at Norwich, and to be tried there, but the trial was put off, on affidavit of the absence of Harris? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know where Harris was? - He was at sea, somewhere.</p>

               <p>You say, when you first came up to the vessel, they called to you, and asked what boat it was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now when you came to, you say Mr. Vitty told them they must heave to, or they would fire into them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That, you are sure Mr. Vitty said? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you are sure, that before any thing else passed, Vitty said to them, heave to, or I will fire into you? - Yes; before they fired upon us.</p>
               <p>And you are sure, that Vitty made use of that expression; that was the first beginning of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>We have not learned that from him; now you say, that you are sure, that the people distinguished Vitty, for they said that is Vitty, that is standing on the stern of the boat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That you are sure of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I take it that was said loud enough for every body in the boat to hear? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They pointed and said that is Vitty, that is standing on the stern of the boat; every body on board your boat might hear it? - I cannot tell whether every body on board heard it, but I heard it; I was standing right forward.</p>
               <p>Was it spoke loud enough for every body to hear it? - Yes; it was spoken loud.</p>
               <p>Now you are sure it was the third gun that hit you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The third gun was the last gun that was fired? - There was another after they turned the boat round that did not hurt us.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080050"/>You told us there were six people in the custom-house boat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then there were only five people on board the Mary? - Yes, there were six of them.</p>
               <p>That you are sure of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Every body might see there were six? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was the third gun that hit you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>These people were all on deck, were they? this was a deck vessel? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All the six people were on deck? - They were on deck some time, some of them went below.</p>
               <p>Were they all on deck at one time, so that you could very plainly perceive there were six? - Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>That you could plainly see from your boat? - Yes, it was very bright, indeed.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At Thornham.</p>
               <p>How far is that from Hunstanton? - Four miles.</p>
               <p>Do you know Hunstanton well? - Yes, I have been there frequently.</p>
               <p>Was you there after this matter happened? - I was not there at all to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was not this man, Breeze, in Norwich gaol last summer? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>He expected to be tried? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe you went into Norwich gaol, did not you? - I went in to speak to one Dennis.</p>
               <p>Now I ask you this upon your oath, did not you declare in Norwich gaol, that a man there of the name of Hook was the man that struck you? and I will call two persons witnesses; did not you declare in Norwich gaol, that a man of the name of Hook was the man that shot you? - No, my Lord, I was very fuddled when I was there; I do not know that I ever saw such a man; I just saw Breeze in the yard one morning.</p>
               <p>What did you go into Norwich gaol for? - To speak to the two Dennis's that were there.</p>
               <p>Were they acquaintances of yours? - Yes, very old people.</p>
               <p>Were they prisoners? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What for? - They were bound for their son.</p>
               <p>And they were there for debt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you went there, they were on the debtor's side; how came you to see Breeze? - I was walking about there a good while.</p>
               <p>Have you a clear recollection that you was walking about there a good while? - I was walking out of one room into another, but I was very fuddled.</p>
               <p>What did you go the Dennis's about? - I just went to speak to them as neighbours do, to let them know their wives were well.</p>
               <p>Did not you there declare that one Hook was the man that shot you? - No, your honour, I never said such a word; I said that how I would freely forgive this man; I did not want to hurt him, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Did not you declare there that one Hook was the man that shot you? - No, Breeze, I said was the man.</p>
               <p>And you said, in the gaol that Breeze was the man that fired the gun at you, and shot you? - Yes; I am not sure that I said so at the time; I was very fuddled, but the people tell me so since.</p>
               <p>Did you, in the gaol at Norwich, last summer declare, that Breeze was the man that shot you? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you declare, and point to the man, that Hook was the man that shot you on that occasion, on the 4th of November? - If I did I was greatly mistaken.</p>
               <p>I ask you, if you did or did not? - I am not advised of it; and I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did or did not? - I cannot say, I was fuddled; I should be very loth to take a false oath; I am sure I would not not do it for the world.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that you did not there declare that Hook was the man that shot you? - I will not; if I did, it was not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was not the trial at Norwich put off on account of your absence? - So I have understood, I do not know.</p>
               <p>And was you at Norwich during the assizes? - No, I came from Swansea.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080051"/>Upon your oath did not you go into the gaol at Norwich, to see the person who was confined on this charge, and had been concerned in this transaction? - No, that I did not.</p>
               <p>That you swear you did not? - I knew the man before for several years.</p>
               <p>Did not you go to see the person that was confined on this charge, to tell whether you could know him or not? - To the best of my knowledge I never asked for the man.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect perfectly the errand for which you went to the gaol? - I know that the coachman told me, who carried me up, that I went to enquire after the Dennis's; I was so fuddled that I did not know how to walk in the gaol.</p>
               <p>Why you walked about the rooms, you have just now told me? - I went into the room where Miles sleeps, he is the man that

                  drew

               <p>Are you sure that you was with Miles on that occasion on that day? - Yes, I might, but I do not know that I did that day, when I went into the prison at first.</p>
               <p>Were you in the prison more than once? - Yes, I was there twice; I went once to receive a letter to carry to Dennis's wife.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the purpose that originally carried you to Norwich gaol, or to see whom? - To see the Dennis's.</p>
               <p>That was the reason that carried you there? - Yes, the whole reason.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. They desired you to call for a letter to carry to their wives? - They sent a man to me the next morning to tell me to call.</p>
               <p>Did you know a man of the name of Hook? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You have never seen a man of the name of Hook? - Yes, I saw a man at Wells of the name of

               <p>Not in Norwich gaol? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you know a Hook at Hunstanton? - I may know the man by sight, but I did not know the name.</p>
               <p>Who else did you see in the prison the day you went to see the Dennis's; did you see Mr. Simpson? - Who is that?</p>
               <p>Why the turnkey? - Yes, I must see him; somebody let me in.</p>

               <p>Will you swear you had no conversation with Mr.

               <p>Did you see a man of the name of Lawes there? - No, I do not know that I did, I might, I cannot say, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You went to prison for the purpose of seeing the two Dennis's? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>You was very fuddled when you went to prison? - Yes, I was very fuddled when the man first took me; I was fuddled when I went into Norwich.</p>
               <p>And was you more fuddled when you went into the prison? - Yes, I drank in Norwich.</p>
               <p>Did you get any more liquor when you went into the prison? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>You do not remember having accused a person of the name of Hook being the man that shot you? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>When you was on board this boat, you was in the bow of the boat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you was the nearest man to the vessel? - I was.</p>
               <p>You had known the sloop before, and seen her after? - Yes, I had been on board of her.</p>
               <p>And although you could not read, yet the mark in her stern was the mark by which you knew her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now I will ask you again, after all you have heard, after all the questions that have been asked you, are you sure that Breeze was the man that fired the musquet, by which you think you was wounded? - Yes, I saw it in his hand, and he laid it across the rail.</p>

             any time in November 1789? - I cannot say rightly that it was 1789.</p>
               <p>Was it the last November but one? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Where was it? - At Hunstanton.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what the day was? - I cannot say exactly what day it was, but I think it was on Gunpowder Treason.</p>
               <p>Was it the day after this transaction happened between the sloop Mary and the Custom-house boat? - Yes, it was the day after it was reported.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him about that transaction? - Yes, we talked about many sorts of things.</p>
               <p>Recollect, as well as you can, whether he said any thing, and what he said relative to the sloop Mary? - Yes, he told me he came on shore at a place called Hulcombe Bar; he did not tell me from what vessel.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tell you when he came on shore? - No, he did not; he only said he came on shore from Hulcombe Bar, without saying when or from what place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Litchfield. He did not tell you in what vessel he came ashore? - No, Sir, nor when.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him, respecting the Custom-house officers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Relate, as accurately as you can, what that conversation was? - He told me that he shot at a boat, that he supposed was a Custom-house boat.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say when? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation about a thing that had happened lately, or a thing that had happened ten years ago; what did your conversation turn upon? - Why, my Lord, it was about a vessel that had lately fired on the Custom-house officers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Litchfield. How lately? - I cannot say; he did not exactly say what time it was.</p>
               <p>Did he say who was in the boat? - No, he did not, to my knowledge; but he said he supposed it to be the Custom-house boat.</p>
               <p>Did he say what vessel he himself was in? - No, he did not mention the vessel.</p>
               <p>Did he say in whose company he was? - No, he did not, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself, Mr. March, remember you must tell us the whole truth? - Yes, I will tell you the truth as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Well do then; did he mention any other person's name that was in company with him at the time he fired on this boat? - He told me he was along with one Graver, that one Graver was master of her.</p>
               <p>Master of her; what did you understand by her? - Master of the vessel which he was on board.</p>
               <p>What led to this conversation between you and Breeze? - Led! Sir.</p>
               <p>What occasioned it; what brought it on? - By reason I had some goods in this vessel, and I went to his house to hear.</p>
               <p>In what vessel had you some goods? - It was a vessel that Graver was master of.</p>
               <p>What is her name? - They call her the Mary.</p>
               <p>And you had some goods on board the Mary, and you went to Breeze's house to hear of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you had not much doubt about what vessel he was talking of? - I paid very little regard to it, but I knew what vessel he was mentioning.</p>
               <p>Now the next day, recollect yourself, and tell me whether you did not go on board this vessel? - Yes, I did; it was the Saturday after Gun-powder Treason, that I went on board of her.</p>
               <p>That was the next day? - I cannot say as to the next day.</p>
               <p>Who did you see when you went on board of her? - I saw

               <p>Look at him again, and tell me whether you saw that man on board, whatever his name may be? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did you know Jack at that time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I submit that is not evidence against this man.</p>
               <p>Court. You have evidence that Graver was the captain, but what he said cannot be used as evidence against these men.</p>

               <p>Court. It either signifies something or nothing; if it applies at all to either of these prisoners, what another man said, as tending to prove the fact upon the prisoners, I apprehend cannot be evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Litchfield. If we shew that Jack was was on board, then it will be evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. How far you may make it evidence by intervening evidence is not before the Court now; but the point is settled, that what a man says about a person who was not present, is not to be received as evidence against that prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Litchfield. You did not know Jack before? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now we are in December? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is a long while ago that you are talking of? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>When were you applied to, to recollect any conversation of this sort? - What, of these people.</p>
               <p>Yes? - I cannot say when it was.</p>
               <p>I take it that is a particular thing; have you often been witness in a court of justice? - No, Sir, never before this time.</p>
               <p>Cannot you recollect what time you was applied to, to be a witness? - I cannot indeed; I think I was applied to in June following.</p>
               <p>In June? - Yes, I believe it was in June.</p>
               <p>That you are sure of? - Yes, I am sure it was in June.</p>
               <p>Mr. Litchfield. Where did you expect your goods from? - From Rotterdam.</p>
               <p>Was you ever applied to, to go on board this vessel the Mary, by Graver? - Yes, I was asked to go over with her.</p>
               <p>What were your reasons for refusing to go on board?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I submit that is not evidence.</p>
               <p>March. I refused, because they put it to me, that they meant to have some guns, and I did not like it, and I would not go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Breeze lived in Hunstanton; did not he? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was there publicly seen by every body? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Do you live at Hunstanton yourself? - No, Sir, I live ten miles off.</p>
               <p>Had you seen Breeze before he was taken up? - Yes, Sir, frequently, I saw him in his own house, when I saw him.</p>
               <p>He has a wife and four children? - I cannot say how many children he has.</p>
               <p>You know that the shooting with firearms was a capital offence? - I thought it was a thing that I should not have done.</p>
               <p>You know very well that it is an offence for which a man is liable to be hanged? - Yes, it is so reported.</p>
               <p>Was you ever in conversation with a man who told you he had committed a murder? - No.</p>
               <p>Never? - No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080054"/>Was you ever in company with a man who told you he had committed a highway robbery? - No.</p>
               <p>This man was telling you, glibly enough, that he had been guilty of a capital offence? - Yes, he said he had shot from the vessel.</p>
               <p>That made no impression on your memory? - Yes, I thought about it.</p>
               <p>But not so far as to take any notice of dates, or places, or any thing of that sort? - No.</p>
               <p>Pray what may you be? - I am a labourer, I go to sea now.</p>
               <p>In what way do you go to sea? - In a smack of my own, a little sloop.</p>
               <p>Was you in any visible way of employment last year? - Yes, I was a day labourer, and the things helped me that I sent for over.</p>
               <p>Did you get your bread as a day labourer? - Yes, and it was labour for these things helped me.</p>
               <p>So you dealt a little in smuggling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath now, did you work as a day labourer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How often in a week? - I cannot say that, some weeks I laboured the whole week.</p>
               <p>You, I suppose, took your leisure about day labouring? - Yes, Sir, I worked when I was forced to it.</p>

               <p>Jury. Pray Sir, tell us whether or no those two pistols that were fired by Hart, were small pistols or large ones? - They were pistols about an arm's length.</p>
               <p>Was that near enough to do execution? - I do not know what a pistol will do, they were good large stout pistols; I do not know the consequence of a pistol.</p>
               <p>Did Hart fire the same pistol twice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you say that there were no more than three fires? - No more than three.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. So the evening was not very dark? - It was a fine evening, but whether the moon shone, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Could you see your hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You heard them say they must heave to, or else they would fire into you? - I heard them say heave too, I did not hear the other.</p>

               <p>Where did you come from to give your evidence; where did you come from last into this Court? - From Norwich.</p>
               <p>No, but you came from Newgate, did not you, here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From what part of Norwich did you come from to Newgate? - I know nothing about Norwich.</p>
               <p>Did not you come from the gaol of Norwich? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They were going to hang you for this; was not they? - I was taken up.</p>
               <p>You expected to be hanged? - I did not do any thing to be hanged for; though it was done, it was against my will.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have not you said, that you should be hanged, unless you could give evidence against any body? - I never said such a word in my life.</p>
               <p>You are perfectly sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You cannot be mistaken in that? - I am not mistaken.</p>
               <p>And you know very well you would have been prosecuted for a capital offence if you did not give evidence? - I know it was contrary to my will, and I sent to the gentlemen directly.</p>
               <p>Now, that is every thing but an answer; I ask you if you did not expect to be prosecuted unless you gave evidence; do you understand me? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to say, man, that you, being concerned in smuggling, did not know that it was a capital offence to fire on custom-house officers? - Certainly it is a bad fact.</p>
               <p>Do not you know it is a fact that affects people's lives when they are convicted? Look at the Gentlemen of the Jury, and speak out; why do you hesitate, man? I will give you as much time as you like; I will repeat the question. - I hope the law will be more merciful.</p>
               <p>I dare say you, being an old smuggler, do wish it may be so; upon your oath, do you, or do you not, know that it is a capital offence to shoot at a custom-house officer? - Yes, I do; but I did not understand you, indeed.</p>
               <p>Do you mean now to tell the Jury that you did not understand that question; was not you taken up for this offence? - I was taken up, and put into Norwich gaol.</p>
               <p>Did not you expect to be prosecuted for that offence? - Yes; I know it is at your mercy.</p>
               <p>You know you are not to be prosecuted; as you have given evidence, it would be very wrong you should; you know you are King's evidence, and you are not to be prosecuted? - I do not know that I am not, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not expect now to be prosecuted? - I hope in God I shall not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You are the turnkey of Norwich gaol? - I am.</p>
               <p>Do you know Harris? - From his coming into the gaol to speak to Breeze; this is the man.</p>
               <p>Was he ever in Norwich gaol at the time that Breeze was in custody there? - He was: an affidavit being made in Court, when Breeze should have been tried, that an evidence was at sea, the trial was put off; that evidence was Harris: the prisoner was then told by the counsel, that he might be bailed out at the next assizes; on my going to the learned Judge, to inform him that bail was ready, his Lordship informed me there was a mistake, he must remain in prison; on my return back, I found Harris in the prison, and he being a stranger, I asked him who he was, and what he wanted; he said, he came to speak to Breeze; says I, have you ever seen him? he said, yes, here he sits; and that was another man, and not Breeze; the man's name was Hook, he was along with the debtors, he was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Was Breeze present at that time? - He was not present; for we never suffer any body to speak to a felon but in the presence of the turnkey, in our prison.</p>
               <p>In your judgement was the man so drunk at that time that he did not know what he was about? - I do not know, Sir, but he might have been drinking; but I asked him why he was not there the day before, and he said it was late before he came into the town.</p>
               <p>That was a sensible answer to that question? - Yes; another witness, who you will call, will prove that he got a lodging for Harris.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be in a drunken, insensible state, not to know what he did? - No, Sir; he did not appear so to me, indeed; he appeared to be come from a journey, but he did not appear to be so drunk and insensible; I asked him personally, myself, says I, how long have you known Breeze? his answer to me was, three or four years; I then told him that was not Breeze; he told me he knew Breeze better than I did.</p>
               <p>You are in a place of considerable trust, how long have you been in that place? - Ten years; I believe I am pretty well known<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080057"/>to some of the Gentlemen at the Bar, and to the learned Judge.</p>
               <p>I believe Scott was in your custody? - He was.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear him say any thing respecting his giving evidence? - Yes; we had an order to keep Scott separate; the gaol being in a state of repair, we were obliged to lock him up in a room by himself; Scott asked me to let him out into the yard an hour or two in a day for the benefit of his health; I told him I dare not do it without the order of a magistrate; because, if any thing should be done to him, any personal hurt, we should be deprived of an evidence for the crown: he said he hoped the poor men would not come to any hurt, for if he did not swear against somebody, he should be hanged himself; and that he should not have said any thing, if his wife had not persuaded him, that he might come home to his family: I said I thought it very strange that Breeze did not flee for it as well as he had done; for Scott had fled the country, and he and Hart were taken up on suspicion of a robbery; that was the way they came to be taken up: his answer to that was, he did not know any thing he did; he hoped the poor man would not come to any hurt, for the sake of his babes.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure he made use of that expression, that if he did not swear against somebody, he should be hanged himself? - I hope I know better than to come into a court of justice to say any thing that is not true.</p>
               <p>That is to the best of your recollection? - Them were the words he made use of.</p>

               <p>Did Harris say any thing about Hook before you mentioned the mistake to him? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Did you know Breeze? - I never knew him till he was brought into custody.</p>
               <p>You do not know, in point of fact, whether he did stay at home or not? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney-General. I know you perfectly well; but I will ask you a few questions: the truth is, that you apprized Harris of his mistake? - I did, Sir: Hook was not a debtor, but he came in to see the debtors; but I have since heard that Hook was a brother-in-law of Breeze's; Hook is a man perfectly well known, he belongs to Thornham.</p>
               <p>Still he persisted in it, that that man was Breeze? - He did; and he acknowledged since the trial came on to two or three people who can prove it; he acknowledged he charged a wrong man: I said to him, how long have you known Breeze,

            ? says he, two or three years: I should be very sorry to tell an untruth.</p>
               <p>Harris. Your honour, I said I might do it, but I was so fuddled I did not know; I did not deny it to this gentleman.</p>
               <p>Did he say he was drunk at the time? - No, Sir, he did not: he said so to me.</p>
               <p>Did this Harris, in conversation with you just now, say he had been drinking? - Yes, he said that, and that he charged a wrong man: I knew none of the parties but Mr. Vitty; I have known him for years; and a more respectable character, I take upon me to say, is not to be found in Norwich, or any where else.</p>
               <p>You do not know where March had been before he came into the prison? - No.</p>
               <p>Had he any liquor in the prison? - We do not sell any; our rules and orders are for debtors and their friends to be allowed one quart of beer a day for themselves and guests.</p>
               <p>He was not then so disguised in liquor as not to give a reasonable answer? - I perceived the man was tired.</p>
               <p>With respect to the expression that Scott used, if he did not swear against somebody, he should be hanged himself, did that give you the impression that he would accuse any body wrongfully, or that he should save himself by turning King's evidence? - Indeed I supposed, by what he meant by it then, that he meant he should save himself by turning King's evidence; it impressed me in that way; for I am always most willing to take the most favourable side.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you, that, although he knew nothing of the matter, he would swear what was untrue? - No, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080058"/>What impression did the other expression give you, that he should have said nothing about it, if his wife had not persuaded him; did you collect that he knew nothing of it, or that his wife had persuaded him to become King's evidence? - It struck me in the light that he would turn King's evidence, to get home to his family.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What passes in a person's breast you cannot tell? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>But he did say, that if he did not give evidence against somebody, he must be hanged himself? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did you at all suspect, from Harris's appearance at that time that he made this declaration, that he was at all in liquor? - I do not think it; he came twice to see them, and there was a note that he sent, that he did not know them, and would not know them when he came before the judge.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long did Harris persist in that error? - He went away in that manner: I sent for Breeze out, and brought him up among the debtors.</p>
               <p>How came he to discover his error? - That was on the Friday; he came again, and signed a note; he did not see Breeze on the Friday again; I met him again on the Saturday, the 31st of July, in the market; I said, John, you must be very cautious of what you swear at the trial, for I shall certainly be obliged to swear; oh, says he, I do not care, I know him very well.</p>
               <p>Do you think there is much personal resemblance between these two men? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>Did he seem sober the next day? - Quite so; and so he was on the Saturday.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then in your judgement did he appear to be far gone in liquor? - He was when I first went into the prison, but he slept in Miles's bed I suppose two hours, and when he awaked he still persevered in calling him so; I then asked him, how long he had known Breeze; he said he had known him three years or more; I asked him if he was often in his company; he said many times in the course of that time.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you a housekeeper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did he say any thing about this Hook? - He said, pointing to Hook, I am wounded, and you are the very man that wounded me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Harris, after he had slept there two hours, see that man again whom he called Breeze? - Yes; Hook did not quit the room.</p>
               <p>Was it after or before he slept that he said to Hook, you are the man that wounded me? - Both before and after, not only once, but several times.</p>
               <p>Are Breeze and Hook at all alike? - Not in the least, nor in size.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Wood.</p>
               <p>What was Hook's Christian name? - Thomas: I asked him; he said his name was Thomas.</p>
               <p>You say he was in liquor in prison? - I saw him in liquor when he was in prison; he was asleep for two hours, and with his eyes open, which was very remarkable; he was there till six at night.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ever see Harris sober? - Yes, Sir; I saw him sober the next day in the prison.</p>
               <p>Did he still persist in his error? - Equally so.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Hook present the next day? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wood. Did not you tell him, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080059"/>Breeze's name was Robert, and not Joseph? - I did not tell him that, I did not contradict him in any thing.</p>
               <p>Hook is Breeze's brother-in-law, is not he? - So I understand.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you related to either of the parties? - No, Sir; quite a stranger; I never saw either of them till they came to Norwich.</p>

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice ASHURST.</p>
               <p>Foreman of the Jury. My lord, it is the earnest wish of my brethren, and myself, that you will recommend the prisoners to mercy.</p>
               <p>Court. I am desired to ask you, gentlemen, the reason you found your application on.</p>
               <p>Jury. The reason we make this application is, the bad characters of some of the witnesses, and the notorious one of him who led the prisoners into this crime, and who has escaped justice.</p>

               <p>The case opened by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury: Gentlemen, I am of counsel in this case for the prosecutor against the two men at the bar; and it has very often been my fortune to stand in this place, in the situation in which my learned friend stands to-night, called upon to do the best in the compass of my power, to defend real or supposed innocence: Gentlemen, I have not taken leave of the feelings which must necessarily operate on the minds of advocates<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080061"/>placed in so painful a situation, in a place too in which by the wisdom of the law it is denied to the advocate, on the part of his client, to make any address in his defence; all that it is permitted to us who stand as counsel for prisoners, is to endeavour, by such questions as may occur to us, to impress on the minds of the Jury observations tending to excite distrust of the evidence, and to evince that which we are instructed is the truth of the case. On the present occasion, Gentlemen, I feel this to be a very momentous enquiry indeed: on the one hand, the lives of two of our fellow citizens are at stake; the best interests of society, on the other hand, are at stake; and therefore it is material that you, under the direction you shall receive from the Court, should lend your very, very best attention to the minutest circumstance that on the one hand may go to make up the degree of guilt imputed to the prisoners, or that on the other hand may weigh in the scale of innocence. Gentlemen, the prisoners are charged with a highway robbery; and in point of law, if the facts are made out, which it will be necessary for me, on the part of the prosecution, to make out, I must shew to you that the prosecutor of the present indictment has parted with goods to the defendants, on some terror inducing him to dispose of his property not agreeable to his own will: in the ordinary case of highway robbery, you have evidence laid before you, that either a pistol, a cutlass, or some other deadly or offensive weapon, has been produced with circumstances of terror to the man that complains he has lost his property; on the present occasion you will have no such evidence; the prisoners have obtained of the prosecutor his goods, by the apprehension that his character would be ruined unless he parted with his property. Gentlemen, I know of no times in the legal history of the jurisprudence of this country, in which it has been doubted that such a terror applied to any man constituted that force necessary to make a highway robbery; but if at any time it has been doubted, such doubts are quieted and removed by the determination of all the judges of England; they have declared that, if by menaces used by prisoners threatening to charge the prosecutor with an unnatural crime, or with unnatural and unmanly practices, it is as much in the eye of the law a highway robbery as if they should have knocked him down, or produced a blunderbuss or pistol, or any other weapon; therefore, Gentlemen, as you were not the Jury that attended in that place yesterday, of the law then and now laid down there can be no doubt: Gentlemen, I shall now proceed to state to you some of the circumstances in the case, avoiding by choice to be extremely particular about them, by which the guilt of the prisoners is to be imputed to them in evidence; they are, as you may observe by their appearance, soldiers in the Coldstream regiment of guards; one of them, I may state to you without prejudice, I mention it because it is inseparable from the story now to be told you; one of them is already convicted of a similar offence; and he, together with an unfortunate man now under the sentence of the law, is stated to have applied in the streets of this town to the prosecutor, Mr. Sharp, and by threats that they would accuse him of the abominable practice to be stated to you by the witness, obtained from him a sum of money, which was the subject of another prosecution: Gentlemen, I apprehend when once a man has been weak enough to part with the smallest portion of his property, he is the constant marked object of the man that has first made the application; the mind cannot resist the impression, the overbearing and overwhelming impression, that this observation makes upon it, How came you to give money to a man, if you was innocent; if you was innocent of a crime that most disgraces human nature? Therefore, if a man is taken in an unprepared moment, and has the misfortune once to part with any of his property, experience shews us it is extremely difficult to stop the torrent of oppression, and to say, so far it shall proceed, but no further: Gentlemen, the unfortunate victim of the attacks of these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080062"/>men, was prevailed upon to part with a considerable portion of his money, considerable as every thing must be according to the situation of the party; he parted with nine or ten pounds; the men were all soldiers in the Coldstream regiment; sometimes a man came with an old accomplice, then he came with a new one: Gentlemen, at last, worn out, the prosecutor applied to an old friend, a Mr. Simms; Simms directed him to take them to a magistrate, and to make application to the laws; it happened that the attack was repeated; and that which forms the subject of the present enquiry is an application made to him, at his master's house, by the prisoner Roberts; he had seen Platt several times before; Roberts, on the 28th of October, came to him, and knocked at his master's door, and procured some money; but this charge will be the attempt of the 2d of November, between seven and eight, when Roberts came to that house, having on a former day said that he came from a soldier, and that they were draughted to go abroad, and wanted money; he told him, he was come now for the last time, that they were absolutely going off on the morrow morning; that they wanted some money before they went; that, as it was the last time, half-a-guinea would do now: on this man's saying he really had not it, but would go out and borrow it, then he joined company with the prisoner Platt and some other soldiers, and they obtained from him 10 s. 6 d. Gentlemen, on the law there can be no doubt, if the money has been obtained in the manner and under the threats I have stated to you, it is a highway robbery; but there is still, Gentlemen, a most important and very anxious question remaining behind; if that which constitutes a highway robbery has been committed, by whom has it been committed? Gentlemen, beyond all question by the two prisoners at the bar, if you believe the witness, the prosecutor; if you believe him, he will tell you he had frequent opportunities of knowing the persons of them both, which makes it beyond all question that they were the men; he will state to you the conversations he had with them, which will put it out of all doubt: Gentlemen, it is my duty to make these observations to you; and it occurs, in prosecutions of this nature, to ask the question, Has the witness a fair, honest, unimpeached, irreproachable, and untainted character? Is he a man singled out by the villainy of others, for the purpose of having this sort of charge made upon him? because, as I stated yesterday, the best men in society may be the victims of those charges, on the prosecution of the worst men that disgrace human nature; but if a bad man should come forward, Juries will look anxiously into the character of the person making the accusation: Gentlemen, as a lawyer, I hold myself intitled to state to you, that it could make no difference in the case, if you should be persuaded that a man had been guilty of the filthy practice which this extortion states; still, if these men, instead of dragging him to the courts of justice, chuse to gratify their own avarice, it would still be a highway robbery; but God forbid that, whilst we in this country have the benefit of trial by jury, any such law should be stated as governing the decision of the case: Gentlemen, I ask your verdict for the publick on this plain, manly, and intelligible ground; Do you, on the result, believe all the witness tells you? If you believe him, when he states himself to have been an innocent and poor man, to have been under the terror of such accusations, of such threats, borne down by the apprehension of danger, and induced to part with his property; if you believe the story he tells you, publick justice, publick security, demand that the prisoners at the bar should be made victims to that publick justice and to that publick security; but, on the other hand, I feel I should disgrace the situation I hold in society, I feel I should dishonour the gown I have now the honour of wearing, if I did not state this to be my opinion; That if you should find the prosecutor, in the course of his evidence, equivocating with truth, tampering with justice, concealing any part of that which the intelligent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080063"/>eye of a Jury should see, on all occasions; if there be any contamination in his character, and he appears interposing other men between himself and danger, dragging others forward, to be placed in that peril that is due to his own crimes; I for one, say, God forbid, that their blood should be sacrificed on the testimony of such a witness; therefore, I on the part of the prosecutor, invite your serious attention, aye, and I beg leave to crave the superintending attention of the Court too; if on this occasion, my learned friend should be able to call witnesses to you, who should cast a shade on the character and conduct of the prosecutor, and on that evidence which he will now give on his oath, in the name of God, Gentlemen, let the prisoners have the advantage of the doubt; it it is better, it has been often said, that guilty men should escape from the difficulty of proof, and the doubt that hangs over that proof, than that you and the sacred administrators of justice sitting on this bench, should run the risk of dooming to death a fellow creature, on precarious or uncertain evidence. Gentlemen, I have feebly done my duty thus far; I have addressed you, as I am informed you are to expect that a shade will be attempted to be cast on the testimony of that witness; on the one hand you have an important duty upon you, to take care that you do not give too much credit to the evidence of a witness coming forward; and on the other hand, it is your duty to the publick, it is your duty to a private individual, the prosecutor, to attend to his testimony. Gentlemen, you owe it to your oaths, to your consciences, and to your God, to get at the truth by the best lights that the evidence shall afford you, and to give a just and satisfactory credit on the present occasion Gentlemen, I shall conclude my address to you, with hoping, and intreating, that the God of all truth, may lead you to that which is the right and proper mode of investigation, in this important case.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I understand you are the porter at a carpet warehouse under the Piazza, Covent-Garden? - Yes; I am the foreman there; I have lived there 24 years last August: on the 27th of August, I, for the first time, saw the prisoner Platt.</p>
               <p>He was then in company with a man of the name of Templeman? - Yes; Templeman and Platt, and some other soldiers of the Coldstream regiment, procured money from me, from time to time; on the 28th of October, was the first time; I saw Roberts about half past seven in the evening, he came to my master's shop-door, he asked whether a person did not live there, of the name of Sharpe; I heard him; I was called; I was in the back part of our shop, which is long; I saw a soldier which was Roberts; I asked him what he wanted with me, he said he came from some soldier which he named, but I do not recollect it, he said, did I know none of the Coldstreamers; I did not know they went by that name then; I said no; he asked me if I knew him, or not; I told him no, I was clear I had never seen him before in my life, to my knowledge; he said very possible, but if I would step round the corner, there was a young man there, a soldier, which I should know; I answered him, that I should go amongst none of them; he said he only wanted half a crown for the soldiers, that had been with me before, for them to drink, before they marched, which would be the next morning, for they were going abroad; I told him, it was an extraordinary thing, that a man with a rational understanding should come to demand money, whom I had never seen before; I am very clear, this was the prisoner Roberts.</p>
               <p>Upon the next Tuesday, the 2d of November last, did you see the two prisoners? - Yes; it was about half past seven in the evening; I heard a person ask for me by name, which I think was Roberts; I went to the door; the two prisoners were close to the door, but Roberts was nearest; I asked them what they wanted; Roberts said the preceding night that they were going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080064"/>abroad, and would never trouble me more; I told Roberts, you said I was to see them no more; they were both together: Platt says, you gave my friend two bad shillings in the three, the other night; for I gave Roberts three shillings the night before; I said, if I had, it was more than I knew, then they said, they now were absolutely going away the next morning, and would have some more money before they went; I told them it was very extraordinary, how could they think, or how could they come after me, which knew nothing about them; they both said they would go away, provided I would give them half a guinea; I told them I had not half a guinea; I had no more than two brass sixpences about me, which I had had sometime; then they said, damn your eyes, we will not leave you without you go and borrow half a guinea; and Platt swore he would be damned if he did not go into the shop, and blow me up, unless I did it; I was then within a yard or two of the door; I was the outside next the coffee-house; the shop is shut of a night, all but the door. Roberts says to Platt, do not be such a damned fool, he will give us money; for Platt laid hold of the door, as if to open it, and go in; I told them I had no money, and if I had, I would give them none, they had had enough, and too much already; Platt laid hold of the door again, says he, damn your b - y eyes, I will blow you up; he turned again to me, and said will you get this money for us or no? I said I could not; they said they would not leave me till I did, and both of them together said borrow it; with that I went to the King's head in James street, with a pretence to borrow half a guinea, they followed me; I told them I could not borrow half a guinea; but I had two guineas in my fob, and I went in reality to get change for a guinea; they said they had considered of it, and damn their eyes if they would leave me without a guinea, for they were going on board of ship the next day, they would not go, damn their eyes if they would, without money; I being so much terrified, by their abusing, and accusing me in the manner they did; I was afraid of my character, which is my bread.</p>
               <p>What apprehensions had you, when they said they would blow you up? - The apprehension that I had, was, that they would accuse me of some unnatural crime, and that it would deprive me of my character, and my bread; then I agreed to go back to the King's-head, to borrow a guinea, and I took a guinea out of my fob, and came to them, and I said, mind this is the demand you make, this is betwixt you two; Roberts directly puts the guinea into his pocket, and squared his elbows in a boxing posture, now says he, damn my eyes if I part with a penny of this; Platt said he was a villain, why was he not to have half, and then Platt swore, why was he not to have one too, as there is none of this for me; I argued with them, how they could think of going on so, with that, Platt said damn his eyes if he would go without half a guinea; I told him where could I borrow more; but I agreed to go to borrow half a guinea, and I got half a guinea, and half a guinea's worth of silver; the agreement was to give me a receipt for a guinea and a half, I said, I would not give it them without they gave me a receipt or discharge, as others had done, referring to a paper, which had been given me, by Templeman, who was another soldier, who in company with Platt, had obtained other monies, that they had agreed to, this is the discharge from Templeman, to which I alluded, (Read)</p>

They made no enquiry what discharge I meant, upon that I advanced the 10 s. 6 d. and desired them to come to some house to sign the receipt; then they refused to do it, adding that as they were to march tomorrow morning, they had no occasion for it, I should never see them any more; Roberts says, damn your eyes, give me your handkerchief, I want it for my bundle; I did not; then they wished me a good night,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080065"/>Roberts said he hoped I should meet with no worse villains than they had been; I said it was needless; I did not see them till Templeman and Platt were taken on a Thursday with Smith, and on the Friday evening, the prisoner Roberts came to my master's shop in company with another man of the Coldstream regiment; I went to the door, and asked him what he wanted with me; he said he had a receipt on a stamp, for the money that he had three nights before; I told him to give it me, he said he would be damned if he did; I told him he should go with me; I took hold of his arm, and he went pretty quiet a few yards; then, says he, Platt is gone on board of ship; yes, says I, I know he is; I called Mr. Simms to my assistance, he was at his stall, and we took him to Bow-street, there he said he never saw me before; he denied that he had said any thing about a receipt, or had been at my master's shop at all, but was coming promiscuously along the Piazzi, and that I came out and seized him.</p>
               <p>Now I ask you, and attend to the question, and answer it deliberately, did you know any thing at all of Platt, till that 17th of August, when you saw him first in company with Templeman? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Not the least in the world? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of Roberts, till you saw him in the company of Platt, when he came to your master's shop, on the 28th of October? - No.</p>
               <p>Had any thing indecent or improper, ever passed between you and Templeman, or Platt, or Smith, or Roberts? - Never; so help me God, as I stand here on my oath.</p>
               <p>Had there with any person whatever, any of the soldiers of the guards, or any person whatever? - No Sir; there had not.</p>
               <p>With no human being, any thing of the sort had ever passed? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner Roberts's Counsel. You have been servant to this carpet ware-house, 24 years? - Yes; I have been foreman about 16 years.</p>
               <p>Of course, you are greatly in the confidence of your master who employs you? - I do not know in regard to that; I will explain it, the former part of my time, Mr. Barnet was my master, he died and left a family.</p>
               <p>Who is the master of the carpet warehouse now? - Mr. Drury; he commenced last August was 12 months.</p>
               <p>Then during that time, you of course saw him almost every day, I suppose? - No; not every day, because he has another shop.</p>
               <p>Templeman you had seen about two months before last Christmas? - Yes Sir.</p>
               <p>From that time you did not see him, till the May following? - I did not see him; I had been measuring a room in Pall-Mall, the music was playing in the court yard, a person in soldier's cloaths acosted me; I said you have the advantage of me; on the 17th of August, I saw him again, then Platt was with him.</p>
               <p>I believe the account you gave on that occasion was, that being charged in the streets by these two men, you did not know but the people might rise upon you?</p>
               <p>On the 20th of August, on the 23d of August, on the 18th of September, on the 20th of September, you was applied to, on the same sort of business, and on the 21st of October, another application? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before you had seen any thing of Roberts, there were no less than eight applications made to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, upon none of those applications, had you ever taken any steps to bring the persons applying to you, to justice? - I had not, not till after.</p>
               <p>When did you first mention this to Mr. Simms, your friend? - On the 21st of September.</p>
               <p>That was after six applications had been made to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe in consequence of that, you went with your friend Simms to the Northumberland Arms, in Great Russel-street? - Yes; I very seldom use a publick house, but I am perfectly known at the King's Head in James-street.</p>
               <p>Then, even on the 22d of September, when your friend Simms was with you, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080066"/>you had the assistance of every person in the house, no complaint was made to any person? - Not to any third person, it was the tender feelings that I had, because I would not take the life of a fellow creature, if I could help it but I told them if they did not desist, I would put the law in execution, the first was my character, and the next was that.</p>
               <p>Were there any other publick houses, at which you were in company with the persons that made these applications to you? - I desired them repeatedly, to go to a publick house, and call for a pot of beer, and I would pay for it; I waited for Simms coming; and they did go to the publick house; I never was at any publick house with them, only at the Northumberland Arms, and at the White Horse, a small publick house; I was at the door, and called for a pot of beer, and paid for it.</p>
               <p>Then you never was at the Queen's Head, Tavistock Row? - Not till after that; I was after that, at the Queen's Head with Platt.</p>
               <p>There your friend Simms was with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There another application was made to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On that occasion, Simms being-with you and the landlord, and the persons in the publick house, the application being made to you, you made no application to any person? - I did not.</p>
               <p>On the 28th of October, Roberts came to your shop about half past seven? - Yes; as near as I can remember; he knocked at the door; I came out to him; we conversed together about five minutes, as I suppose.</p>
               <p>Have you been often to see the Guard relieved in the Park? - Me! no, not without it was in my business, not once in half a year; I have heard of the Coldstream Regiment, but never took any notice of the name; I know there are three Regiments, first, second, and third; I had not heard of the Coldstream Regiment by name, to my knowledge, to take notice of it.</p>
               <p>Did nothing particular happen, at the time that Roberts came to ask you for some money? - Yes; there were some turnips thrown from behind the Piazzas, and I saw several soldiers heads peeping backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Did not this create some little disturbance? - None at all, the people were not passing thick; there was half a dozen I suppose, not all at once.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that attracted the attention of nobody at that time? - It did not; I do say it upon my oath, it did not.</p>
               <p>Did none of your fellow servants come out at this time? - No; we were just at the side of the door.</p>
               <p>Was it always your practice to stand at the side of the door, when any body called? - Not always.</p>
               <p>Was it so when these soldiers called? - Then I mostly walked from the door; the whole transaction of the 2d of November did not take up above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that at the time of the half play under the Piazzas, that no person whatever interfered, or came up to you? - Nobody interfered with us; an old woman came past and stopped, they bid her go along.</p>
               <p>How many people might pass you? - I cannot tell; a good many.</p>
               <p>Then you made no complaint, nor offered to stop them, nor told any body what was passing? - I did not.</p>
               <p>At the King's Head you was perfectly known? - I was.</p>
               <p>You went twice there without calling for any thing? - Yes; just to the left of the door; I stood at the bar and asked the mistress's sister, she said she had it not, and I directly came out.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Simms? - Six or seven years; I have frequently bought things of him.</p>
               <p>On the Monday, when Roberts called on you, you did not expect him? - No; because there was a warrant out against him at that time.</p>
               <p>You have never walked in the Park of an evening? - Never particularly; I have gone through the Park.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080067"/>Not of an evening, that you swear positively? - I swear positively I have not; I never go out of an evening.</p>
               <p>And you have never made any attack on any body in the Park of an indecent nature? - No, Sir, that I have not.</p>
               <p>You have never received a blow for any such attack? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Whilst you was in the Piazza, you, who was alarmed left a mob should rise upon you, did not proclaim that the men were charging you with an unnatural crime? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Nobody took notice of you but an old woman? - No.</p>
               <p>You mentioned it to your friend Mr. Simms, and took his advice about it? - I did.</p>
               <p>At first you said you was reluctant to take the life of your fellow creatures? - I was worn out with their manner.</p>
               <p>You say positively, on the oath you have taken, that if any soldier in the guards should be hardy enough to say that you have made any attack upon him, of an indecent nature, and that he had knocked you down, he is guilty of perjury? - He is Sir.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Platt. Did not the prosecutor treat me with a pot of beer, once at the Horse Guards, by the Pay Office, and give me the change out of a shilling on my offering it to him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Whether he did not behave in a very indecent manner to me at that time? - I did not see him at all at the place he describes.</p>
               <p>Were you guilty of any indecency to him at the time? - Upon my oath, the sacred oath, as I stand here before you, I was not.</p>
               <p>Did not I knock you down in the Green Park for indecency? - It is as false as God is true. I can say no more.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep a green grocer's shop in Covent Garden; I have known Sharpe about fourteen years, he had told me of some applications for money; I saw the paper signed by Templeman and Smith. I took Templeman myself, a warrant was granted against Roberts, and on Friday night, the 5th of November, I was drinking a cup of tea with my wife in my stall, and Sharpe came and said, this is the man that we have been looking for; Roberts was with him, I took hold of him directly, and carried him to Bow-street, he was examined there; he declared to me before, and then at his examination, that he knew nothing of the man at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Whereabouts is your stall? - In Covent Garden, the first stand from James-street as you come down.</p>
               <p>Where were you on the Thursday? - On the Thursday I took Templeman; on the Tuesday I came down James-street, and saw the two prisoners talking together, attempting to make water; I looked in Platt's face, as I had seen him before, they had two caps on I am sure; I was at my stand in Covent Garden on the Tuesday evening, I suppose that is about twenty-five yards from the hatter's shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you quite sure you saw the two prisoners in company together? - I am positive of it, I saw Sharpe talking to them, and his hat off; that was on the 2d of November.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Had not you the curiosity to stop and listen to the conversation? - No, I had not, I was at my stand when I saw them talking.</p>
               <p>Now, had not Sharpe applied to you before, on their application for money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Knowing that, and seeing two soldiers with him, had not you the curiosity to go up and know something about it? - No, Sir, I thought he would alarm me; business, or something took my time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Platt. Had you any connection with a house in Eagle-court? - I know no house in Eagle-court; I know a house in Eagle-street, the Horse and Groom, I lodged there, I travelled with a Mr. Rooksby that lived at the next door, where the wax-work is in Fleet-street; I had a wife there and two children, the man's name is Young, my wife and I were there at the time, and when I came from the fair and different things, I commonly came to her,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080068"/>as usually a man comes to a woman, and Mr. Young used to ask me to draw some beer; I took the authority in the house; if any of these men can come forward; it is about nine years ago.</p>
               <p>Whether he never laid with this Young, the same as a man and his wife? - Never, on my oath; I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Never with a soldier in the guards, named Tillotson, who was a drummer, who is now in the New Prison for an assault? - I never was guilty of any thing of that kind in my life, and never with such a man.</p>
               <p>This house was broke, its licence was taken away for the same thing, nobody but those sort of people use the house? - Gentlemen I deny the whole.</p>
               <p>Was not there a drummer quartered in the house of the name of Tillotson? - Never in the world to my knowledge; I was away five months at a time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I called you, that your character might be enquired into; are you married or single? - A married man; this is my third wife.</p>
               <p>Have you any children? - I have none by this, I have two in Dorsetshire, a boy and girl.</p>
               <p>Had you any children by your second wife? - She died in child-bed of twins.</p>
               <p>At the time you lodged at this house in Eagle-street, you lodged there as a married man with your wife? - I did.</p>

               <p>When you came to London, did you cohabit with her as men and their wives usually do? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you, as it has been put to you, by the prisoner, having a wife in the house, sleep with a male bedfellow? - I slept with nobody but my wife.</p>
               <p>Have you, ever before this prosecution, been accused of unnatural and improper propensities? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been guilty of such? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I submit I shall be entitled to call witnesses to the character of Mr. Sharpe; I give my friend warning I have such witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. My Lord, I am told I have a witness that is very material, and I should desert my duty very much if I did not call him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Platt. I have a person here to give me a character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Roberts. The witness I have to call, his name is Williams; he came on his own accord.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you a private? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What regiment? - The second, the Coldstream Regiment of Guards.</p>
               <p>Do you know any person round you? - I know Mr. Sharpe perfectly well, the gentleman here.</p>
               <p>Go to him and touch him? - This is the gentleman (touches him); I was on the centry, in the Green Park, I do not know positively the day, it was some time before the riot happened that we were drafted to go into the Tower, to go abroad on foreign service; it could not be in the summer, Mr. Sharpe came to me in the night, between the hours of ten and weive, when I was on the centry; I had never seen him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did he do or say any thing? - Yes, Sir, he did, he offered some very unnatural crimes.</p>
               <p>Tell us what he did? - He asked me whether I had been done lately; I asked him what he meant; he said he supposed I perfectly understood what he meant; he wanted to know whether any man had any thing to do with me lately; I told him he ought to be kept and taken up, and made an example or; I told him it was a thing I detested, that I was a maried man, and did not give my mind to any thing of that sort; after he found that I would not submit to any of these unnatural crimes, he immediately departed from me, and went away.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any thing more of him after that? - I mounted the Tilt-yard Guard at the Gun; he came to me about half after nine; that was the 5th day at night, after the first attack; I am sure it was the same man, I called him by his name as he came to me; I told him I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080069"/>have him taken up, and he immediately left me.</p>
               <p>How came you to call him by his name? - I was going some time after the first attack to my quarters in Covent Garden, I saw him stand looking in at a window, and I enquired of a person what was the gentleman's name, and they told me his name was Sharpe; I mentioned to them that he offered very unnatural crimes to me, and ought to be taken up.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the person that you told of it? - I do not know who it was: he told me he lived in the neighbourhood; but he did not tell me in what capacity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you ever see him again, after this business of the Tilt-yard? - Never, till this time I saw him in the courtyard.</p>
               <p>From the opportunity you had of seeing him, are you sure he is the man that accosted you in the Green Park, and at the Tilt-yard? - Yes, Sir, I am perfectly convinced he is the same.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure he is the same? - I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When did you see him in the court-yard? - About twelve, when I came here to-day, I saw him on the steps.</p>
               <p>What brought you here? - I was ordered here, subpoena'd.</p>
               <p>So you came here in consequence of your subpoena, about twelve to-day; when did you receive your subpoena? - I saw it about half after eleven to-day.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, this filthy subject, you had not talked of it to any body? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>No; I take it for granted, except to the person whom you saw under the Piazzas, you have not mentioned it to any body? - No, Sir, I have not.</p>
               <p>You can be quite sure, that except to that stranger under the Piazza, you have never mentioned it to any body; recollect, I do not wish to hurry you? - No, not to my knowledge, I never mentioned it to no creature; but since I came to court I saw the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Let me see, if I understand you right, except to the stranger in the Piazza, you never mentioned this indecency to any person till you came here to-day; what did they tell you, you was subpoena'd for on the trial of Roberts? - Sir!</p>
               <p>Do not I speak loud enough, soldier? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Answer me then, and do not say, Sir! concerning this matter? - What matter.</p>
               <p>Who subpoena'd you? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it the stranger that spoke to you under the Piazza? - No, a serjeant that came to me.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, Sir, if you never mentioned it to any body, but to the stranger under the Piazza, till you came here today, how came they to know that you could give any evidence here about Mr. Sharpe, when they subpoena'd you? come, that is a point blank shot you was not prepared for, soldier? - I do not know that ever I mentioned it to any person except my serjeant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Short-hand-writer, take care, and do your duty; I know you do it always; but I wish this man should know you do it.</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes, Sir, I mentioned it to a serjeant that is here now, serjeant Folden.</p>
               <p>When did you mention it to serjeant Folden? - I believe I mentioned it to him after I came off the centry, at the Gun in the Tilt-yard.</p>
               <p>What did you tell him? - I told him that I had such a person come to me.</p>
               <p>Who did you tell him came to you? - I told him Mr. Sharpe came to me.</p>
               <p>Now will you venture to swear you did this; look to the Jury Sir, come, will you venture to swear, that when you left your guard on the Tilt-yard, that you told serjeant Folden, that Mr. Sharp had made this attack on you? - I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you ever in your life, till to-day, mention it to serjeant Folden? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>When did you? - I am not positive when.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - When I came off centry, the time I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080070"/>Come, you must answer? - Yes, Sir, I think I did, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you did; come, come; look to the Jury, I see it has an effect upon you? - I have mentioned it to him, but I do not positively know when.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath have you ever mentioned it before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long before? - I cannot positively tell.</p>
               <p>Where have you mentioned it? - In different places.</p>
               <p>In different places; were there many people present? - I do not recollect any body that was present.</p>
               <p>Why you made no secret of it, did you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you mention it more than once to serjeant Folden? - I cannot say whether I did, I believe it was in the guard-room.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I did mention it in the guard-room, to all the guard that was present.</p>
               <p>To all the guard that was present! when all the guard was present in the guard-room? I mentioned it to serjeant Folden in the guard-room, whilst all the guard was present; but not as the guard heard me.</p>
               <p>What did you mention it in a whisper? - I called him aside, and told of this in the Tilt-yard guard-room; there is no other guard-room.</p>
               <p>Was it when you was relieved after Mr. Sharpe had been there? - Certainly, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was this attack after the rumour of your being drafted for foreign service had blown over? - No, Sir, it was before that.</p>
               <p>How long before Mr. Roberts, your friend, was taken into custody? - Some time.</p>
               <p>A long while? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the serjeant where Mr. Sharpe lived, and what trade he followed? - No, Sir, I did not know.</p>
               <p>How came they to think of bringing you here? - I do not know, I mentioned it to the serjeant.</p>
               <p>Pray, has these sort of things happened to you often? - No, Sir, never before this time nor since.</p>
               <p>Therefore you did not understand what he was saying, when he asked you if you have been done lately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are a married man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have been a soldier three years? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have mounted guard with a good many different men, I fancy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you did not guess at the expression? - No; I told him he ought to know better, and he ought to be taken up and made an example of; so he went off.</p>
               <p>It was between ten and twelve; was it nearer ten or twelve? - I cannot be positive whether the clock had gone eleven.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - I am not positive of the night.</p>
               <p>Was it, or was it not, a dark or a light night? - I know when I was last on guard in the Green Park, it was a dark night.</p>
               <p>What part of the Park was you in? - It was the Green Park; there was a lamp at the house next to the box, about ten or twelve yards off.</p>
               <p>The man was nine or ten minutes talking with you; why you had quite a coaze with him, quite an agreeable conversation with him? - It was not very agreeable.</p>
               <p>How long was it afterwards when you saw him looking into the print-shop? - It was a day or two.</p>
               <p>What did you say to the stranger? - He was looking in there; I asked him if he knew him, he said his name was Sharpe; I said, I believed he was a very bad man, and a man that did not like a woman, and a man that ought to be taken care of.</p>
               <p>You did not explain to him why you thought so? - No.</p>
               <p>Then it is not true, if any body had said so, that he made a very unnatural attack on you in the Park? - Why I told him he had offered some very unnatural practices to me in the Park.</p>
               <p>What said the stranger to this? - He did not say any thing, he laughed and went away.</p>
               <p>He did not tell you where he lived? - No, Sir, he did not tell me positively where he lived, he told me Sir, he lived in the neighbourhood, but he could not tell me where.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080071"/>Did you press him to tell you where he lived? - No, I did not; when I asked him where he lived, he said nothing, but went away; he told me before that, that he lived in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>So then, you who had kept this so snug, that you did not mention it to any of your comrades, mentioned it to a stranger in Covent-garden? - I did.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go with the stranger and take him to Bow-street? - If I had done as I ought to have done, I should.</p>
               <p>You are a soldier in the Coldstream regiment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have the honour to have his Royal Highness the Duke of York for your commanding officer? - I have.</p>
               <p>Do not you know instances in your own knowledge of his Royal Highness encouraging soldiers who have detected unnatural practices in the Park? - He has.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Sharpe run away from you? - He went off as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>How near was you to another sentry? - Why, a hundred yards and better.</p>
               <p>How far from another sentry when you was in the Tilt-yard guard? - From one sentry I do not suppose it was above forty yards.</p>
               <p>Then why not call out to the other sentry to take this fellow? - He did not go that way.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I called him by his name, Sir; he came up to me, as I called him by his name: when he began to offer this unnatural crime, I told him he ought to be secured, and I would secure him, if he offered any thing of the kind to me; and he made off as fast as he could; it was dark.</p>
               <p>What did he say then in the Tilt-yard guard; what was the first thing he said? - He came up to me, when I was on sentry, and talked to me; and he asked me whether my breeches were lined.</p>
               <p>What answer did you give him? - I called him by his name, and told him that I knew what he was very well, at least by his behaviour, that he was a very bad man, and to get away, or else I would secure him.</p>
               <p>Was that all that passed? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Recollect. - I called him by his name, and told him he was a very bad man, and a man that ought to be taken care of, and if he did not go away I would secure him.</p>
               <p>When did you tell that to any body? - I mentioned that to Serjeant Folden.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I am not positive.</p>
               <p>When your guard is relieved, do not you report to those who succeed you what has happened on your guard? - No, unless it is something that concerns our duty.</p>
               <p>Then if a man should come to your sentry-box, and should offer any unnatural attempt to your person, that is no part of your duty? - I did not take him, because I could not leave my post.</p>
               <p>How long is this last time ago? - It was some time before we went into the Tower.</p>
               <p>When did you go to any magistrate to make a complaint that Mr. Sharpe, who lived in Covent-garden, was an unnatural man, and had been offering unnatural practices to you? - I did not go.</p>
               <p>Did you knock him down for this? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you never said you did? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Then you never said to any body, that Mr. Sharpe, the prosecutor, had made an unnatural attempt upon you, and that you had knocked him down? - I did not say so to nobody, never in my life, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>That will not do for me; I ask you, and I warn you that I am able to prove the contrary. - I did not say so.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - Yes, I do swear positively, that I did not say so, never in my life, to any body.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Sharpe. You have heard all that this man has said; upon the solemn oath that you have taken, and as you will answer it to your God, recollecting that the lives of these two men are at stake, is the account that man has given us true? - As I will answer it at the great and dreadful day of judgment! every word a lie! every word, as I may never stir from this place any more; how villainous it is! I stood patient to hear such villainy!</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080072"/>Is it true, that at any part of your life, you had any conversation with that man in the Green Park? - No, never, Sir.</p>
               <p>Is it true, that in any part of your life, you ever spoke to him on the tilt guard? - Never.</p>
               <p>In one word, is there a syllable of truth in any thing he has said? - Not a syllable, as I hope for salvation; I can say no more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If Serjeant Folden is here, I will make him my witness; for in this case, whatever may come of the prosecutor, the whole story shall come out.</p>
               <p>SERJEANT FOLDEN sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know the private of the name of Williams, that you brought here by subpoena? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was the person that caused that subpoena to be served? - He was subpoened, and I was sent with it while he was on duty; I was sent from the regiment, from the orderly room, as a part of my regimental duty.</p>
               <p>Had you any share in the procuring him to be subpoened? - No, Sir, I had no share.</p>
               <p>Had you directed him to be subpoened? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you given any account of what he knew on this subject? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you any knowledge that he was possessed with any circumstance that had any thing to do with this trial? - No, Sir, I was not, indeed.</p>

             the subpoena was brought, had you any reason to suspect that he knew any thing that related to this prosecution? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard from him any account, that he had any knowledge of any transaction that could have the least relation to this subject? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you before this day, any conversation with him relating to this subject? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you before this day ever hear him mention a person of the name of Sharpe? - No, Sir, never before this day.</p>
               <p>Until this day, you never heard from him the name of Sharpe? - No, Sir, I have not.</p>
               <p>Is Williams a private of your guard? - No, Sir, I am not on guard; but I have been on guard with him at St. James's.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his being on the Tilt-yard guard, while you had occasion to be at the Tilt-yard room? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did he ever in the guard-room relate to you any circumstance that had happened to him either on the Tilt-yard guard, or the Green Park? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Had he never told you that a man of the name of Sharpe had asked him some indecent questions? - Not till to day.</p>
               <p>Are you very positive of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you very sure that he never told you that man was a man of unnatural passions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know much of this man, Williams? - Yes, ever since he has been in the regiment; I cannot say rightly; I have known him four or five years.</p>
               <p>Since Roberts particularly has been in custody, have you seen Williams from time to time? - More when he came to his duty.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any private conversation with him apart from the guard-room in your life? - No, Sir, not about any such thing.</p>
               <p>If he had told you that a man had asked him questions of an unnatural tendency; if he had told you so at any particular time, should you remember it? - Yes, I should.</p>
               <p>Are you quite positively sure that he never did? - Yes, I am; he never mentioned any such thing happening to him, to me, never in his life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, my lord, I propose to call witnesses for the prosecutor's character.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you are intitled to do it; but the case does not call for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It certainly does not; but for the sake of this man in future life, I ought to do it.</p>

On the 24th of November last I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment; the prisoner lived with me till the 23d or 24th, and then went away; after she left me I missed these things; they were all in the house when she came to the lodgings, and they were all missed after she left it; I missed them the very same day, or a day after; I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>What time of the day did she go away? - It was between six and seven; I heard her on the stairs then, and never saw her after, till she was taken; I found part of my things at No. 14, in the same street, where I live; I found some more at Mr. Jackson's, White-hart-yard.</p>
               <p>Was any promise or threats made use of to induce her to make this confession? - None at all; she had sold some to Mr. Mills, Little Drury-lane, some to Mr. Jackson, White-hart-yard, and the bed down in Cross-street, the bottom of Newton's-lane.</p>
               <p>Was you present with Scott when he went to look after it? - No, but I went to fetch some of it yesterday to bring here.</p>
               <p>(Some of the property produced; the rest not brought because they were so cumbersome.)</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner own to you that she had disposed of such and such things, some at Mills's, and some at Jackson's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the value of all those things you did find? - I suppose they might be about a guinea, or two and twenty shillings.</p>

               <p>I brought Mrs. White from Brentford to London; she asked me to call an hackney coach; the coach did not come near enough to step out of one coach into another; I went to assist her, and put in her bundles; and as she was getting in, she was shoved down, and the bundle was stole; I was shoved down along with her; I can say there was no one near but the coachman and the prisoner at the bar; the prisoner at the bar was at the hackney coach door at that time; and he was there some time after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask whether I was not with him from the time that the lady said she lost her bundle, for an hour after? - He was with me some time; I cannot say for the time; he came and attended the coach as usual: he was the watering man, and generally attends the coaches there.</p>

             had taken the bundle; I saw him about there a few minutes afterward; and about five minutes after I saw him on an hackney coach box in Piccadilly, with the man who was convicted last sessions; I pursued him up Rupert-street; Peart got off the box; and at the end of a little court, called Edmond's-court, facing St. Ann's church, the coachman stopped, and got off the box; (this might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after the robbery was done); he got down and opened the coach door, and took the bundle out, and had walked down the court some yards; and Peart came up from the bottom of the court to meet him; and he was close to him when I apprehended the coachman; his name is Johnson.</p>
               <p>What became of the prisoner? - He left London after the sessions, and went to Portsmouth; and an information coming up that he was at work at a stable-yard there, I went down and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says I rode on the coach, and he followed me about to the dead wall of St. Ann's church; then he says he saw me in the court, at one end, and the coachman at the other; now, if he saw me in Rupert-street, how could he see me at the other end of the court? - He was coming to the coachman, almost the distance as I am to you, my lord; I saw him first at the corner of Air-street; and he passed just the end of the street; I says to the man with me, there is Peart on the coach-box; says I, we will follow him wherever he goes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is it possible for a coach to go to Piccadilly, and set the lady down at Mary-le-bone, in this time as he has mentioned he saw me? - I cannot be positive for a few minutes.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. White. Did you go in Johnson's coach to Mary-le-bone? - Yes, I did.</p>

On Tuesday the 16th of November, I was in the stable; two tarrier dogs were working in the straw for vermine; after they had scratched up the straw, they scratched up a bundle, containing two leather linings; I went out to Bow-street, and left it in the same situation, in which they were first found, in order to detect the thief; and when I came back with a search warrant, I gave it to an officer, and we went to the apartments of the prisoner; he was at dinner; about four o'clock in the afternoon we told him that we had a search warrant, and that it was the best way to deliver up what he had; he went up stairs, and we with him, and there were several boxes one upon another, and he himself unlocked the topmost box, and took out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080079"/>several skins with the letter S. on them, he said this was all; I believe lenity was proposed to him: these things are the property of my father; here are four skins; I found seven others; I have no doubt of their being my father's property.</p>
               <p>Are the skins there found in the stable? - Yes they are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, prisoner's Counsel. I want to know the situation of this stable; is it in a yard adjoining to this house? - It is.</p>
               <p>It was not locked up at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>So that any one might have free access? My reason for believing it to be the prisoner was, because he was the man that looked after the horses.</p>

               <p>There was no lock to it, and thereby any one might have free access to it as much as the prisoner, and this man hath been your servant for five years past? - He has.</p>
               <p>I believe at Bow-street there was some difficulty about speaking to the property? - I wished to be more positive, that was the reason; I did not swear, because I wanted time to recollect.</p>
               <p>Hath the prisoner at any time been used to buy any skins whatever? - I never heard him ask to buy any.</p>
               <p>HEWIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; I had a search warrant to search the prisoner's apartments, and I found thirteen skins in his bed-room; they were in his custody, he took them from two different boxes, they were both locked, and he had the key of them.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was at dinner, he did not refuse to come out to you at all? - None in the least.</p>
               <p>Did he refuse you to open the box; he himself unlocked the box, and shewed you the things? - Yes he did.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing passed, that he bought these skins of Mr. Savage's brother? - No.</p>
               <p>The box was opened by your desire; the first box he opened very readily? - I told him if he did not make haste I would break it open.</p>
               <p>Court to Hewis. Did you go with the prisoner to Mr. Savage's house? - Yes; and I asked him if any of these skins were the skins in the stable; he went up into the loft, and there was room for only one person at a time, as soon as he went up, Mr. Savage had a lanthorn and a candle, and I went up, and the prisoner had got the skins in the loft and brought them to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Savage. Are these the skins you found in the stable? - I believe they are, they have never been out of the possession of the Constable; when I went out they were in the stable, and when I came back from Bow-street, I found the prisoner clearing the room of the stable; I sent the prisoner to Dice Key, to consult what to do, and immediately as the prisoner was gone, I found the skins missing, and that was the very same parcel produced from the loft.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What is the mark you know them by? - By the letter S.</p>
               <p>On any of them are no other marks than the letter S.? - Yes; there are my men's marks on them.</p>
               <p>Your men make the same marks on all the skins, therefore all that you can swear to is, that it is such a mark as your men make? - Yes; it is.</p>
               <p>With respect to the letter S. these skins that are particularly marked, those are the same amongst a great number of others, and all the skins of a certain description have that letter S.? - Yes; and they have the men's mark beside.</p>

               <p>Was the prisoner a stranger? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did you offer them to sale? - I sold three or four for 3 d. apiece; I believe they were some of the rough ones.</p>

               <p>Are you sure as to his person? - Yes; I am sure he had nothing but a stick in his hand, and I saw him turn to Mrs. Leatham's house; it is a little passage; and he went to the passage, and could go no where else, for it is no thoroughfare.</p>

               <p>On the 20th of November I laid three guineas worth of silver into a bason, in my closet. I live at <placeName id="t17901208-49-crimeloc265">the Cheshire Cheese, in Angel-street</placeName>

There was put by a crown piece, eight half crowns, and the rest in shillings and sixpences: they laid there about two o'clock; I had the crown out, and shewed it to several people in the kitchen: when six o'clock came I went to get change, and missed the crown piece, and with that I looked into the bason, and saw the silver looked very little, and took it up, and found it to be no more that two pounds-worth; I found there was gone a crown piece, four half crowns, and eight shillings; I did not know whom to charge it to; I had no one in my kitchen but my servant maid and this drummer, who was ballotted on me; I directly takes the servant maid up stairs, and had every thing searched, and found nothing. I takes my candle up and searched the drummer's room, and I clapped my hand into his grenadier's cap, and there I found my property; I left it there, and sent for Mr. Townsend, and we examined him in my club room; I asked him what property he had got of his own in his room? he said, no property there, excepting some silver, which he said was a four and sixpenny piece, and some half crowns, and some shillings; with that we went up stairs together with Mr. Townsend, and as soon as ever he was in the room, he fell-down on his knees, and said, the money was my property.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said to him, to induce him thus to confess? - He owned it before Townsend had searched one thing: I had not time to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Was this closet locked, or how was it fastened? - It was shut, but not fastened.</p>

               <p>On the 20th of November Mr. Careless sent for me, and told me the story, and I went to the lad, and desired him to be called into the club room: when I asked him what silver of his own was up stairs, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080085"/>said he had a four and six-penny piece, &amp;c. in his cap; I then took him up stairs, and when I had taken the money from his cap, and told him I should take him into custody, and to Bow-street, he said it was was the first time, and he hoped Mr. Careless would pardon him.</p>

            , he is at sea: The prisoner came to take an empty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080086"/>room of me on the 18th of November, I was very loth to let it her, but she prevailed on me till I did let it, and I asked her what she had got to bring into this room; she told me she had nothing, she said she lay on the bare boards; I told her there was a bed in the room adjoining that, which she took, where a single man lay on, who was gone into the shop, and I gave her liberty to lay on it two or three nights; about seven o'clock in the evening I was gone to bed, I thought I heard a rumbling noise, and could not tell what it was; I got out of bed, and slipt on my under petticoat, and went up stairs, and she was gone down stairs, and the bed was gone; I went down and alarmed the rest of the people in the house; we went to the place where she was come away from that day, I came back again, and carried the watch with me, and I went up stairs and found her rolling these two pieces of carpet in the room; the watchman has got them here.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the bed was safe that night? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find the bed? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Had you let this bed to that woman? - I had given her leave to lay on it; she was to pay me nothing for it.</p>
               <p>Did you know this woman before? - No.</p>
               <p>What is she? - She cries things about the street, oysters; she has lived about Shadwell some years.</p>

             were in it, I was then proceeding on my way to Lyndhurst, in order to secure it there that night, and about half an hour after I got to Minstead, Cull the prisoner ran out and joined the other two men, and had some conversation with them two, I did not know the nature of the road, I enquired, and a woman had directed me; Cull immediately came up and said, you are going wrong, and wished me to go some other way; I told him I did not want his assistance, and should follow the woman's directions; I told him he had no business to follow me, and insisted he should not; he then began to abuse me, and said, he had as much business on the road as I had; I then insisted he should keep at a much greater distance, for I did not like his appearance at all; soon after that he returned to Witcher and Curtis, and they had some conversation together at a distance; and in about ten minutes after that, they came out of a wood opposite to the cart I was driving, and one of them pulled me off my horse, I cannot say which, nor which of them beat me; it was in that violent manner, I cannot say; but they took a pistol out of my pocket, and while I was laying in that manner, Cull says, d - n him, shoot him; he then immediately after that ran to the cart and horse, and turned it about, and began driving it to Stoney Cross, which I had seized; and a woman about a hundred yards off, where they beat me, ran out and cried, and ran for her husband; and when she returned with her husband, they were gone; one of them took away my horse, and bridle, and saddle, and my pistol, but I cannot say which of them it was; the horse was brought to me the next day, but the saddle and bridle I never got again; my arm was dislocated at my elbow, and very much cut, and dreadful bad it was for a month, and I never shall have much strength in it.</p>
               <p>Was Cull there at the time? - Cull was the most active man, they were all three together, I saw them together as I was down, and they were beating me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You had first seized a cart and horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you first seized it the prisoner was not by? - He was not.</p>
               <p>You saw the prisoner come out from a farm yard? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>He did not make his appearance to you, till you was in conversation with a woman? - He did not come near till then.</p>
               <p>You told him, I suppose, rather huffishly, that you did not want his directions? - I told him, friend, you can have no business here, I am convinced, and therefore you had better go about your business.</p>
               <p>Upon which he replied, that he had as much business on the road as you had? - He did.</p>
               <p>He certainly was not the man that pulled you off your horse? - No, he certainly was not.</p>
               <p>You cannot say which of them it was that beat you? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Was you at all stunned with the fall from your horse? - They pulled me from my horse.</p>
               <p>Did you fall to the ground in consequence of that pulling? - Of course.</p>
               <p>I take it you was a little alarmed? - Of course.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it? - About half after six in the evening of the 1st of June.</p>

               <p>ON Monday morning, the 13th of December, 1790, at ten o'Clock, RHYNWICK, otherwise RENWICK WILLIAMS, was brought from Newgate to the new Sessions-house on Clerkenwell-green, to take his trial for several assaults<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080093"/>committed on the Miss Porters and others; being set to the bar, the chairman addressed him as follows:</p>
               <p>Have you any counsel, prisoner?</p>

               <p>Mr. Swift. Sir, I am counsel for him.</p>
               <p>Do you know, prisoner, that you have a right to put off your trial till the next session, if you chuse it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Swift. Sir, he would rather meet his fate at once, and know it; he has a clear and most indisputable alibi; but there has been such strange swearing; and as the former alibi was not credited, I am decidedly of opinion that no one witness shall be called; not that I am afraid to call them.</p>
               <p>Chairman. I could wish not one single word should be said of any former trial till this time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Chairman, and gentlemen of the jury -</p>
               <p>Court. If you are going at all to open your case, it is improper what you seem to be about; if you have any thing to say with respect to your trial going on, or not going on, this is the proper time; but every other circumstance will come more properly when you come to make your defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Swift. I should conceive you would not object to any thing he may be going to say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prejudice of the times being somewhat abated, I look round to those who are to protect my innocence, with more confidence of impartiality than I formerly experienced in another place. I trust they will this day restore me to society: the same Almighty being who has so recently chastized me, will, I trust, not always extend his rod, but will this day defend me from my enemies; relying not more on your justice than on your humanity, I at once plead not guilty; for should I plead guilty for the sake of form, a mistaken world might be apt to think I actually am guilty, not knowing the reasons and motives that might induce me so to do: I said I would plead guilty; but I have since determined not to confess guilt under those circumstances, though by so doing I should avoid much perjury from my prosecutors. Sir, your deep penetration, will, I trust, pierce the veil with which my accusers have endeavoured to conceal the truth from your sight; and your well-known candor and impartiality will not suffer falshood to triumph over truth and innocence. You sit there not clothed in the terrors of an angry and sanguinary judge, but with that mildness of humanity with which you always smile at innocence. In your hands I feel myself safe, and I look up to you with conscious hope for support, in the whole of this trial: yours is the voice of justice, because it is the voice also of humanity: to talk to you of prejudice were an insult, not more to your justice than to your understanding. That I have suffered from prejudice, is certain; but I forgive my prosecutrix, and esteem the former jury for the very verdict they gave me, because they gave it as they believed it: in the same manner I shall respect yours, let it be what it may: I am confident that no other than truth will prevail: if you think me guilty, in the name of God pronounce me that very monster that my soul abhors, and from whose savage hands, I would this moment, at the risk of my life, rescue the very woman who has so barbarously pursued me: to your verdict I submit without a murmur; and should you think me guilty, let the pains of the law be what they may, I shall continue to trust in Almighty God, to enable me to support those sufferings with the fortitude of a man. Once more, Sir, I address myself to you: neither my poverty, my distresses, nor my long confinement, save me from the obloquy of those, whose purses have long been open to criminate me at all events; you, Sir, are neither a severe nor unjust judge; and though I have suffered one conviction, trusting to your mildness and to your candour, I submit to take my trial.</p>

               <p>The indictment opened by Mr. Shepherd, and the case by Mr. Pigott, as follows -</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury. You have probably many of you, perhaps all of you, been so frequently called upon to assist in the administration of the justice of your country in that important character, in which you are now invested, that it would be very unnecessary for me to attempt to give you any description of that offence which the law in the technical language it is accustomed to use, has denominated an assault and battery; you know very well the nature of that offence; you know in general to what you are to apply the evidence you hear when such an offence is opened. Gentlemen, if this description of the prisoner's offence would convey to your minds any adequate idea of it, it would be very unnecessary either for me, or for any person Counsel against the prisoner charged with an offence like this, to give you any very laboured or detailed description of it, undoubtedly it would; but Gentlemen, such is the state of the law in this country, (tho' I am sure you will presently see, on the smallest consideration, it is no reproach to that law,) that that very peculiar, and very extraordinary crime, unprecedented as it is, and which I hope will furnish no example to others, that extraordinary crime which it is my duty to day to open to you, those who prosecute are reduced to the necessity of prosecuting it as an assault and battery only. Gentlemen, the business of legislation in making laws by which the peace and welfare of society are to be secured, is the effort of civil wisdom, founded on common experience; the legislators are not speculatists on crimes, legislators are not speculatists on the human heart, they cannot foresee all the miserable courses of depravity, which it will take, they must therefore proceed according to experience and to civil wisdom; they must provide for such crimes as that experience shews to have been committed; we are perfectly familiar, therefore, with those crimes by which the high roads are infested, and with those lesser depredations<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080095"/>in the streets; those also, by which peaceable citizens are disturbed in their dwellings in the night, and so of all the various descriptions of crimes, with which Courts of justice are unfortunately too familiar, with these you are well acquainted; but with a crime of the description, that I am to have the misfortune to state to you to day, no human legislature, no man who had in his power at any time heretofore the task of forming a rule for the conduct of his fellow citizens, could possibly be acquainted, and it therefore stands unprovided for, as it ought to be, but not as I hope it will be, according to your verdict, and the sentence of this Court; and as the most humane mind will think it ought to be, by that punishment which ought to follow for such a crime, of such a nature; a crime, Gentlemen, baffling all human speculation, confounding all the chronicles of this Court, and similar Courts, in all ages of the world. Gentlemen, it is yet however true, that this crime has been committed; and if in looking for a motive for it, if in searching for any possible inducement, you should find that search defeated, I am sure you have too much experience yet to doubt the fact, which will be proved to you beyond the possibility of a cavil. Gentlemen, if we were upon no occasion to believe a fact, the motive of which we cannot discern; if we were to turn the want of motive into an argument of disbelief of the fact; God knows we should be (I will not say every day) but we should be frequently the dupes of our incredulity; and because we do not discover by referring either to our own minds, or to the principles of justice, any impulse by which the person charged with the imputation of this crime, could have acted; it would be singular indeed, if the want of that motive, and the impossibility to discover that impulse, should operate on our minds as a doubt of the fact. Gentlemen, it would be an affectation, perfectly useless, to attempt to hide from you the transactions which were imputed to the prisoner; and which no doubt have been from time to time the subject of much publication, and much conversation. Gentlemen, upon the person, whoever he was, who perpetrated those crimes, and who was the hero of those exploits, the publick have stamped an application that propriety has justified by the strictest use of language; the greatest master in the language, which this country ever possessed, having defined that application, by which the perpetrator of these crimes has been distinguished, to be</p>
               <p>"any thing</p>
               <p>"out of the ordinary course of nature," that is Doctor Johnson's description of a Monster. Gentlemen, having said this, if the prisoner at the bar had not anticipated me, I should have anticipated him, in requesting that you will efface from your minds all recollection of every syllable you have read and heard about that Monster; that you will not recollect, you have ever heard of his name before; that you will not recollect any one of his transactions; that you will totally blot from your memory any conversation in which you have borne a share, or at which you may have been present, in which he, or his transactions may have been the subject: Gentlemen, if it was necessary so to do to men of your experience, I should conjure you to do so, not to believe the prisoner is the man, until you have it established in a Court of justice; not to apply that epithet till you know he is the man. Gentlemen, God knows the object of those, who have with a publick spirit, of which it were desirable that there were more examples, undertaken this prosecution; and their object would not be obtained, if it were possible that even the prisoner at the bar, whom I charge to have been so forgetful to every right of humanity, should owe his conviction to the smallest degree of popular prejudice: I deprecate it as much as he does; and I declare to you, if there be a man in Court, so ignorant of that Gentleman, to whom the publick is so much indebted for this prosecution, and for bringing the perpetrator of this crime to justice, and so ignorant of those, unworthy as they may be, to whom he has committed the conduct of this prosecution, as to suppose it wants the assistance of popular<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080096"/>prejudice, they are indeed under a great mistake; for neither he nor I, nor any body having any thing to do with this prosecution, would thank a Court or Jury for any verdict that stands on no better foundation than popular prejudice: I ask you therefore, to dispossess it from your minds, if it were capable of making any effect; and to hear the evidence; to listen to it calmly and dispassionately, and to disbelieve it if you can; I ask you to hear what he says in answer to it, and then to hear what shall be replied to that answer, and to do your duty to the publick; that is all I ask at your hands. I must however take the liberty to remind you, that it would be a most melancholy circumstance for the publick justice of the country, if after a criminal has committed crimes of the description which I shall here lay before you, because he is capable of adding one vice more to those which he possessed, namely, that of cant and hypocrisy; because he is capable of coming into a Court of Justice, and presuming to call his maker to witness his innocence, and address a Jury as he has just done in your presence, and will, no doubt do again, on the nature and extent of his sufferings, that he is to mock publick justice, and go out of Court in a situation to do this, which he has already done; or that because he has the effrontery to set up an Alibi, you are of course to believe it. Gentlemen, I am speaking to men of the world; these are tricks which have been played before, they have not the merit of novelty, and I am sure they will not have any improper effect, though they have before been practised by other persons, in other places. Gentlemen, I shall state to you the facts upon which this prosecution is founded. Gentlemen, Mr. Porter has a wife and a large and fine family, as you will presently see, for you will this day be acquainted with many of them; he lives in St. James's street, the left hand side of the street, going from St. James's Palace into Piccadilly: Gentlemen, he keeps a Hotel in that street; as respectable a one (if that were the question to day) as I undertake to demonstrate, as any in London; he has a large family; he has four daughters who are young women grown up. Gentlemen, Mr. Porter is not in such opulent circumstances, as to enable him to box up any part of his family, who have occasion to go out for their business or amusement, in a coach; they therefore walk, sometimes with Gentlemen, sometimes without: it happened, Gentlemen, that for some considerable space of time, the exact space of which will not be material here; some time before the 18th of January, 1789, when the fact which is charged on the prisoner happened, that in the course of the walk of these young ladies, the prisoner accosted them in a manner of which there is no example: Gentlemen, young women that are in the street, undoubtedly, in such a metropolis as this is, are not acquainted with the manners of a savage; the address of the prisoner at the bar was totally the reverse of all that ever they had heard; I shall undoubtedly forbear to desire young women to pollute their mouths with the repetition of that language which issued from him, but it was the most horrid, and the least sufferable to human ears: Gentlemen, the two eldest had most frequently walked out together, he had therefore most frequently accosted them in this manner, and that in the broad day, and not at night, in the publick streets, in publick places: Gentlemen, what were young women to do? he did not commit an assault upon them, on those occasions: he did not strike them; he approached them in a manner of which there is no example, and such as I have given you some faint idea of; they mentioned it at home, the manner, the frequency, the time of the day when the prisoner accosted them in this manner, gave them the fullest opportunity of being acquainted with his person; and I state to you now, that these young ladies were as familiar with his person, as with that of their father, they did not know Mr. Porter's person better than they knew that of the prisoner: Gentlemen, figure to yourselves, young ladies, such as these whom you will presently see, and whether there is any thing in this, calculated to make an impression, whether it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080097"/>like a gentleman passing a young lady, taking off his hat and asking how far she was going, or so on; that kind of civility does not lead a young woman particularly to retreat, is it that kind of thing: No; it is a man's acosting them in a shivering sort of voice, expressing some thing that is unintelligible, and when he speaks, speaks a most horrid language to them, talks of drowning them in their blood, and of blasting their eyes; are those circumstances to make impressions upon young women, or are they not? Are they likely to know the person of the man that does this, and is all this in the open day, when they are subject to no mistake whatever, when they turn round and look at him? Why, good God! have you any doubt that person to whom such an extraordinary transaction happens, and happens more than once, happens repeatedly! have you any doubt but they know, and are perfectly acquainted with the person of the man that does this: Gentlemen, there can be no doubt; and it will not avail the prisoner to say, either that the person who did all this, was him, but that he was not the person that committed the fact, in which the crime principally consists; or that he was not the person guilty of any of the transactions: Now Gentlemen, the effect this had on these ladies minds, and in the family, was such, that he had by them a name given to him, (not that which the publick has since with one voice unanimously given to him) he was called the Wretch; that was the name they described him by, and I dare say, they will tell you, that if they had the pleasure of being acquainted with any one of you, and saw you passing on the other side of the street, they could not have conveyed a more correct idea to the family, that an acquaintance was passing, if they had seen you there, than they described the prisoner, when they said in the family, there is the Wretch; or when they related any of his ill behaviour in the street to them; that is the Wretch! so that they had the person of the man, perfectly familiar to them, and the name applying to that person. Gentlemen, on the 18th of January, these young ladies, the two eldest, Miss Ann and Miss

(Here the learned Counsel minutely related the circumstances of the case, as were after repeated by the Miss Porters and the other witnesses, declaring that he had not words to express the dreadful injury, the shocking barbarity, the brutality, the ferocity of the prisoner, who in total want of all morality, of all humanity, and of all the claims of manhood, had made this attack on the person of Miss Porter. On the point of identity, Mr. Pigott observed)</p>

             then gave her evidence to the same effect as on the former trial, only mentioning several other times, in which the prisoner had previously insulted her and her sister; one of the jury asking, whether the language he had used was indecent or threatening? Mr. Fielding said, Madam, if you happen to know that sort of language, was it swearing, threatening, or indecent? To which she replied it was all; when she had finished, Mr. Fielding said,</p>
               <p>"Miss Porter, now only let me desire you not to be alarmed but collected; recollect the object of public justice, which alone you pursue; and any questions that are put to you by the gentleman concerned for the prisoner, answer them coolly."</p>
               <p>Mr. Swift. Whatever opinions have gone abroad of me, I can only say no person has felt more for your situation than I have; I only wish to obtain the truth from you, and shall disappoint these gentlemen in their expectations.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was not a quarter after twelve when you left the ball-room? - I am sure it was not.</p>
               <p>Was not you much agitated when you felt the blow? - However agitated I might have been, I should have known the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Swift dwelt very much on the circumstance of some lamps, which were obstructed by two bow windows, which might prevent her from seeing the prisoner's person; to which she said, there was a sufficiency of light to see, and she was sure it was him. Miss Porter being just ready to faint at the manner of Mr. Swift's putting his questions, he was reminded by the Chairman, that the mode he adopted was not the most likely to get at truth; upon which he apologized and said, it was only his impetuous manner, and he would endeavour to be more temperate.</p>
               <p>When you got home, after all the abuse you had met with in the various walks; whether you told your friends of that conversation? - I do not know what you mean by the various walks, I always told my friends when I went home; my situation always betrayed what I had met with.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner came into the room, had you, and your sister, and

                  </persName>
             any whisper in the corner? - Whisper! no; why should we? we had no occasion to whisper.</p>
               <p>Whether the lady did not say at Bow-street, the prisoner had brown hair? - I always said, I thought he had brown hair, but whether light or dark I could not say, because it was always powdered.</p>
               <p>Did not you describe him with a remarkable large nose, and very thin? - I said he was by no means a very thin, slim man; for he rather was stout made; I described him in the best manner I could he appeared to me to be about twenty-eight or thirty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I forgot to ask a question of infinite importance to the public, and I ask it by way of introducing hereafter, the most respectable testimony that ever was introduced into a court of justice; I mean Mr. Angerstein; Have you ever received any reward for the evidence you have given? - Reward! Sir; my God.</p>

               <p>You never had? - Never, Sir; Mr. Angerstein told me I was entitled to part of the reward; and I was surprised at the proposal, but I rejected it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Swift. Had you directly or indirectly any interest through the medium of Mr. Coleman? - Interest! Sir; I wonder how you can ask me such a question; what connection have I with Mr. Coleman? good God, Sir, no.</p>
               <p>M. Fielding. If any body should have said, that you have received fourteen hundred pounds on account of this; is it true or false? - The most infamous falsehood that any body can advance.</p>

               <p>Subsequent to the last trial of the prisoner, some days, I sent for Mr. Porter, and told him there was a reward to be given of fifty pounds, on the monster's being committed, and fifty pounds more on his being convicted; and I thought his daughter being so accessary in the finding of him, that she was intitled to half; and Mr. Coleman was to have the other; the father thanked me, and gave me no answer; he brought his daughter the next morning, I repeated to her as I did to the father, told her that I thought she was intitled to fifty pounds, as the reward, in being so accessary in taking of Williams; she thanked me, and refused the money, and said she would not touch a farthing of it, on any consideration whatever; the father then said, Sir, I approve of my daughter's conduct.</p>
               <p>Sir, in point of fact, they have, neither this man, nor any part of the family, either directly, or indirectly, had any part of it? - If the contrary has been asserted, it is a mistake.</p>

             some days after, and told him I had made an offer of half to Miss Porter, and that he was intitled to fifty pounds; he desired some days to consider of it; and some days after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080100"/>I gave him an order on Mr. Taylor to pay the 50 l to him; I believe he sent somebody for it; I believe I gave an order to Mr. Taylor, who collected the subscription; it amounted to 135 guineas; this family neither directly nor indirectly have touched a shilling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Swift then began the Prisoner's Defence, as follows:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury. I never felt myself in a more aukward situation in my life than I do at this moment; not that I have a bad case to defend, for I think that I have an exceeding good one; but the difficulty I have to contend with is, with gentlemen of great abilities, so great, that I cannot add to them by any praises of mine; I feel my own deficiency; I have been bred to the profession, as you see, but very unhappily I am very much out of the habits of it; I shall therefore hope for some candour and allowance, if through the impetuosity of my temper, or any other cause, I should fall into a mistake: I have another circumstance to encounter; a popular idea has gone forth, but I trust it is very ill founded indeed, that I have an enmity to the sex, and that no man would take up the cause that had not; these are calumnies, however, that no man will venture to my face, and I am sure there is no woman that will: Gentlemen, the cause of beauty is that cause which every man must be proud to be engaged in; but, on the other side, on the closest investigation of the case, the more I examined into it the more innocent I found the man: as for the alibi, I assure you I set it at naught; not that I think that the witnesses are not to be called, but I advised them not to be called; however, I hope you will presently hear them, their testimony will be such which will sufficiently set aside the evidence against the prisoner: the learned Gentleman, whom I must follow at a very humble distance, and in the lowest of his train, he opened this matter, and appeared very much moved; he said he would this day establish the case beyond the possibility of a cavil: I am in the correction of the Court as to the expression, but I will not grant him that he has established it beyond the possibility of a most substantial contradiction; he has described this person, whoever he was, that committed this outrage, as a monster; and I do think that, when he joined his voice with that of the publick, he could not give it a more strong name; it is that sort of name which perhaps may be the strongest our language affords; I heartily join issue with the Gentleman that he also has very humanely and candidly desired you to withdraw your minds from all prejudice I think the prisoner very happy in so enlightened a jury, and I am sure that no circumstance of a former trial will weigh one single feather in the scale this day: Gentlemen, the learned counsel, Mr. Pigot (and I do not mean to impeach the principles, integrity, and virtue, of the worthy Gentleman), observed, that the character of Mr. Angerstein could not be impeached; now, although a man may mean extremely well, yet rewards of a very high and exorbitant nature are attended with a dangerous influence, and in the calendar of the country instances may be found of men who have not only trumpt up evidence to obtain rewards themselves, but to get it in others; I do not mean it is so this day; the legislators have fixed on rewards of a certain sum; and I must say, when a private individual steps out of that line which is constitutionally appointed on those occasions, however he may not err in his heart, he certainly errs in his judgement; the influence which rewards have, if it has not been employed on some part of the evidence you have heard to-day, has been received by others, and you will judge what credit you will give to that man, I mean Coleman: Gentlemen, I am very unused to publick speaking; I have been about this business all day; and if I am in a labyrinth, you will get me out: my learned friend, who first addressed you, called the address that the poor prisoner made to you cant and hypocrisy; he said it was nothing more than cant to call his Maker to his innocence, that it was a mockery of publick justice;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080101"/>I presume not, and shall establish it to your satisfaction: the Gentleman has softened the expression, by calling it tricks that have been played before: he said they were a fine family, and that they are a fine family you have had a sufficient proof; the Gentleman should have left that to you; I know very well the power of beauty, I know very well its influence on the human heart; certain I am you are not men if it would not have an influence; they are a fine family; but because they are a fine family, justice must not lean all on one side: I shall now, Gentlemen, go into some part of the evidence; and I believe some of you have taken notes more correctly than I have: first, I must press on your memory the circumstantial and very strong declarations of the two first witnesses, and Mrs. Neale, with respect to the hour that they came out of the ballroom; that hour is the best part of my case; therefore I desire you will remember it was a quarter after eleven: Gentlemen, the only question for your consideration is, whether the person who committed this outrage was the man at the bar.

             tells you, that just as she passed, a chair was going by, and she felt at that instant a stroke from somebody, who I am very ready to admit was the person that wounded her sister; that they ran all together, and both described that the person, whoever he was, struck that woman, and stooped down; one knew him as he stooped down, and the other knew him as he stood up: Gentlemen, I shall call a witness to you, that shall prove to you, that there is literally a bow window on each side the door, which sufficiently intercept the lights: Gentlemen, your own reason, without my proving it, will tell you, that if there is an interception of light on the right and on the left, if a man stands with his back to the light, it is impossible the light can fall on his face; the only question is, whether, under all the circumstances of the case, this was the man who committed that outrage. Miss Sarah says she knew him by the lights in the passage; that she saw a man, and afterwards believed him to be the man; that I will not dispute; the brother, however, though he held the door in his hand, recollects nothing of him; why not? he did not know him before; therefore the sisters they go on their fore-knowledge, and one of them tells you, if she had not known him before, she should not have known him then; she knows the man that abused her, she knows the man that insulted her, but not the man that wounded her; they have been more circumstantial than they were before: Gentlemen, I happened to use a term very much made use of in the profession, I called it bolstering up of evidence; I do repeat it again; let it give what offence it will, they have found it convenient to bolster up the weak part; they have produced the brother, to prove nothing; they have produced Mrs. Neale, because she has done them no good; they produced her, in order to bolster it up, by a number of evidences, to bring out such matter as was not brought out before; they chuse to bolster it, and I will repeat it here in, and out of Court: Gentlemen, on the former trial I must make an observation; when the Miss Porters told their story there, they did not say one single syllable that, when they got into the house, they mentioned the man to their father, mother, or brother; only that they were wounded by some man or other; to-day they begin and produce the same people, and they themselves get out of them what they know would have been extorted from them in private conversation; therefore I repeat, they are brought to bolster up the weak parts of the former trial. With respect to the number of times that they say they saw the man, I do confess that they saw some man extremely like the prisoner. If there is any one fact that can strengthen the case, that at times a man like the prisoner, and at other times some man, would stop them, and use words the most dreadful; that a man should at one time be so wanton, so savage, lay aside his dignity, and that at another time he should pass on, and not speak to them; this is extraordinary, and I am not disposed to believe it; however,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080102"/>that some man has insulted them in this manner, in their various walks, I do most sincerely and most verily believe. Gentlemen, with respect to the point of identity, there was a particular case, I forget the very year, where a very worthy Gentleman, Sir

            , they prove nothing at all; I fancy I shall not be able to prove, because unhappily the poor prisoner is the only person that can prove it; but there has been indisputably an acquaintance between the prisoner and the witnesses, and yet it happens very fatally that there is a flat resemblance between the prisoner and some other man, and that the conversation and the knowledge which the prisoner and the witnesses have was of a very different nature indeed; I will not stain the word justice, by saying that there were private motives behind the curtain, but that there were conversations of a very different nature, such as excited the present prosecution: Gentlemen, one thing you will observe, some of the witnesses - (but, faith, I am so fluttered) - they say that when he used to assault them the mother was not with them; and yet it comes out, that sometimes he did not assault them when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080103"/>they were alone; but there being two different men; for my own part I see it so strong, and I think the prisoner's alibi will give you the utmost satisfaction: with respect to Mr. Tomkins, I have nothing to say to him; I was almost surprised to hear him say, he never heard of any ladies that had been assaulted since Mr. Williams was in custody; however, as he said he never heard of it, it is very possible he never did. Gentlemen, notwithstanding this surgeon of very extensive practice, I will call a surgeon of less extensive practice, whom I know very well; and whose word I would take beyond the oath of any one of the witnesses I have heard to-day; and if I prove there are any such men abroad, that have used the very same gestures, the very same language, and whose persons answer the description, not of the man at the bar, but of the man that was described at Bow-street; I will prove to you by and by, that there are ladies who have been wounded by a man, who answers the exact description of Miss Porter, in Bow-street; if it will be any satisfaction to the Court, it will be sworn. Gentlemen, I could tell you of a lady that has been most barbarously and cruelly wounded; I was with her at the moment it happened, on the 20th of August; and a most cruel business it was; and I am sorry to say that was the seventh time she had been assaulted since Williams was committed. I could not get the lady here to-day; her father-in-law is a very old man, and he is dangerously ill, but I hope you will give credit to the fact; if not I will be sworn to the truth of it; however, if it should appear that women have received frequent and dangerous wounds in these parts; if it should appear, that the very man who wounded this lady, answers the exact description that Miss Porter gave at Bow-street, and used the exact language of Oh, Oh; and stared her in the face, and stooped at her; I think it will have some influence upon you. Gentlemen, I trust, as the dignity of human nature is at stake, and as a poor helpless man stands here unbefriended, humanity will step forth: if the learned gentlemen deny me that justice here, I must say before-hand, they are afraid to meet the question: as for me, gentlemen, I have nothing to gain in coming here, I may have some character to lose; it may receive a sort of stain from the public; I despise the insinuation from my soul and heart; I despise the man that dares attempt it; I believe I should not stoop to kick him. I stand here, not the defender of the Monster, but the defender of another man; if I prove Williams was at another place, and that there has been these outrages committed by a man of a similar description, I shall gain my point. Gentlemen, I do not wish to take up your time, one observation more, and I will sit down; as to Macmanus, he found no instrument of a dangerous nature; and, with respect to Coleman, it is impossible to follow that man without expressing indignation, which I should be sorry to do: I beg to be corrected in a gentleman-like manner; but of all the witnesses I ever beheld, Coleman is the most extraordinary; the man follows him, he says, out of the Park; he says the prisoner came and looked at her; to be sure he did, they had been always accusing one another; this gentleman was with her and discovers her fears, and she tells him it is the Monster: away goes Monster, and away goes Coleman! I am told the prisoner is a very remarkable active man, and a fast walker; which way the prisoner went is very immaterial; but the prisoner did not look up at a house in Admiralty-court, that I assert; and I expect my word should go beyond his oath at any time; then he went into St. James's-street, and he looked into his brother's shop; observe he does not go across St James's-square, but up St. James's-street, where his person must be known by those ladies whom he so often met; and though they passed Miss Porter's door, they never attempted to take him in; it is all a trump up piece of business throughout. [Mr. Swift continued his observations on the evidence of Mr. Coleman for some time, and said he had enquired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080104"/>into the prisoner's character, which he had found to be good; and that he should establish an indisputable alibi, and trusted to the jury, that with their mercy and good sense mixed together, he should have a verdict for the defendant.]</p>

            , attempted to establish an alibi, as on a former trial, with some variation, however, in respect to some circumstances; for on being asked how they knew he did not leave Mitchell's till half past twelve, they said they knew the time by the quantity of work that was done, and did not look at a watch or clock; and one of the witnesses said the prisoner might have gone out, and she not have seen him. John Jerceaux proved by an order given to Mitchel for a dress for Mrs. Abington, as mentioned in the former trial. Two of the witnesses said he never went out at the street door, and it was impossible he should, without their knowing, because of a bell. Mr. Swift then informed the Court that he could call five or six witnesses to the prisoner's character, but that as it was so late, he would not detain the Court. Mr. Pigot replied at considerable length, in a very forcible manner, to Mr. Swift's observations, and concluded with reminding the jury of the situation some of their families might be in, if by their verdict the wretch should be set at liberty again. After which the chairman summed up the case, recapitulating the whole evidence very minutely, with many pertinent observations, and begging the jury, for God's sake! to divest themselves of all prejudice; and at one o'clock the jury retired for half an hour, doubting only whether they should find the prisoner guilty of an assault, with an intent to murder, or only of a common assault, when they returned with a verdict,</p>

               <p>Mr. Chairman. Gentleman of the jury, before I call your attention to the particular circumstances of this case, I cannot help availing myself of the opportunity which is now offered me of congratulating you on the justice you have done to your country; and I will say without a particle of flattery, that there never was an instance in this kingdom, of a more patient, a more deliberate, and a more unprejudiced enquiry, then was manifested by you yesterday, when that trial was before you. Gentlemen, you had the satisfaction not only of doing a noble piece of justice to this country, of quieting those alarms that were excessive indeed through this metropolis, but you have likewise the satisfaction, I will now tell you, of restoring peace to an innocent family, that have been for a considerable time in the most miserable agitation: for from the first commission of the crime on Miss Porter, that whole family have had no peace; and by this time you are aware that a late publication must have contributed extremely to their uneasiness. Gentleman, I very well know the quarter from whence that publication came; and I cannot from my soul think but it proceeded from a laudable, though mistaken motive: it frequently happens, that looking at some objects with a particular attention, and not regarding some which do not obtrude themselves to the view, a prejudice is begotten in the human mind; and under the influence of that prejudice, a man is led into a variety of mistakes. [Mr. Fielding proceeded to state the circumstances of his case.] Mr. Swift observed, that let the writer of the publication alluded to, be whom he might, he knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080105"/>him so well, that he was not ashamed of a single tittle of it; and that another publication on a late trial would appear.</p>

               <p>Had you an opportunity of observing his face and his person? - I took particular notice of him every time he spoke to me; I looked at him when he spoke to me; he then said, will you smell at them? and I said, no, I thank you, Sir, I am not partial to flowers; and I did not think they were natural flowers, but I did not say what I thought.</p>
               <p>Did it occur to you at the time that he had the nosegay in his hand, that they were not natural flowers? - Yes, it did; after that, he directly caught me by the throat, and with his other hand he gave me a blow across the thigh; and at that time I heard my clothes rent.</p>
               <p>Did you feel the wound at that moment? - No, Sir; I pushed his hand from my throat, and he struck me a blow on my breast; I cried out, to the best of my knowledge, murder; I cannot tell what became of him; he went on, and I turned up my own court, I was so near my own home; there is but one house between the yard and the court; I knocked at the door, and they let me in; I first saw my landlady,

               <p>Do you recollect what coat this man had on? - To the best of my knowledge ( it was candle-light) it was a light coat, with buttons of the same; it appeared to have a lappel, with buttons on the breast.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing his face at the different times he spoke to you? - Yes, a great opportunity, because all the shops were open.</p>
               <p>Turn round, and see if you can see the same man again? - Yes, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Have you the least doubt? - Not the least in the world. I went to Bow-street; my landlady was with me; I saw him in the yard among a great number of other persons; and I said to Mrs. Garrison, that is the man that cut me.</p>
               <p>Had you any body to point him out to you, except your own recollection of his person? - No, Sir, there was no person there to say any thing to me; and as soon as I came out of the house into the yard, I saw him, and singled him out directly; he was dressed in buff and blue.</p>
               <p>Had you ever been taken to Bow-street by other people? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Do look at him again, and tell the jury whether you have any doubt at all of that being the same man that struck you? - No; I have no doubt of the features of his face; his hair was dressed with powder at that time.</p>

               <p>Court. How long after that did you see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080106"/>him? - When he was at Bow-street, the 4th of June; I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I keep the house where this poor woman lodges; I remember her coming home on the 5th of May; she hallooed aloud in the court; I did not know her voice; I thought it was a common prostitute; I did not open the door directly; she knocked twice before I opened it; and when I opened it, I asked her what was the matter? she did not answer me any farther, than she said, oh, the man! the man! I shut the door, and she dropped down in a fit; I went with her afterwards to Bow-street; and she went into the yard and pitched on the prisoner; there were a great many people in the yard; I thought it was a gentleman that was walking under the Piazzas; she said, no; it was a gentleman in blue, with a buff waistcoat; I never saw the prisoner before; she said she did not think the flowers were natural.</p>
               <p>Did you see the wound on this poor woman? - Yes; she was ill about nine days.</p>
               <p>Was it a cut with a sharp instrument? - It was like a scar; but the blood was within the scar; no blood besides; it seemed to be a small instrument; the clothes were cut all through at the same part as the wound was.</p>

               <p>I saw this poor woman, I believe, a day or two after this happened; she came very ill to my house; she described the coat to be a light-coloured coat; I do not recollect the circumstance of the lappels; I was not well myself at the time; I took particular notice of it, as it was different from the other description.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her say any thing of the buttons? - No, Sir; the first description I had of the monster, was a blue coat; and she differed in the colour of the coat so much, that I took notice of it in another advertisement.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was going to enter on his defence; but Mr. Swift said, not a word, Mr. Williams; you was prevented from speaking last night, and you shall not be permitted to speak to day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I shall take the advice of the gentleman, my counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen of the jury, I must say, that I never saw either in this, or any other court of justice, a jury conduct themselves with more impartiality, more coolness, more fairness, more deliberation, and more propriety, than you did yesterday; you have done yourselves great honour; you have done your country great service. I am now, gentlemen, to call upon you, and endeavour to impose upon you a still harder task; that you would endeavour, if possible, to forget every thing that passed even yesterday; and to treat this as a new offence; and to treat the prisoner, in your judgment upon him, as if you had never heard of him before, but that he was now, for the first time, brought before you, charged with an assault, proved only by one witness, but with certain corroborating circumstances. Here the chairman summed up the evidence; and the jury immediately found the prisoner</p>

               <p>Look at him now? - That is the person.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt? - Not the least: I went to see some other persons at Bow-street, but they were not the right persons. (A blue silk gown produced.) It is cut about half a yard; it was folded up round me; I did not hear it rent at the time; the rest of my clothes were cut, and I am positive they were not cut before, and the scratch corresponded with the cutting of the gown.</p>

            , spinster, with intent, wilfully and maliciously to tear, spoil, cut, and deface her garments; and that you on that said 18th of January, in the parish aforesaid, in the said public street, did wilfully, maliciously, and feloniously, cut, tear, and deface her silk gown and shift, being part of her wearing apparel which she then had on, and wore on her person, against the form of the statute; upon this indictment the jury have found you guilty; but your counsel made two objections in arrest of judgment; the one to the form of the indictment, and the other to the substance of it, namely, that the facts as proved, did not constitute the offence intended to be punished by this act of parliament. A majority of the judges are of opinion that both the objections are well founded; in respect to the first, the words of the statute make it necessary that the assault and the tearing should be at one and the same time; whereas, here it is not laid as the same act; but for any thing that appears on the face of this indictment, it may be that the assault was on one part of the day, and that the tearing of the clothes might be on another part of the day; because it does not say that you made an assault on such a day, and then and there tore the clothes, but that you made such an assault on such a day; and that on the said 18th of January, you wilfully tore the clothes. Now, the law in favour of a prisoner, requires the utmost precision, and is not to be made out merely by inference; therefore the indictment was certainly not properly or accurately laid: with respect to the other part of the objection, that the case as proved, was not substantially within the intent of the act of parliament; a majority of judges were likewise of opinion that it is not. The occasion of enacting this law, was, that a crime of a very extraordinary and unaccountable nature was then committed, by tearing clothes in the street for the mere sake of mischief; and to bring this case within that act of parliament, the primary intention of the person must be the tearing of the clothes; whereas, your primary intention appears to have been the wounding the person of the prosecutrix: the legislature never looked forward to a crime of so diabolical a nature, as that of wounding his Majesty's subjects in a most savage manner, for the mere purpose of wounding them, without any provocation to the party; if they had, it is probable they would have annexed a still higher punishment for such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080092"/>an offence, than that in the act of parliament; but as the legislature did not apprehend, and of course have not provided for it, it does not fall within the province of those who are to expound the law, to usurp the office of the legislature: but though you are not within the lash of this law, as far as a felonious act, the common law remedy is still open upon an indictment for a misdemeanor; and if the fact should be proved to the satisfaction of the jury, the common law is armed with sufficient power to punish the offence, so as to make a man repent of his temerity, in having been guilty of so flagrant a breach of it. At present you will be remanded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg leave to address the Court for a few minutes. My lord, after a confinement of six months, as disgraceful as it has been distressing to me, I feel little satisfaction at the interpretation of the statute, which has neither cleared my character as a man, nor established my innocence in the eye of justice; at last I am only reserved for severer trials, though the letter of the law may not apply to a cruel conviction. I have suffered prejudice, which arms justice with new whips to scourge me. My case remains the very same it was five months ago; I have no new evidence to offer: such of the family as were present with me in Dover-street, at the time Miss Porter was wounded, have already given their testimony; that testimony has not been credited; as it was the true, being the only testimony I have to adduce, if it did not avail me then, it will not for the future. Much as I have been abused and libelled in the public prints, and bad as a persecuting world will be disposed to think of me, I will neither bring people to perjure themselves, or prove another alibi; my innocence, however, has not wanted an advocate. After the publication of this, gentlemen, was I to stand a second trial, the same perjury that pushed them on to convict me before, would only be multiplied for the purpose of strengthening those witnesses, as the learned gentleman in his letter to the judge who tried me, has pointed out; and therefore I do not feel the least exultation in discovering that after a cruel and bitter confinement of six months, I have only exchanged a less misery for a greater. Good God! for what am I reserved? without friends! without either money to support me in my difficulties, or to enable me to stand another trial with those whom reward has enriched, and whose case has made friends of all men, it is impossible that a poor and helpless individual as I am, should struggle with the stream, or prevail with those who have determined they will not be convinced. I stand an instance of singular misfortune; while my passion for the sex has nearly been my ruin, that the singular charge of a nature directly opposite, should compleatly be my destruction. I have now nothing to hope for or to look for in this world: to my God alone, to whom my innocence is known, and whom, in this instance, at least, I have not offended, I turn with comfort for support, though justice be denied me here; a father so kind and merciful will not refuse me, when I demand it of my prosecutor in that great day when the judges of this earth will themselves be tried. Most chearfully should I have sought amongst savages in another country, that protection which has been denied me in this. I have nothing farther to add, my lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams was then remanded, being charged on several indictments for assaults, to be tried at the new Sessions-house on Clerkenwell-green.</p>
