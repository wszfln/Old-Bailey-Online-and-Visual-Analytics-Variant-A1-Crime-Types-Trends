                  </hi>. I am the wife of Dr. Hesse, of Broad-street-buildings—in June, 1861, the two prisoners had offices in our house, in the name of W. R. Hughes and Co.—they were there six weeks—they did not leave of their own accord—when Keeling took the offices he gave the name of John Keel<lb/>ing—I did not know anything of Sheen till some time afterwards—they paid no rent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was Keeling there some three or four weeks before Sheen came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Keeling told me that Sheen was his clerk, and was a relation of his—Keeling told me that he traded in the name of Hughes, as be had traded in that name in Dublin, and had a brother-in-law of that name—I knew that his name was Keeling—several persons came to and fro, but 1 had nothing to do with the offices—persons came in and out in the ordinary way that offices are used; and I have stopped the trade by telling such persons who came, to be careful that they did not deliver their goods without the cash—two days before the prisoners left, I told some one so; but we knew it from the first—I saw what they were, and I told the people that came to be careful—they had only been a few weeks at the office before I saw what they were; and they only remained six weeks—they were quarterly tenants—they did not enter at the half-quarter—it was after the rent was due that I saw this, and I told them on the Saturday that they must leave on the Monday, and that during their being in my place I should caution every one—I did that because I had reasons—there were so many people coming to ask for money, and they always denied it—the prisoners always said that their master was not at home—I had nothing to do with the offices; but there was such a great deal of noise that I sometimes went down stairs to see what it was, and that was how I knew that people some<lb/>times called for money, and they said the master was not at home; and we knew at the time that Sheen and Keeling were in the office—we had the whole of the house, except a few offices on the ground floor—I could hear everything from my room, which is only up one flight—I did not answer the door—1 sat in the room over their offices, and I could hear much noise, and there were a great many gentlemen coming there for money, and making a noise—they were scolding or angry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Keeling. Q.</hi> Did not you mention to me that this disturbance occurred when I was away for two or three weeks in the country? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but it happened also when you were there, and you knew it very well—it never ceased while you were there, until I got you out—it is not true that nobody went away while you were there without being paid—I asked you the reason you put up W. R Hughes and Co. over the door, and then you told me that you never mentioned the name to the agent—that was the reason he was surprised to see it on the door—yon told me yourself that Mr. Fox</p>

               <p>never went to your reference, that he never troubled himself for any reference—he did not tell me that he had ascertained that you were respect<lb/>able people—he said that nothing could be done till the quarter, when we could give you notice—be showed me some letters from your brother on 24th June—you took it from 24th June, and the rent was due in three months—it was you who took the offices.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lodging-house keeper, of 4, Norfolk-street, Strand—the prisoners came to lodge there in December—Sheen gave the name of Martin, and Keeling that of Henry—Sheen gave me their card—it bad on it" Anderson, Martin, and Co. merchants, 40, St. Mary-axe"—he gate it to me as a reference—my rent was not paid—they lived together, and occupied the same bed—they had a portmanteau and a trunk; the trunk contained some bricks and iron, and a carpet; and the portmanteau some iron, and dirty linen, and papers—1 took those things for my rent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Hampton—I recollect some carpets being tent to Martin, Anderson, and Co. 40, St. Mary-axe—Keeling came to me shortly afterwards to say that he had been very much abused by the firm; that he was their clerk, and they had turned him out—I asked him if there was any probability of getting the goods or the money—he said we might get the goods, but not the money; and if we saw Sergeant Joy he would be able to give us some information—he said they were a parcel of swindlers from top to bottom, tad the firm was a complete hoax—we did not get paid for the carpets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you supply them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 25th November 1861, and I was called on 6th or 7th December, about ten days after<lb/>wards—they were not in custody then—in consequence of what Keeling told me, I went to 40, St Mary Axe, and asked for the money—we had sent the bill with the goods, and requested a settlement—we sent a stamp which was either torn off or brought back—we did not exactly give them credit for the goods—the understanding was that they were to be paid for on delivery, but our man came back with another small order for mats, and said that the money would be paid—we did not take the carpets up again, because it would be a great loss to us—we were rather short-handed, so we let the matter stand over.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Keeling's Defence.</hi> I took the office in Broad-street-buildings in my own name, and explained to the agent that I was doing business with my brother-in-law, Mr. Hughes, in Dublin, who had been in business with me previous to my leaving Dublin. Mr. Fox went down and had an interview with my brother at the West-end. I called on him a few days afterwards, and he expressed himself perfectly satisfied. I took the offices in June; my rent commenced at quarter day. Mr. Fox told me he would call on Dr. Hesse and tell him that he was satisfied of my respectability, and that I might have possession in a few days. I called afterwards and saw</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186203030010"/>
               <p>Dr. Hesse and he told me the agent had seen him, and he was quite satisfied, and he gave me the key. I think Mrs. Hesse was then present; I explained to her that my brother-in-law was in Dublin; that his name was Hughes. I got an order from a gentleman in Ireland for some of those measures that have been spoken of I did not know much of the large manufacturing houses in London; and Mr. Sheen having longer experience than I, I happened to mention to him that I wanted some measures, I said a very small quantity at first, to see if they would suit. He happened to know Messrs. Pontifex, and I asked him to call and select some for me. He did so, and selected one set, amounting to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. My brother-in-law was in London then. I had just before that told Mrs. Hesse that my brother-in-law was coming up, and he would arrange all the accounts; that is why, when the man brought those things up, he was told that Mr. Hughes was not at home. As regards the two firms with which they have endeavoured to identify my name, Leslie, in Fenchurch-street, and at Pudding-lane, I was not there at all. At the time of the existence of those two firms I was in Whitecross-street, till the end of April, 1861, when I passed through the court. Mr. Webbe has alluded to a firm called Monck, Keeling, and Co., and I asked him to produce the card which he saw; there was never an office of such a firm in existence. At that time, in May, 1860, I was clerk to a Mr. Smythe, who had offices in St. James'-street, and having some capital I invested it in the purchase of some wines. I knew a gentleman of the name of Monck, in Dublin, a spirit merchant, and he asked me if I would try and get him some orders here. I said I would, and he had some papers printed with the name of Monck, Keeling, and Co., on them, and sent them over to me. I sent them back, and said that it would not suit my purpose to carry on an agency of that sort, consequently there were never any cards printed, nor any names put up over the office, nor did I ever do any business or send out any circulars, or any business letters in such a name. With reference to the firm of Burns and Co., in Bush-lane, I had no con<lb/>nexion with it. I was engaged by them when the firm was first established there. I was never even seen in it; but I was offered a commission if I would dispose of some goods for them at certain prices. I endeavoured to do so, and I made a little money for two or three weeks while I was con<lb/>nected with them. Mr. Webbe came to me there. I told him I was engaged by Mr. Burns, doing commission business, and I wished him not to have me arrested at that time; but that I would pay him so much a week off his bill; that was in July. The firm of Stauley and Co. was in existence at the very time that I was doing business in King-street, St. James's ; I was only in that office twice altogether. I was engaged at St. Mary-axe as a clerk. It has been endeavoured to identify me there as a partner, which I was not. I was only there for three weeks altogether, and at Christmas, the housekeeper, according to her own statement, received instructions not to allow me into the office if I came there, and when I presented myself about 2d or 3d Jan<lb/>uary, and wanted to get some papers of mine which were there, and told her to come into the office with me, in order that I might get them, she told me that she had received instructions not to allow me in, and she did not; of course if I was a partner in the place I could have insisted on going in, but I did not do so, knowing that I had no right there unless the gentlemen were present and wished me to be so. I utterly repudiate any intention of defrauding Messrs. Pontifex of those goods. I did not assume any name. Mr. Hughes is my brother-in-law's name, and if I had had a little longer notice, I should have been prepared this day with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186203030011"/>
               <p>witnesses to have proved the statements I have made. I have been in busi<lb/>ness many years, as one of the mart extensive booksellers and publishers in Ireland, where my name is well known. When Mrs. Hesse complained of the disturbances there had been, in consequence of people coming for small mounts, I ascertained that that had really takes place. I had been away for three weeks out of the six, for which that office was occupied; and while I was away other persons, who had been left in the office, had had trifling things in, such as dinners, and there had been noises upon the people com<lb/>ing for the payments for them. I settled all those when I came home. During the whole time I was there, there was not £5 credit obtained for anything. After I was dismissed from Anderson and Co's, I gave informa<lb/>tion to those gentlemen that they might obtain their goods or their money. When I called upon them they told me that they were perfectly satisfied and did not wish to take any steps whatever. When I was at Bow-street, I thought it was only a charge of fraud; I had no idea it was a charge of forgery, nor was I aware of it till to-day. I am perfectly innocent of any intention to defraud, and I have never gone into any place of business except in my own name. I never had any office except that in Broad-street-buildings; the other offices I had no connection with at all.</p>

I live at 30, South-street, Marylebone—I was an assistant in the employ of Mr. Wincott the deceased, at 30, South-street—about 4 o'clock on Saturday afternoon, 3d February, I was in the shop—we have a customer of the name of Viall, who takes away the bones from our place—Viall was there with his cart removing bones from our place that afternoon—whilst the cart was at the door laden with bones, I saw the prisoner come up with three other men, named Walsh, Cox, and Poulton; they came up and commenced taking the bones from the boneman's cart—I can't say which began, they all began, they took the bones and threw at Viall the boneman—some of them got up on his cart and took bonesa nd began throw<lb/>ing</p>

I live at 357, Oxford-street—I am in service there—I was not in service on the day this occurred—on the day in question I was coming down South-street—I did not know the prisoner or Mr. Wincott previously; all the parties were strangers to me—I was coming along with another young person, and saw a man or the cart with a large bone in his hand—I stood by the butcher's door, not thinking that the butcher had any<lb/>thing to do with the fight, and he laughed and jeered, and encouraged the man in the cart to hit these boys—I saw Mr. Wincott in the shop—I was in the shop when he was stabbed—when the man in the cart leaped on to the pavement, and ran into the shop I ran into the shop too, for safety—I did not see the prisoner try to get in to the shop—they never came opposite the butcher's door—I saw the prisoner outside, at the door, and I heard Mr. Wincott tell the prisoner to go out of his place—I did not see the prisoner come in—I saw Mr. Wincott get a bone and hit him on the shoulder with it—I cannot tell whether it was a heavy or a light blow—I saw Mr. Wincott afterwards stabbed—I cannot say how many minutes that was after I had seen him strike the prisoner; it was afterwards—I did not go before the police Magistrate—I was living then next door but one to the butcher's, in a situation, and my mistress thought to keep me from it, if she could—I am here to-day because they brought a summons, and of course I was obliged to appear to it.</p>

               <p>for that purpose kept a considerable quantity of money in the second till at the window-end of the counter—on 15th February there were 56 sovereigns in a bowl in that till—a person standing on the ground, could not reach over the counter to the till—between 1 and 2 o'clock that day the prisoner Hall came into the shop for a sheet of paper to wrap something in—he had nothing with him to wrap up—I handed him one or two sheets which did not suit, and he went with me to the back of the counter, where he took a seat, selected a sheet, and paid for it—I was alone in the shop, Mr. Brown was at a funeral—I am not aware whether Hall had an opportunity of seeing where the money was kept, as I do not know whether I served a customer while he was there—having obtained a sheet of paper he left the shop—shortly afterwards he came in again for a larger sheet—I had several money orders to attend to, and said, "Will you go to the other end of the shop and see if you can find a larger sheet, while I am serving these customers?"—not many minutes elapsed before I went to him—no one was then left at the other part of the shop; he and I were the only persons in the shop (in attending to the customers I had had occasion to open the drawer where the money was; it was the money-order drawer)—I heard a slight noise, raised my head, and saw the other prisoner on the counter lifting the bowl of sovereigns up in his baud—I rushed to him—I do not know whether I shoved him round; but he tried to put some of the sovereigns into his pocket, and some of them were thrown upon the ground—some one came to the door, and I held George till a policeman came—not above a minute or two had then elapsed—Hall stood looking on, but did nothing; he was standing about six or seven feet from the door—he emptied the money out of his pocket when he saw that there was no means of escape—George opened Hall's pocket and put the money into it, while Hall stood perfectly still—he emptied it on the counter almost directly it had happened—he did not endeavour to assist me in any way—he said something, but I forgot what—they were both given in custody—two sovereigns fell outside on the door eill, which were picked up and given to the policeman—they were all found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 97, Fleet-street—on Monday afternoon, 24th February, about 3 o'clock, the prosecutor was brought to me bleeding from the side of the crown of the head—I examined his hand, and found an incised wound about an inch and three-quarters long, and a quarter of an inch deep—I did not probe it, as I thought I would not interfere with it, the skill not being at all depressed—it had gone through the integuments—it had been inflicted by a sharp instrument—this hatches would certainly do it, but it must have been with the sharp side—there was concussion of the brain—he apparently could not stand when he came in, and he has not recovered it yet.</p>

                  </hi>. In consequence of information I received, I went to 1, Pimlico-walk, Hoxton, on 27th February, at 7 o'clock in the morning, accompanied by my son and other officers—we broke the outer door and the parlour door—there is a parlour and a back room—I broke the front parlour door in first, and directed the officers to go in—the two Youngs were there with a baby—the other officers went there—I and my son went into the back yard to the back door leading to the kitchen—I did not go through the parlour—there is a door into the back-room from the yard, and also a door between the back room and front parlour—I broke open the door from the yard into the back room—it was partially opened by my son when I got there, and he was held in the door by the prisoner Pitt, who resisted vio<lb/>lently, and was assisted by a bed which was thrown across the door—before I got in I was seized in the private parts by Pitt, from within the room—he put his hand out—he was naked—I was halfway within the door—he and Close were both undressed—Sergeant Brannan said, "She's breaking the mould"—at that time Inspector Webster pushed in behind me, and assisted me to seize the male prisoner—Sergeant Brannan and Inspector Bryant seized Close, and took from her hand these fragments of plaster of Paris moulds (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had hold of Pitt by the hair of the head and he said, "Leave go of my head, Mr. Brannan, you will find all you want on the shelf; there is a galvanic battery, and all you want"—he was then secured by Inspector Webster—I went to the shelf and found in this basket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) a cylinder jar, and another jar, both containing acid, a copper wire which has been dipped in solution, and all that forms a complete battery—on the mantle-shelf in that room I found in a little box, two 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces and a sixpence, counterfeit—we then proceeded with the prisoners into the front room—I pulled down the blind—one of the Young's was on the bed, and the other one lying on another bed on the floor—on pulling down the blind I saw Margaret Young put her hand underneath the clothes of the child which the elder prisoner had in bed with her—I said, "You have passed something to your mother; I am not going to be done in that way; let me have it"—they both posi<lb/>tively denied that there was anything passed—I said, "Don't let's hurt the baby; I am determined to have it"—I seized the elder prisoner Young by the wrist, and in it I found this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which contains two shillings, two groats, and a counterfeit 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I then said to the prisoners that I had received instructions from the authorities of the Mint to look after them as dealing largely in counterfeit coin—I said, "It appears the im<lb/>prisonment you both have had has not had the desired effect"—the younger prisoner said, "I did pass it, Mr. Brannan;" and the elder prisoner said, "That is all we have got; you will find no more, Mr. Brannan"—previously to that I addressed Pitt and Close and told them I had had them under observation for some time—Harriet Young said to her daughter, "That is the fruits of acting kindly towards others"—I produce the whole of the articles I have mentioned—the baby is the illegitimate baby of the younger prisoner—it was born in prison.</p>

I was going down home, and met some friends; I had something to drink, and had change for a sovereign. On the Monday morning I went down there again; I met a friend, and went and had a glass of ale with him. I must have taken the money there on the Saturday night. I had had too much to drink then, and also on the Monday.</p>

I found these papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the prisoner Clark—one is a letter written from a lady from Dover to give him a character, and here is a letter to a gentleman at Russell-square—I went there, and they said that he was a very good servant when with them, and they had recommended him to a lady at Dover—that is where the letter is dated from—he had been drinking at the time I took him—I should think he knew what he was about—he went before the Magistrate two hours afterwards, and seemed to be quite sober then.</p>

I am a fishmonger of 61, Ashburton-grove, Hornsey-road—on 3d February about 4 o'clock, I was passing along South-street, and saw the three prisoners and Quail coming along South-street—there was a bone cart outside Mr. Wincott's door—Quail jumped on to the step on one side, and Poulton on the other; they got into the cart on each side, and <hi rend="italic">throwed</hi> bones at Viall—Cox and Walsh were standing by, saying, "Go it, let him have it"—they then went away—they came back again—Viall had not entered the shop before they returned; he was just going into the shop when they came back—Quail took up the knife and stabbed Mr. Wincott in the groin on the right side; and afterwards Cox took up the chopper that was lying by and waved it over his head, and said, "You b—, I will have your head off"—I saw Mr. Wincott stabbed.</p>

I am a member of the College of Physicians, and live at 56, High-street, Shadwell—on Wednesday night, 29th January, about a quarter to 12 o'clock, I was called to the police-station in King David-lane, and found the deceased suffering from an incised wound in the right side of the abdomen, at the lower part: it was about three inches and a half long—I dressed it, and had him conveyed home—I continued to attend him till the time of his death, which was eighty-seven hours after the injury—he died on the 2d February—all wounds penetrating the abdomen are considered highly dangerous—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination and found that the wound extended through the walls of the abdomen, and there was a wound of an inch and a quarter through the peritoneum—the inner wound corresponded with the external one—the cause of death was inflammation of the peritoneum, produoed by the wound—it was such a wound as would be caused by a stab with a knife—he was sober when I first saw him, and the prisoner also.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, A</hi> 51). I was present when Mr. Selfe, the Magistrate, took the depositions of the deceased, James Gardiner—the pri<lb/>soner was present and cross-examined Mr. Gardiner—this is Mr. Selfe's signature—I saw him sign it, and Mr. Gardiner also. (<hi rend="italic">Deposition read:</hi>—"James Gardiner says, 'I live at 1, Denmark-street, St George's, lodging-house-keeper. Patrick Devereux came to lodge with me last Saturday night, the 25th January. On Wednesday afternoon he paid me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he owed me more than that; he wished me to return the money that he might himself pay to the tailor and bootmaker; this was about 6 o'clock in the evening; he came three times in the course of the evening to see me at the George and Vulture over the way. I was standing in front of the bar with Cohen, the bootmaker; the prisoner came to the door and said, "Are you going to pay me that money." I said, "I will not," he went outside the door, and said, "By Jesus, I will make you see directly." Mr. Cohen and me stood at the bar for three or four minutes, and then we came out; the prisoner stepped forward as we came to the door, and said, "Are you going to pay me that or not?" I said, "Be off with you, don't come tor<lb/>minting me any more." He had his right hand hanging down by his side; I scarcely had the words out, when he made a plunge at me, and struck me in the lower part of the stomach. Mr. Cohen then called out, "A knife." It was as quick done as thought; I had not myself seen any knife, but I put my hand down and called out "I'm stabbed." I felt the blood I trickling down my legs. I was anxious to see, and ran into the tap-room to pull my things down, and found I had a severe stab. In two minutes the policeman re<lb/>turned with the prisoner, and I swear he is the man who stabbed me; I had never given, him any provocation; the prisoner was perfectly sober and so was I; I went to the station, and Mr. Ross came and saw me, and dressed my</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner being called upon to say whether he had any reason to give, why judgment of Death should not be passed upon him, said,</hi> "My Lord, I came into London on Friday evening and Mr. Gardiner came into the ship and asked me where I was going to board; I told him I had a boarding-house where I was stopping before, named Jacobs; he said that she had left the place altogether; we came up to London in the morning and that man came on board the ship, it was a wet day on Saturday and he stopped all day waiting for the crew and he said "You must come with me for the woman has left the place. I went with him and was four days on shore. I came down and was four days in his house, when I was paid off I went to the office, he had a bit of paper in his hand and said "Are you going to remit your money to me?" I said "I can keep my money myself;" he said "There are a great many robberies about here and it may be picked from you" and I gave it to him. I was paid off the <hi rend="italic">Dunbar</hi> and I went to a man named Davis where I bought some clothes. I waited till 3 o'clock and saw him in his own house and asked him if he was going to settle; he said "There is plenty of time the night is long. I went up to his house and then met him in the public-house and said "Are you going to settle with me, Mr. Gardiner; I want to go to ny mother and father in the morn<lb/>ing." I was sitting down in his house about an hour, and I came down to the public-house again and asked him "Are you coming to settle with me or I shall lose the steam-boat in the morning?" He came up and came into his house and said "This <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> is always offending me and he put his back against the door like this. Some of my shipmates were there but they have all gone away. He said, "You owe five days board," wanting to charge me for Saturday, when I only arrived on Saturday night and he said "There is 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for putting the heels on your boots." I said that I would not pay it I could get it done for a shilling. He said "There is 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the pair of boots you have got on your feet" and he said "You are in my debt." I said "I cannot be for only four days board." He would not settle with me and I went to a policeman and told him of it, in St. George's Highway; he said "You must wait till morning." "I said "I want to have my money before the morning" and the policeman said he could do nothing further. I asked him to come into the house with me and settle for me but he would not, and I went to the public-house; he was there drinking and one of my shipmates was there: I asked him to give me my clothes and I would go home with what money I had in my pocket, he said "Go away you scamp or I will kick your a—" he struck me three times. I said if he kicked me I would summons him in the morning. I am not getting justice, that man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Cohen</hi>) can give me justice if he likes but he wo'nt. He kicked me and turned me out. I went into the public-house, and was drinking, and this man with him, and one of my shipmates and two girls. My shipmates called me in to give me a glass of rum but I would not take it, I was crying. He would not give me my clothes and he</p>

               <p>came outside the door. I asked him if he was going to give me my clothes and he struck me in the pit of the stomach. I went in this manner (<hi rend="italic">stoping</hi>) and two girls said "Are you stabbed?" I could not speak, and they said, "The boy is stabbed." When I came to my senses I said, "I am not stabbed." I heard no more till I was taken by the police. That is all I have to say, I beg for mercy and I know I shall get justice. Have mercy upon me my Lord, have mercy; don't hang me; my father is an old man and I have no one to help my mother and my little brothers and sisters and what am I to do.</p>

I am a cheesemonger, carrying on business at 26, Fetter-lane, four doors from the prosecutor—on Saturday night, 25th January, I saw the prisoner near my shop—he put his barrow right in front of my shop—I saw him put a can of varnish on the barrow, and wheel it away—I did not see any one with him—I gave information to Mr. Reeve.</p>

               <p>man asked me where I was going; I said, "Straight down;" and he asked me if I would give him a lift with the can. I said, "Yes." He put it on the barrow; I wheeled it about forty or fifty yards from him, when Hench tapped me on the right shoulder. I asked him what he wanted. He asked me where I got the can from. I told him the man asked me to wheel it for him. He told me to wait a moment. He looked at the can, and I said, "Does it belong to you?" He said, "Yes." I took it off the barrow, and placed it on the pavement. If I had stolen the can, or known that it was stolen, why did I not place it inside the barrow? it would have been concealed there. Instead of which, I placed it on the top of the barrow board, and it could be seen from the top of Fetter-lane to the bottom. I did not know what it contained. I never used any of it in my life. Mr. Hench saw the other man who was with me.</p>

I live at 1, Albert-terrace, Wharf-road, Islington—I am a carman—on Friday, 21st February, about half-past 4, I was at the New Cattle-market—I saw the prisoner there—he was with a horse—I saw the deceased John Gould—he went up and spoke to the prisoner—I did not hear what was said, I was on the other side of the way—the prisoner knocked him on the nose with the end of his stick once or twice—Gould then walked away to the other side of the way—the prisoner untied his horse, which was tied up to the pens, and followed him, and said he would punch his b—head; and he called him a b—old rogue several times—Gould said he did not know as ever he <hi rend="italic">rogued</hi> him or anybody else—Gould was a farrier—the prisoner up with the end of the halter that he had hold of the horse with, and tried to put it round Gould's neck, and said, "I will hang you, you old b—, I will"—Gould said he would call the police<lb/>man, and the prisoner said, "Call the policeman; there he is"—Gould said he did not want to call the policeman if he would go on and not insult him; he had given him no cause to insult him—the prisoner directly up and shoved the stick in Gould's eye, and said, "Take that you old b—, do"—the stick went into Gould's left eye, between his nose and left eye—the prisoner had hold of the stick the whole time—it was a drover's stick; a little thin ash stick—a policeman was close handy—somebody called the policeman, and Gould gave the prisoner in charge—blood flowed from the wound; it came on to his cheek, and his eye swelled up very much directly after it was done—the policeman took the prisoner into custody, and took the stick from him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the stick.</p>

I am a labourer at Harmondsworth—on Wednesday, 5th February, I was coming along the road in the direction of the rick, on the London side—I was about 300 yards from the rick when I saw the fire—I walked towards it, and met the prisoner 126 yards from the spot, on the London side of the rick—he was walking along towards London—I could not say whether he came out of the field or no—I stopped him and asked if he knew what it was on fire—he said, "I don't know, I am sure"—I said, "You most know I"—he said, "I don't know, I am sure; I never saw it till I got by"—I said, "You must know, for you are hardly by now?"—he said, "I don't know, I am sure," and then I left him and ran to the rick—he went on—when I got into the field there was no one there that I could see—it was impossible for any one to get away, for the field is between fifty or sixty acres—there was a man about 200 yards ahead of me, going home from his work the same as I was; that was Pye, who is here—I believe the prisoner was not smoking when I met him.</p>

I had only had this room three or four days, and did not know the character of the persons who had been there before me. I did not come home till 8 o'clock, and then went down to town, and did not come home till a quarter to 12. Everybody knows how I get my living in the towns I go through. I bought the bayonet with some old iron, and I can prove it. I never saw these persons before, to my knowledge; only the sailor (<hi rend="italic">Evans</hi>). I have seen him at Deptford, when he came three months ago, on the Saturday. I was hawking at Deptford, and saw the inspector at 2 o'clock, about a quarter of a mile from the station.

I did not come home till half-past 10, and my wife was out, too, looking for a living. I go about gathering rags.

We met Bradburn in Whitechapel-road. He asked me where I had been. I said, "To the play." He said, "Are you going home?" I said, "No," and we went together, he and his wife, and me and my wife. We did not go home till half-past 12. He then went up into his room, and I went into mine. My wife went down to get a pot of beer. She stopped a long time, and I went to look after her; when I came up again the policeman and two more constables were in his room, and the good woman was lying on the bed. He said to me, "Do you live here?" I said, "No; this is my room next door." I went into my room, and in about ten minutes he took me in custody. I asked him what for. He said, "On suspicion of a robbery at the Frying Pan public-house." I said, "If that is all, I am willing to go." He found nothing on me, no fine clothes or jewellery; certainly I had a pair of boots, but those I bought and paid 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for, a shilling at a time—I brought them home on the Thursday previous to the robbery. I had not been in the room from 6 o'clock to half-past 12. I have been eight years and nine months in the Navy, and was discharged from Liverpool in June, 1856. I did duty in the trenches in the Crimes, but was discharged with palpitation of the heart and dizziness of the head. My father and mother live at Dept<lb/>ford. I had just come home in the ship Mary Ann, which was cast away, and only eleven of us came on shore. I was called down to Southampton to receive 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and came up to Chatham, and met two or three of my shipmates who told me my child was dead; it died on the 4th of January.

I am a waiter and live at 6, Red Lion-court, Charter house-lane—on 4th February, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was in Long-acre—I was quite sober—when I got near St. Martin's Hall I felt a sudden pressure on my throat—I was pulled backwards, and fell on my back—I felt a man's hand in my waistcoat pocket, and saw Leary leaning over me—I called, "Police," and sprang to my feet; another man left my side at the same time, but I did not see his face—he was on the same side of me as Leary was, but rather behind me—one went across the street, and con<lb/>tinued on the opposite side, and the one I followed kept in front of me, that was Leary—they both ran towards Drury-lane—I never lost sight of Leary, except for an instant, when he turned the corner and ran into a policeman's arms—he was then five or six yards from me.</p>

I made a spring at him, but missed my hold, and he crossed Drury-lane into Parker-street—I pursued him—Wilson-street and Brownlow-street are on the same side of Drury-lane—the man I saw was on the same side of Drury-lane as the others—he ran into a house on the left hand side of Parker-street, fifty or sixty yards up, and got into the back yard—I was not three yards behind him—he turned round on seeing me enter the yard, and I said, "What did you run away for?"—he said, "I was not going to stop there to be knocked about"—I said, "Hearing a cry of 'Stop thief!' and you being the first man running, I shall take in your in custody"—he said, "I shall not go, there is no one here to charge me; if there was I would go, but there is not, and I will not go quiet"—I said, "You had better do so, for I intend taking you"—he said, "Then we will have an up and down for it"—I collared him and took him to the station—I found Leary in custody coming towards Bow-street—I had not seen him before, but I saw a person ranning in the same direction—when in the dock they denied knowing each other at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of police at Bury St. Edmunds, in Suffolk—on Friday, 14th February, I saw Humphrey's and went with him to Hargrave, about eight miles from Bury St. Edmunds—he identified a pony which I showed him—I took possession it and brought it up to Bury—I went to Norwich on the following day and saw the prisoner in the Cattle-market there—I asked him if he knew the county of Suffolk—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Were you at Horinger fair last year?'—he said, "No"—I said, "Were you there the year before"—he said, "No," at first, but immediately after he said, "Yes, I was"—I asked him if he knew any<lb/>thing about a pony that was sold there; if he was in company with a man named William Collins, or George Bambridge, and there sold a pony which was stolen—he said, "No," to my first question—I said, "Nor with William Moon, or Romford Fred," who were the same persons: Collins and Bam<lb/>bridge go under different names—he said, "No"—I asked him if he had sold the pony—he said he had not—I then took him to the Norwich police-station, and there repeated those questions to him again; he again denied them—I afterwards brought him to Bury and charged him there with stealing the pony—before he was locked up I asked him if he stopped at Bury the night before Horinger fair on that occasion—he said, "Yes"—on Sunday morning, 16th February, I saw him in his cell and told him that I had information that he was in company with two others, and stopped at</p>

               <p>Horkingdon Green with a pony on the night before Horinger fair, the year before—he said, "I know nothing about it"—afterwards I had the horse and cart and took him on to Horkingdon—as soon as he got into the cart, he said, "Where are you going to?"—I said, "I am going to Horkingdon to see whether you tell the truth or not"—he said, "You need not go any further; I was there with William Moon and Long George"—I do not know "Long George," I know William Moon—he said that he and the other two left the Fox beer-house at Edmonton on the Sunday night previous to the Tuesday, with a pony and cart, and drove down to Bury—he denied having anything to do with it, only that he was a servant to Moon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is Moon a man who has been convicted of an offence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is now waiting his trial—he has been convicted—the prisoner did not know the names of William Moon and Romford Fred, when I put them—it was not till the following day that he admitted he was with them—they are the same persons; I have no doubt of it—all my questions put on 14th February, 1862, referred to something that occurred in September, 1860—he answered correctly that he was not at the fair in 1861—I was not dressed as a police<lb/>man at that time, I was when I went to Norwich—I do not think he knew I was a policeman—I was in company with a policeman.</p>

I was on duty on Friday evening, 14th February, in the Blackheath-road, about half-past 7 o'clock—I saw the prisoners there, one on each side of the road—I saw Saunders first, they were each carrying a parcel in a handkerchief, apparently very heavy—I followed them down Blackheath-road for some distance, till they came opposite Mr. Adams', a marine-store dealers shop; he is Saunders' father-in-law—Saunders crossed the road smartly, and Rice went into the shop close behind him—Saunders went to the end of the counter and put down his parcel—Rice also put his parcel down by the side—I was looking in at the window, and I saw all three apparently in conversation; some words passed between them, but I could not hear what—Rice was the last one in the shop and the first one coming out—they were coming out and I met them coming out without the bags—Saunders stepped up to Rice at the door, when I met him, and said, "That is the little engine I was speaking to you about," pointing to a small engine that was standing against the door—just as he said that, I said to Rice, "What do those bags and parcels contain that you bronght into the shop?" neither of them made any reply—I then took hold of Rice and pushed him back into the shop to where the bags were lying—Saunders was behind him—I said to Adams, "Do you know what the bags contain"—he looked at the two prisoners and looked at me, and then said, "No"—I said, "Untie this first bag, let us see what it contains"—Adams untied it, and I saw that it contained brass—I then said, "Untie the other bag, let us see what is in that;" and then he untied the second bag, which also con<lb/>tained brass—both the bags are here—I then asked the prisoners where they worked—Rice said, "I work at Mr. Soames' soap-works, East Greenwich"—Saunders also said, "I work there"—they said they had brought the metal from Mr. Soames—I asked them if Mr. Soames authorised them to dispose of that property—Rice said, "No, but if you go to Mr. Perrier, the foreman, he will tell you all about it"—nothing more was said then—I sent to the police-station for an officer—a police-constable came and took Rice and one bag containing the brass, to the station—I took Saunders and the other bag to the station—I told them I should make some inquiry about it before I let them go—instead of going to Mr. Perrier I went to Mr. Soames—neither of the prisoners said anything more as to why they sold the metal—I did not lock them up at the time—I left them at the station, and went to Mr. Soames, who came and charged them—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the bags—the two weigh about 72lbs.—I cannot say which prisoner carried the bag con<lb/>taining these brass bushes and bearings—they were lying close together—the other is old metal, some of it has been in the fire.</p>

I am foreman to Mr. Soames, and have been in his service between seven and eight years—Rice was his head engineer—he has been in Mr. Soames' service about ten years, and Saunders about nine months—I did not give the prisoners authority to sell any of the property in those bags, or to take it out of the premises—I did not know that any portion of it had been taken from the premises—a portion of it is old metal—the brass things would not be considered old metal, without they were passed as such by Rice; if they were made too large, and would not corns in use, if he passed them for old metal they would go for old metal—I do not know what is the value of all the metal—there was a fire at Mr. Soames' on 17th May last—I sold some old metal about a mouth before that was damaged in the fire—no metal ought to be sold without being brought to me to he weighed and entered in a book—I sold the old metal to Messrs. Jackson and Watkins—they would pay for it at the counting-house—I never saw Adams, the marine store-dealer, till I saw him at the police-court—I gave no authority for any metal to be sold to him—these men left their work on 14th February at half-past 5—I do not know where Saunders lives—Rice lives at Greenwich, a mile and a half, I should think, from Adams.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business in the Blackfriars-road, with my partners—our counting-house faces the Blackfriars-road; the mill is at the back, and there is a side entrance—a cart going to the premises would have to go up Church-street, and in at the side entranoe—Whittington was in our service in February, as delivery foreman—when persons come for goods they first come to the shop, tell us what they want, I show them the</p>

               <p>goods they say what amount they require, and I make out the invoice—if the goods are in stock I make out a ticket, as we deliver all stock from the mill; I then take or send a ticket into the mill, to the foreman, Whitting<lb/>ton, and it is his duty to shoot the goods from our sacks into the buyer's sacks—the linseed is kept at the top of the mill; not on the same floor as the barley meal—on 21st February, Smith came to me and said that he wanted these goods—I made out an invoice, and this delivery order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he wanted a quarter of oats, and found, after I had made out the invoice, that he had not sufficient money to pay for them; and I at once altered the invoice to half a quarter, as it now is—I put that in both the invoice and the order—Smith told me that he came from Mr. Smith, of Clapham, a commercial traveller—he paid me about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the goods put into the cart were worth about three guineas, in addition to what he paid for.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector, M</hi> 252). I am a detective officer—on Friday, 21st February, I was watching the prosecutor's premises, and saw a cart, driven by Smith, draw up to the front—I saw Smith go in, and after<lb/>wards come out, and take the cart round to the side entrance in Church-street—I then noticed that the cart was empty—it remained at the side entrance in Church-street from half an hour to an hour, during which time I passed several times, and saw Smith and Whittington loading it—I was in plain clothes—I saw the cart move out, and counted either eight or nine sacks in it—Smith was driving it at a rapid speed, and I followed in a cab, through the back turnings, and never lost sight of it till it reached the prisoner Edwards' premises, in the New Kent-road—Edwards came out and spoke to Smith for a minute or so—Smith then commenced unloading as fast as he could—I saw Edwards assist him with three sacks on to a shelf at the side of his shop—he dropped two of them on the floor, and when Smith was taking the sixth sack from the cart, I went to him and told him I was a police-constable, and that I should take him in custody for being concerned with his master in stealing a quantity of corn from Messrs. Edwards, in the Blackfriar's road—I asked him how many sacks he brought from there—he said he did not know exactly, seven or nine—I took him into the shop, and saw that one of the sacks, which was put on the shelf, had straw sticking in a hole in it, and there was linseed escaping from it—I sent Smith by a con<lb/>stable of the P division to the station, and I took Edwards to the station, when he said, "I know the order I gave to my carman"—I said, "What was it?"—(I am looking at a memorandum I made at the time)—he said, "a quarter of oats, a quarter of bran, half a quarter of beans, and a sack of meal"—I said that I would write it down, and I did so; this is it—that is all that passed.</p>

On 20th February last, I went to the Windmill public-house, in the New-cut, Lambeth, about half-past 6 in the evening, accom<lb/>panied by other officers—on entering I saw the prisoner Mac Carthy behind the bar, and Murray standing against a post which is in front of the bar—on Mac Carthy turning round and seeing me, he put his left hand in his trousers pocket, took from it this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and attempted to stuff it down the hole where the pipe leads from the bar to the cellar—at that time Murray rushed forward, and took from his right-hand coat pocket a bag, and attempted to stuff it down the same place—I called Inspector Bryant's attention to it—he picked up the bag, and I picked up Mac Carthy's bag—when I saw him putting it down behind, I seized him by the collar and attempted to pull him away—he had an iron wrench in his hand, and he held it up in a menacing attitude—it was an iron wrench for screwing nuts, about 4lb. weight—he said, "You see I am at work for this man, Mr. Brannan," meaning the barman, who stood close by—I said, "Oh yes, Mr. Mac Carthy, I see the work you are at; you were endeavouring to stuff this bag down the hole"—while I was struggling with Mac Carthy, I heard two packets drop on the floor—I looked round and saw Matthews standing close by, with her baby in her arms, with her left arm under its clothes; and from under the baby's clothes fell this packet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which contains ten counterfeit shillings—they were all separately wrapped up, as were all the other packets—in the bag which Mac Carthy had, there were three packets containing ten counterfeit shillings, each separately wrapped in paper—I then said to Murray and Mac Carthy, in the hearing of Matthews, that I had received instructions from the Solicitor of the Mint, to look after them as dealing largely in counterfeit coin—Mac Carthy answered, "I dare say you think yourself very clever for an Irishman; that woman is innocent," meaning Matthews—the prisoners were secured, and taken to the station—I also picked up two more packets containing ten shillings each, close to where Matthews stood, but I could not swear that she dropped them—I heard two fall.</p>

Had I known the half-crown to be bad, do you think I should be so foolish as to go direct up to the boy and ask for the salts and change? it stands to reason, if I had known the half-crown to be bad I should have made off as quick as possible. When the shopman laid hold of me I did not try in any way to get away from him, but I went back direct with him. I was searched at the shop, there was nothing more found on me, nor at the station-house, where I was stripped and searched again. Had I any more on me, or had I tried to pass another at another place, it might look something like guilt; as it is, a man may take a piece of money without knowing it to be bad I took 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the docks, and to my misfortune the half-crown turned out to be a bad one.</p>

I am a hairdresser, at Vauxhall I—was in the Durham Arms on the evening of 18th February, and saw the prisoner given in custody—I followed him and the policeman down Kennington-lane—I saw something drop from the prisoner's pocket—I picked it up, found it to be a bad shilling, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

               <p>Blackfriars-road—I have had occasion to look at the stock, to see whether we have any missing—I did that at the end of October—I found between 300 md 400 reams which I could not account for—I have seen the emery-cloth which is produced—it is worth about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ream—that is the invoice price—that is the way in which our paper is labelled when it leaves our place—the second quality cloth is 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and the selling price of the glass<lb/>paper is 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—those are the wholesale prices—I did not know the prisoner till I saw him at the police-court—we had no account with him—I super<lb/>intend the town department in the business—we have different sized figures for goods sent about town, and to the country—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) will illustrate it; the small figures are the country, and the large ones are the town—we generally begin every month with one, for town, but the country numbers go all through the year—we have numbers in our books for town which run above 505—I have the books here—these are the town and country order books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in October the numbers went higher than 505—I have got August here—I made the entries myself in September—the highest in August was 590, and the other was 364—in the course of our business I never knew a town order rise above 1,000—the date of this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is 7th September; it is for emery-cloth, emery and glass<lb/>paper, and sundry things, from Jameson &amp; Co., of Newcastle-upon-Tyne—I have examined those goods which are the subject of this inquiry; they are our manufacture—the selling price of Scotch glue, from our place, is 63<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt.—I do not remember, in the course of my business, going to Mr. Barnes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not know that occasionally when persons come in for a town order, there being some packages ready stacked for the country, that they have been handed over, the figures altered, of course, and altered from a country order to a town order? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has been done, but not to my know ledge—the goods sold over the counter do not have numbers on—if a man comes in to buy a ream of paper it does not go through our books, and therefore does not have a number—the man who does that ought, properly to erase and alter the mark—if goods are sold over the counter we cannot put a number on.</p>

I was to have one shilling out of the fourteen—there are plenty of makers who will buy them of you at that price—that transaction was about the date of this invoice—I called round again in the course of three or four days—I made another invoice out to Mr. Scrine—I think this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. Scrine is a wholesale oilman at High-street, Hoxton—I went to him on Saturday, 14th September, and sold him goods to the amount of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10 reams of glass paper, and 9 of cloth—after I had made that sale I informed Briggs as before—I recollect the goods being sent to Serine—they were taken from Briggs's shop in a corn-chandler's cart, Mr. Moore's, of London-road—I do not know the driver's name—Mr. Briggs assisted me to put them in the cart—he went with me—when we got about two hundred yards from Serine's, the prisoner got out of the cart, and went into a public-house—there had been nothing said, between him and myself about his getting out of the cart and going to the public-house—I delivered the goods at Mr. Serine's—I was paid by cheque, and I delivered the invoice—I gave the cheque to Mr. Briggs, in the public-house in Hoxton—I found him there—there was only his little boy with him, about ten or twelve years of age—I got my commission; Briggs paid me when I gave him the cheque at the public-house—the next transaction was with Lee, of Hoxton, on September 10th, for 13 reams of glass paper—when I made ths sale I informed Briggs as before—I went to his shop and oommunicated with him—the cart was ordered from Moore's again, and I and Briggs packed the cart—I cannot say whether his little boy was with us then—when we got near Lee's he got out as before, and went into a public-house—I was paid for those in cash—I brought the money to him, and I was paid my commis<lb/>sion—the next transaction was with Mr. Rose—I saw the number on some of the paper that was taken to Rose's—it was 2,030—the next transaction with Rose was on 17th September—I got this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Rose; it is payable to Henry Rushbrook or order; I gave it to Briggs—there was one cheque I cashed myself—I do not know which one it was—I gave all but one to Briggs, and that I cashed myself in consequence of Ross being out—the date of that is September 26th, for 12 reams of glass paper and 8 1/2 of cloth; sold at 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I got the goods as before—Briggs went with me—he did not go to Rose's—he stopped opposite at a public-house—I gave him this cheque, made out as before to me or order—the next trans<lb/>action was with Barnes, of Brick-lane, Spitalfields, and consisted of three reams of emery cloth—I got that from Rose's shop—I had originally taken it to Rose—there were four reams of No. 3 returned, and these were three of them—I noticed the coverings of those three reams; they had 2,030 on the cover—I do not recollect the colour of the label—the prisoner did not go with me to Barnes's—this was for my commission—I sold them for myself—there was another transaction with Mr. Berry, of St. John's-square, Clerken<lb/>well, one cwt. of Scotch glue, and two reams of glass paper and emery cloth; the amount was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and was paid in cash—the next transaction was another with Barnes, of Brick-lane—there is no date to this—it would be after the 2d October; it was for one ream of emery and two of glass—then there was one with Rose again, on 10th October, for two reams of</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, residing at Hatfield-place, Westminster road—in the month of September last, my horse and cart was hired by Rushbrook—I went with him to a shop; I do not know whose it was, in Brick-lane—we then went to New-street, to an oil-shop—I do not know Briggs, I never saw him that I am aware of—I took up two cans, and a tag or two, I will not be certain which, and two or three packets of paper—I saw some emery paper outside here to-day; I cannot say whether that is the sort of paper I took into my cart—it was something similar to that—I do not think it was packed up with the same wrappers—I really do not know whether it was covered with brown paper—I cannot say whether it was like this produced—I took them to an oil-shop in Brick-lane, White<lb/>chapel—Rushbrook went with me—my orders from him were, after I had got it into my cart, to drive to Shoreditch—he went with me, and I drove to Shoreditch—when I got to Shoreditch Railway station I picked up another party—I do not see him here to-day, that I am aware of—he did not go to Brick-lane with me—he got out before I got into Brick-lane—I do not know where he went then—I delivered some of what I had in the cart at Brick-lane—I went to Limehouse with the remainder; to another oil-shop—I believe I delivered the cans and the paper at Brick-lane—I do not know, in fact, what I did deliver—I delivered some part of my load there—it might have been the paper—when I left Limehouse I came home—I did not call at Shoreditch on my way back; I am quite certain of that—I picked the same man up again in Brick-lane, after we had left the things in Brick-lane—I then went from there to Limehouse, and from Limehouse I came straight back home—the man I picked up in Shoreditch went with me to Limehouse—he got out before I got to the oil-shop—I did not see where he went—I picked him up again after I had delivered the load, and brought him back to the end of the Borough-road, Stone's-end—it is near New-street—New-street is the bottom of the Borough-road, and where I delivered him was at the top, just by the Ship public-house.</p>
