               <p>What did he say for himself? - He said he was very sorry, and told me where he had sold the table cloths.</p>
               <p>Did you make him any promise of favour? - No, none in the least; he asked whether I could get the things back again without paying for them; I told him, may be I might; he said he had sold them to a Mrs. Harris, in Old-street-road, he sold two table cloths first for seven shillings, and one for three shillings.</p>
               <p>Did he say when he had taken them? - No, they were there the day before he went away; one of them was laid for supper the night he went away; the other things he said he could not tell any thing at all of.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of the things at Mrs. Harris's? - No, there were some duplicates found upon the prisoner, but they did not relate to any of my things, except a pair of breeches, which I believe were mine, but I am not sure.</p>

               <p>You did not see it? - No, he came down with a basket, but I did not perceive any thing in it at that time; he went away, and did not return till the next evening about six o'clock; he then knocked as before, I let him in; he then said he came to fetch a brush and trowel belonging to the bricklayer which he had left; the room door where Gun's box was, was locked; it was locked on Thursday, but it was on Friday; I went up with him on Friday, and found the door was locked.</p>
               <p>There was a window open in the room? - Yes, and he put a ladder up for the trowel and brush; I came down stairs, and left him there; I had a suspicion that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120005"/>was the person before; I intended to detain him in the house; the prisoner's master detained him, till I could get a constable, a constable came, and took him to the watch-house; when he came down he had a great deal of property about him.</p>
               <p>What property? clothes or what? - Men's clothes.</p>
               <p>Did you know whose they were? - Yes, I can swear to them, because I washed some of them.</p>
               <p>(Repeats the things mentioned in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>You know those things belong to Mr. Gun? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether any thing had been done to the door? - No, the key was in the door withoutside, that he could unlock the door without breaking it.</p>
               <p>Did you go to see if the box was open? - No, I did not, the young man locked the box in the morning, and took the key with him.</p>
               <p>You said it was the first day that the coat was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - Because the young man went up stairs, and missed it, and charged me with it.</p>

               <p>These things were taken out of your box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Adams. Had you been up stairs on the 16th, in the morning after Gunn went out, and before the prisoner came in, and went up stairs? - No, if the door was left locked by Gun, it was locked when the prisoner went up, for nobody had been in the house, nor up stairs, but myself to make the bed in an adjoining room, but I did not go into this room at all.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice whether the door was shut or not? - It was shut, but I cannot say whether it was fast or not.</p>

               <p>I am a Surveyor; on the 20th of June last, I was with Mrs. Dealow; we were met by three men in Stepney Fields; who robbed both her and myself; one of them went up to her, and asked for her money; she made some trifling answer; either, that she had not much, or had none, or something of that kind; then says he, I must have your cloak; he took the cloak off.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing in his hand? - He had something of a hanger, or something of that kind, in one hand, while he took the cloak off with the other hand; he threw the cloak upon the ground, and one of the others took it up, and went away with it, and they all three went off.</p>
               <p>Did he roll the cloak up? - It seemed to be rolled up, and the other clapped it under his arm.</p>
               <p>What was his name? - Romaine.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner, was he one of the three? - I believe the prisoner was the person that took the cloak off; but I will not be thoroughly positive.</p>
               <p>When did you see him afterwards? - At the Justices Office; I don't recollect immediately when, but it was since the last Sessions.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again? - I did; I recollected his countenance, but not his dress.</p>
               <p>What was your opinion about him at that time? - Much the same as it is now; I told the Justice I could not positively swear to him.</p>
               <p>Look at him again, and tell me what you think at this moment? - He is very much like the person, but I do not chuse to swear positively he is the person.</p>
               <p>Was you positive as to Romaine? - Yes, I was rather positive, but not thoroughly as to him.</p>
               <p>You said you met the three men? - They first of all followed us, and then passed by us.</p>
               <p>How long might they be in the act of following and passing by you before you were robbed? - I suppose upwards of ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity then of observing them? - Yes, it was light enough, the moon was full out.</p>

               <p>Do you know who took them? - No.</p>
               <p>When were the prisoners apprehended? The 1st of September in the morning.</p>
               <p>Was you present? - No, at night the patrols inquired if I had lost any poultry.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see them again? - Yes, at Bow-street; the people that stopped them took the rabbits and the turkies, for they were dead, and of very little use.</p>

               <p>On the 1st of September, about half after nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners coming out of a field that leads from Kentish Town to the turnpike in Tottenham Court Road; Holdsworth had a basket, and the other had a handkerchief stung to his shoulder with a stick; I followed them down Tottenham Court Road till they came to the Terrace, where my brother officer Hatch lives; I called to him, and told him I suspected these men; I immediately laid hold of Holdsworth, he dropped the basket, and we had a struggle; the other ran away, and Hatch pursued and took him; in Holdsworth's basket, four yellow turkies, a very large yellow rabbit, and a small one yellow likewise: I took them to Bow-street, and on Monday I heard the things were claimed by the prosecutor in the presence of the prisoners; they said they found them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoners counsel. Which of them was it that said he had found them? - They both said so.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to say that Holdsworth said so, or that the other had asked him to carry them? - I am sure he said so.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning was it? - About half after nine, or between nine and ten.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner Herbert, and found upon him a large drake and a rabbit, tied up in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Court to Froggett. Those things that were stopped, were shewn to you at Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you tell with certainty whether any of them belonged to you or not? - They were not marked, but I believe they were mine; they were the same size, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120010"/>the same number as I lost; the drake was a remarkable large one, greyish, and some green upon his head; I bred him in the spring.</p>
               <p>Can you say with any degree of certainty, whether it was your drake or not? - I cannot, but I believe it was mine.</p>
               <p>Do you think if it had been among a flock and you had look'd for it, you should have known it? - Yes, I think I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What time in the morning were those missed? - About six or seven o'clock I believe, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Then they must have been stole between nine o'clock in the evening and that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>JOS. HERBERT's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On Saturday morning I got up about six o'clock, I went to Holdsworth's lodgings, and stopped there; I asked if he would go out and see for a day's work at hay-making; we went round the fields and could not get any work, and in the field near Tottenham Court Road, these things lay; we took them up, and did not know what to do with them; the other prisoner said he would take them home and have them advertised, and if nobody owned them, we would make use of them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Holdsworth left his defence to his Counsel.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Maynard-street, St. Giles's, Bloomsbury; I keep a horse and cart, and sell greens about the the town.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a house? - No, I have two rooms in the house of Mr. M'Cabe, a rabbit merchant, in Leadenhall Market.</p>
               <p>Do you know Holdsworth? - Yes, he lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the day he was taken up? - Yes, the night before he went to bed in my back parlour, about a quarter after ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>How long had he been in your company before he went to bed? - All the afternoon long.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning did he go, out? - As near as I can say upon my oath, about ten minutes or a quarter past seven.</p>
               <p>It was not before seven? - No, it was not; my milkman always comes at seven, and I called him up to take the milk in, and I am sure he was then at home.</p>
               <p>How soon did you hear he was in custody? - The same day.</p>
               <p>Then are you sure he was at home at seven in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And slept at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What part of the house do you sleep in? - I sleep in the fore parlour, and the partition is taken down between the room where he slept, and the room where I slept, so that it is like the same room.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have not you been in custody yourself within these three months? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor within these six months? - No, nor within these two years. I'll tell you the truth; once I was a poor man; I went a begging, and was then taken up as a vagrant, but was never taken up upon any charge for any crime.</p>
               <p>Court. What is Holdsworth? - A shoemaker; his master is here that he was apprentice to.</p>
               <p>He does not go out a hay-making does he? - No, not that I know of; I don't know; he might; he had work'd some time back at Chelsea, and then he work'd at Knightsbridge, but he was out of work at this time, and had been seven or eight days.</p>
               <p>He was at home all that afternoon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How happened that? - He went along with me to buy a jack-ass, and I could not get one; and I bought a poor old horse, and brought him home about six o'clock in the evening, and he never went out after that, but staid with me at Mr. Price's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120011"/>the public house, and had some beer, and passed away the time playing at all-fours till after seven.</p>
               <p>Who else was in company? - Several; Mr. Price himself was there, and saw us there.</p>
               <p>Was any-body but you and Holdsworth in company together? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you sup at Price's or your own house? - At my own house.</p>
               <p>Was any-body there at all? - Yes, my wife.</p>
               <p>No-body else? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she sup with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What had you for supper? - A piece of cold breast of mutton and potatoes.</p>
               <p>Any beer? - Yes, a pot; we sent for it to Price's; my wife fetched it.</p>
               <p>What time of night? - About half past seven or rather better; it was not eight o'clock; my wife called me when supper was ready.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to bed? - About ten, or about five or ten minutes past ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did Holdsworth go to bed before you or after? - About five minutes after I had been in bed; says he I'll go to bed I think; ay, says I, do; I wonder what you staid up so late for; my wife sat up an hour after.</p>
               <p>Who was first up in the morning? - Holdsworth; my wife got up about eight o'clock; Holdsworth took in the milk, and I sent him to Price's for some spirits a little after seven, and he brought it.</p>
               <p>Your wife was not up then? - No.</p>

            , Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>I appear to prosecute these people, merely for the good of the public. On the 3d of August, I went in consequence of an information I had received, with a search-warrant, to search Upton's house, No. 49, Windmill-street; there I found an apron hanging on the line, and some table-linen on the table, which were made out of my shirts; with the assistance of the officers, we found two duplicates in a box in that room; we took the woman we found in the room to Bow-street; in going there, Macmanus, one of the constables, met her husband in Leicester Square, and took him.</p>
               <p>Have you at any time lost the goods in the indictment? - Yes, I missed them, but did not know how till after the information; I then missed forty-nine callico shirts; I know the exact number, because I had an account of all my linen in a book.</p>
               <p>Did you miss any thing else? - Yes, some stockings.</p>
               <p>Have you seen these since? - Yes, I have seen them all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. This boy, (Cooper) was your <rs id="t17870912-6-deflabel35" type="occupation">servant</rs>

                        targets="t17870912-6-defend96 t17870912-6-deflabel35"/>? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had he been so? - About four years.</p>
               <p>What age is he? - About fourteen.</p>
               <p>You brought him from India with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He has been with you ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What character (independent of this transaction) does the boy deserve? - A better boy nor an honester creature never was born; I did not know that he was doing wrong; my confidence in him was unlimited; he had every thing of mine under his care, and even now I can take it into my service again; there is one circumstance, which as a proof of his honesty I shall just mention: I sent him in the course of the winter to buy some stockings for himself, he brought them to me, and asked me if I liked them; I told him they were what I meant he should have; he laid down the money as I was busy writing, and when I came to tell it, I found he had given me too much; I told him he had cheated the people; he said no, he had got them two-pence a pair cheaper than I could have got them.</p>

               <p>You did not find any thing that had been your's in the state in which you lost it? - No, some of it was making into table-linen; there was a callico shirt.</p>
               <p>This was a stock of linen you had during your stay in India? - Yes, some of them had been worn but an hour, in order to avoid the duty of the Custom-house, in consequence of having such a vast quantity; I had upwards of five hundred shirts: Upton's wife appeared to be (though poor and big with child) exceedingly industrious; and I never felt more in my life than at that time, to see her in that situation with her work before her: when the boy first came to me, he did not understand our language, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120013"/>when the articles of war were read on board the ship, and that article concerning theft, I do not believe he understood it, but he had often seen me punish the people under my command, who had been guilty of crimes, and had prevaricated, and not told the truth; for if I caught them in a lie, I never let them go unpunished, and he always told me the truth.</p>
               <p>Of what did your family consist? - Myself, my wife, the prisoner, and two maid-servants.</p>
               <p>Your linen was always washed out? - Yes, they were given out and received back by the maid-servants; they were all clean, and were so when they were found upon the prisoners; except one, which was worn by Redman.</p>
               <p>Did you keep the drawers always locked? - No, I had been very inattentive in that respect.</p>
               <p>Had any body else access? - They might for aught I know, when they laid open.</p>
               <p>Any other person in the house might have robbed you? - Yes, I did suspect it had been a servant maid that took the things away; and that was the reason I first kept the drawers locked up; I had observed the linen lay closer in the drawer than usual, and I used to d - n the washer-women for pressing my linen so close; sometime before this the boy went o an errand with twenty guineas, sometime before, which he had been trusted with, and which he faithfully delivered, and he has frequently been trusted with money in his pocket.</p>

               <p>I went with Captain Williamson to this room of Upton's; I found some duplicates and a shirt that had been cut up; the captain said he did not doubt but that was his, though it was cut up; I then took up Upton's wife, and sent Shallard with the duplicates to the pawn-broker's; on the road to Bow-Street we met Upton; I asked his wife if that was her husband; she said yes; she told him what she was going to Bow-Street about; and I told him he must go too; he began to cry and seemed very much frightened; then we went to Bow-Street; it was on the 3d of August, the same day the little boy gave information.</p>
               <p>Court to Captain Williamson. How was that information procured? - I called upon Justice Addington in the morning, and told him of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Was it not in consequence of threats? - No; I took the boy to the Justice without saying any-thing about it, and sent him in to ask if the Justice was there; (I had previously seen the Justice, and told him of it) the boy came out and said no; I then desired him to stay there till he came, and make my compliments to him; he did, and the Justice told him, Jack, I am sorry to find you are turning out a bad boy, and told him he had robbed his master; and he immediately confessed, and related all the circumstances.</p>
               <p>Court to Macmanus. Look at that examination?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120014"/>- It is the examination of Cooper, one of the prisoners at the bar, taken before Justice Addington.</p>
               <p>Was you present when it was taken? - No, but afterwards I was called in, and it was read over before the boy; and he was desired, if there was any part of it that was not truth, to contradict it; and he said it was all true.</p>
               <p>In what language? - In English; he said it was all true, and I saw him sign it and the Justice too.</p>
               <p>Court to Captain Williamson. Who took the examination? - The clerk.</p>
               <p>Was Justice Addington present; - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the boy give his relation? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And from his relation the confession was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The confession read.)</p>
               <p>Macmanus. When I brought Upton, I went to the boy, and he described Kernon as a person who gave bills out; I went towards the place where he said Kernon used to stand; I saw him and asked him if his name was Kernon; he said yes; I told him he must go with me to Bow-street; he asked me what for, and I told him; he began to cry.</p>
               <p>Is Kernon a Jew? - No, I believe not, the boy took him for a Jew.</p>
               <p>Is he lame? - Yes; I took him to Bow-street and searched his pockets, and found the key of his lodgings; I went there and found six shirts.</p>
               <p>(They were produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Smith. You said you saw the boy come to Upton's, how was he dressed? - As he is now, in a brown coat and red collar.</p>
               <p>Court to Captain Williamson. Is that your livery? - Yes, it is his livery undress.</p>
               <p>What do you know those shirts by? - They are all marked with

               <p>Macmanus. The next day the 4th of August, the boy was again at Bow-Street. he described Redman; he said he used to sell fruit about the street in such a place; I did not think he had told me well enough for me to find him; so I brought the boy with me, and Shallard and I and the boy went to Piccadilly, and found him; he said he lodged in Greek-Street, Soho; I went to his lodgings and found some duplicates, and one shirt that had been wore.</p>

               <p>What quantity? - About thirty-six yards in the whole; there was a mazarine blue and a pink: immediately after I had got the ribbons from him, he said he had never seen them nor touched them, nor they never had been taken out of his pocket; I sent for a constable, and he took charge of him.</p>

               <p>And he stood his ground? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you charged him with having the ribbon, the answer he made was, I know I have; but upon your oath, did not he add to that these words, I have no more than what I mean to pay for? - He said so when he got before the aldermen at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect whether he said so at the time? - No, he did not.</p>

               <p>On the 5th of this month, the prisoner came into Mr. Living's shop, and asked for some narrow ribbon; I shewed him a roll of three penny and fourpenny ribbon; from that drawer he took a piece of blue sattin, and put it in his left hand pocket; he said there were none narrow enough, and wanted to see some three halfpence a-yard; I shewed him some, and he desired me to cut him off two yards of blue, which I did; he gave me a shilling to pay for it; before he had his change, he wished to look at some wider; I then took up a drawer that had china ribbon, from that he took a piece of pink; I did not see him take that, but I knew it was our's when he took it out of his pocket; they were not wide enough; I took out another drawer that was sixpence halfpenny a yard; he desired me to cut him off two yards of that; while I was measuring it, I saw him take a half piece of mazatine blue ribbon, which had never been cut; I was going to send up to Mr. Living, when he came down by accident with some gloves; I told him that man had got some ribbon; he asked me if I was sure, I said I was.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner attempt to go off when you told Mr. Living? - As Mr. Living laid hold of him, and charged him with it; he said he knew he had; he seemed to be in some confusion; he said he knew he had, but did not want it; he took the other two pieces of ribbon out of his pocket, and wanted to put them under some papers that laid on the counter; I saw what he was going to do, and took them up in my hand; I lapped them up, and kept them in my possession till they were delivered to the constable next morning.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing about meaning to to pay for them? - He said he intended to have some of them; after that, he denied having had them in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Though he might hear what you said he kept his ground? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He laid the ribbon down on the counter before your face? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To be sure you must have misunderstood something that he said, because it is hardly to be supposed that he said he did not take them; at one time he did say he intended to pay for them? - He said he intended to have some of them.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know if the prisoner is a married man? - No, I did not before he came into the shop, but he then told me he wanted them for his wife.</p>

               <p>Did you enquire at the shop? - Yes, and the people said they did not know who the horse belonged to, nor did they know any thing of the prisoner; I then made him go back again the same way he came, and in going along, I heard a man say, there goes Jackson's old horse; I turned back again, and asked the man where Jackson lived, and he told me; I then went to Jackson's house, he was not at home; I saw his wife, and she said her husband was looking out for his horse all the day long; I then left orders for Mr. Jackson to attend at Bow-street next morning, which he did. I am servant to Mr. Fenwick, the keeper of Tothill-fields Bridewell; I found the boy with the horse, about a quarter after three.</p>
               <p>Court to the prisoner. Have you any questions to ask this witness? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you hear what the witness says against you? - No.</p>
               <p>He says he saw you riding this horse in St. Margaret's church-yard, and that you told him that it belonged to a person of the name of Williams, on the other side of Westminster-bridge; will you ask the witness any question upon what he says? - No.</p>
               <p>Now what have you to say in your defence? - Nothing, Sir. (Crying.)</p>
               <p>Foreman of the Jury. Could any body ask what he meant to do with the horse.</p>
               <p>Court. The misfortune is, that question cannot be asked, because it tends to criminate him.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Bathall. I will take care of the boy.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury; to convict this boy, he must have taken this horse with an intent to convert it to his own use; it is one thing, to take property for the purpose of selling it, and converting it to the use of the person who takes it; and another thing to take a horse in a boyish way for the purpose of riding.</p>

               <p>What time of the day was it? - Between the hours of one and two.</p>
               <p>What else did you see? - I did not see any thing more; my wife will give you an account of what passed afterwards; I did not suspect him, because I thought he was going to the person who lodges up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>MARGARET DAVIS sworn.</p>
               <p>It was past one when I heard a great noise.</p>
               <p>Do you know what day of the week it was? - Thursday, the 9th of August, I went up one pair of stairs, I found the door fast; I went up to the two pair of stairs, and I found that door fast; I was going up the other pair of stairs, and I met the prisoner coming down with a pair of sheets in his hand; as soon as he saw me, he dropped the sheets behind him, and wanted to sit down, I would not let him; he appeared to me to be very ill, or drunk, or something.</p>
               <p>Who lived up three pair of stairs? - Nobody; my husband and I slept in that room.</p>
               <p>Produce the sheets.</p>
               <p>(The sheets produced.)</p>
               <p>Are those the sheets you took up, and that you saw the prisoner drop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are they your sheets? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where had they been? - This sheet lay on the bed the night before, and this sheet lay at the bed's foot.</p>
               <p>When had you seen them last? - I left the room about ten in the morning when I came down with some soul clothes.</p>
               <p>Were they there then? - Yes, my Lord, and I locked the door.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120023"/>Did you go up stairs after you had found the sheets on the stairs? - Yes, immediately after, and I found the room door burst open, and all the things strewed about the room.</p>
               <p>Are there any particular marks on those sheets? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how do you know them, any further than by meeting the prisoner upon the stairs, and finding the sheets there? - When I went up stairs, I missed them from the bed, and he left the under sheet lying upon the bed, he did not take that off.</p>
               <p>Then you found the under sheet on, but the upper one was gone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How could any body get in? - I locked the door and laid the key on the chimney-piece in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Was the door open when you went up? - The hinge of the door was broke off, and the lock was still on.</p>
               <p>Did you see the sheets in the prisoner's hands? - I saw them dropping behind him at the time; I knew he had broke the door open when I saw the sheets.</p>
               <p>Was the noise you heard, like the noise of breaking open a door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any marks on those sheets? - No marks, but when I saw them I knew them.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to swear with certainty that they are your sheets? - My husband has some cloth of the same.</p>
               <p>Jury. There can be no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not in my senses.</p>
               <p>He says he was not in his senses; you say he appeared as if he had been drinking or something like that? - He did, and he seemed to sit, but I would not let him.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to him? - I told him directly I saw him, that he broke the door open, and he said he wanted to go to sleep.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you ever seen him before? - Never in my life.</p>

               <p>As I was going out between one and two; I saw a man standing at a distance from the door; when I came home I heard a noise up stairs, and presently I saw my landlady and the prisoner coming down stairs, and she had hold of him by the lap of his coat, she asked me if I knew him; I told her I had never seen him before that I know'd of; I asked him what business he had up stairs, and he said he come to put up the heel of his shoe; I told him it was very odd for him to come there to put up the heel of his shoe, and he must have come there on some other business; and then he said he came to seek his sister.</p>
               <p>Had he any sister there lived thereabouts? - No.</p>
               <p>What else passed? - I asked him his his sister's name; when I asked him that he could not give any answer, and he said he wanted to sleep, then there was no more passed, then Mr. Davis detected him.</p>
               <p>Did he appear drunk, or mad, or insane? - He rather appeared in liquor.</p>

               <p>I was very much in liquor and don't know what I did; I happened to be at the prosecutor's house, and had got a little beer more than ordinary; and as I was coming along, I saw a man come out of this house and drop a bundle, and I went and picked it up, and tumbled down in the entry: I work for Mr. Felton of Highgate; I have got a wife and five small children; I never did such a thing in all my life; I always work'd hard for my bread, and never did such a thing since I was born.</p>

(The will put in.) A probate was granted upon that will; here is the probate book; here is a book which contains the minutes of the court; I am the person that takes charge of this book; I enter the minutes in it; I enter the causes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What do you call that book? - This is called the assignation book in which all causes are set down that come before the Judge, and the register.</p>
               <p>Is there any other record than that entered in that book? - No.</p>
               <p>That is the record of the office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then is that book the proper record of such proceedings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any other document whatever that appears to be the record of that court but that book? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. It is the only record of the proceedings in the court in those causes? - Yes. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd, Prisoner's Counsel. You do not write the minutes? - No.</p>
               <p>Are the minutes when entered signed by any body? - No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Then in fact the minutes made in that book, are made by somebody at the time the Judge is present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Whether they are taken faithfully or, not, you cannot tell? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that the book in which they are always entered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There is no other? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you keeper of the book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it a genuine book, and does it remain in your hands unaltered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then credit is due to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, another of the Prisoner's Counsel. Is not there a rough book from which that is transcribed? - Not transcribed, there is a rough book which I keep myself.</p>
               <p>The register sits in court, and takes the direction of the Judge? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you enter that direction into any other rough book or that? - No, I enter it in this book, and no other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Turn to the record of the probate having been granted, and the revocation, and point it out to the officer that he may read it.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can he either read or write? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - About twenty-eight years.</p>
               <p>Sir SAMPSON WRIGHT sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I believe you have happened to see the prisoner at the bar before this time? - I have.</p>
               <p>Do you remember when you did see him, whether Hickford was present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was this? - I can't speak exactly.</p>
               <p>On what occasion was it? - He was brought before me as a magistrate, and Hickford was there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Were there minutes taken in writing? - I dare say they are in court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If not, I must object to your giving any parol testimony of what passed before you.</p>
               <p>(The minutes produced.)</p>
               <p>Were those minutes made by you or by the clerk? - By the clerk.</p>
               <p>And signed by you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then I object to their being read, unless the rough copy made by the clerk is produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did he sign the examination? - He refused to sign it.</p>
               <p>Court. In what way was the examination taken? - It was an examination not only of the prisoner, but the witnesses; and I asked the prisoner if what he said was true; he said yes, it was true, but that he would not sign any thing.</p>
               <p>(The Court ordered the rough minutes to be sent for, which was done.)</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Look at that will, Mr. Gale, what are you? - I am an engraver; I live in Crooked-Lane.</p>

               <p>Look at that will, to see whether that paper is not made from that plate? - I should rather suppose it was.</p>
               <p>What makes you rather suppose it was? - From the impression that the plate makes; here are some marks in the plate which correspond with the will.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say for a certainty that that will was made from that plate? - It<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120032"/>appears so, but it is possible to engrave a plate exactly like it, to make the same impression; provided they have the original to do it by.</p>
               <p>You could no doubt copy that plate exactly on another plate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing particular in that plate which corresponds with the will; are there any flaws in it? - Here is a mark or dent near the word executor, which seems to have happened from the stroke of some hard tool.</p>
               <p>Are there any flaws in that plate which appear on the will? - There is one which I have told you near the word executor.</p>
               <p>When was that plate engraved? - I can't tell.</p>
               <p>When did you repair it? - I can't take upon me to say, but I repaired a plate for Messrs. Mount and Page, on the 2d of April 1783.</p>
               <p>Now look at that plate, and see if you repaired that plate? - That is impossible for me to say; it was not my graving in the beginning, and therefore I can't swear to another person's work: I repaired a plate, but I can't take upon me to say that that was the identical plate; I remember one circumstance which refreshes my memory, there was to be some alteration in the motto, but I can't take upon me to say what the alteration was.</p>
               <p>Do not you know what the alteration was? - It is a Latin motto, and perhaps it might be in the word officii, but I cannot take upon me to say what the alteration was.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect in that plate, whether you made any addition to that part or not? - I know there was some alteration, but I can't tell what the alteration was.</p>
               <p>Are you, as an engraver, able to say, whether from the examination of the plate, and the examination of the will, that the one is a copy of the other? - I take it to be so; I should rather believe so; it appears to be so.</p>
               <p>Does that appear to be an impression from a new plate, or a repaired plate? - This appears to be an impression from a plate that has been repaired.</p>
               <p>And the plate that you repaired was in 1783? - Yes, on the 2d of April 1783.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. The forms of all appear to be the same? - I believe they are nearly.</p>
               <p>Most capital stationers have a plate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the form of each of them is the same? - I should rather suppose so, but I cannot immediately say so.</p>
               <p>Court. What flaw is that you speak of? - If you observe, my Lord, it is between the word executor and the word of; there appears to be a small scratch; I doubt very much whether it would print now; I rather think it is too shallow; on looking at it again, I take notice that my mind is refreshed by some alteration; the word officii is made officie.</p>
               <p>On comparing this plate and the impression together, I should conceive that there can't be much doubt, whether that is an impression from that plate or not? - I firmly believe it is.</p>
               <p>Is there any doubt about it? - None, but that it is possible to make one so near as to be exactly alike, and to do that, it would be necessary for me to have the plate before me.</p>
               <p>If you were to copy the plate as an engraver, would you copy the flaws? - Most certainly not, without they were directed to be done so.</p>
               <p>From what inspection of that plate can you collect, that that is a repaired plate? - The work is not so clear; there are several things in it, which I, as a professional man, could point out clearly; but, which it would be difficult for me to make your Lordship understand.</p>

               <p>When a plate is once repaired, they work them down as long as they can before they are repaired again? - Yes, you can plainly see that that plate is much worked down.</p>
               <p>May not a person work an original plate as much down before they repair it? - To be sure.</p>
               <p>But still I do not collect from you, whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120033"/>those particularities in the plate arise from its having been much used, or from its being repaired? - It may be seen from the hollows that it lies in, that it is a repaired plate.</p>
               <p>I should be glad if you would point out to me and the jury, how you know that is a repaired plate, so as to make us understand it? - From seeing the plate, it is very plain that the letters lie in those hollows, which could not have happened, unless it had been worked down and repaired; it is done by the wipe of the hand in printing; if you look at the letter S. in the last word before the blanks, that never could be graved so in the beginning.</p>
               <p>Why do you conceive that never was so graved originally? - Because no professional man would turn it out of his hands in that manner, and it is impossible that the plate could have been in the manner it now is, unless it had been repaired.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole then, you believe with certainty that that plate has been repaired? - I firmly believe it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Whether this is the plate you repaired, you cannot tell? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Any other plate in the same state would give the same impression? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A great many stationers have plates? - Almost every capital stationer has a plate of the same kind.</p>

               <p>I live with Mount and Page, stationers, on Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>Do you know that plate? - I brought it here to-day.</p>
               <p>Whose is it? - It belongs to Mount and Page.</p>
               <p>Do you know when it was repaired? - I know we had one repaired in 1783.</p>
               <p>Had you any other? - No, I believe it is the same plate.</p>
               <p>Court. What reason have you for believing it is the same plate? - Because we have no other plate than this, and it is always left at the printer's.</p>
               <p>So whether he has returned you the same plate or not, you can't tell? - That I can't tell; I suppose he has; I give him the paper out to print upon.</p>
               <p>I suppose all capital stationers have plates of the same kind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now suppose ten or a dozen different stationers sent paper, and sent their plates at the same time; is it at all unlikely that the printer may return not the identical plate, but another plate exactly alike? - I have never had any reason to think so; the plate is not returned at all; this plate has been in the possession of the printer ever since it was repaired.</p>
               <p>Who is your printer? - Mr. March.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - On Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it is no evidence; when did you have it from him? - Two or three days ago, and last this morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You took the plate from Mr. Page's to Mr. Gale's to be repaired? - I suppose I might.</p>
               <p>What was the alteration to be made in it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Did you give the directions yourself? - No, I gave no directions.</p>
               <p>Court. Mount and Page had the plate repaired in 1783? - I know it from the book; I know it from nothing else.</p>
               <p>Where is that book? - The book is here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Is the entry your own? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whose writing it is? - I am not quite certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then it goes for nothing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Look at that plate, does that appear to be your plate? - I have no reason to doubt, I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Have you any other reason to think it is your plate, than because it was sent to the printer's, and not returned? - No other reason.</p>
               <p>Court. It has been above three years at the printer's? - Yes, since April 1783.</p>
               <p>You have not seen it during that time? - I don't believe I have.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120034"/>Then what reason have you to suppose that is the same plate that went to the printer's at that time? - I firmly believe it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Are they alike, these wills; does every stationer have them exactly alike? - No, I have seen different ornaments; some with a ship at the top, some one way and some another.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Suppose you were to see several bundles of wills at the Lord Mayor's Office, would you be able to pick out Mount and Page's? - No.</p>

            ? - I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Sir Sampson Wright: When this man was brought before you, he was charged by Mr. Knight, the solicitor to the Admiralty, with having forged this will? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Knight attend? - He did.</p>
               <p>He was charged with an offence supposed to have been committed in the city of London, as appears by the proceedings to day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was not charged with any offence stated to have been committed in the City of Westminster, or the county of Middlesex? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he had been charged before the chief magistrate of the city of London and discharged? - I really cannot recollect that particular.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know it of your own knowledge? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know how he happened to be brought before you? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knight examined by Mr. Shepherd. When did Ramsbottom first apply to you? - Some time in the course of last summer, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120035"/>He applied to you, I believe, to know the reason of the stop having been put upon him? - Yes, he came to me about it.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, you informed him there was a stop? - He understood that.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him on what account the wages were stopped? - I do not recollect I told him whether the will was suspected to be forged, but I gave reason to understand that there were suspicions which prevented the payment of the money, but I did not give him to understand that in words.</p>
               <p>He applied to you several times after this? - He might be with me several times afterwards, but I cannot speak to the number, three or four I believe.</p>
               <p>Did not Ramsbottom understand from what you said, that there were suspicions that the will was forged? - No, I cannot say that he understood that any body suspected a forgery.</p>
               <p>Did not he offer to give you all the satisfaction he could? - He alledged it was a genuine will.</p>
               <p>Though he must have understood there were some suspicious about the forgery? - I suppose so, I cannot say what passed in his mind at the time.</p>
               <p>He came to you several times afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe Mr. Knight, he was a little turbulent the last time? - I cannot say he was; he was rather noisy.</p>
               <p>How long was it between the first application and the last? - I am not capable of answering that.</p>

               <p>Was the last application before or after he had brought the action against the treasurer of the navy? - He brought his action in Trinity term.</p>
               <p>How far did the action proceed before you ever thought of making a charge against this man? - I believe it was in Michaelmas term following, that the charge was first made.</p>
               <p>Had not time for pleading expired, and time been granted you by his attorney to plead before this charge was made? - No, to the best of my recollection, the charge was made before the rule to plead was out.</p>
               <p>Had not Mr. Smith, the attorney for this man, given you time to plead twice before this man was charged? - No.</p>
               <p>Had not he once? - I do not think he had; I think it was early in November, about the 8th or 9th, and that the rule was not out.</p>
               <p>Previous to your applying to the Magistrate, you had applied to the Court of King's Bench, and obtained a rule to stay the proceedings in the action? - No, the obtaining the warrant against him, was in the beginning of November.</p>
               <p>Was that rule obtained, before the rule to plead expired? - I think it was not.</p>
               <p>Then with the warrant in your pocket, you went to the plaintiff's attorney, and begged time to plead, and obtained a consent for time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You met Mr. Smith? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Did he consent, or was there an order for time? - There was a consent perhaps, but I do not recollect whether the time was obtained before a Judge or not.</p>
               <p>Did not you receive a letter from Mr. Smith, giving you a second four days time to plead without going before the Judge? - I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to Mr. Smith about charging this man at the time? - I do not know that I did, nor do I know that I should; I told my opinion of the man.</p>
               <p>You applied to the Court of King's Bench to stay the proceedings? - I did.</p>
               <p>And the man was taken up under a warrant at the time? - About the time.</p>
               <p>He was examined before the Lord Mayor just before the day of the rule to shew cause, and discharged by the Lord Mayor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the rule to shew cause in the King's Bench was discharged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now I ask you whether at the time you said he was turbulent, you had not a quarrel with him? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120036"/>You did not threaten to turn him out of your house? - I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Did not you say this to him, that if he had not been an impudent man to you, the stop should have been taken off; but that you would care he should not have his wages? - Never.</p>
               <p>Do you deny that upon your oath? - I do, I might tell him he was an impudent fellow.</p>
               <p>Why did you call him so? - I thought him so, because he came several times, and was impertinent; he came in a very submissive manner once or twice.</p>
               <p>Did not he come, and offer to give you every satisfaction? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him as he had behaved so impudent, he never should have the stop taken off? - No.</p>
               <p>Had not you had a quarrel with him, and threatened to kick him out of the house, before you made the charge against him? - No; do you suppose I had any malice against this man? I was not privy to his being apprehended.</p>
               <p>Now I ask you, whether before any warrant was taken out against him, you had not threatened to turn him out of your house? - I might call him an impudent fellow.</p>
               <p>Was not that before any proceedings were taken against him? - I believe it was, but I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it not in consequence of that quarrel that these proceedings were had? - No, it was in consequence of his urging the suit in the manner that he did.</p>
               <p>Then if he had brought no action against the treasurer of the navy, there would have been no prosecution against him? - I do not know; I have a hundred things to mind, and if I stop payment of the money; I think I have done a good act.</p>
               <p>How long after his first application was it that you took any steps against him? - Four or five months.</p>
               <p>How many times might you have seen him during that interval? - About three times I think, but I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>How long before the 8th of November was the last application, when he behaved so ill? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How many days before you went before the Lord Mayor? - I cannot say whether it was one, two, or three months.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was more than two days after the quarrel, that you went to the Lord Mayor, and got the warrant against him? - My opinion is, that it was much longer than days or weeks.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was a week? - I think it was more.</p>
               <p>How came you not to think of taking out a warrant against him before? - The man had been so impudent, that it was thought advisable to take some step against him.</p>
               <p>You had this warrant out the 8th? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you execute it? - The 23d I believe.</p>
               <p>How came it not to be executed till the very day, or the day before, the rule to shew cause? account to the Jury for that. - I do not know that I had found out where he lived.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that was the reason, and that you had given it to be executed before that day? - I think I gave it to be executed on the 21st, and that it was on account of my not knowing where he lived, that it was not executed.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that was the reason? - No, I do not, I cannot give any reason; I did not take these steps without consulting my principal Mr. Dyson.</p>
               <p>I want some reason why for the space of five months this step was not taken, and why it was taken on the very day, on which the rule to shew cause was appointed to be heard? - On the declaration being filed, and the appearance entered, the papers were laid before counsel to advise what was proper to be done.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - I believe so, and they advised the motion, to stay proceedings till he had surrended.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120037"/>That motion was made at the beginning of the term, do you recollect that? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Was it made before, or after the warrant was taken out? - After; the motion was advised to stay the proceedings on the ground of the warrant being out first.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner was taken before the Lord Mayor, he was discharged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was it before he was taken up again? - About seven months; we had not evidence sufficient to found a commitment the first time.</p>
               <p>Did not he come to you after he was discharged by the Lord Mayor, and offer to give you all the satisfaction in his power? - He never did give me any satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Did he not point out to you where you could find out information? - He did.</p>
               <p>After he had been taken up and discharged, did he not come to you, and suggest some clew, whereby you might find Hickford out, and where he was born? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not he come to tell you this after you had advertized for him, with a view to this prosecution? - No, I think it was before.</p>
               <p>When did you advertize? - Upon my word I cannot tell; it was before the action.</p>
               <p>Did you not advertize after the discharge before the Lord Mayor? - Both before and after.</p>
               <p>Did not he after that come to you? - He came to offer to give satisfaction, and to say that it was a real will, and that he could prove it.</p>
               <p>How long after, and how many times? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did you never know where he lived? - No.</p>
               <p>After this discharge, you knew where he lived? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After the discharge he came to you, and there was an interval of seven months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came he not to be taken before the Magistrate in the city? - I do not know, he was taken before the Magistrate in Bow-street, and sent into London to be examined, because the offence was committed in London.</p>
               <p>How came that not to be done the second time? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his presenting a petition to the Board of Admiralty, for leave to produce evidence to substantiate his claim? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now I believe he was not taken the second time till after that? - No, it was in consequence of that petition that the Board gave orders, that whenever he applied for an answer to that petition, he should be taken up; we had endeavoured to take him up before; we were prepared with evidence long before he was taken up the second time, but could not find his place of abode.</p>
               <p>Did he attend for an answer to that petition? - I do not know that he did, I was out of the way at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Satisfy these gentlemen in the first place, in what capacity did you act? - I am agent to the solicitor of the Admiralty.</p>
               <p>You were pursuing the public duty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was it that you first knew any thing of the will of 
               <persName id="t17870912-16-person259">

            ? - I saw the will of Mitchell and three or four more, that were proved by this man in the Commons; certain suspicions arose in my mind, and in consequence of that, I wrote letters to the different pay-offices, to desire the officers to stop payment of their wages.</p>
               <p>When did he first apply to you, not till after the publication of course? - No.</p>
               <p>This man in consequence of some applications to you, had put this matter in a cause of civil proceeding, by bringing an action against the treasurer of the navy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you, as the solicitor to that Board, were employed to defend that action? - I was employed by Mr. Dyson.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120038"/>If it had not been for the action being brought, you would never have thought of prosecuting him? - Not I indeed.</p>
               <p>But in consequence of that being set on foot, you searched about for further evidence? - I advertised immediately.</p>
               <p>Subsequent to the information before the Magistrate, had you got further evidence? - I had; when I found he still prosecuted his suit, I advertised again, and the deceased's attestation was sent to me from Portsmouth, upon that he was taken up again.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath have you prosecuted him from any private malignity? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. You had received some account from Portsmouth, that this man came from Little Brickhill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He had told you that before? - Yes, but I had forgot it.</p>
               <p>Court. You have since found he was from Little Brickhill? - Yes.</p>

               <p>By what means did you come at this? - It was in consequence of a letter I sent to Portsmouth desiring them to search for the name of

               <p>When you found Hickford out, he was brought up to town and examined? - Yes.</p>

               <p>On Saturday, the 28th of July, the prisoner went to the George and Vulture tavern, with a pair of hinges for a shutter; when he came back, he said the carpenter told him to go and fetch a bar for one of the windows in the garret, and it must be taken directly; he came home, and cut a bar of iron, and made a flap to it, and went, as I thought, to fix it up; it was for the maid's window, at the George and Vulture tavern; he being gone an hour or more, I went after him, and found there was no bar wanting or ordered by any body; I found the bar afterwards by his direction at a public house in the Borough.</p>

               <p>On the 4th of August about nine o'clock in the evening, I was going along the road into the country to harvest; I saw three men in the road leading to Canonbury-house, the other side of <placeName id="t17870912-21-crimeloc105">Islington</placeName>

               <p>Do you know which of them it was said that? - No, I cannot tell, for they had beat me so, that I could not lift my head from the ground.</p>
               <p>Which way did they go? - I could not tell; some gentlemen came and picked me up but I cannot tell who; and whether they carried me or led me I cannot tell; I was taken to the turnpike, and then to St. Bartholomew's Hospital.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you saw any body you knew? - Three or four days.</p>
               <p>Was it the prisoner that was brought to you? - Yes, to know whether I knew him or not; he turned his back on me at first, then they made him turn his face, and I knew him immediately; and then they had him away.</p>
               <p>Was you sure at the time you looked at him that he was one? - Yes, he was the man that knocked me down first.</p>
               <p>Look at him again? - I am sure that is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120043"/>Did you see him again afterwards? - Yes, on the 9th, they brought him into the ward to me, I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Were any other people there? - Yes, the Lord Mayor was present; he asked me if I knew the man; I said, that was the man.</p>
               <p>Did they point him out to you, or did you point him out to them? - I pointed him out to them.</p>
               <p>Did you point him out yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nobody pointed him out to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again immediately? - Yes, I had not the smallest doubt.</p>
               <p>Look at him now? - I am sure he was the man that knocked me down first.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing him before he knocked you down? - Yes; but it was a very little space of time just enough to see him, so as to know him again.</p>
               <p>Did you see him, so as to discern his face after he knocked you down? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Were they going the same way you were, or did they meet you? - No, they came across me.</p>
               <p>How far were they from you when you first saw them? - About two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Had you no suspicion of them when you first saw them? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Where were you when you first saw them? - On the causeway next the road side, they came down a lane that goes up to Cannonbury-house.</p>
               <p>Was it so light you could easily discern their faces? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it day-light or moon-light? - Day-light.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you know me before this happened? - I had seen him, but never had any acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where had you seen me before? - In the fields at Islington where I had worked.</p>
               <p>Court. What was he doing? - Nothing but walking about.</p>
               <p>By himself or with others? - By himself in a brick-field.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him more than once? - Yes, I had seen him several times.</p>
               <p>So often, that when you saw him coming to you, you knew you had seen him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he saw me afterwards the same night at the turnpike; he said he did not know either of the men, and again three days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court to Brett. Had you ever had any conversation with the prisoner at any of those times before? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever speak to him before? - Yes, I may have said to him, how have you done, or the like of that.</p>
               <p>When you were at the turnpike did you say any-thing about it? - My senses were quite gone, and I do not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Jury. Does this illness of body proceed from the wound you had when you were robbed? - Yes, they cut off the calf of my leg, and beat me in a terrible manner.</p>

             a bricklayer; says he, is that all? I thought it had been for something worse; he said, he thought we had no right to break a door for a warrant; after that we secured him and took him away; he said, had he been drunk instead of sober, he would have been cut to pieces before he would have come with us; it was Sunday, and we took him to New Prison.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards take him to the hospital? - Yes, I went with him after he was committed on the Monday to the hospital, in consequence of hearing of the robbery of the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>What was done afterwards? - I left the prisoner with Redgraves, and went to the man's bed-side; I asked him if there had been any body there that he knew; yes, says he, that man in the blue jacket, the prisoner had a blue jacket on then.</p>
               <p>Jury. You did not point him out to him? - No, no such thing.</p>

               <p>How long afterwards was it? - I cannot justly tell; it was three or four days, I believe, but I am not positive; my Lord Mayor and the prisoner and I, and a dozen or fourteen more people, went into the ward with us, when we were all in the ward, my Lord asked him if there was any body in the place that he knew; he then pointed the prisoner out.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect his words? - He said, that is the man (pointing to the prisoner) that gave me the blow on the side of the head; he said, he knew him before by sight but had never been in his company to eat or drink; the prisoner desired my Lord to ask us officers if we had ever had any conversation with the man before; my Lord asked the wounded man if we had ever had any discourse with him about the prisoner; he said, we never had any thing to say to him before.</p>
               <p>Are you perfectly sure that you had no conversation with the prosecutor before? - I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Are you perfectly sure that the prosecutor when thirteen or fourteen of you were there, fixed upon the prisoner readily, and without any person at all pointing him out to him? - He did.</p>

               <p>Was you present at the hospital? - Yes; on the Monday following, Braclay and I and the prisoner went; we walked into the ward as though we were strangers.</p>
               <p>Was any body else there? - No, only the assistant and the patients; the assistant came up to the bed and nothing passed then; we withdrew out of the ward, all three of us; then Braclay went back again.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the Lord Mayor was there? - Yes, I was out of the ward and was sent for up; when I came up, the prisoner put the question to the poor man, whether we had any conversation with him or not; the prosecutor said, no; and the prisoner seemed satisfied that we had no conversation with the man.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the prosecutor was desired to point the man out? - Yes, and he pointed him out immediately before my Lord Mayor.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 7th of September, as I was walking along St. John's-street with one Mr. Saunders, about eleven or twelve o'clock, I met with the prisoner at the bar.</p>


               <p>Had you ever seen him before? - Never to my knowledge. I was going about my business, buying of clothes. Saunders is a clothes-man. The prisoner came up to me and asked me to buy some whites?</p>
               <p>What answer did you make? - I told him I did not know the meaning of whites.</p>
               <p>When he asked you to buy some whites, what did you say to him? - I did not say any thing to him.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner asked you to buy some whites, what did you say to him? - I said yes.</p>
               <p>Then you did not tell him that you did not know the meaning of whites? - No.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you on your saying yes? - He took me through an alley, and desired me to go into a public house, and call for a pint of beer, and that he would come back again in about ten minutes; Saunders and me went into the ale-house, and Saunders went backwards, mean while the prisoner at the bar came to me.</p>
               <p>How long after? - About six minutes afterwards, I can't say justly to a minute, then the prisoner wanted me to go out of the room with him, and as I was going out with the prisoner, Saunders followed out of the yard; the prisoner said, there is no occasion for you both, one is sufficient; so I went with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Who desired you to go out of the house at all? - Nobody desired us to out, we went together, me and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Why? - We had no business to do in the ale-house further.</p>
               <p>Do make yourself more intelligible, when the prisoner came to the alehouse,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120047"/>what did you do? - He asked me if I had any beer, I told him yes, and he paid for the beer and changed sixpence, and the landlord gave him the change, then I went out with the prisoner by his desire.</p>
               <p>Then when Saunders was going to follow, what did the prisoner say? - He said there was no occasion for us both, there was no occasion to do any thing under four eyes.</p>
               <p>What more did the prisoner say? - The prisoner said I should go with him, and he asked me if I had got the money ready to buy the counterfeit shillings?</p>
               <p>Court. Did he make use of that expression, tell us exactly what he said, and what the words were that he made use of? - That I should go with him to the alehouse, and if I had the money to pay for the counterfeit shillings -</p>
               <p>Were those the words he made use of? - He did not make use of the words counterfeit shillings.</p>
               <p>Tell us the very words he made use of, his own words? - We were walking along towards Cow-cross to the ale-house.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He asked me how many I wanted.</p>
               <p>Saunders was not with you then? - No, he staid behind.</p>
               <p>He asked you how many you wanted? - Yes; I told him I would go back to my friend Saunders, and ask him how much money he had, as I had not money enough to pay for them; I went back to Saunders, and he sent me to the prisoner, and said I should bargain for three guineas worth.</p>
               <p>Then Saunders waited for you at the publick-house? - Yes.</p>

               <p>And you left him to go back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What house did you leave the prisoner at? - I think it is the Red-Lion in Cow-Cross.</p>
               <p>Now had any thing passed in the way to the first publick house in Cow-cross, had the prisoner said any thing to you about what whites were? - No, I do not recollect that there had.</p>
               <p>You came back to the <placeName id="t17870912-22-crimeloc110">Red-Lion, Cow-cross</placeName>

                        targets="t17870912-22-off108 t17870912-22-crimeloc110"/>? - Yes, I found the prisoner there, and told him I should be with him in an hour's time, for I was going home for money, and he said he would meet me there in an hour's time.</p>
               <p>Did you order any? - Three guineas worth; I went back again to Saunders, and Saunders told me that the man ought to be apprehended before Sir Sampson Wright; we went up to Sir Sampson Wright, and we met Mr. Clarke, and we related the business to him, he ordered me to go back and buy a guinea's worth, I told him I had not money, and he said I will send an officer with you, who shall give you a guinea.</p>
               <p>Did he give you that guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who gave you that guinea? - Mr. Ting.</p>
               <p>Then you went back to the publick-house? - Yes, I went and found the prisoner there to his time; he took me behind in a parlour, and called for a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Did Saunders go back with you? - Yes, and the officer.</p>
               <p>But you did not all go in to the prisoner? - No; I went in alone, I left them in the street, two or three doors from the publick-house; the prisoner took me backwards into the parlour, and he bid me to stop a few minutes, as he had them not about him, and he would send out for them.</p>
               <p>Did he ask you how many you wanted then? - Yes, and I told him a guinea's worth, and he sent out for a guinea's worth.</p>
               <p>Who did he send out for the guinea's worth? - That I can't tell, he came in about two minutes into the parlour, and he brought me them tied up in a paper, and he said there is thirty-two shillings for the guinea, I gave him the guinea, and he gave me the counterfeit money; he told me there was no occasion to count them, they were very right, for fear any body should come into the parlour, he said I might count them if I pleased, but there was no occasion for it.</p>
               <p>Did you take them without counting? - Yes, and then he made me a present of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120048"/>six sixpences and a shilling for my trouble, that I should come to him again, if I wanted any more.</p>
               <p>What else did he say? - He said I should be sure to find him at that same publick-house.</p>
               <p>What did you do then with the money? - I kept it in my pocket till I came to the officers.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the money? - I gave it to Mr. Ting, and then they went into the house to apprehend the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You thought you was buying some white cloth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The thing he asked you to buy was some whites? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he said here is thirty-two for a guinea? - I do not know what it was at first.</p>
               <p>Those were his words, thirty-two for a guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he say, here are thirty-two for a guinea, or thirty-two shillings for a guinea, or thirty-two shillings-worth for a guinea? - Thirty-two shillings-worth.</p>
               <p>How much money had you in your pocket when you first met him? - Two shillings.</p>
               <p>You were going about purchasing old clothes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was your whole stock in trade? - No more.</p>
               <p>That had been your whole stock ever since you came from the other side of the water? - I was there that very day.</p>
               <p>I don't mean in the Borough; you know that little story which you went abroad about? - I went never abroad out of England.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you have never been abroad? - If I have been abroad, I have been abroad for no harm, I came from abroad.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you first came to England? - I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Is it nine years ago? - Nineteen.</p>
               <p>Do you want to swear that you have not been out of England for the last nine years? - I have been.</p>
               <p>Where did you go to when you took a jaunt over the water? - About my business.</p>
               <p>Where did you happen to go, whereabouts? - I went where I had business to do.</p>
               <p>Where did your business carry you to? - I have been at Ostend.</p>
               <p>How long is that ago, honest Mr. Simon? - I can't really tell you.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you went? - It may be four or five years.</p>
               <p>How long have you been come back again? - About four years and a half or thereabouts, I can't tell.</p>
               <p>You staid longer than that abroad? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did not you stay till the witness died? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Has there not been a story about some stolen goods since you came home? - I never bought any stolen goods.</p>
               <p>I do not ask you that, but has not there been a sly story about stolen goods? - That was all wrong.</p>
               <p>Tell me what it was, this little matter about stolen goods? - It was wrong or I should have suffered the law.</p>
               <p>Then there was such a thing; do you know

               <p>You shall see her; do you know her? - I cannot tell, there is many Barnets.</p>
               <p>Let us into the secret about the stolen goods, that is, since you came from Ostend? - I never bought any in my life.</p>
               <p>When was it they said you bought some? - I never said that.</p>
               <p>But somebody else has. - They could not prove it.</p>

               <p>When did the people swear you did? - I don't know what people swear.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120049"/>Do you mean to say that? - Men will say any thing</p>

               <p>How long is it since the charge was made? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Try without the almanack; it does not happen every day you know, how many weeks is it ago? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How many days before this buying of the white cloth was it, that you were charged with receiving some stolen goods? - I cannot really remember the time.</p>
               <p>Who was the officer that searched your house, and had you in custody? - Mr. Meecham.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - At the other end of the town.</p>
               <p>What part? - One Treadway was in my house.</p>
               <p>How long is it since Meecham and Treadway were at your house upon this business? - I cannot say, about a twelvemonth perhaps.</p>
               <p>Have you had no charge about stolen goods later than a twelvemonth? - Never before that, nor ever since.</p>
               <p>Has no body charged you with receiving stolen goods within this twelvemonth? - I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>You never knew what whites were before? - Never.</p>

               <p>For what? - For selling such things.</p>
               <p>What, for selling white cloth? - It turned out to be counterfeit money.</p>
               <p>But when you went to Bow-street, you thought it was white cloth? - He told me he would sell me thirty-two shillings for a guinea.</p>
               <p>That was after you came from Bow-street. - No.</p>
               <p>You met Mr. Clarke accidentally, as you went to Bow-street? - No, I met him before the door of the office.</p>
               <p>Did you know Mr. Clarke before? - No.</p>
               <p>Why then did you speak to Mr. Clarke first or did he speak to you? - I spoke to Mr. Clarke.</p>
               <p>You did not know him before? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I told Mr. Clarke that such a man had got such things to sell.</p>
               <p>Let us hear plainer than that, what was your expression? - I told him that a man wanted to sell thirty-two shillings for a guinea.</p>
               <p>That was what you said as soon as you saw Mr. Clarke in the street; you said, Mr. Clarke, there is a man wants to sell thirty-two shillings for a guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Clarke took you into the office? - No, he sent Ting with me.</p>
               <p>He would not trust you with the guinea? - But Ting did; the officer gave me the guinea.</p>
               <p>You did not know Mr. Clarke before? - No.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, I ask you whether till you went to Bow-street, you did not think you were buying white cloth? - My friend Saunders told me so.</p>
               <p>Did Saunders tell you were to have thirty-two shillings for a guinea? - The prisoner at the bar told me so.</p>
               <p>When did he tell you that? - He told me that in the way we were going to the Red Lion public-house.</p>
               <p>Before you went to Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, what did he say? - He told me he would let me have thirty-two shillings for a guinea.</p>
               <p>How much had you in the whole? - I did not count them; the officer counted them.</p>
               <p>How much had you? - Thirty-two.</p>
               <p>Thirty-two what? - Thirty six-pences and sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Had not you more? - No more.</p>
               <p>Had not you thirty-six? - Twelve six-pences and a shilling he made me a present of.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120050"/>What did you receive in the whole? - Seventeen shillings and thirty-six sixpences.</p>

               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was in the paper that he sold you? Yes, I saw them counted by the officer.</p>
               <p>Was not there a small story of your receiving a Sun-fire-office bag which had been stolen from a fire? - I never received any such thing.</p>
               <p>Were you not accused of it? - I was accused of it; I was not the man convicted of stealing it.</p>
               <p>I don't know that; did you yourself go to amuse yourself at the fire? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you never count them? - No, I never counted them.</p>
               <p>Then he cheated you of a shilling; are you sure that the paper counted contained the precise number that the prisoner gave you? - I never once opened it; it never was opened in my hands; I delivered all I received into the officer's hands, without even having opened the paper at all; I am sure of that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you see him purchase it? - No, I did not; I was standing on the outside of the door.</p>
               <p>What did he do with the money he purchased from the prisoner? - He gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>Then you and the officer went in and took the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is all you know? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You and Mr. Simons had not been in company together that morning? - Yes, we walked together, and I got before him.</p>
               <p>Then he gave you the wink to follow him? - Yes; I did not hear him cry clothes, and that made me turn about.</p>
               <p>You are in a sort of partnership then? - No.</p>
               <p>How much money had you in your pocket that morning? - I had about fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Did you know Simons before he went abroad? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you are but lately acquainted with him? - I know the man as far as we all know one another.</p>
               <p>All honest men know one another? - I am as honest as the world will let me.</p>
               <p>This is a pretty good job for you, is it not? - I think it becomes every man to do justice to his king and country.</p>
               <p>When you first met Simons after the man had been talking with him, what did he tell you he offered him? - I asked him what the man had to sell; says he, he has got some whites; says I, do you know the meaning of whites? no, says he; well then, says I, it is counterfeit money.</p>
               <p>You knew very well what it was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So you told him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What did you understand by the wink? - That is very often among our people, very few travel with much money in their pocket, and we often assist one another with money, in case one gets a good bargain.</p>
               <p>There is no occasion for a wink, he could have called you back; is not the course of your dealing to leave earnest when you buy a thing? - No.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Bow-street; I had information of some coining business, and Mr. Clarke ordered me to go with these men, and give this man, Simons, a guinea; and he said you mark it; I did mark it; I cut it with a knife; then he ordered me to go with these two men to Cow-cross, to the Red-Lion, there Simons was to meet this man, Dean, I and Saunders, was in the Court; after Simons came out, he speaks to Saunders, says he, he is in there; says I, I don't know him, you shew him to me; upon that I goes in and lays hold of him, and takes him to another public-house and searches him.</p>
               <p>Did Simons give you any thing? - Not then, he did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon that Saunders and you went in? - Yes, and Saunders says, this is the man; then I fetched him out of that house, and we went into another public-house, over the way.</p>
               <p>Simons did not give you any thing then? - No, I took him into the public-house and then I searched him.</p>
               <p>What did you find upon him? - These two guineas in his fob; the one is the guinea I gave Simons, there is two cuts in it before the face of it; that guinea I took out of his pocket; that is the guinea I gave Simons, and that is the guinea I took out of his pocket, and this I took from Simons.</p>
               <p>When did you first see that in Simons's possession? - At the second public-house.</p>
               <p>Where had he it when you first saw him; had he it in his pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Simons take it out of his pocket? - I can't tell; I never saw it till I came to that public-house.</p>
               <p>How was it done up? - It was tied up in a paper, with this very bit of string I have here in a brown paper, but that is not the paper, that paper is worn out; I opened it and counted it; there are sixteen shillings and thirty six-pences; I am sure that is the same number.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did Simons produce any that the prisoner had made a present to him at the same time? - Yes; he had these in his pocket loose, and he made me a present of them; I have them here.</p>
               <p>How often does it happen that you furnish guineas to buy bad silver? - Twice I believe.</p>
               <p>Did you know either Saunders or Simons before? - I had known Saunders before.</p>
               <p>How long had you known him? - I have known him a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Have you ever known him on this sort of business? - Never that I know of.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any dealings with him before, on account of bad money? - Never.</p>
               <p>How have you known him? - Crying old clothes about the streets.</p>
               <p>Did you never have any informations about bad money from him before? - Never that I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that positively? - To the best of my knowledge, I don't know that I have.</p>
               <p>How mach money has been paid him for rewards in the course of this last year? - I don't know.</p>

               <p>I sent Ting to give this man a guinea; I have been employed by the officers of his Majesty's Mint many years; these are base metal, the sixteen shillings are worth about three half-pence a piece, and the six-pences the same; they are all counterfeit; they are a bad sort; they are not very black of the sort, and it appears by their look that they have never been in currency; because they put black stuff upon them.</p>

               <p>How long have you known him? - Eight or nine years.</p>
               <p>Have you known him in any business relating to coin? - Never.</p>
               <p>You understand the extent of the question; I don't mean coining? - I never had any dealings with respect to coining with him, except this.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any reward under this act? - None at all.</p>
               <p>But you always make some compensation to these people? - That depends upon what the Solicitor to the Mint chuses to give them; every man ought to be paid for his trouble.</p>
               <p>Court. When these people brought you this information; did they ask you what they were to have, or how they were to be paid? - No, not a word when they came to the office to give the information; they were there before I was, and had mentioned the same information as they did to me.</p>
               <p>You found them there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then they gave the information? - Yes, I put the question as I generally do, asking them where.</p>
               <p>Who did they speak to when they first came in; did they give you the first information? - I was informed they had given the information.</p>
               <p>Then it is not true that they first met you in the street, and gave you the information there? - Yes, I saw them in the street; they saw me first, but they had been at the publick office first.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know, whether at the public office for any other purpose, or for any other information, Saunders had received had received money before? - I do not happen to know.</p>
               <p>Court to Saunders. Have you not before this, received money at Bow-street from the officers? - I never received any money but once, when Sir Sampson Wright sent me down into the country to fetch a watch back, and gave me a guinea for my expences.</p>
               <p>Is that all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes, positively, Sir Sampson Wright gave me a guinea to go forty-five miles into the country, that is all the money I received in that office in my life.</p>
               <p>What case was that in, was you examined here afterwards? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you any witness to shew that either of these men asked for two half guineas for a guinea? - No, my Lord, I cannot I have.</p>
               <p>Because that is a fact extremely material for your defence? - There was not above two people in the house, and they were sitting backwards at dinner, and I was standing by the bar door.</p>
               <p>Who was in the bar? - I did not see any body in the bar; I was between the bar door and the tap.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say there was nobody there? - Nobody but the persons who were eating their dinner behind.</p>

               <p>Where was the prisoner? - He stood leaning against the place in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Was there any body in the bar? - I cannot recollect that.</p>
               <p>Do you know what money Simons had? - He had only two shillings.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - Because I searched his pockets; I thought he might be a buyer.</p>

               <p>Court to Clark. Is that so? - Yes, my Lord; it is really for no other purpose, but to blind who gave the information at the time, and to take away the suspicion from the person who gives the information.</p>
               <p>Court to Ting. Was it done? - It was done.</p>
               <p>Had Simonsany money at all besides the two shillings? - No.</p>

               <p>Simons did not tell you what his name was? - No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Who first told you what the prisoner's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120054"/>name was? - Nobody at all, I do not know his name now.</p>
               <p>Then how could you possibly know whose trial was to come on, or when it was to come on? - They told me the trial was to come on in which my brother was concerned to day.</p>
               <p>What people, you must tell? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>When was it? - Yesterday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Was it men and women together? - There was men and women together; they were in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Did you know them? - No, I asked them if they had been at the Old Bailey, and they said they had, and that the trial was to come on that morning.</p>
               <p>How came you to ask? - They said they came from the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>How came they to say that to you? - Because one of our people was tried here yesterday, and I asked them when my brother's trial was to come on, they all knew his name.</p>
               <p>What did you ask them? - I asked them if the trial of my brother was come on, and they said it would not come on before to-day.</p>
               <p>Why, your brother was not to be tried? - I asked them if the trial was to come on between him and the man; I do not know the man, I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Did you tell them that you intended to come here? - Yes, I did say so.</p>
               <p>Did you never tell any body before that? - Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell your mother-in-law? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was that? - Last week and this week.</p>
               <p>Does she know the prisoner? - No, she never saw him any more than myself.</p>
               <p>Does she know him? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how came your name in that brief? - I cannot tell, many people know my name.</p>
               <p>You never told the prisoner at all? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to be Mrs. Mitchell's daughter-in-law? - I married a son of her's; her first husband's name was Barnet's; she is married again.</p>
               <p>Simon. I beg to know what she knows of me? - I can only tell what people have said; he gave a man a kick, and the next morning he was dead, and it was very well known, he flew away for it. The jury sat, and if they had not brought it in manslaughter, he would have been hung.</p>
               <p>How much have you for coming here? - Nothing at all.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you had any conversation besides that you have mentioned on the road with this man about the horse? - No, he made this at the gaol, and it was read over to him before the Magistrate; I wrote it all out of his mouth.</p>
               <p>Did you follow his words as he spoke to you? - Yes Sir, word for word.</p>
               <p>How came you to write it down, did the prisoner think of it, or was it your desire? - The gaol-keeper in short came up to Mr. Ward and me, and desired us to come down, he thought the little one had something to say to us.</p>
               <p>Did the gaol-keeper or you recommend it to him to make that confession? - Yes, we told him we thought it would be the better for him if he did it.</p>
               <p>Then there is an end to the confession, what may the value of this gelding be? - Fourteen pounds.</p>

               <p>Let us know what complaint you have against the prisoner at the bar? - On the 2d of August, I went to Florida gardens with Mr. Peacock, who I now live with; it was in the afternoon, about six o'clock to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Who did you go with? - With one Mr. Peacock.</p>
               <p>Who is Mr. Peacock? - I have lived with him these three years.</p>
               <p>What happened there? - I went there in company with him, when I came there he had business at North-end; he lived there once in business; he had some business to do there, and he went across the fields to North-end.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120063"/>Did you go with him? - No, he left me there.</p>
               <p>In company with whom? - With nobody at all but myself; I went in there, and he said he would meet me at nine o'clock at Florida Gardens tap.</p>
               <p>Then for these three hours you were left there by yourself? - I went into the garden, and staid a little bit, and then I went home.</p>
               <p>How came you to go home before the time appointed? - Because I was rather tired of staying there.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay in the gardens? - I cannot say, to the best of my knowledge about half an hour, then I went home, when I went home I drank tea.</p>
               <p>Alone by yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But you need not give us this history, come to the point at once? - About half past eight I went out with an intention to meet Mr. Peacock at Florida gardens tap, and when I came up by <placeName id="t17870912-32-crimeloc155">the Bell and Horns, near Brompton</placeName>

               <p>Where abouts is the Bell and Horns? - In Brompton road.</p>
               <p>How far is it from Florida gardens? - It is at the crossway before you come to Florida gardens.</p>
               <p>Is it in the way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far is it from the gardens? - It is a good way.</p>
               <p>As you came into that field you saw the prisoner? - No, it was as I was going by the road; there is a corn field on the left hand side.</p>
               <p>Were you going through the corn field? - No.</p>
               <p>Then where did you see the prisoner? - He stood on the outside of the rails in the path, with his back against the corn field.</p>
               <p>Just by the Bell and Horns - Yes, when I came there he forced me very much to go with him, and what he had he had out; he tried very hard to go with me.</p>
               <p>You must explain yourself more, what you say at present is unintelligible; what did he say or do? - He catched me fast round my middle without speaking a word, and he tried very much to go with me.</p>
               <p>To do what? - To be connected with me.</p>
               <p>What on the pathway? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what manner, you must be particular? - He pulled my petticoats up, and forced me very much to go with me.</p>
               <p>On the pathway? - Yes; by that means I strove very hard against him.</p>
               <p>Did he throw you down? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What did he do when he pulled up your petticoats? - He forced me very much.</p>
               <p>How do you mean? - He tried to carnally know me.</p>
               <p>What when you were standing in the pathway? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were his breeches unbuttoned? - Yes, my Lord, when I came up to him they were.</p>
               <p>When you first came up to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now go on? - By that means my Lord, he tried three times to push me into the hedge; by that means I strove very hard against him, and I screamed out, by that means he upt with his fist, and knocked me down; he hit me in the stomach, and knocked me down; by that means when I was down, he took my petticoats up, his breeches was down; by that means, my Lord, he entered my body; by that means he put his hand across my throat that I might not seream out an longer; from the time he had me down, his hand was across my throat, and I was quite insensible.</p>
               <p>When did you first come to you senses? - When he had me down, and had entered my body, he said</p>
               <p>"damn me, madam, you shall."</p>
               <p>That was the first thing he said? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you recover your senses again? - Not till I came out of the field.</p>
               <p>What did you do when you first recovered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120064"/>your senses? - I found he was got off from me.</p>
               <p>You do not know how long it was? - I was in his hands from the first beginning to the ending half an hour, but I am sensible he was a quarter of an hour upon me when he entered my body.</p>
               <p>How can you tell that when you were not sensible? - Because I believe it was a quarter of an hour before he put his hand across my throat, after he had knocked me down first.</p>
               <p>You were struggling and crying out all that quarter of an hour as hard as you could? - Yes, my Lord, I did, and begged of him as much as I could to desist.</p>
               <p>What time of the night was this? - As nigh as I can tell, it was about half past nine when he was taken.</p>
               <p>You left home at half past eight in Piccadilly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then it might be about nine when you met him? - To the best of my knowledge I think it was.</p>
               <p>You had been to Florida gardens, and was going back to them again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was this the direct way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there much company in the gardens that night? - I did not stay there that night.</p>

               <p>Was it a fine evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were the gardens pretty full? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>This was in the pathway by Brompton road? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far from the Bell and Horns? - The length of a corn field, it is not a very large corn field, it is no great way.</p>
               <p>Then he first attacked you on the pathway? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was standing in an indecent manner before you came up to him? - I never saw him till I came up to him; he had nobody with him.</p>
               <p>How long might you struggle before he got you into the corn field? - I dare say it was about a quarter of an hour, to the best of my knowledge it was that time.</p>
               <p>You struggled then as much as you could not to go into the corn field? - Yes, I begged of him for God's sake, do not hurt me, do not use me ill.</p>
               <p>What did he say to that? - Not a word.</p>
               <p>You cried out for help? - Yes, I cried out, and said for Christ's sake, do not use me ill.</p>
               <p>How far did he drag you into the corn field before he knocked you down? - Not far, he dragged me through the hedge.</p>
               <p>It was a fine evening you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The day-light is not gone on the 2d of August at that time? - The moon shone very bright.</p>
               <p>Then there was both day light, and moonlight at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After he got up from you, and you came to your senses what did you do? - Some people came up, and cried halloo.</p>
               <p>Were they in the path, or in the field? - They were coming along the path from Florida gardens.</p>
               <p>Then it was that you got up? - Yes,</p>
               <p>Was that before or after he got up? - Before he got up.</p>
               <p>Then he got up? - Yes, he got up immediately when he heard them cry out; he had not satisfied himself.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he had or not? - I be not sure.</p>
               <p>Do you understand the question? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are not sure of that? - I think so much, but I cannot swear that, because at that time I was insensible, but I am sure he entered my body.</p>
               <p>Then when these people came up and cried halloo, he got up? - Yes, and came out of the field through the gateway.</p>
               <p>What did the people do? - The people asked me what was the matter, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Where were you at the time? - I cannot tell whether he pulled me up, or whether I got up myself when he left me.</p>
               <p>Were you up when the people came into the field? - They did not come into the field.</p>
               <p>What did you do then? - I made my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120065"/>way out as fast as I could, and went to the people.</p>
               <p>What were the people and him doing when you went into the road, were they talking to him, or had they hold of him? - I cannot tell which, for when I came out of the field I was quite unsensible.</p>
               <p>Did you tell them how he had used you? - I said if you had not come up to me, this man would have murdered me.</p>
               <p>What more happened, did they stop him? - They stopped him, and my Lord, they asked me what was the matter; matter enough says I, this man has used me very ill, and would have killed me if you had not come up.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said Betsey, you knows me, and I knows you, and for God's sake do not hurt me.</p>
               <p>What did you say to that? - I said, you villain, you know you would have murdered me, I know nothing of you, nor you do nor of me.</p>
               <p>What did he say to that? - Then the watchman came up, my Lord, and took him.</p>
               <p>What you accused him of then, was attempting to murder you? - I said he had me by the throat, and I verily believed he would have murdered me if they had not come.</p>
               <p>That was what you accused him of then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After the watchman took him, what passed? - When the watchman came up to him, they asked me to go to a public house to make it up.</p>
               <p>Who asked you to go to the public house? - He asked them to ask me, I said I would do no such thing, by that means he was taken into the public house, and I gave a written charge over him, because they refused to take him without it.</p>
               <p>The watchman has that now? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>The watchman is here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The watchman took your written charge, and for a ght you know he has it still? - I believe he has I think he gave it to the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>After you had given the written charge, what was done then? - The gentlewoman took me into the parlour, and gave me a smelling bottle to smell to, and he begged very much to make it up.</p>
               <p>What house was this? - Somewhere by, I not know the house.</p>
               <p>Is she here? - No, but the people who came up to my assistance were in the room with me.</p>
               <p>Now what time of the night was this when you were in the public house? - I think it was a little past ten as nigh as I can tell to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you go home? - No, I told them I was going to meet Mr. Peacock at Florida gardens, and the gentlemen went with me.</p>
               <p>About what time of the night was that? - I believe it was eleven, if not more.</p>
               <p>Then you went with the gentlemen that came to your assistance, to meet Mr. Peacock? - Yes, at the tap, my Lord.</p>

               <p>What time was that? - I believe it might be twelve o'clock as nigh as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you for disappointing him? - I spoke to him first.</p>
               <p>Were you not afraid he would be angry? - I thought he would be rather uneasy.</p>

               <p>For disappointing him, appointing him to meet you at Florida gardens at nine o'clock, and coming home at twelve? - I thought he would wonder what was become of me.</p>

               <p>What did he say when you told him all about it? - Says he, the rascal! I wish I had come by at the time.</p>
               <p>You say that you struggled on the pathway for about a quarter of an hour before he dragged you into the field? - A good while before.</p>
               <p>After he had got you into the field, he tried three times to push you into the hedge? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After he knocked you down, he was about a quarter of an hour on you before he clapped his hand upon your throat, and deprived you of your senses? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that he was about half an hour in the whole? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were crying out as much as you could for help? - Yes, my Lord, I screamed out very much.</p>
               <p>And nobody came past for half an hour? - I never heard or saw any body till those people came by.</p>
               <p>If they had they must have heard you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say that when you complained to these people, that he had almost murdered you; he said Betsey, my dear, I know you, and you know me? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - I never saw him in all my life.</p>

               <p>What injury you might receive in those parts would not hurt you know, you had tried that before; the moment you saw his breeches down, it must alarm a lady of your nice feelings, why did not you run away? - Because he laid fast hold of me.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Vernon; his house was broke open on Sunday the 15th of July, at what time I cannot tell; I was not there.</p>
               <p>When had you seen it last before? - The same morning; I left it about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you leave any-body in it? - No, nobody; I returned to it again at about half past nine o'clock; as I was going in at the gates, I found two boards pulled off from the paling that goes round the garden, that was not done when I left it; I opened the gate and went in, and there were some long stakes laid across the gateway, I knew they were not there when I left it; I went into the house and struck a light.</p>
               <p>Was it dark? - Yes; I looked about and saw there was a hole broke out, from the stable into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>How large was the hole? - I cannot say, but it was large enough for me to go in and out, but not quite so easy as I could wish to do; after I perceived that, I was terribly frightened, for I did not know but there might be somebody in the house at that time; I went up stairs, and found my master's things all thrown about the floor in the dining-room, the drawers and scrutoire broke open, two knives, and a screw-driver which was broke, on the ground, all the cupboards up stairs were open; I went back immediately, and told my mistress of it; she desired me to return again as quick as I could; I went and took a man to stay all night with me, and that is all I know about the matter.</p>

               <p>What day of the week was it? - Either Monday or Tuesday, I am not certain; it was about two o'clock, the woman's son, a little boy, lived servant with me, as an errand boy; she came frequently to see her son, and met me one day in the passage, and asked me if I wanted a riding habit; I told her I did not want one much; she told me she knew a man that had one to dispose of, and would sell it reasonable, because his wife was dead, and he wanted money to pay the funeral charges; she came again the same day with it, and brought Gregory with her; I asked her the price of the habit; she said the man could afford to sell it cheaper, on the account he wanted money; she told me it was a guinea and a half; I gave her half a guinea, and told I had no more change; I told them any other time they chose to call, I would give them a guinea more; some time after I was out about some business, and Gregory, who owned it, called for the money.</p>
               <p>Did he come with the woman before? - Yes, he stopped in the passage while she came to me; I paid her no more than half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say this woman's son served you as an errand boy? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What is Bragg? - A receiver; I was sitting there with Vandebus and Everard, and they told me they had done the house facing the Jews-harp-house, in Marybone-fields, and had got a great coat, and a pair of boots, which I saw in their possession, from that-house; Vandebus bought the coat and boots of Everard for five shillings.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with them relative to this robbery? - No, only they told me that, and that it was done of a Sunday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Vernon's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Vernon's house opposite the Jew's-harp-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of doing a house? - The meaning of it I suppose is the robbery.</p>
               <p>Did they tell you at what o'clock in the afternoon? - Yes, between four and five,</p>
               <p>Was any body in the house? - Nobody that I know of; they did not tell me whether there was or not.</p>

               <p>Do you know any thing else? - Yes, I went with Gregory and Mrs. Vandebus, to Mrs. Lynus's; he went in, and I staid at the door; Gregory came out, and shewed me half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Vandebus go into the house? - No not when I was with her, she and I sat withoutside the door of the next house.</p>
               <p>What did she come for? - To get the money to carry to her son.</p>
               <p>Where was her son? - In trouble.</p>
               <p>How in trouble? - In gaol; he had been in gaol about a week.</p>
               <p>What had the son to do with this habit? - Nothing that I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you know from her or from any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120072"/>body else, where this habit came from? - Gregory said it came from the house opposite the Jews-harp-house.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you when it came from there? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the woman? - No.</p>
               <p>Why did she go with you? - Because she was to have the money to carry to her son.</p>

               <p>The Indictment opened by Mr. Garrow - and the case by Mr. Fielding, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, the crime which you have now to enquire, as it is imputed to the prisoner at the bar, you have collected from the indictment, which has been stated to you by my learned friend, and it will call upon you for two distinct considerations; first, whether the transaction will amount to the crime of a highway-robbery; or, if not to that, whether to the offence of privately stealing from the person of the Duke of Beaufort? Gentlemen, the heads of the evidence, which I shall presently lay before you, will be comprised in a very short compass, for, as the transaction was of a very short duration, and the detection of the criminal almost instantaneous, these facts will be necessarily short that will constitute your enquiry; Before I state them, I cannot help suggesting to you the public importance of this prosecution, prosecuted as it is by a personage of the most exalted rank, against an offender of a very marked description: Probable it is, that this instance of the effective administration of justice may be universally known, and if, on the result, you are convinced of the guilt of the prisoner, as probable it is that awful solemnities will attend that example to which he must be doomed. Gentlemen, truly lamentable indeed it is, to reflect on the miserable situation of this metropolis, infested as it is now and has been by such swarms of offenders; banditties assembling together, no place, however sacred, secure from their encroachments; the church itself infested; the palace of the Sovereign, every avenue of this metropolis, wherever you can pass, none of those places are secure from these depredations, which are carried on with such a front of audacity, where they assemble together in such numbers, that even at day you are not secure, and at night, if you happen to be returning home, you are alarmed and afraid of some attack on your person: I do not mention these circumstances to touch your feelings, I have have had the honour of seeing some of you before, I know the manner in which you have discharged this duty. Gentlemen, if the laws themselves are defective for the security of our persons, we can only lament it; but if, in the execution of those laws by the inferior magistrates, there is either a want of vigilance or activity, we have a great right to complain; and I am but too much afraid we have that right; for if there was a proper activity to prevent, I am sure that measures would be effectually adopted for our preservation. Our theatres particularly, that form the nurseries of these creatures, might surely be guarded and watched in a very different manner; and I am afraid the unhappy wretch now at your bar owes his present miserable situation to the want of that vigilance. Gentlemen, I shall now proceed to state to you that evidence which is the foundation of the present prosecution -</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I humbly request you will order this servant out of court.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Gentlemen, on the 4th of June last, which you know was the birth-day of his Majesty, his

             the Duke of Beaufort had been at court at St. James's; as he was coming from court, when he came down into the first larger court, not finding his servants ready, his Grace made his way into a lesser court, which they call the Kitchen-garden-Court, there, looking for his servants, he stood in a situation, where, as a carriage was drawing up, his Grace found himself suddenly pushed about in a very extraordinary manner, and the prisoner at the bar and another person immediately near him, and who were the people who pressed upon him; the Duke turned to them and asked them what they meant, and, though they must have seen his Grace, with his ribbon about his shoulders, and must have known his rank, they gave him a very extraordinary answer, including a question,</p>
               <p>"Why<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120076"/>don't you see the carriage coming?" the Duke turning about, the men left him, his Grace happening to put his hand to his side, where the George was suspended at the end of the ribbon, he found it was gone; he immediately called to one of the marshal-men that he had lost his George, one of his Grace's servants immediately arrived, and hearing what was said, he saw two men going off, he immediately pursued them, and took them both by the collar, (one man was in black, the other was the present prisoner at the bar,) he told them what he suspected, the prisoner at the bar seemed to put on a front of indifference and boldness; the servant suspecting him more than the other, says he, you have got it in your pocket; and instantly rushing his hand into his pocket, he brought from the prisoner the very George that was taken from the Duke; so that you see as to the outline of the transaction, as to the theft by the prisoner, there can be no doubt.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it is necessary, in order to constitute the offence of a robbery, that the person from whom the property is taken should be previously put in fear; what that degree of fear may be, will come better from my Lord than me; as to the other offence, that of privately stealing, the law in its administration has been at all times, and especially in the construction that has been put on that statute (the offence of privately stealing being a capital offence, whereas the stealing unaccompanied with that circumstance is within the benefit of Clergy) the Courts have always been attentive to the merciful circumstances, and extended their constructions favourably, extremely far indeed; but I conceive in the present case, that there will be no doubt at all as to that degree of charge being brought home to the prisoner; the Duke himself was not apprised of this till the property was gone, therefore it was taken from his person clearly and demonstratively without his knowing any thing of the matter, therefore privately. In many of the offences that have been brought forward here, and where there has been agitations of law, I conceive the Court never went further than this, that where the person himself may not have known of the thing, yet some person connected with him does, as for instance, if goods are stolen out of a shop, though the master may not see the goods taken away, yet if another person has seen it, that will differ extremely from the present case, and I conceive without any farther observation, that no advantage can be derived to the prisoner from that consideration; I shall therefore proceed to call his Grace to tell you the story.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Will your Grace be so good to tell this story, what passed? -</p>
               <p>As I was coming from Court, on the 4th of June, my servant informed me that my carriage was in the inner court, I went towards the inner court, under the gate-way; there, a carriage coming by, I found myself surrounded by several people; after the carriage was gone, I, putting my hand to my side to feel for my George, I found it gone; the George was suspended by the ribbon; I immediately said aloud,</p>
               <p>"I have lost my George!" and the next I saw of it was in my servant's hand, which was in about a minute; my servant then had hold of a person, but I cannot swear it was the prisoner, he had hold of a man.</p>
               <p>Had your Grace seen the prisoner at all before your servant produced the George? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>You had no recollection of his person? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Did you Grace perceive the George, taken from your person? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not know that you had lost it, till you put your hand down to your side? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Was there any person about you, very near to you immediately, before you missed it? - Several persons were very near to me; I have had the possession of the George since; I have it now, (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Court. Is this the George your Grace had to your ribbon that day? - It is.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120077"/>Your Grace is able to say that positively? - Positively.</p>
               <p>Is your Grace sure you had it when you came out of the palace? - I am sure I had it when I was in the gate-way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Counsel. Your Grace was not at all alarmed, I take it for granted? - No otherwise alarmed than by being pressed.</p>
               <p>There was a great croud there? - Several people.</p>
               <p>I believe there is always a great croud there on a birth-day to see the people? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Your Grace did not observe the person of the prisoner? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Had you observed the persons of those that were close to you? - There were two men in black that were taller than me, close to me.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner in black? - I do not know, he was in blue at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Your Grace's idea was that the person in black had committed the robbery? - I said two persons in black stood by me.</p>
               <p>Did your Grace call out to stop those persons in black? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner was not one of them two? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg to refer to the copy of the examination, for his Grace said there, that one of the men in black had his George.</p>
               <p>Court. Did your Grace on the first examination charge on suspicion either of these men in black? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Were the two men in black? - No, one in blue and one in black; when they came up to his Grace, I heard his Grace say he had lost his George, pointing to the two men, one of these men was a man in black; his Grace said there is a man in black; but he said before, one of these two; I ran after the men immediately, they were running away into the Secretary of State's yard, into the first passage on the right hand, I ran after them, I saw the men run into the yard, I saw them turn into a narrow passage, I saw them in the passage, and ran up to them.</p>
               <p>Were there any other persons accompanying them, or only them two? - Only them two; I then put my hand towards the man in black's pockets, and felt nothing, I immediately put my hand to the prisoner's pocket, and he shied, clapping his hand to his pocket and shied, I immediately took him by the collar with my right hand, and put my left hand into his right-hand coat pocket, and pulled out the George;

             I was afraid there were suspicious people about, and I came on purpose, and I asked if he could describe any of them; says he, there is a man in black just gone that way; the footman came up that moment, and he heard him mention the man in black, and he pursued; I saw a man in black, and another in blue, that was Mr. Sterne, the men were both running, we ran as hard as we could, the servant came up and took the George out of Mr. Sterne's pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you observed Mr. Sterne before the Duke came out of the palace? - I had not. I never knew the man before he was secured and taken to the black hole, I took him myself, I never quitted him.</p>

               <p>Tell us exactly what it was his Grace said to you? - He said he had lost his George, and I said I was afraid there were some suspicious people, and asked him to describe any one, I would search them.</p>
               <p>What did his Grace then say to you? - He said there is one in black just gone that way, and directly we ran.</p>
               <p>Therefore after you had desired his Grace to describe the person, he said there was a man in black gone that way? - He said he had observed a man in black near him.</p>
               <p>Were there any more people in black at that time near you? - No Sir, I did not see any thing more particular, but seeing these men run, we did not follow any body else, Thomas ran up and felt the pocket of the man in black, then says he, it is here, one of them has it, and he took the George out of the pocket of Mr. Sterne.</p>
               <p>Court to the Duke. Was the ribbon cut? - It was not; it was taken off by untwisting the diamond knot. (Shewn to the Jury.)</p>

               <p>Not from the waistcoat? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord and Gentlemen, I hope the great rank of the prosecutor, and the illiberal manner in which I have been treated by the papers, will only tend to operate in the minds of the Court in my favour.</p>
               <p>Court. Undoubtedly, the Jury will divest their minds of every prejudice as they ought to do; I see a Jury from whom you have nothing to apprehend, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentleman, the prisoner is indicted on two separate and distinct charges, included in one indictment; there are two counts in the indictment, and there are two charges, not only separate and distinct, but extremely different, I may say opposite, in their nature; for the circumstances that support either the one or the other of these charges, expressly exclude the possibility of the other; the first is the offence, commonly known by the name of a highway robbery, which is a taking from the person either by actual force and violence applied to the person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120079"/>who is robbed, or by putting him in such fear as induces him to part with his property; that is the general idea and description of a highway robbery, and that is the offence charged in the first count of the indictment: The second count charges an offence, which appears on the face of it, inconsistent with the former charge; for it is stealing the same property privately from the person of the Duke of Beaufort, which is always so laid as not to be perceived; it therefore clearly excludes all idea of a highway robbery; for it is either taken by force, or the effect of fear, that necessarily supposes that the person must perceive the violence, or the impression of fear, and must see the person that takes the property; and the evidence most clearly and unquestionably applies to the latter; for there is no circumstance of violence whatever spoke of by his 
               <persName id="t17870912-47-person511">
                  Grace

                  </persName>
             the Duke, or any of the witnesses, and to be sure the evidence which appears to have been very correctly given, does certainly prove that whoever was the hand that took the George from his 
               <persName id="t17870912-47-person512">
                  Grace

                  </persName>
             the Duke of Beaufort, stole it privately, and therefore it comes within the second charge of this indictment. You will observe in your consideration of the evidence, particularly, that I state whoever was the hand that took it; because in the construction of this law, which is a very severe one, making it a capital offence to steal property, even of a very small value, privately from the person of a man without any personal violence to him, which can concern his life or safety, it has always been taken in favour of the person accused; and as this act of parliament deprives the person of the benefit of his clergy, it does not extend in express terms to persons aiding and abetting the commission of the offence. The construction, therefore, that has been put on this act, is, that the hand alone who takes the goods is guilty of the private stealing. In stealing privately in a shop, the law has been otherwise taken, because there it is expressly mentioned. Gentlemen, I am happy in this opportunity of stating the law in the presence of three learned Judges, who will correct me, if I have mistated it. The next thing that is suggested to you by the prisoner, was what I should have mentioned to you, that there are two circumstances which you ought to lay wholly out of your consideration; neither the high rank, and justly respected character of the prosecutor, nor any supposed notoriety of character in the prisoner, ought to make the smallest impression on your minds; you are to consider the prisoner in the light of an innocent man, taken up on grounds of suspicion for having committed this offence, and you are to judge on the evidence against him, as you would against a stranger, or your neighbour: If you are of opinion that he committed this fact, whatever his former character might have been, it will be your duty to find him guilty; if on the contrary, you think that on any part of the charge he is not guilty, whatever impressions may be raised against the prisoner, it will be equally your duty to acquit him. (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and then added:) This is the whole of the evidence I have already stated to you, that the evidence which is very clearly and distinctly given, leaves no room to doubt that the George was privately stolen from his Grace; the only question consistent with the evidence, is, whether you are satisfied that the prisoner was the man who actually so took it? the circumstance of finding stolen property in the possession of a man, is always considered as evidence, to shew that he was the person who stole it; and in itself, simply considered, it is also evidence, that he was the person who stole it in the particular mode in which it was stolen, whatever that may be; if goods are stolen out of a house by means of a burglary, the possession of those goods unaccounted for, especially if under circumstances that raise additional suspicions, and very recently after the fact committed, is evidence, not only that the party stole the goods, but that he committed the burglary in that particular manner, unless something to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120080"/>contrary appears; so in a highway robbery, the possession of a watch, or whatever property, is evidence that he took it in the manner in which it really was taken; so with respect to this offence, if nothing to the contrary appears, the finding property which is privately stolen, immediately after the stealing, in possession of a man who cannot give any account of it, is evidence that he privately stole it; but that evidence may be explained like all other evidence; and therefore it is for you to consider, whether in this case, under all the circumstances that have been stated, you give that effect to the evidence, which simply is the inference of law from it, which is, that the prisoner Sterne, in whose possession the George was found within little more than a minute from the time it was taken from his Grace's person, was the very hand who took it from his Grace, or if he was not: if it was taken by the man in black, though in that case the prisoner is guilty of larceny, equally guilty of the stealing with the man who took it; yet under this act of parliament, he is not guilty of private stealing; you are therefore to consider whether you are satisfied that the prisoner was the hand that took his Grace's George; if you believe the facts, there seems to he no doubt but he was concerned in taking it; but if you are of opinion he was the hand that took it, you will find him guilty of the whole charge. It is not perhaps a case where you should lean without all reason to make an inference against the evidence; but if you find any just ground to doubt whether the prisoner was the hand that took it, or whether the man observed by his Grace, might be the hand who took it, and hand it over to the prisoner, which is the frequent mode of committing these kind of robberies, then you will find him guilty of the stealing only: According to your opinion on that fact, your verdict certainly ought to be; if you are clearly satisfied the prisoner himself took it, you will find him generally guilty; if not, you will find him guilty of stealing only.</p>

               <p>What did you do on the floor, was you on your legs on the floor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What happened then? - He put me on the bed again.</p>

               <p>Have you never been in there since? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Could you tell whether it was lengthways, or cross-ways? - I cannot tell; then he put me on the bed again, and put the clothes over my head after that; I pulled the blanket or something off from the bed with me the first time; I had been a long time the last time on the bed with him, a long while indeed.</p>
               <p>How long? - I cannot tell rightly; I cried murder, and for some assistance, and scratch his face, and did as much as I possibly could to save myself; when he could not get his will with me on the bed, he chucked me down on the floor, between the bed and the table, that was by the bed.</p>
               <p>What sort of a table was it? - I am sure if I go upon oath, I cannot tell what sort of a table, I never saw it only just in the room when the watchman came to take him up.</p>
               <p>Like a square table? - Yes, and he put me down between the bed and the table, and took up all my whole clothes first, and put them over my head.</p>
               <p>All your whole clothes? - My petticoats; some of the bed-clothes come with me off the bed, and he put the bed clothes over my own petticoats; I cry murder, and some assistance to me as loud as I could possibly cry out, I call Mrs. Smith by her name.</p>
               <p>Is that the name of the landlady of the house? - Yes; I cry and call out murder, and call Mrs. Smith by her name to give me some assistance as loud as I could possibly, and he keep the bed clothes over my head so much, I could hardly get my breath to call; I put my left arm under the frame of the table.</p>
               <p>What was that for? - To save me take my clothes, and assist myself to take off the clothes from my face; he keep my right-hand down with his arm; he keep his hand upon my right arm; I keep my thighs together close as possibly I could; he jumped three times on this here part to open my thighs, and he threatened me so much as possibly he could; I cry out all the time for assistance; I could hear nobody to give assistance; I cry murder, and he put his hand to my throat in this manner to keep me down; I told him what do you want with me, do you want to murder me? I cry out many times; I could not get my breath at all; when I had my breath, I cry for assistance as loud as I possibly could, and then he opened my thighs, and he had what he wanted with me.</p>
               <p>How did he do that? - He opened my thighs.</p>
               <p>How did he manage that? - With his hand he opened my thighs; he jumped three times on my thighs to open my thighs, and had concern with me.</p>

               <p>Which hand? - I cannot tell which hand, because I had nothing to see in the dark.</p>

               <p>Now, Mrs. Davis, how lately before this thing happened to you, had you heard he was dead? - I cannot tell if you put me upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Don't you know upon your oath how lately before this man ravished you, it was that you heard your husband was dead; I must have an answer to my question? - I heard, I cannot tell when.</p>

               <p>Whether two or three months? - I don't know which; if I had the letter from him I could tell.</p>
               <p>You must recollect? - I cannot tell you.</p>

               <p>Had he been dead two days? - I can give you no answer.</p>
               <p>How long had your husband been dead before you heard of his death? - I cannot tell indeed.</p>

               <p>Who told you so and when? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Can you tell if he had been dead a month, or a week, or a day? - If I see the man again, I don't know him again.</p>
               <p>Then some stranger told you of it? - I had a line he was living at Woolwich.</p>
               <p>When had you that line that he was living at Woolwich? - I had it about a fortnight or nine days agone.</p>
               <p>How long since is it that you had a line that he was living? - After this happened to me.</p>
               <p>How soon after this happened to you? - It was about two or three days before I go to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120089"/>How long is that ago? - About a day or two after I commit this man.</p>
               <p>So then you went to see your husband two or three days after you had committed this man, and you had a line that he was alive two or three days before that? - I go a day or two after the line, about two or three days after I commit this man, I went to see my husband; I had the line that night I believe.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Evans's husband died lately, has not he, just the same as your husband? - Mrs. Evans's husband is living now.</p>
               <p>Where is he? - At home.</p>

               <p>Then before you lighted this man up stairs, you went as soon as you had opened the door to Mrs. Evans? - Before I lighted the man up stairs.</p>
               <p>As soon as you opened the door, you went to speak to Mrs. Evans? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you returned to light this man up stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So that you did not light him up the moment you let him in? - No.</p>
               <p>As soon you opened the door you let him up? - I said that before.</p>
               <p>I only want to know whether I am correct in the fact. Then as soon as you opened the door, without waiting to light him in, you went over to Mrs. Evans? - I said that before.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the alderman that?</p>
               <p>Court. Did you go to Mrs. Evans before you let the prisoner in? - Yes, for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>As soon as you let him in, you went over to Mrs. Evans? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell that to the alderman? - Yes, I did, I told every thing.</p>
               <p>Did you tell that? - Yes I did.</p>
               <p>You swear positively you told him that? - Yes.</p>

               <p>He then laid hold of you without saying a word to you of any sort? - He was lying in my passage, and he asked me would I give him some light.</p>
               <p>Then you went up with him? - He go after, I go before him; he seized me, and I made a great noise.</p>
               <p>Then he seized you without asking you to lay with you? - No.</p>
               <p>He did not ask you to lay with you? - No, he laid hold of me, and dragged me into the room.</p>
               <p>He laid hold of you and tried to have his ends of you there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You got up after? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you got up you made a great noise? - Yes I did.</p>
               <p>There was but one room on a floor in this house? - No.</p>
               <p>The Irishman and his wife were immediately underneath where you were stamping? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At first you began to call Mrs. Evans by her name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why did not you call Mrs. Smith by her name? - I did call Mrs. Smith; I thought she was sitting at the door at the time.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the candle after you had opened the door to let him in? -</p>
               <p>The candle was in my hand, I carried it over to Mrs. Evans, I stood with it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Then in the court you were talking with the candle in your hand all the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120092"/>And the prisoner was in the house in the dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you light yourself in? - I could not go in, he was lying at my room.</p>
               <p>Did you lock the door? - No.</p>
               <p>When you had got into the prisoner's room, your candle was in your hand still? - No, Sir, he had put it out upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>Then he shut the door by putting his back to it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether his windows were shut or open? - No.</p>
               <p>Then it is not true that his windows were open? - No.</p>
               <p>He put you first upon the bed, afterwards let you get up, and then put you again a second time on the bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You resisted him on the bed, and then he had you on the floor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the alderman all this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the alderman you was thrown twice on the bed? - I cannot recollect whether I told him that I was twice on the bed.</p>
               <p>You was twice examined before the alderman; I desire to know whether at either of those times you swore that he put you twice on the bed? - I believe I did not say he put me twice on the bed.</p>

               <p>Then you only told the alderman that he put you once on the bed? - I did not tell no more than that; I cannot recollect indeed.</p>
               <p>Describe the manner in which he jumped upon, and forced himself between your thighs, in what manner? - In this manner. (describing it.) my own peticoats were over my head.</p>
               <p>During the quarter of an hour he lay on you, you kicked with your feet on the floor? - As much as I could; sometimes I could not get my breath at all.</p>
               <p>Breath or no breath, you kept kicking on the floor as violently as you could? - Yes, and scratched his face.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of Mr. Harrison; I went up to bed with my husband, on Friday, the 31st of August, at one o'clock; I am sure he fastened the street door, and I fastened the bar myself.</p>
               <p>Describe the bar, is it a room cased in with a casement round it? - It is separated from the tap by a window, and the door is made to hinge on.</p>
               <p>Was the hinge on, and fastened when you went to bed? - Yes, I fastened it myself; when I came down, there is a little stool that stands in the bar, that was put on the outside of the bar, which I tumbled over, and I said to the girl, I am afraid there has been somebody in the bar: it was between five and six.</p>
               <p>In August, it had been light some time before that? - Yes; I found the top of bar unbolted; I missed my child's things the first thing; next all the things mentioned in the indictment; I brought them down to wash the next day.</p>
               <p>To Dodds. Did you find the articles mentioned in this indictment upon the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The things valued at one pound nine shillings.)</p>
               <p>The street door being unbolted, it must be unbolted within, must it not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did there appear any marks of violence about the door without or within? - No.</p>
               <p>I suppose there was a good deal of company in that room that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you walk into the tap room before you went up to bed, to see whether there was any body in the tap-room? - Yes, there was nobody there.</p>
               <p>When once the door that leads to the tap room was open, the prisoner could very easily get to the bar? - Yes, the bar is by the passage before you come to the tap room.</p>
               <p>You are sure no person was in the one or the other that night when you went to bed? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any part of your house, any window, or any place broke? - No, there was a pane of glass in the bar had been broke some time.</p>
               <p>Was that adjoining to the street door? - Adjoining to the bar, looking into the tap room, and by putting her hand through that pane of glass, she might reach the bolt of the tap room; there was nothing at all broke as I could see; I cannot say how she got in or out.</p>
               <p>How long had this girl lived with you? - About two months.</p>
               <p>Had you lost any thing during that time? - No.</p>
               <p>What servant was she? - In the public way, to get pots in, and clean the house; I only kept one, and a boy.</p>

               <p>Was it a cotton gown? - Yes, it is here; the spoons and the buckles were in her pocket; I told her the gown did not belong to her; she said it did, and I took the gown, and the pocket apron off from her, the next day at Guildhall.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; on the 31st of August, about three in the morning, I met the prisoner in Fleet-lane, Fleet-market, with a bundle; I asked her what she had got; she said she had got some bread; she had the best part of a quartern loaf; I asked her what else she had; she said two or three things; I wanted to know what it was; she undid her apron, and I took two or three of the things out, and put them in again, and said she must go with me to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Were the things in her apron? - Yes, except the coton gown that she had on.</p>
               <p>Was there any linen table cloths in her apron? - Yes, and half a yard of check linen, and the rest of the linen was in her apron.</p>
               <p>What did you do with these things? - I took her to the watch-house, and the patrol searched her, and found the property on her, and he kept them till such time as she was taken before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Court to Deacon. Had she any woman with her? - Yes, and please you, my Lord, I met a woman just before I met her.</p>
               <p>Were they in conversation? - When I met the first woman, she had got nothing as I could see, and I let her pass.</p>
               <p>Answer my question, were they in conversation together? - She called to the other.</p>
               <p>Then the other woman was before her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What became of her? - She went away.</p>
               <p>Did the other woman make reply at all? No, she went off immediately; she only called to her by her name Bet, to the best of my remembrance, but the other never offered to come back.</p>

               <p>About a quarter before eight, a person came into the shop, and asked for two tumblers; I am mother-in-law to Mr. Ponter; the maid rang me down, and I found this young man in the shop; he asked me for two tumblers, and I asked him what size; he said he had had two of Mr. Ponter the morning before, and gave five-pence a piece for them; I looked out two of that price, and he said he did not like them, and he said Mr. Ponter fetched those he had the day before, out of the back parlour; then another person came in for a vinegar crewet; I looked for that first, and he said it was too dear; I told him it was the same price we always sold them at, and when the prisoner saw me engaged with that man, he went out of the shop; I did not see him take the figures; Newton called out, and said stop thief, and he was pursued, and taken in Christ's Hospital, the other made his escape.</p>

               <p>I live with Messrs. Hinchliffe and Hollyer, refiners; I bought some plate of Manypenny, this tea-pot is all we have left unmelted.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what the other articles were? - I think there was a quart mug and some spoons.</p>
               <p>Was any body with him? - No.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Hinchliffe or Mr. Hollyer at home? - I am not certain, but believe not.</p>
               <p>Did you know Manypenny before? - Yes, I knew he lived with Mr. Edwards, watchmaker and silver-smith in Cheapside, he brought it as from Mr. Edwards, and we bought it as Mr. Edwards's property, it weighed fifty ounces five penny-weights, at 5 s. 1 1/2 d. per ounce, that was a fair market price for silver at that time.</p>
               <p>Do you usually buy such articles as these to melt down? - It was as black as my hat when it was bought.</p>
               <p>That is nothing; you know a little plate-powder would clean it, now what could induce you to suppose that Mr. Edwards who is a silversmith, and kept a public shop, and who, I dare say, would not sell it to me under 7 s. 6 d. per ounce, should send such an article as this to be sold for 5 s. 1 1/2 d. per ounce? - It has been repaired since.</p>
               <p>But that makes no difference, it was easily done; what could induce you to suppose that Mr. Edwards should send his servant to sell you such plate at such a price? - No answer.</p>
               <p>Court. Your conduct has been highly reprehensible, highly criminal in buying this plate; I am happy to be informed that neither of your principals were concerned in this transaction; I tell you as a caution, that a silversmith of credit in the Strand, was convicted upon evidence not much stronger than this, and sent to the lighters upon the river Thames; he gave a better price by 5 d. an ounce for the plate that he bought, and, excepting the circumstance of denying it afterwards, it is much stronger in this case than in that; your's is a business extremely dangerous, and I would have you to be very cautious.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did Mr. Edwards deal with you at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How lately before this had Manypenny brought things to your shop? - On the 7th of July.</p>
               <p>Have the goods in the course of your dealing been sent by him without a note of the weight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He has no account with you? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Is it usual to have plate brought without any note, but sent by a servant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you never had a note from Mr. Edwards of the weight and price that he meant to sell it at? - No, I do not remember that he ever did.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Mr. Edwards himself upon this business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120105"/>Did you enter this in your book as received from Mr. Edwards? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What time of day was it? - About three, or between three and four in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>How came Simmonds not to take it himself? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did he bid you take it? - He told me there was a trunk there; I knew what he meant; I took it on my head, and went a little way down the street, through an alley, into Bridges-street, Govent-garden; Simmonds and I took a coach there, and drove to Whitechapel, near Petticoat-lane; we took the trunk out of the coach, and went into a public house with it.</p>
               <p>Do you know the number of the coach? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever try to find that coach again? - Yes, but I believe I should not know the coach again if I was to see it.</p>

               <p>Did you put the plate into the trunk again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you do with it then? - He went out, and bought a yard of tenpenny cloth, and I staid, and minded the trunk; he called for a pint of ale; he came back, and brought the cloth, and tied the plate up in it.</p>
               <p>In the public house? - Yes, we put the trunk before the plate and drawed the curtain.</p>
               <p>What public house is it? - I cannot tell, it was some where in Whitechapel; I think I could find it again, because there is a cobler stall under it.</p>
               <p>Should you know the landlord again? - I do not know, but I think I might know him if I saw him; he took the plate, and I took the trunk, and we went away from the public house.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the trunk? - We went down a great many turnings, for fear any body should be looking at us; we went into another public house, and had some gin and water; we drank it, and I took the trunk out, when we went up two or three turnings, I dropped the trunk in an alley.</p>
               <p>Did Simmonds wait for you? - No, he went on.</p>
               <p>Was any thing left in the trunk? - Yes, some candlesticks; I do not remember any thing else being in it; we then went straight on to Mr. Cowie's; I took the plate from Simmonds.</p>
               <p>What the whole cloth of plate? - Yes, I went in with it.</p>
               <p>Did you sell it all there? - No, there was a milk pot, a papspoon, and some tea spoons, and other things; Simmonds said he would keep them back a little, for there was plenty for one time; he put them in his pocket; they were kept out when we broke the trunk open before they were packed up in the cloth.</p>
               <p>In the first public house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Simmonds did not go into Cowie's with you? - No.</p>
               <p>All you carried in, Cowie bought? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Cowie pay for it? - Mr. Edwards had been there selling some plate, and there was some left that he had not paid Mr. Edwards, and he gave me the difference to give Mr. Edwards; he gave me two ten pound notes, and two guineas, and he gave me a note of it, which I left on the compter.</p>
               <p>How much was that for the plate you sold him? - About thirteen pounds two shillings I believe, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The rest he owed to Mr. Edward's before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you sold plate to Cowie often after you had left Mr. Edward's before this? - Two or three times, it might be four times.</p>
               <p>He always paid you ready money for it? - Yes, always.</p>
               <p>Where was Simmonds? - Watching for my coming out; when I brought him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120107"/>the notes, he said I must go back, and get them changed; I went back, and told him that Mr. Edwards would be glad if he would change that for me.</p>
               <p>Did Simmonds send you in directly? - No, I kept out a little, till I thought I had time enough to go to Mr. Edwards's.</p>
               <p>Where does the refiner live? - In Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Did you get cash for the notes? - Yes, for one, and he said I must get change for the other; I got the other changed in Wood-street; I told them I came from Mr. Jones, of Hatton-garden; we then went home.</p>
               <p>Where is home? - Simmonds's lodgings, No. 34, Tash-street.</p>
               <p>Did you go with him? - Yes, but I did not stay long; I went home to my mother's after that.</p>
               <p>Do you know what became of the articles that were kept back? - Yes, he took them in a cloth, and said he would go to Hendon; we left them at a public house, in Gray's-inn-lane, as a bundle; he went and fetched them away on Monday, and carried them to Hendon, and I went down the next day, and came up the same night; when he came to town, he had spent all his money, and Mrs. Simmonds sold the milk pot, and spoons, and tea tongs.</p>
               <p>How came she to sell them? - Because I did not know where to sell them, and he said his sister knew a young man that would buy them.</p>
               <p>Did you go with her? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how do you know she sold them? - They both told me so.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - She said Dick, I have been to tell some spoons, and a milk pot.</p>
               <p>How came she to say so? - Because she knew very well that Tom and I used to be together.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether she knew how you got them? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>What was Simmonds? - A butcher I believe.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear him tell her how he came by these things? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any of these things in her possession? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>How long after did you hear her say she had sold these things? - I believe it was the same day she sold them.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what day? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>How long after the robbery? - It might be a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Did she say who she had sold them to? - Yes, one Mr. Jones in Fleet-street; there was a pap spoon he had in use a great while till he wanted money, and that he pawned; I do not know who pawned it, he told me it was pawned.</p>
               <p>Did he say where? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any thing else being pawned? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You never heard him tell his sister how he came by these things? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell her? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>You never told her any thing of this robbery? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have promised to tip me some of your gammon, have not you? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear you never said so this morning? - No, I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>However, I shall tip you some hock to your gammon; pray, young gentleman, whose lottery office boasts your education? - I lived at one Mr. Shergold's.</p>
               <p>You have been about six months a thief? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Regularly at the trade? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Besides dabbling a little before; in the course of six months, you have carried on a roaring trade? - Yes, I and Simmonds.</p>
               <p>In the course of six months, you and Simmonds have carried on a roaring trade at it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On the day you went to Clare-street, you were on the way to Parliament-street? - No.</p>
               <p>I thought you was going to dispose of the watch you did in Theobald's-road that day; was it not the same day? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>You know what doing a watch is? - I suppose it is stealing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120108"/>You did that yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you shall have the honour of it; now upon your oath, was you not on the road to Parliament-street, and seeing this door open, you thought it a good convenient opportunity? - No.</p>
               <p>There was one little circumstance you missed, though you have been very accurate; how much of this twenty three pounds you had for your own share; you welled one of these notes, did not you? - I do not know what that is.</p>
               <p>Then I will tell you what welling is, when you take twenty pounds, you put ten pounds in your own pocket, and divide the other ten; how much did you give Simmonds? - Of the first ten pounds note, he had five pounds.</p>
               <p>You did not well any that time? - No.</p>
               <p>It is about a twelvemonth since you spun your top into the area in Brook-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was before you was a regular thief? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You made forty guineas of that job? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You went and brought out forty guineas, how did you get that forty? - It was in a cupboard; the key was in the cupboard door, and I opened it; but my top never went down the area; young Mr. Sherwin used to take notice of me, and I used to go backwards and forwards to see him kill the sheep.</p>
               <p>And you thought that a good convenient opportunity to open the cupboard door, and steal forty guineas; and I believe Mr. Sherwin was fool enough not to prosecute you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You kept a lady or two of course? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Pray who were those girls that came to visit you while you was under confinement? - They were Simmond's acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been here before? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Have you never been up in the gallery to study? - No, never, I have been in that corner. (Pointing towards the door).</p>
               <p>Oh, that was the place of your study, the next place you will be in, will be there; (pointing to the bar) for you will be hanged in the course of two sessions.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the plate of the same colour when you sold it, as it is now? - No, it seemed as if it had lain by a great while.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you live last, before you was taken up? - I never was away from home.</p>
               <p>Did your parents know you was carrying on this trade? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you do with your money? - When Simmonds was out of money, he having a family, I used to lend him mine.</p>
               <p>Then you robbed for the sake of lending your friends the money? - We never used to rob when we had money.</p>
               <p>What are your parents? - My father is a cabinet-maker, and my mother a mantua-maker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I would have you take care of yourself, for I assure you, I will have you watched as soon as you are discharged; I will take that upon myself.</p>

             delivered in a written defence, which was read by the clerk of the arraigns as follows.</p>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen; I do not wish to deny, or even to disguise a single circumstance of truth; conscious that my innocence of any criminal intention in this unhappy business, will appear in the most satisfactory light. I stand before the Court a striking example, that the most perfect innocence may inadvertently become the subject of a criminal accusation, and that a life of honest industry may be tainted in a moment; my affliction is of a peculiar nature, and increased by the means which brought it upon me: for, though a common share of prudence might have furnished me with a sufficient degree of precaution against the artifices of a stranger; yet human foresight could not have suggested a possibility of danger from the snares of a brother. When I pledged the various articles laid in the indictment,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120109"/>I entertained no suspicion that I was violating the law. The open and undisguised manner I did it, at mid-day, which has been proved to the Court, will, I trust, convince you, that I could be under no apprehension of guilt. My unhappy brother brought me the articles, and informed me, that a master with whom he had formerly work'd, was obliged to make up a sum of money, but did not chuse to expose himself, and therefore had requested him to do it for him; under these circumstances, I took the things to Mr. Jones in Fleet-street, to whom I had been known many years, and he offered me five shillings and nine-pence per ounce, assuring me it was the utmost value; it then occurred to me it would be a good opportunity to buy the tea-spoons and tongs, cheaper than I could buy them new, and I therefore took them myself at the same price Mr. Jones had offered me; but as I was not possessed of quite money enough to give to my brother, I left four of the spoons and the tongs at Mr. Jones's to raise the remainder: I accordingly paid my brother after the rate of five shillings and nine-pence per ounce. This, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, is the true simple statement of the transaction; under these circumstances, I have done nothing more than a common act of friendship, which I was credulous enough to think I might have safely done for an indifferent person; it is some consolation that I am able to produce unimpeachable testimony from respectable persons now in Court, of an irreproachable character; which, I hope, will have its weight. I trust you, Gentlemen of the Jury, will be satisfied, that I was drawn into the commission of the offence now charged upon me, without knowing that I was the instrument of violating the laws of my country. I leave myself in the hands of you, my Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, in full confidence, that as my conscience does not condemn me, I shall have the happiness to hear you pronounce me innocent.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called six witnesses who had known them from their infancy, and gave them a good character.</p>

               <p>Do you know who took them? - Yes, Steele; for I had them when she knocked me down, and when I got up they were gone.</p>

               <p>Will you swear the duplicate the officer had of you, is the same duplicate she brought into your room? - I will not, but there was no other duplicate that I know of in the place; she was going a little way out of town and desired me to take care of it till her return.</p>
               <p>- CROSBY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; I took the prisoner Steele on the 17th of July, and found the duplicate in the room of the last witness as she has related. (Produces it.)</p>

               <p>This woman was in liquor, she was lying with her head on the table asleep; she had a soldier with her, and they begun dancing; I went out and came back again, and sat down, and in about half an hour's time, she said she had been robbed, and I saw no more of her.</p>
               <p>STEELE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went to the public-house to see for my husband; the prosecutrix was there with a soldier, and he begun to pull and haul her about the bosom; she came into the box where we were; I told her to go into the box for we did not want her company; she insisted upon our drinking with her, and said, if she had not money, she could pawn her handkerchief; she shew'd a farthing, and said that was all she had; that she had been robbed in the box where she was asleep; she took it to a pawnbroker's in Hyde-street, and they would not take it of her; I took it for her to Mrs. Davis's the corner of Middle-row, St. Giles's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120113"/>and they would not take it; she said she would not go any further; however, she went across Leicester-fields, and asked me to go into this shop; the gentleman gave me half-a-crown; she desired me to keep the duplicate till next day for her.</p>
               <p>Court to the prosecutrix. This is a very serious charge against the prisoners; their lives must answer for it, and you are bound to tell the truth; were you in liquor that day? - No, I only drank part of 6 d. worth of gin and water amongst three of us.</p>
               <p>Was there a soldier at the Two Brewers? - I don't know, for I did not look.</p>
               <p>How came you to join them in the public-house? - Steele got up for me to come in and sit down, as there was no room.</p>
               <p>Did Steele accompany you to any of the houses to pawn your things? - No, no where.</p>
               <p>Now upon the oath you have taken, did you go with her to Leicester-fields to pawn that handkerchief? - No.</p>
               <p>She did not leave you at the door while she pawned it? - No, no such thing.</p>

               <p>Are you sure it was her? - I am sure it was her; I spoke to her and told her to keep away; she turned out my breeches pocket, on the right hand side; as soon as she had turned out my pocket and got the money, she loosed me and ran into the Weaver's Arms just by; I followed her immediately, and never lost sight of her.</p>
               <p>Had she taken any thing? - She had taken six shillings and six pence out of my pocket, and she had got it with her.</p>

               <p>Was she there still? - Yes, she was there with a man drinking just by her; then she was taken into custody, and she was taken down to the watch-house; the constable never searched her.</p>
               <p>How came that? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did he refuse to search her? - I don't say he refused to search her; then a man passed his word for her appearance, and she was discharged.</p>

               <p>Did she come again on the Monday? - I went on the Monday to the constable's house, and to the Weaver's Arms to enquire for her; I found he was gone to the Excise-Office, and the mistress of the house told me where she lived, and we went to take her in her own room.</p>
               <p>What public-house was this? - The Weaver's Arms in Cloth-fair.</p>
               <p>On the Monday you took her up, and carried her before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And she was fully committed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was quite sober? - Yes; I had drank share of one pot of beer, that is all I had drank that day.</p>
               <p>You lost nothing but the money? - No.</p>

               <p>About ten o'clock, as I was coming my round, I saw this man standing crying at the door, he had got a shovel or a spade in his hand; and he was standing crying at the publick-house door, the Weaver's Arms; he said he had been robbed by some woman, who was gone into the Weaver's Arms; I asked him if he should know the person, he said he should; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120116"/>went into the house with him, and the man of the house said, there was no person there that had robbed him, and desired him to go out; the prisoner at the bar was there, and he said he was sure that was the woman; we came out, and I asked him if he was sure that was the woman when he was in the house; I told him if it was, I would go in and take her out; I did so, and went and took her down to the watch-house, and she was bailed as before related.</p>
               <p>Who was the constable of the night? - One Mr. Vaughan.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - At No. 7, in Cloth-fair.</p>
               <p>He took the publican's word? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Is it usual to take bail for capital felonies? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Vaughan here? - No; he was sent for, but he sent word he was too busy to come.</p>
               <p>I don't wonder at his being shy; I believe he has done more than any magistrate can do.</p>

               <p>I am innocent of what is laid to my charge; I was in at the Weaver's Arms, I had been there full an hour, when he came in; he said the landlady was the woman that had robbed him; me rob you! says she; yes, says he; says I, you may as well say that I robbed you, as to say that that woman robbed you; then, says he, it is you, and I will charge the watch with you; with that he charged the watch with me, and I was carried to the watch-house; the man of the house came down and was bail for me; I staid at home till the Monday, then he came for me; then I went to Guildhall, but I never saw the man till he came to say that he was robbed.</p>

               <p>I live in Cloth-fair; I keep the Weaver's Arms; my husband is not here; he is not at home; he had nothing to do in it; he was not within at the time the affair happened, and the man came in, he came in soon after; all I have to say is, this man came in crying, he seemed to be drunk; it was about a quarter after nine, and some people in the tap-room asked him what was the matter; he said his pocket was picked of four shillings; some of the people asked him by whom; I stood up, that is the woman, says he to me; by and bye I got into the bar to serve; so he said no more but walked out; I laughed at him when he said it was me; he saw me going into the bar, and he went out.</p>

               <p>Then the watchman took her to the watch-house? - He did not go out without her, but took her to the watch-house directly.</p>

               <p>Do you think he came home after they were gone to the watch-house? - I cannot recollect, whether he come home before she was taken from my house, or whether he followed her.</p>
               <p>That is not the question; we all know he followed to the watch-house: I want to know whether he came home before the prisoner was taken to the watch-house, or whether he came home after? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Did he take any notice of the man standing crying at the door? - No, Sir, I cannot recollect that; I cannot recollect whether he came home while the man was standing crying at the door; I do not know what he might say.</p>

               <p>Was he within when the woman was up, upon your oath or not; come answer; you have had time enough to consider; why do not you answer? - I think the woman was taken up before he came in.</p>

               <p>Who did you go with there? - I went with the prisoner about a quarter after nine.</p>
               <p>Who else went in with you? - I knew none of the people that were in the house; only she and me went in together; that was about a quarter after nine.</p>
               <p>How long was it before any thing happened? - About half past nine, a man came in crying, and he said he had lost 4 s. 3 d. and he first charged the landlady of the house, who was sitting in the tap-room at the Weaver's Arms; he came in by himself, and said he had lost 4 s. 3 d. and that she had robbed him of it, and he would swear it; he said that without any body asking him any questions, I never heard any body asking him any questions about it; and then directly as soon as he came in, he said he had lost 4 s. 3 d. and that the landlady had taken it, he went out crying.</p>
               <p>Did any body tell him he was robbed? - No, I never heard any body tell him he was robbed; there were people in the house told him he had not been robbed by any body there.</p>

               <p>Was the landlord come home then? - I do not believe he was.</p>
               <p>What passed when the watchman and he came in? - He directly fixed on this woman, and said she robbed him; the watchman told the man, if he would swear to it he would take charge of her, he said he would; upon that he took charge of her directly.</p>

               <p>

               <p>The landlord came and bailed her out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long after you was at the watch-house? - I believe it might have been for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, that was the first of my seeing the landlord that night.</p>
               <p>What became of her after she was bailed out? - After I came out of the watch-house, I went straight home, I did not stop, I did not go to the Weaver's Arms.</p>

               <p>Quite sure? - Yes, quite sure.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Carney. Yes, you did, Brown.</p>
               <p>No, I did not go to the Weaver's Arms, but I well remember she treated me with a glass of gin, at a gin-shop in Long-Lane.</p>
               <p>Then she did not go to the Weaver's Arms? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What became of the landlord? - I do not know; he came home I suppose; I did not see the landlord after she came out of the watch-house at all.</p>
               <p>Is Long-lane in the way from the watch-house to Cloth-Fair? - The Weaver's Arms is just joining to Long-lane.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner treated you with a glass of gin in Long-lane, and you left her at that door? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had you nothing at all to eat? - No, not there, I had my supper in Long-lane before I met with her.</p>

               <p>Who served you? - A young woman, she might be a servant for what I know, it was a young woman served us.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing more? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Watchman. I think you told me that you know the man that keeps the Weaver's Arms personally? - I do.</p>
               <p>I think you told me that when the prosecutor first took you into the house, the landlord answered you, and said there was no person there that had robbed any body? - I say so now; I am sure it was him; it is true upon my oath; he desired me to go out and this man likewise.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You know the landlord of the house? - Yes; it is the same man that bailed the woman out of the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Was that man in the house when you and the watchman went in the first time? - Yes, he was stripped in his shirt sleeves.</p>
               <p>Is it true that he said what the watchman has said? - Yes, it is true.</p>
               <p>He said there was no person there that had robbed you, and desired you to go out? - That is true.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes, upon my oath it is so.</p>
               <p>Court to Watchman. How long have you known the master of the house? - Ever since he has kept the house, which I believe is six or seven months; I know his person perfectly well; I have no doubt but he is the person that spoke to me; his wife was there at the time, and she said this man challenged her before I came there with being the person that robbed him; that was when her husband was there, and when I first went in; the second time, when I brought him to the door, I said, are you sure that is the person, he said he was sure it was; I said, I will go and fetch her out; the husband was there both times, and followed us to the watch-house; I cannot say that Brown was there.</p>
               <p>(Here the learned Judge summed up the Evidence.)</p>

               <p>Did you ever hear the prisoner say any thing respecting that chest, or any thing it contained? - Before my Lord Mayor, he spoke about it, and acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Had there been any promises or threats? - No, he said what he said voluntarily, without any inducement:</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Be so good as to tell whether your partners were with him before he said any thing about that chest? - I do not know, I have no reason upon earth to believe that any thing was said to him; a variety of things he acknowledged to the buying of people in the streets, which things were found in his chest; he never was examined before my Lord Mayor but once.</p>
               <p>What sort of articles were those? - Those were linen-drapery goods; new, and likewise remnants of muslins, and a variety of silks, and other things; we first found some callico handkerchiefs, at the house of Molloy; a variety of callico handkerchiefs, which I knew to be our patterns; in the chest we found one hundred and thirteen guineas and a half in gold, which this man acknowledged to be his.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason to know before that, what his circumstances were from him? - He had frequently complained of poverty in my hearing, a fortnight or three weeks before; Mr. Topham keeps the cash, and pays the wages, he can speak to that; he acknowledged having but one guinea in the world; there were a variety of goods which he had in the chest, which are our property; he was asked how he came by them, and he said he bought them of different people in the street; in consequence of some further information, I went to an officer, Mr. Creach, in Sunmond's-street, Wapping, and found the remains of a piece of tambour muslin, with our private mark upon it, nothing else, and a duplicate; that muslin was produced before the Lord Mayor, but I do not recollect he said any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. No other person has any secret interest in your business, but what you have mentioned? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to be a married man? - No, single, the other partners are all single; I have not the principal care of the house.</p>
               <p>Does either of the partners pay the whole rent of the house? - No, the expences of the house are paid out of the trade.</p>

               <p>I am a shopman to these gentlemen; on the 8th of September, we took account of some muslins; I laid them promiscuously about the warehouse; I did not watch them afterwards; I searched the cellar, there I found two pieces of muslin in some rubbish under the cellar stairs; they are here; they have been in my possession ever since; they were found in about an hour after dinner time; immediately as I came down from dinner, I went into the muslin warehouse, and counted the papers; I missed two pieces, one out of each paper; all the pieces had our private mark on them but one, which I saw Mr. Sowdon mark with a pencil before he went to dinner; this is the same piece. (That piece marked with a pencil, produced and deposed to.) They were wrapped up in nothing, laying among the dirt; they were small pencil marks in characters.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say from this, that this was one of the pieces so marked, and left in the paper before you went to dinner? - I am, because we had never another piece marked; this is the private shop mark, a very small mark.</p>
               <p>What is the prime cost value of these two pieces? - One of them is sixty shillings, the other thirty shillings, or thirty-one; they were both in the warehouse when I went up to dinner, and both missing when I came down; I was present at one Nevil's, in Golden-lane; I was present at Molloy's, there we found several shawls.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you know how long these muslins had been in your master's warehouse? - One I suppose two or three months; it was a particular kind of goods; we had only one piece of it.</p>
               <p>They were dirty when you found them? - They were in the dirt.</p>
               <p>You went to Molly's, and found a great number of things? - I heard the prisoner say that some part of them belonged to himself, that he had bought them in the street of different people, whom he named.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe this to be my property, and to be stolen from me.</p>
               <p>Lavender. I matched the two pieces of that silk with the piece from which it was cut-off, and they match like an indenture; I have the money, but I was afraid to bring it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys to prosecutor. You have had this muslin some time? - I suppose two or three months.</p>
               <p>Does it not appear that there has been lately a considerable fall in these goods? - I do not know of any particular fall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are not these two pieces valued at a great deal more than forty shillings? - Them two pieces cost us five pounds.</p>

             out that day to his stand where he went a begging, and then he told me he was going to do it; and I asked him which way he would get into the place, and he said at a pannel that was opened before, which was fastened by four or six small tacks, and if he took them away, he could get in very easy; and after that, I told him he could not get in without somebody or other seeing him, and he desired me to hang a bed-gown across the line, which I did, and he put up a wooden board at the window to prevent any body seeing him that way; and he told me to go out of the place, and lock the garden gate after me, and take the key with me to prevent any body coming to see him.</p>
               <p>Was it the same garden to your house as to Blacklowe's? - Yes, I went out and staid about ten minutes; then I returned, and he was in Blacklowe's room, and he desired me to go back again, and I went away again and staid, I do not know how long exactly; but when I came back he was in our own room; and when I came in, he shewed me the money that he had taken, which was between six and seven pounds, good and bad together, and he gave me some to count, and the remainder he counted; and then we went to the pawn-broker's to release some things of mine that were in pledge.</p>
               <p>When you came back the first time, he was in Blacklowe's room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw him there, who was with him? - Nobody but himself.</p>
               <p>Who was at the window? - I saw nobody at the window but himself.</p>

               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Cox? - No, I know no such person.</p>
               <p>Do you know one Ward? - No, I know no such name; I never saw him there that day, there was nobody with him in the room, he was by himself.</p>
               <p>How came he to be discovered? - I do not know, we were taken up at Coventry, we went to Coventry that evening; he had been out of work, and we were reduced to the greatest distress in the world, and he said he must go to Coventry to get employ; he belonged to Coventry; we went to the Castle and Fleece, but the coach was gone; we went off with the Liverpool coach; the evening following we were both taken up at Coventry; I never knew that any body was privy to it besides himself and me, and he never told me any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Court to Booth. How came you to send to Coventry after these people? - They had made a very precipitate retreat, when the old man came off his post from begging; I told him those people went away in a very hasty manner; then I pursued her to her mother's, and she told me they were going to Coventry.</p>

               <p>How came you to tell this story that two men and you committed this robbery? - After the second examination, these two men took me down to the publick-house, and they gave me a good deal of beer; and they sent for half a sheet of paper, and they asked me if I could write; I said no; they wrote whatever they pleased, and I said I would not sign my hand to any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120131"/>paper; and I believe they both signed it; and they made a mark at the bottom of it.</p>

Some circumstances of tenderness and attention being also mentioned in favour of the prisoner, the Jury found him.</p>

I was going from Oxford-road, when a man overtook me; Sir, says he, here is a fine wind to day; yes Sir, says I, it is so; as we were walking along, he saw something, so he said somebody had dropped a garter, yes says I, it is a fine one too; it happened to be a purse; he picked it up and put in his pocket; says he, come along with me and we will see what there is in it, he said he was going in the fields, he was going to receive some money, he said he always came up once a year; I went with him and set down to see what was in the purse, and he put his hand in the purse, and he pulled out a letter, he said, here is something, can you read? yes, says I, a little; he gave me the letter to read; while I was reading it, the prisoner came by, this was not the prisoner I had been talking to, the man said, this man has picked up a purse; says he, I will ask this gentleman, so he called, Sir, to the prisoner, I will be glad to speak to you; so there was a receipt for 136 l. but says he, this is of no use if we have not the property; so he looked into the purse again, and there was a little box with cotton, and amongst the cotton was this fine diamond ring, so says he, this is fine luck, I would have you keep it to yourself, and say nothing about it, and I dare say it will be advertised to-morrow; says the other man, I found it, but this man was with me; says the prisoner, are you willing he should have part of it? says he, what do you desire? says the prisoner give him 40 l. I said I should be very well satisfied with 40 l. says he, I will go and fetch the money; says he, I will keep the ring, and make a present of it to a gentlewoman in the country; so he was going off to receive the money, and the prisoner said, let me keep the ring for safety till your return, so he gave him the ring, and he came back, and said he could not raise the money now, the gentleman is not at home, but he will be at home at six o'clock; I said we will stay, as this gentleman is a stranger to me and to you; this gentleman said his name was Johnson, he kept a livery-stable in Oxford-Road; we stopped with this gentleman to receive the money; so he said I will keep the ring, and the man that found the ring said, you must give me something in security; so the prisoner pulled out a note of thirty-five pounds, which he said was as good as money, and the prisoner said, I will give the man that, if you will give him your watch, and I was to go to the prisoner's house till he came; he asked me what a clock it was, I pulled out my watch; says he, shall I have your watch? I said I do not care, you may have it if you will, so I held my hand to him, and he took it and put the note with it into his pocket; this young man went away, the prisoner staid with me till after he was gone; he hurried the other away to make baste back; we staid some time after, and we walked away towards Portland-square, as we were going along, says he, I will tell you what, I would not have you have too much beer, says he, go forward, I shall be at home in two or three minutes, you stop till I come; he told me to go to his house, he said he kept a livery-stable at the top of Oxford-Road; I parted from him, and went and enquired for him, I could find no such person; I mentioned it the next day, and one of the runners said if I would give him five shillings he would bring him to me; the man was taken on the morrow, I cannot tell where he was taken, he was not searched; my watch was never found.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did you let him have the watch? - For security for the diamond ring; I gave him this watch with this note in security for the ring; he was to give me the watch back when the other brought the money; the other man had the watch; the prisoner was to produce the ring.</p>

               <p>Did not you offer somebody, that if this man, or any body for him, would give you two guineas, and not prosecute you for compounding the felony, you would make an end of it? - I said if it was made up before the justice.</p>

               <p>Who might you work for? - Mr. Dodd.</p>
               <p>You are one of those that have struck, I suppose? - I am not one of those that have struck; I have had work till the week that I came on this business, I was in work at the same time; Mr. Dodd lives in Little George-street, Portland Chapel, I had worked for him near upon a fortnight, I have not been out of work at all, I had been at work half that day, I never saw either of these people before.</p>
               <p>Then you gave your watch to the other man, I take it for granted, that you might not run away with the ring? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not recollect it did not belong to you? - I knew it did not; I said to them, you must not keep it, but when it is advertised, you must return it to the owner.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor and another came and apprehended me; I told them you are very wrong, for I was at a butcher's in Compton-street from one till half past four, I dined there and drank tea in the afternoon, I was going to take the shop.</p>

               <p>To Tomkinson. Look at the two iron chissels; the iron chissel, and the rabbit plane, you describe to be your own, what marks do you know them by? - I know the chissel by the handle being turned in the lathe, and the mark it has upon the face of it; it is a dent upon the face of the chissel; it is not common to every chissel to have such a dent in it as that is; I have had it four years; I had been working with it in this house.</p>

               <p>Did he pay you for these stockings? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you make any contract for them? - None at all, he asked me the price.</p>
               <p>Did you fix any price upon them? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did any other conversation pass about these stockings, but that you have mentioned? - I do not recollect any other.</p>
               <p>Did you promise to change them if they did not suit? - Certainly I did; it is the rule of the business, if it is six months after.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said when they were to be paid for? - No, Sir, I should not have given him the least credit, being a perfect stranger; I am sure I was gone but a very few minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. There was no contract, I understand, made between you? - - None at all.</p>
               <p>Nothing said about paying for them? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>The fact was, that he was to shew them to another person? - He said he bought them for a friend in the country.</p>
               <p>Why then you sold them? - I thought I had done so; he was to have bought them.</p>
               <p>When you returned, did you see some ill looking men lurking about the house that looked like officers? - Indeed I did not, I did not take any notice.</p>
               <p>You left them there for the purpose of fetching these things? - I left them there till I returned.</p>
               <p>If he had paid you the money, or returned them to you in six months, you would have changed them? - I should not have let him have them without the money.</p>
               <p>Court. Then if I understand you right, there was nothing said about money? - It was never mentioned.</p>
               <p>Was there any other person in the room when you left the stockings with him? - Nobody else.</p>
               <p>Am I to understand by your evidence that in case he had paid you for them you would changed them? - Yes, I did not mean he should have them without paying for them at that time; if they had not suited his friend after I had received the money, I would have changed them for others.</p>

               <p>I am a married woman; I know Mr. Berger; he came to my house, and brought a bundle; I do not recollect the day; the prisoner lodged in my first floor; he was at home at that time; the prosecutor carried the bundle up stairs to the room where Mr. Johnson lodged; he came down, and went out in a little time.</p>
               <p>Had he any bundle with him when he went out? - I cannot say that, in a few minutes after Mr. Johnson went down stairs, and went out; he wished me a good morning.</p>

               <p>Had you known Mr. Berger before? - Never.</p>

               <p>When Johnson went out you saw no bundle in his hand? - No, my servant was at the door; it was about nine in the morning; he wished me a good morning, and crossed the way, and seemed to be rather in haste.</p>

               <p>I live in Green-street, Leicester-fields; I had a few friends in town the day before this happened, we got rather forward in liquor; about twelve in the evening I parted with my friends, and I took a walk up Leicester-fields and met the prisoners, and they asked me to give them a glass of wine; I denied them, and crossed <placeName id="t17870912-95-crimeloc450">Prince's-street</placeName>

               <p>Was you in liquor so much as to be able to know you had it in your pocket? - I saw it to a certainty; I had it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120139"/>You are perfectly satisfied you did not give it to either of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. You had been making merry with your friends? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was pretty far gone in liquor? - I was merry; I am not obliged to tell how many bottles of wine I drank.</p>
               <p>You was intoxicated? - I was not considerably.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you looked at your watch? - I suppose about half an hour.</p>
               <p>You did not call for any assistance? - I had no occasion to call for assistance before I was robbed.</p>
               <p>The first notice you had of your watch being missing, was it being in the watchman's hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it possible that the watch might drop from your pocket? - It never did drop out from my pocket, it did drop from one or the other, but I don't know which.</p>
               <p>Do you take upon yourself to declare upon your oath, that it was impossible, in the situation you was in, that the watch did not drop out of your pocket? - I should think so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where may you live, Sir? - In Green-street.</p>
               <p>Are you master of a house? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Are you a servant? - Neither, Sir, I lodge there.</p>
               <p>A single man I hope? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had been enjoying the whole day with your friends, and enjoyed the evening afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You left your house at twelve? - Thereabouts.</p>
               <p>What hour was it this affair happened? - I believe it was a quarter before one.</p>
               <p>What journey did you take for three quarters of an hour? - I turned up St. Martin's-lane, up Leicester-street, and into Princes-street.</p>
               <p>You ventured all along the Strand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many common women did you speak to there? - I never spoke to any.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - For a certainty.</p>
               <p>Have you never said otherwise? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Where was it you spoke to these people? - They spoke to me, I am sure I did not speak to one woman on my journey; when they stopped me I went upon the step of a door, and they asked if I would go home with them; I told them, I would not; they were close on each side of me; they pressed me to go on the step, I could not very well go from them; they got upon the step as well as me; when I missed the watch, I was more sober than I was before.</p>
               <p>The air sometimes has an effect upon people when they have been drinking? - That's not always the case with me.</p>
               <p>Suppose the watch had fallen on any part of the woman's gown, then it might not have been broken; your only reason for supposing that the watch did not drop out of your pocket, was its not being injured in any part? - My reason is, the watch not being injured.</p>
               <p>Might not the watch have fallen on one of the women's gowns so as not to be injured? - It was impossible for the watch to have fallen out of my pocket without being taken out.</p>
               <p>Tell me your reason for saying so? - I have no other reason but that it is impossible that my watch should go out of my pocket without somebody taking it out.</p>
               <p>Court. In a word, the gentleman means to ask you whether any part of your clothes were in such a situation that the watch might drop out? - No, they were not.</p>
               <p>Had you occasion to pull out your watch in the course of your walk? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did you look at your watch just before you left your house? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Might not you have fixed your watch loosely in your pocket? - My watch could not drop out without taking out; I fixed it as secure as if I was sober, I did not see it laying upon the ground, but I saw the watchman take it up.</p>
               <p>Behind which of the women was the watch taken? - He said behind the black woman.</p>
               <p>What business are you? - I sometimes do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120140"/>business at the stock-exchange, I have a small income of my own.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you a hook to the watch? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose you could by any accident have dropped your watch out of your pocket, could it possibly have dropped where it was found by the watchman? - It could not.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; on the 30th of August as I had just done calling the hour of one, I saw the prosecutor and those two prisoners standing at a door, No. 23, Gerrard street; I thought they had been the family belonging to the house; when I came within a few yards, the gentleman said, watchman, I am robbed of my watch! I asked the gentleman who had robbed him? he said it was one of these women, but which he could not tell; the black woman,

               <p>Where did the watch lay when you picked it up? - Very near the left hand side of the door.</p>
               <p>Did it lay near the prosecutor or near the women? - Near the black woman.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you, from the place in which it lay, that it could or did drop out of the gentleman's pocket? - The watch was about three yards from the gentleman; the two women were between the gentleman and the watch; I took the prisoners to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. What distance was you from them when you first saw them? - Not the length of this Court, only four doors.</p>
               <p>They were very quiet, were they? - I did not hear a word till I came within three yards of them, they stood entirely still, they did not change their position.</p>
               <p>Do you say the watch was near the black woman? - The white woman was standing next the gentleman, and the black was next to her; the gentleman told me he was robbed by one of the women, he could not tell which; he was not very sober, but he was capable of going to the watch-house with me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was the black woman spoke to me, the other said nothing to me as I recollect.</p>

               <p>I am a labouring man, I was in Gerrard-street; when the gentleman said he lost his watch, I stopped till the watchman came up, before he came up, I saw the black woman turn round and stoop down.</p>
               <p>Had the gentleman at that time complained of having lost his watch? - He had; the black woman rose again, and turned round to the parties; when the watchman came up, I told him I had seen the black woman stoop down, but what she laid out of her hand I did not know; I saw the watchman pick up the watch.</p>

               <p>What had he done to displease him? - Nothing that I know of.</p>
               <p>As you are so nearly related to the deceased, be careful what you say; it is your duty to tell the truth, but nothing more: If this man deserves punishment he ought to suffer it, but recollect there are a great many witnesses who were present besides you. - I will tell the truth as near as I can.</p>
               <p>What was the first thing you saw of any dispute between Weston and the deceased? - No other than Mr. Weston began to pull him about; and pull him into the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Was that without any provocation from your husband? - Yes, I saw nothing else; after he had dragged him into the tap-room, one Bolton held me across the stomach and breast, and said damme, if you stir, I will knock you down.</p>

             the landlord was coming from the back room adjoining to the tap-room, some words passed between the deceased and Mr. Weston, the words were, that they were not afraid of each other, after that they came together in the tap-room, and they kept striving to come at each other at the time, but there was a person or two between them.</p>
               <p>Who were they? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Were they striving to fight? - That I cannot tell; they were striving to get together.</p>

               <p>Did they get together in your sight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - Mr. Weston came from the other room, the deceased was in the tap-room, and Mr. Weston was coming from the back parlour at the time, but he was not got into the tap-room at the time, then Mr. Weston came into the tap-room, and they came together in a scuffle.</p>
               <p>Who struck first? - I saw no blow, it was a fall; I saw no blow struck by either of them.</p>
               <p>Did both fall? - Both fell at that time; in recovering again, the landlord seized the deceased again.</p>
               <p>Did they both get up? - Yes; and then Weston threw the deceased again close by the fire-side in the tap-room; the deceased<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120144"/>cried out that his leg was broke; after that, Mr. Weston struck him several blows on the head and the upper part of the body; after that, I went on purpose to fetch a surgeon, after I had fetched him, I went home.</p>

               <p>Were you at this house when this unfortunate affair happened? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening did Cuit the deceased come in? - Between ten and eleven at night; it might be about twenty minutes after ten; he used me very ill, and shoved me about from one part of the kitchen to the other; he asked me if I would be a pint along with him, I said I would have no more beer; one word brought up another, and he said he had a light guinea of mine, I said, whatever you lose by it I will return you the money when you come to my house; he began to fly in a passion, and wanted to fight with me, and more than that, he said, I should not walk along Old-street; he shoved me about from one part of the room to another, and he tried to wring my nose two or three times.</p>
               <p>Where was the landlord at the time? - He came into the kitchen and desired peace; he said he would not have his customers ill used; and said to the deceased, the last time you was in my house, you cheated me of a pint of beer; at that minute in came Mrs. Cuitt; while they were talking about that, one word brought up another, and they began talking about scholarship.</p>
               <p>Had any blows passed before that? - No, Sir, none at all.</p>
               <p>What happened after she came in? - She came in one of her flying airs as she often did in public-houses, and began black-guarding me, and he immediately began upon the landlord and knocked him down with his head upon the fender; he hit him just in the jaws and cut his lip.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was that the first blow struck? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that is the truth upon the oath you have taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was present beside Cuit's wife? - There was a man and his wife in the room, but I never saw them before or since.</p>
               <p>Was it the man and his wife that were examined before the coroner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any body present besides them? - Not in that room, the other room door stood open; I had got my bricklayers and labourers in the tap room at the time.</p>
               <p>Then there was nobody in the room at the time but you, Holt and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Cuit, and the landlord? - No, that was all.</p>
               <p>After he had knocked the landlord down, what passed? - He got up and went to put Cuit out of the door, and both Cuit and his wife laid hold of him, she laid hold of him by the hair of his head and held him down, while he beat him, and Cuitt struck him while she was holding him by the hair.</p>
               <p>What happened afterwards? - Then they got entangled together, till they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120145"/>came into the tap-room, and there they engaged themselves together, and entangled themselves together; I cannot say who was liablest to fall, but Cuit happened to fall undermost, after they both met together, they entangled one with the other, and Cuit happened to fall, and he said, his leg was broke; I believe it was an old wound; Weston ordered a chair to be fetched for him.</p>
               <p>It turned out in fact, that his leg was broke? - Yes, Sir, he was sent to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Did the landlord strike him after he was down? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that; can you say that with certainty? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Then he was sent to the hospital? - Yes, there was a coach fetched, but he was carried on a shutter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. If I understand you right, Weston received the first blow? - He did.</p>
               <p>Where was he standing at the time? - About four foot from the fire-place, with his hands in his breeches pockets.</p>
               <p>Then the deceased struck him upon the lip, and knocked him down with his head upon the sender? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After that there was a struggle, and a fall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before the struggle and fall, Mrs. Cuit laid hold of his hair? - Yes, I knew them both well; his wife has slept at my house for fear of his killing her.</p>
               <p>What sort of a man was the deceased? - He was a very quarrelsome man when in liquor; a very quiet man when sober.</p>
               <p>Is Weston quiet or quarrelsome? - I never saw any thing of him, than that of being a quiet man; I would not use his house, if he did not use me civilly; I always pay my men there.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the surgeons of St. Bartholomew's hospital; I remember the deceased being brought to the hospital on the 2d of July, about twenty minutes before one on the Sunday morning; he was brought on a board, and I was desired to look at his leg; I examined him and found a dislocation of the ancle, with a fracture of the small bone; I examined it very minutely, and I told his friends it would be mortal.</p>

               <p>On what did you ground that opinion? - From the nature of the fracture of the small bone; though a dislocation of the ancle is certainly not in itself a mortal accident; a compound dislocation of the ancle is generally a mortal accident.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by that? - Where there is a large fracture beside; the bones we call the tibia &amp; timpana, were broken.</p>
               <p>In what manner was the wound; describe that? - The wound was circular.</p>
               <p>By which bone? - By the tibia.</p>
               <p>That was in consequence of the dislocation? - Yes, it had been so violent as to break the small bone; had it been so as to force the large bone out of its place, it would have been what we call an Astragulus.</p>
               <p>How do you mean, an external wound? - Yes, and being so violent as to force the bone through the flesh and the skin, the bone was quite out.</p>
               <p>Then it forced the large bone out through the flesh and the skin? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You apprehended danger immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From the violence of the accident? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The danger you apprehended was a mortification? - I apprehended that would come on in three or four days.</p>
               <p>Would not amputation prevent that? - I have seen them amputated, but I spoke to Mr. Lock concerning it, and he said he would not do any thing, for he could not save his life.</p>
               <p>When was that? - On the Monday I went for him; he said he would not take off his leg for that it would certainly mortify; as he never saw one but what did.</p>
               <p>Then there are not many instances where the bone and the flesh is shattered and mangled to pieces, which immediate amputation would cure? - Some, my Lord; but in compound dislocation, I never saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120146"/>it; I have seen a good many, but I never saw it in compound dislocation.</p>
               <p>Can you explain at all, why if the part injured is immediately amputated, whether the dislocation in that case makes any difference? - No further than this, an inflammation generally takes hold of the whole system; if amputation is deferred, the stump will probably mortify.</p>
               <p>Did this mortify? - An inflammation came on, and that was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Then the injury done to his leg, was, in fact, the actual occasion of his death? - That I believe, my lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Must not the foot have catched somewhere to have caught this wrench? - I should think most likely it did.</p>
               <p>A dislocation of the ancle, generally produces a fracture of the small bone? - I never saw one without.</p>
               <p>Of course when the bone is out of the socket, the large bone, which you call the tibia, that of course almost always breaks the small bones? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Were there any appearances of an old wound on his leg? - No.</p>
               <p>A dislocation when once set, leaves no mark? - No.</p>

               <p>Did they put you out of the door? - Yes, after that.</p>
               <p>Had you any acquaintance with either of them before; I never saw any of them to my knowledge; I was quite a stranger; I staid out some few minutes, and some people knocked at the door, and then I went in again.</p>

               <p>Do you remember Cuit's coming in there? - I was present at the time he came in.</p>

               <p>Had Weston struck him at all? - No, not at this time; then the woman came in at the time Weston was down, and caught hold of his hair, and the deceased struck him; then they both fell down together; then they were parted, and the woman was taken away; then he was very much in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120147"/>liquor, and went into the front room, and they both fell down together, and he cried out his leg was broke, and there was assistance got immediately.</p>
               <p>Now, did the landlord strike him when he was down? - I never saw him strike him when he was down; I must have seen it if he had.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you say that after the first quarrel, Cuit struck Weston, and the woman laid hold of him by the hair? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then they were parted and went into the tap-room? - They were parted, and then this man was very much in liquor, and he got hold of Mr. Weston.</p>
               <p>Who laid hold first in the tap-room? - Mr. Cuit.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am sure he took hold of him first in the tap-room.</p>

               <p>Have you ever promised this man any favor, if he would make a confession? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Have you ever threatened to punish him if he would not confess? - No, I have said, whoever had the ring, had better give it to me at once.</p>
               <p>By that you gave him to understand you would be milder, if he confessed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the ring since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not in the state in which you lost it, I believe? - No.</p>
               <p>Who produced it to you? - Mr. Phillips the Jew.</p>
               <p>- ALDUS sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What are you? - I am a pawnbroker; I live in Berwick-street, Soho; the first time I saw the prisoner at the bar, was, on the 8th of June; he came to my shop in the day-time with a ring, and said, he wanted half-a-guinea upon it.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - Very genteelly.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - I cannot tell exactly.</p>
               <p>Was not he dressed in livery? - I do not know; he said he wanted half-a-guinea upon it; I saw it was a ring of value; and I said how came you by it? he said, my name is Grant; and I keep a house in Tornstile, Holborn; there was another man with him; and he said, you need not have any hesitation about it, it is Mr. Grant's ring.</p>
               <p>So he said he wanted no more than half-a-guinea upon it? - Yes, and he said he lived at No. 1, Turnstile, Holborn; seeing it a ring of value, I desired my servant to write a duplicate, which he did; he took the half guinea, and I ordered my servant to go with him, and see that he lived there, and kept the house, and that his name was Grant; he did go with him, and he came back again, and said his name was Grant, and that he kept a tobacconist's shop there.</p>
               <p>The ring is a ruby, set round with diamonds, is it not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now what is the worth of it? - It is not worth more than four guineas.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, is it worth less than ninety guineas, and will you venture to swear that it was of less value than ninety guineas at the time it was brought to you? - Upon my oath I did not think it worth ten.</p>
               <p>Then upon your oath, will you swear that at the time it was brought to you, it was of less value to sell in a silversmith's shop, and of less value in workmanship than ninety guineas? - I do swear that.</p>
               <p>Court. You lent only half a guinea upon it? - No, I thought it was a garnet set round with diamonds; it had very much the appearance of a garnet, set round with bad diamonds; this was on the 8th; on the 22d, the second time I saw the ring, my servant was selling of it to Mr. Jacobs; it then was my own.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present? - No, my man will inform you it was sold to Mr. Jacobs for six guineas; I saw it sold; it was marked at the window for six guineas.</p>
               <p>How came you to mark it at the window for six guineas? - My servant will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120149"/>tell you; he will inform you that the prisoner sold it to him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Had you bought it? - My man bought it.</p>
               <p>Did it hang at your window marked? - It was marked at the window six guineas; it had been bought of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How long had it hung at the window marked six guineas? - No more than part of the day.</p>
               <p>Had it been marked before that day? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you first discover it was marked six guineas? - The day it was bought.</p>
               <p>Then you knew that the same morning it was marked six guineas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath, after this man went out of the shop, did you not call him back again, and press him to sell it? - I never saw him, till I saw him with the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Then it was bought without your knowledge? - It was.</p>
               <p>You had given no directions to your man to give four guineas for the ring if he should come? - No.</p>
               <p>You had never consulted together about it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then he gave the four guineas for it without consulting you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And afterwards marked it six guineas without consulting you likewise? - Yes; I was not at home at the time he bought it.</p>
               <p>Is it usual in the course of your trade to let your servant buy a thing that has been pledged without more enquiry, and then six a price upon it without consulting you? - It is done.</p>
               <p>Is that the course of your dealing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long has he lived with you? - He has lived with me above ten years, and I have lived there above twenty.</p>
               <p>Is the course of your dealing, when a man pledges something for half a guinea, that your servant is authorised to buy it for four guineas, and afterwards to put any other price he pleases upon it, and put it into the window to sell? - It happens frequently.</p>
               <p>Then it happens frequently that when a thing is pledged for a small sum, your servant afterwards buys it for a larger price, and without consulting you, puts a price upon it, and hangs it at the window to sell? - It does happen.</p>
               <p>Does it happen frequently? - It does happen, but I do not recollect such a thing these three or four years.</p>
               <p>Has it ever happened since this man lived with you? - Yes, he has bought things.</p>
               <p>Has he bought things pledged for a small sum, and afterwards put any price he pleased upon it without consulting you? - It has been done.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it the course of your dealing? - It is the course of the trade.</p>
               <p>Tell me whether this is the course of your dealing? - I come here to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>My question to you is, Is the course of your dealing in your shop, that when an article is pledged for a small sum at your shop, it is afterwards bought by your servant, and a price put upon it without consulting you? - It is done.</p>
               <p>Is that the course of your dealing? - It is the course of the trade, but it does not happen very frequently.</p>
               <p>You have said, you do not recollect an instance of the kind within the last three years; now will you venture to swear that there has been an instance of the kind within that time; will you swear that? - No, I will not; things have been pledged, and bought afterwards very frequently.</p>
               <p>Has such a thing been bought by your servant, and afterwards sold without consulting you? - Yes, he has.</p>
               <p>He has, then, without consulting you how much profit he ought to put upon it, put any price he pleased upon it? - It has been done, and is done commonly in business; I presume Mr. Heather does so.</p>
               <p>Is it done in your shop? - It is of course, but we do not do it now.</p>
               <p>This is but two months ago, recollect a little? - There is an act of parliament<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120150"/>lately passed, which says, that all things unredeemed of the value of above ten shillings, shall be sold by auction.</p>
               <p>Is not this a single instance within the last three years? - We have bought things, but never any thing of the value of above ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Recollect an instance now; it does not often happen where a diamond ring was treated in the same way? - I have not bought a diamond ring, nor my man for some time.</p>
               <p>Then you have not bought a diamond ring for a long time past except this? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Has he ever brought a diamond ring in his life? - I do not recollect he has; all the articles of above ten shillings have gone to the auction for the last year.</p>
               <p>Why did not that go to the auction? - It had not been pawned long enough, you observe that is after the twelvemonth is expired.</p>
               <p>Then for the last year you have not bought a dimond ring? - I do not recollect that I have; I am no great judge of them.</p>
               <p>Has your man ever bought one before? - I do not recollect he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did you sell it to? - Mr. Jacobs.</p>
               <p>That day you bought it? - That very day; I did not buy it, I sold it the same day for six guineas; I thought it to be a garnet ring.</p>
               <p>How much did your servant give for it? - Four guineas.</p>
               <p>Did you know he gave four guineas? - I was not there when it was bought.</p>
               <p>Give me an answer, yes or no; did you know before it was marked six guineas, and put up in your window for sale, that your servant gave four guineas for it? - I had seen it by the books, and he told me so, but I had not seen the books before.</p>
               <p>When did it come to your knowledge then that it was bought for four guineas? - I was come home, and it was while Jacobs was buying it, that was the first time I saw it after it was bought.</p>
               <p>I understood you had seen it up in the shop, and seen it marked for six guineas? - I saw the paper upon it.</p>
               <p>Before Mr. Jacobs came into the shop? - Not before, but at the same time.</p>
               <p>When did you see the mark first upon the ring? - I came in, and Mr. Jacobs was then in the shop bargaining for it; I was in the parlour, and my man came in to me, and says this ring Mr. Jacobs offers six guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Before that moment that your man came in to you, and told you this, did you know that six guineas was marked upon the ring? - I went into the shop, and saw the paper on it.</p>
               <p>I will have an answer to the question; and I will not quit you till you give me a direct answer; before your man came into the parlour to you to tell you that Jacobs had offered six guineas for the ring, did you know that six guineas was marked upon that as the price of it? - I did not know that before then, because I went into the shop, and saw the paper that came off it.</p>
               <p>Did you know before that moment that four guineas was given for the ring? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you think it worth six guineas? - I did not, but I asked six guineas for it.</p>
               <p>What did you think it worth at the time? - I thought it was not worth above five guineas, or some where there away.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do you mean to tell me that you thought it was not worth above five guineas? - I thought six guineas was a very good price for it.</p>
               <p>Did you think it worth six guineas? - I thought it was a pretty looking ring; I thought it was a garnet, set round with brilliants.</p>
               <p>Did you think it worth six guineas? - If he had offered me five, I should have taken it.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it worth six guineas upon your oath? - Upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell me just now, that you did not think it was worth more than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120151"/>ten pounds? - I do not recollect saying that.</p>

               <p>But you did say so; now tell me what you meant by saying that you did not think it was worth more than ten pounds; you said you did not think at the time it was worth more than ten pounds, what did you mean by giving that answer? - I thought it to be a garnet; I did not think it was worth ten pounds; I did not think it was worth six, and I would have sold it for five.</p>
               <p>You said it was not worth more than ten pounds; I asked you this upon your oath, was not this ring worth ninety guineas, upon which you answered that you did not think it was worth more than ten pounds? - It was not worth ten pounds; I did not think it was worth five.</p>
               <p>Was not you surprized that Jacobs would give you six guineas for it? - No.</p>
               <p>What occasion had your man to come, and ask you any questions about this ring, or the price, if Mr. Jacobs offered as much as was marked upon it; six guineas was marked upon it; he had no occasion to consult you if Jacobs offered as much as was marked? - He offered five guineas first, then five guineas and a half, and he came in to tell me.</p>
               <p>My question to you is this, if Jacobs offered what was marked, what occasion had your man to come in to tell you; why did he not sell it without coming in to tell you any thing about it? - He offered five guineas and a half, and he came in to ask me if he should take less than six; Mr. Jacobs said it is a venture whether I get a guinea or lose a guinea, and I will give you six.</p>
               <p>As he had worked himself up to give the six guineas, he had no occasion to tell you that? - I was there then; then I went into the shop.</p>
               <p>Did not you say just now that your servant came in to you in the back parlour, and said, Sir, Mr. Jacobs has offered six guineas for this ring, and that was the first time you knew it to be marked six guineas, and the first time you knew any thing about it? - You misunderstood me.</p>
               <p>Did you say so or not? - No answer.</p>
               <p>Did you say so in course of your evidence or not, that the first time you knew of its being bought for four guineas, or being sold for six, was when your servant came in to the parlour to you, and said, Sir, Mr. Jacobs has offered six guineas for this ring? - That was not the first thing he said, he said he has given six guineas for it.</p>
               <p>What was the first thing he said when he came into the parlour? - I am sure I told you exactly.</p>
               <p>Tell it again, a man can always tell the true story? - I have been in this Court before, and I have had the thanks of this Court many times.</p>
               <p>But you will no have them now, I assure you; my question is, what was the first thing that your servant said when he came into the parlour? - I think the first thing he said when he came in, was, that Jacobs had given six guineas for the ring; Jacobs was in the shop bargaining for the ring, and I was called out; he said Jacobs had offered five guineas, or five guineas and a half, but that he had agreed to give six guineas; then I went into the shop, and saw the mark upon the counter.</p>
               <p>Court. Did your servant consult you before he told you the ring was sold? - No, my Lord, that is the first I heard about it.</p>
               <p>Then you knew nothing about it, till he told you he had actually sold it to Jacobs? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the first thing you heard from your servant about Jacobs was, that he had sold him the ring for six guineas? - Yes, that was the fact, that Jacobs had given six guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Was Jacobs gone out of the shop at the time? - No, I do not think he was, perhaps we were all three in conversation together.</p>
               <p>Did you see Jacobs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then Jacobs was not gone out of the shop; because you say the first thing you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120152"/>heard was, that he had given him six guineas for the ring? - I believe that was the first.</p>
               <p>Was Jacobs gone out of the shop? - When he came to tell me so he was.</p>
               <p>Did you see Jacobs? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see Jacobs after your servant told you so? - No.</p>
               <p>What did not you know it before? - He said Jacobs was in the shop looking at the ring; I went into the shop, and saw the mark upon the counter six guineas, and Jacobs looking at it, and Jacobs said five guineas, or five guineas and a half was sufficient; I was very busy with other people in the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to Jacobs about it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know Mr. Jacobs before? - Yes, he has dealt with me very often; he has dealt with every one in the trade I believe.</p>
               <p>Has he dealt with you often? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How lately? - I cannot recollect; it is his trade.</p>
               <p>It was very lucky that he should come by just at that nick of time? - Somebody else would have had if it he had not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Jacobs sell it afterwards? - I never saw it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear afterwards that Jacobs sold it, and to whom? - I heard no more of it till the 21st of July when Mr. Hyde sent word about it, Mr. Hyde asked me if such a thing had not passed through my hands, and I told him that I had had it from Mr. Grant.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath, did not you send to Jacobs to buy this ring? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that it was not worth above five or six guineas? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that Jacobs sold it for fifteen? - I heard so when the prisoner was taken up, never before.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you know enough of this ring to be able to tell me what is the value of it? - I believe it is worth ninety guineas.</p>
               <p>Did you buy it yourself? - No, it was given to me by Sir

            's lady.</p>
               <p>Have you been at the East-Indies? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the value of diamonds? - I have had a great many in my possession.</p>
               <p>What is the lowest value you conceive can be put upon this ring? - The Queen's jeweller is here, and he will tell you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Aldus. Do you mean to swear positively, that after this man had pledged this ring, he was not called back, and told that it would be better for him to sell it? - I do swear that I never heard any such thing pass.</p>
               <p>Court. When you really got six guineas for that which you had on that day received for four, had you no suspicion that the ring was stolen? - No.</p>
               <p>Not when you got six guineas for a ring for which you had given only four, and which had been in your custody but a single day, and from a passer by merely looking at it in your shop, and being willing to give six guineas, had you no suspicion it was stole? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Do you expect the Jury to believe that? I had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to the prisoner as being the man that sold this ring? - That is the man, I described him at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did he keep a house? - He had a house unknown to me in Turnstile, Holborn, when I took him; I never knew any thing but that he was a single man till three months afterwards.</p>
               <p>Aldus. He had his name on the door.</p>
               <p>Did you know that he kept a shop before you missed the ring? - No, nor did I know he was married man, and had a house.</p>
               <p>- CROUCH sworn.</p>
               <p>(Examined by Mr. Garrow.)</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am servant to Mr. Aldus.</p>
               <p>When did you first see the prisoner at the bar? - On the 8th of June.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120153"/>On what occasion? - In the afternoon, he came in with another man to pawn a ring for half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Was your master in the way? - He was in the shop; I took the ring of him first, and asked him if he knew the value of it; he said it was a ring of value, but he wanted only half a guinea upon it; at the same time my master came up, and looked at the ring, and he desired me to write a ticket for half a guinea, and to go home with the prisoner, and see where he lived; he gave me a direction at No. 1, Turnstile, Holborn, a tobacconist's shop; accordingly I wrote a ticket, and went with him, and seeing his name on the door, I gave him the ticket, and the half guinea; I knew it was his house by his calling his wife out, and asking her if some people had been there, which I cannot recollect; seeing me come in, she asked me to come in, and drink tea, which I refused.</p>
               <p>Court. Who asked you that? - His wife I suppose.</p>
               <p>Is there any reason besides that, why you suppose he kept the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon that you gave him the duplicate, and away you went? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it very odd that a man who kept a shop in Turnstile, Holborn, should come as far as Berwick-street, to borrow money, and then suffer a pawnbroker's servant to go back with him to his house, did not you think it strange? - If we have any doubt of any body we do it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you had a suspicion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If you have a suspicion, you go home with the party? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now if I was to come to your shop to pledge a diamond ring, should you want to go home with me? - Not if I knew you I should not; if I did not know you, probably I should.</p>
               <p>Did you suspect this man? - No further than to go home to see that it was right.</p>
               <p>What made you suspect him? - I had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>Then why did you go home with him? To see that the direction was right.</p>
               <p>What if you did not suspect him, you might have taken his word you know; do you walk home with every body that comes with a half guinea pledge? - If they are things of value.</p>
               <p>Then its being a thing of value, made you suspect him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What value did it appear to be of? - I thought it was worth four guineas and a half, or five guineas.</p>
               <p>Had you gone home with any body in the course of that week? - I cannot say, most likely I had.</p>
               <p>Tell me whether that happened or not? - I dare say I have.</p>
               <p>So he left the ring for the half guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon did you see him again? - On the 22d of June.</p>
               <p>How was Grant dressed at the time he came to pledge the ring? - Just as he is now; he had on a jacket I believe.</p>
               <p>Was there nothing else remarkable in his dress? - He was just as he is now.</p>
               <p>Had not he a laced hat on, with a cockade in it? - I believe he had.</p>
               <p>A round hat trimned with lace, and a cockade in it? - I believe he had.</p>
               <p>He had a jacket on too? - I believe he had.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was not it a riding jacket? - It was made in the same way I believe.</p>
               <p>Go and look at it? - I do not think it was so long.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see he was a servant? - I supposed he was.</p>
               <p>Then let me ask you this question, did you ask him to whom he was servant? - No.</p>
               <p>Why did not you? - I thought it was not necessary as he kept the house.</p>
               <p>A servant bringing a diamond ring of value, the first thing you ought to have asked, was to whom he was servant? - I did not think the ring of any such value, as it turned out to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120154"/>You said before you thought it to be a ring of value? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If you thought it to be a ring of value, and believed him to be a servant, why did not you ask him to whom he was servant? - I took every precaution I could.</p>
               <p>There cannot be a doubt, but that the most obvious precaution was the moment that you saw he was a servant, to have asked him to whom he was servant? - Servants have very often very costly things, and it did not occur to me.</p>
               <p>Servants do not usually wear diamond rings? - He said it was his own, and that he had it with his wife when he married her.</p>
               <p>Court. You said that he told you that his wife kept a shop there, and that he went there? - Yes, he told me that in the hearing of my master.</p>
               <p>Why did not you say then, you have two directions, and you live somewhere in service with somebody else, did not ask that? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you not say; pray Sir where do you live besides? - I went home to see where he lived.</p>
               <p>Why did not you ask him who he was livery-servant to? - I thought he was a livery-servant out of place.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath, did not the man tell you not to tell his wife of it? - No, Sir, he did not; when I was going home with him, he said three or four young women were come out of the country to see him, and he desired I would not expose him to the young women, as he did not wish them to know he had pledged the ring.</p>
               <p>Did not he desire you not to say any thing about it in the hearing of his wife? - No.</p>
               <p>How came he then to have a laced hat and a cockade on, if he was a livery servant out of place? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tell you he was out of place? - No, he said he only slept at home; and I thought if that was his house, it was his own ring.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to tell the Jury that you thought it was probable that a servant should have such a ring as that? - I certainly do; I thought it had been his wife's.</p>
               <p>Jury. He has laid great stress upon his caution; I would wish to know if it is usual to send a person home? - We very often do.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner again? - On the 22d of June.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you seen Mr. Jacobs in the mean time? - Often; Jacobs called almost every day; these Jews that deal in these kind of things, go their round very often, and come and ask if there is any thing that suits them.</p>
               <p>They don't look about at the windows? - Yes, they look at the windows, almost always.</p>
               <p>How lately before had you seen Jacobs before you bought this ring? - I might see him that very day; may be not for a week.</p>
               <p>After this pledge had been sold to you, how often did you see Jacobs? - May be every day.</p>
               <p>How often? - I cannot pretend to swear that.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you see him on the 20th? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>On the 21st? - I cannot say; if I did, he did not see the ring.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was he not there on the 21st? - No, Sir, he was not; I have got the receipt for the ring in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Let us look at the receipt; was not Jacobs there on the 21st? - Not to my knowledge; he might be, very likely; he generally calls every day.</p>
               <p>You are sure you had not shewn him the ring? - No.</p>
               <p>On the 22d the prisoner sold it to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What passed? - He came and fetched it out of pledge.</p>
               <p>Court. What time of the day did he come? - Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>What did he do when he came? - He came and fetched it out of pledge.</p>
               <p>What did he say, who saw him? - I.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120155"/>Was any body present besides you? - One of our men.</p>
               <p>Was your master? - No, he was out; he came in about half an hour after it was fetched out.</p>
               <p>Court. What did the man say when he came in? - He gave me the duplicate my Lord, and I went and fetched the ring, and he paid the principal and interest.</p>
               <p>Out of his pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much did the principal and interest amount to? - The principal was half-a guinea, and the interest two-pence, or twopence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>After he had paid the principal and interest you gave him the ring? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What passed next? - He asked me if I would buy it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Without any thing more being said by you? - Yes; on which I asked him how much he asked for it; and he said six guineas; and I offered him four pounds for it, as I thought the diamonds were not worth above four pounds, or four pounds and a half, or five pounds.</p>
               <p>How much did you allow for the ruby and the gold? - I did not know it was a ruby; I offered four pounds; he said, he would not take it, and he was going out of the shop, and I offered him four guineas.</p>
               <p>He went out of the shop and returned again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who called him back? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Then he came back of his own accord? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Without being called or beckoned by you or any body? - Yes, he came back and said he would take five pounds for it; but he begged I would keep it an hour after I had bought it, in order that he might see whether he liked to have it back.</p>
               <p>Then you agreed for it and bought it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much did you give for it? - Four guineas.</p>
               <p>You wrote a receipt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is this the usual way of writing receipts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>"Being my own property;" is it usual to state it to; do you always put that in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he left it with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now what did you do with it? - I kept it some time, and then marked it, and put it up in the window for sale.</p>
               <p>How long did you keep it first? - I suppose an hour, or an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>What mark did you put upon it? - Six pounds six shillings.</p>
               <p>Did your master come home first? - He did not come home till after I had marked it, and was going to sell it to Jacobs.</p>
               <p>How long was that before your master came home, and after it was marked? - It might be an hour or two, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What time of the day did Jacobs come? Between one and two.</p>
               <p>What happened between you and Jacobs? - My master was in the back parlour when Jacobs came in, and asked me to let him look at the ring that lay in the window.</p>
               <p>Had you told your master that you had bought it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you told him that you had marked it for sale? - No; Jacobs offered five guineas for it; I told him I could not take less than six guineas; at that time my master came out of the parlour, he heard me bargaining with Jacobs, and he came out himself.</p>
               <p>Now when he came out, what did he say to Jacobs? - He looked at it, and Jacobs said he would have it at that price.</p>
               <p>That was all that passed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When Jacobs first came in, your master was in the back parlour? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>He came out seeing you dealing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were then behind the counter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never left the counter with the ring? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You staid there shewing it to Jacobs? - I was serving other people as well.</p>
               <p>Then Jacobs was never in the back parlour with your master about the ring? - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120156"/>went into the back parlour to my master, just after Jacobs had bought the ring; I forgot that.</p>
               <p>How came you to forget that little circumstance; for what occasion did you go into the parlour? - To call him out to look at the ring.</p>
               <p>Then your master came out and Jacobs gave six guineas for it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to put this in the window without consulting your master, and to put six guineas upon it as the price? - When we buy a thing, we always do so; it is the course of the trade.</p>
               <p>How many diamonds have you marked in the course of the year? - Many-a-one; I bought diamond rings in the same way, in the last year; I do not say large ones, but small ones.</p>

               <p>Court. Has your master never known you have marked those diamond rings afterwards? - Yes, when they are sold.</p>
               <p>Then you sold them too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But your master has known it after they are sold of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What value of diamond rings may you have bought in the course of the last twelve months; how much have you laid out in diamond rings? - I cannot pretend to say; not to a very large amount, smaller or greater; I suppose to the value of ten pounds; if you please, I will fetch the book.</p>
               <p>Court. Could we have the book, are you sure that the number of rings you have sold are in that book? - Yes; we have a bought, and a sold book; but I cannot tell exactly when the last begun; it began, I believe about four or five months ago.</p>
               <p>Count to Aldus. Give a note, that all your books of bought and sold plate, and other things for the last three years, may be brought here for the inspection of the Court and Jury.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Aldus did so; but the books did not arrive till after the trial was over, and therefore they were not looked at.)</p>
               <p>Now Mr. Crouch, you see we have got to this, that within this last twelve months, you have bought diamond rings to the amount of about ten pounds? - In the shop; not me alone.</p>
               <p>I want to know during the last three years, how many diamond rings you may have bought, and in the absence of your master? - I do not know that before the last twelve-month I bought any.</p>
               <p>Court. How many have you bought during the last twelve-month? - May-be five or six pounds worth, may-be three or four.</p>
               <p>Have you bought any? - I bought one last week.</p>
               <p>How many had you bought before this thing happened? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>I ask you how many you yourself bought and sold without your master's knowledge? - I may have bought, three, four, or five.</p>
               <p>Before you bought this of the prisoner? - With that.</p>
               <p>How many had you bought before that of the prisoner? - Two or three.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you have bought any? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you have bought one? I believe I have.</p>
               <p>How many have you bought? - I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you have bought any since this? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you bought any before you bought this? - Most likely I have, but I cannot identify the man.</p>
               <p>You swore readily enough just now; take care what you say; you are now very near being committed for perjury? - We have bought many diamond rings, and marked them for sale within the last year, and sold them without consulting my master, but he has been consulted afterwards, and the other man has bought other things.</p>
               <p>Then you have bought some? - I have bought one last week.</p>
               <p>Now between the 8th of June 1786, and the 8th of June 1787, how many diamond rings have you bought without the knowledge of your master? - I cannot recollect that; I and the other man have bought rings.</p>
               <p>Now hear; will you swear, that you and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120157"/>the other man in the absence of your master, have bought any diamond rings, between the 8th day of June 1786, and the 8th day of June 1787? - I may have bought one; I cannot recollect; I shall see when the book comes.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you mean by saying we have bought many diamond rings, and marked them for sale within the last year? - When we buy them we always marked them.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you and the other man, or either of you, in the last twelvemonth, from June 1786, to June 1787, bought any diamond rings in the absence of your master? - I cannot recollect; your Lordship will see the book.</p>
               <p>Court. You have told the Court and the Jury you have bought many diamond rings, and marked them for sale, and sold them, without consulting your master, that is to account for your so doing; now, I tell you fairly, if you have not so done, I shall commit you for perjury; let us know whether you have done so or not? - I have told you every thing I recollect.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you recollect that you have not bought any diamond rings in the absence of your master? - No Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>And that this is the first you ever bought? - I think it is not.</p>
               <p>When you buy them you always take a receipt? - We always set that down in the book.</p>
               <p>Don't you take a receipt? - Always.</p>
               <p>Have you ever took a receipt for a diamond ring in the absence of your master? - Never but once since; small spark rings I have bought.</p>
               <p>I ask you between the 8th of June 1786, and the 8th of June 1787, have you bought diamond rings of any sort, little or large? - I have bought stone rings.</p>
               <p>Have you bought diamond rings? - I cannot recollect I have.</p>
               <p>Have you ever bought any diamond rings of any body besides this man? - It is impossible to recollect.</p>
               <p>Can't you recollect whether you ever bought one in your whole life before this? - I think I have.</p>
               <p>You said just now, that you had bought a great many in the course of the last year, to the amount of about ten pounds? - In the course of business I have bought a great many diamond rings.</p>
               <p>Rings that have been pawned? - Very seldom.</p>
               <p>Have you bought them without the knowledge of your master? - Many things we buy I don't recollect, as to the diamond rings, I may not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you ever bought and sold any without the knowledge of your master? - I don't know that I have.</p>
               <p>Have you ever bought any in the whole course of your life till you bought this? - I cannot recollect: Yes, I have bought some, but you confound me so much that I am not able to give you an answer.</p>
               <p>I ask you, Sir, and I will not confound you; upon your oath, did you ever buy, a diamond ring in your life before the 8th of June 1787? - I cannot recollect, I think I have.</p>
               <p>Will you have that taken down as your answer; you are not confused now? - I think I have.</p>
               <p>You said just now that you could not recollect you ever had; but when you saw my Lord astonished, you said, yes I have, which is the answer? - I think I have.</p>
               <p>How lately? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>You said you never bought any till within this twelvemonth, between June 1786 and June 1787; have you ever bought a diamond ring? - I cannot recollect, I think I have.</p>
               <p>If you have bought any, how many do think you have bought? - Not many.</p>
               <p>You must recollect it, if it is a single transaction? - I cannot recollect it; I have taken many in pledges.</p>
               <p>Have you ever sold any without consulting your master? - I have sold many diamonds.</p>
               <p>Did you ever mark one? - Yes, such as come back from the sale.</p>
               <p>Without consulting your master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120158"/>But you have sold a great many? - Some.</p>
               <p>How many within the last twelvemonth? - I cannot recollect that.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, has there been a single diamond ring bought in your shop by any body during the last twelvemonth? - I think there has.</p>
               <p>Between the 8th day of June 1786, and the 8th day of June 1787, has there been on diamond ring bought by any body in your master's shop? - I think there has, but I cannot swear it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear you think you have? - I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Upon the oath you have taken, has there been a single diamond ring bought by any body in your master's shop between June 1786, and June 1787? - At the sale there has.</p>
               <p>Have you bought any in the shop? - I cannot recollect; we have several diamond rings now lying in the window of my making.</p>
               <p>Court. You say that there have been diamond rings bought and sold between the 8th of June 1786, and the 8th day of June 1787, you seem to speak doubtfully; then if you speak doubtfully, I want to know why you answered that gentleman so positively and readily this,</p>
               <p>"we have bought many diamond rings and marked them for sale within the last year;" why did you in the former part of your examination swear to it so positively and readily, and now have a doubt about it? - I said, I think I have.</p>
               <p>No; you said we have bought many diamond rings and marked them for sale within the last year, and referred to the books to prove it; now, another thing you have told me in your examination, that you told the Jew you would not take less than six guineas? - Yes, I told him so.</p>
               <p>That was the same day you bought it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You told me before that you thought it was of the value of four guineas, or four guineas and a half? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, if you thought four guineas was the value of the ring, and you had told the Jew that you would not take less than six, and the Jew thought it worth six, did it not immediately enter into your head that the ring must have been come unfairly by; - No, my Lord, it did not indeed.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, did you really believe that the man kept a shop? - Yes, my Lord, I did.</p>
               <p>Could he write? - No.</p>
               <p>Then if the man could not write, could you possibly believe that a man wearing a livery hat and cockade really kept a shop? - His name was on the door.</p>
               <p>Have you ever taken any thing of this man, before or since? - A pair of sheets, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Have you any thing in pledge belonging to him now? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Have you ever taken any linen of him? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear you have never taken any shirts of him? - To the best of my knowledge I have not.</p>
               <p>Court. The books are coming, therefore I caution you to be on your guard.</p>
               <p>Whether before the 8th of June, 1787, you ever took any thing of that man in pawn? - No, I did not, nor know his person.</p>

               <p>(Examined by Mr. Garrow.)</p>
               <p>You deal in jewels, I understand? - I do.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time buy a ring of Mr. Aldus? - I happened to pass Mr. Aldus's door on the 22d of June, and happened to look into the window, and there laid that there diamond ring that I bought.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the ring before? - No; seeing it in the window, I went in and asked the price; the price was marked on it, six guineas, and he said he could take no less, and after a long to do, I gave him six guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Who treated with you about it? - Mr. Crouch.</p>
               <p>What did you do with it? - I sold it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120159"/>Mr. Phillips for fifteen guineas; I sold it the Monday following; it happened to be a ruby; I am no great judge of these things, and I went to look for Mr. Phillips at the Orange coffee-house; he was there; I asked him if it was a ruby, he said yes; what is it worth? says I; says he I will give you ten guineas for it; says I, if you offer me ten guineas for it, it is worth more; finding I would not take it, he wanted to go half profits with me, but I refused that; then, says he, whatever you are offered by any body else, let me know, and I will give it to you; and I told him he should have it.</p>
               <p>Was this the same day you bought it? - I went to Mr. Phillips in about half an hour or an hour after I had bought it, but I did not sell it to him till the Monday.</p>
               <p>You heard from Phillips, the moment he saw it, that it was worth ten guineas? - He told me it was a ruby of great value.</p>
               <p>A little suspicion came into your head? - Yes, it was a suspicion that it was a ruby.</p>
               <p>But a little more suspicion I mean? - Did not you suspect that it was stolen goods? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You thought you had bought a very good bargain? - That is no rule; these things turn out cheaper or dearer; I did not buy it for a ruby, I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>You have been long acquainted with Mr. Aldus? - I am acquainted with all the trade.</p>
               <p>How much did you receive of Phillips at last? - Fifteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Did you know at any time that Mr. Aldus had any part of that fifteen guineas? - No.</p>

               <p>You have kept it all to yourself? - Yes; I have a large family to maintain, he never received any part of the fifteen guineas, no more than what I bought it for.</p>
               <p>You paid the money directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Aldus upon the occasion? - Crouch went to ask his master if he would take the six guineas.</p>
               <p>Did Aldus see you at all? - I don't know whether he did or no, I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>You had some share in this good bargain? - I had.</p>
               <p>You bought this ring of Jacobs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is this the same ring you had of Jacobs? - Yes; it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>When did you buy it? - On the 22d of June; I was sitting in the Prince of Orange coffee-house when Mr. Jacobs came in and said, I have bought a ring just now, and I want your opinion upon it, whether it is a garnet or a ruby; I looked at it, and says I, it is a ruby, you may depend upon it, what did you give for it says I, says he, I have given six guineas; then says I, I will give you ten, says he, I am much obliged to you, but I do not want to sell it now, if you would give me twenty; then says I, if you have a mind to sell it, I will give you ten, and you shall go half profits with me, what it fetches; he said he would not take it, but he would give me the preference, in case he sold it; then, says I, all I beg is this, that you will let me have the preference, whatever any body offers you I will give a like price; this was on the Friday; he promised to give me an answer on the Monday following, at twelve; on the Monday he came according to his promise, and said he had been offered fifteen guineas; upon which I agreed to give him that sum, and bought it.</p>
               <p>Is not it a very capital ruby? - It is not, if it was, it might be worth three hundred or four hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>How much is it worth altogether? - Not thirty pounds; I have shewn it to the king's jeweller; I have shewn it to Mr. Rundell, and he would not give me thirty pounds for it; it may fetch forty pounds, but I would not give it.</p>
               <p>What are the diamonds worth? - Not above four guineas, or thereabouts.</p>

               <p>Court to the prosecutor. How did you find out where the ring was? - I desired Mr. Mason, silversmith in the Strand, to advertise it; and immediately afterwards, a gentleman came to Mr. Mason, and said he had seen such a ring.</p>
               <p>Look at that ring, and tell me whether you believe it to be your ring? - I have no doubt about it; it was a ruby of that sort and size, and set in that manner.</p>

               <p>I was going to Chelsea to see two children at nurse, and I was seized exceedingly ill; I had lately come out of a fit of illness; I went into the house, and there I saw a woman; I asked her if she would let me go backwards into the yard; I think she said she belonged to the house; she told me, yes; when I came back, she had a bundle in her lap, and she told me she was going to move to the next street; she asked me to assist her to take the things, which I agreed to, and she put them into my lap; I went as far as the door, and there I stopped a bit; the woman I missed; and while I was beating about for her, a child came up to me and stopped me; I was not off the threshold of the door, before I missed the woman; and immediately the child came up to me, and said, they were his daddy's boots; the woman gave them to me; she was a lusty, tall woman, with a light coloured gown, and a Bath cloak; the child brought me back, and called another gentleman; I believe, I do not know; I cannot say I recollect the gentleman; the child was at the door, and spoke to me, but I do not recollect the gentleman.</p>

               <p>I keep a house over-right to Mr. Chinnery's; son the 27th of May, I was in my one pair of stairs room, sitting at the window, and I saw the prisoner at the bar go out with a large bundle under his arm.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was this? - It<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120165"/>might be a little before or after six; I saw him go out of Mr. Chinnery's house.</p>
               <p>How large a bundle was it? - It was like as though it was a taylor going to carry his work home; he was dressed in a blue coat with a round hat, and his apron tucked round him.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - I had seen the prisoner at the bar in Pimlott's room with

             that afternoon; Pimlott lodged there; I am very certain the prisoner is the man; Pimlott went out afterwards with another bundle.</p>
               <p>Has he been brought to justice? - Yes; he has been transported, I believe.</p>
               <p>But the prisoner at the bar is the person? - Yes; I hardly took much notice; I thought the people who owed rent to Mr. Chinnery, were getting as much property as they could off; just after, Pimlott came out with another bundle.</p>
               <p>You did not give any information about it? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What distance may your house be from Chinnery's? - My house stands as it were here, and his there.</p>
               <p>Court. You had not seen the prisoner in Chinnery's room, but in another room in the same house, belonging to somebody else? - It belonged to Pimlott, it was up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Is it a street, or a court? - A street.</p>
               <p>How wide? - As wide as from here to there.</p>
               <p>Court to Chinnery. What day of the week was the 27th of May? - Whit-sunday.</p>

             said, Will take care you do not drop my rule; then he tied the bundle up again, and put both into one; and then as he was going away, he asked me to let him leave his bundle, as he said, it did not look well to carry it through the streets of a Sunday; Matthew Lock said, his boxes were coming to the Elephant and Castle, at Newington; in about half an hour they went away, and in about half an hour after that, Matthew came alone; and said, if I pleased he would take his bundle.</p>
               <p>Had you the curiosity to examine the bundle? - I know nothing further; he took his bundle away, and bid me a good night.</p>
               <p>Did you see the rule? - The bundle I never opened; I only heard him say to the other, take care you do not drop my rule.</p>

               <p>Goff. I cannot pretend to say whether it was or was not, he never opened it; he had a blue one on when he was there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How could you see me come out of the house? - Very well, the front door is facing the door up the passage, and my window is fronting Mr. Chinnery's house, so that I could see every one that come out of the one door or the other. Chick-lane is a narrow-lane, and I could easily see.</p>

               <p>Court. How was he dressed? - He had a blue coat on, with a round hat.</p>

               <p>I and the prisoner Pimlott had worked together some years; for a week before the robbery, I had lodged with Pimlott in Chinnery's house, and laid in that room; I had laid all my tools up there, and some wearing apparel; I was up there on Whitsunday in the morning, and we was drinking together, and Pimlott told me he owed rent to Mr. Chinnery, and that he was going to seize on his things, and desired me to take mine away; I had a coat, I had the jacket I work in, and some shirts; I carried them to a Mrs. Eccles; this coat she put new sleeves in; she had it to mend; I had got it tied up in a bundle; I use a rule in my trade; I said Will, I do not know where to put them this afternoon; as you are going to work at Newington, says he, I know a place where you may leave them, accordingly we went over to Mrs. Pritchard, and there we left them, and I went almost directly afterwards, and fetched them away, and took them to my lodging at Mrs. Eccles's.</p>

               <p>That is in the parish of Shoreditch? - Yes, I went there on the 11th of August, with Harper, Beamont, and Shakeshaft; on entering the garden, the house the prisoner lives in, was at the bottom with two front windows that commanded the walk; I looked up at the windows directly, and I saw a man without his coat; and seeing him confused, I ran and pushed the door open, with the officers at my back; in the lower room, there was a woman who appeared to be his wife, and a maid, and the man said he was concerned in some business under the sheriff; I observed a ladder which led up to the other apartments, and I went immediately to that place, and on the step of the ladder that went out of the lower room, namely, into the one pair of stairs higher, by way of a stair case, I found these things. (Producing some farthings.) The woman was nearest to the ladder; I was not time enough in to see whether she had come from it, but that being there, it attracted my attention; I catched hold of it, opened it, and found it contained all new farthings, and I told the other officer to secure the people; they were in this apron or handkerchief; the other officers were then in the house, and we secured the other things, and the prisoner was then taken to the Magistrate, he, his wife, and the man.</p>
               <p>Did you search the house? - No, the other officers did.</p>
               <p>What quantity of farthings are there? - A great many indeed; I cannot speak to the quantity; on being taken to the Magistrate, the prisoner said he found them; there was in one part of the house, a corner cupboard, in which I found some that seemed to be black; the man that was taken, was discharged at the prisoner's request, as only coming to deliver a message to him; these were in a cupboard by the side of the bed; on going to the Magistrate, the Magistrate took the prisoner's word, and his brother's, for his appearance at twelve o'clock, on Monday, to be examined before Mr. Vernon.</p>
               <p>What day was this? - On a Saturday; he not coming, Mr. Vernon went home, and we had orders to keep these things, and in about an hour after Mr. Vernon was gone the prisoner came; on Friday following, the 17th, we again received another information against a house where the prisoners was supposed to be at work.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you discharged the prisoner on the Monday? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>And you had a second information? - Yes, we had a search warrant, and we went to a house behind the Rum Puncheon at Hoxton.</p>
               <p>How far is that from the other house? - There is a walk called Hare-walk; then there is a field which takes you right to the gardens, where the prisoner's first house was.</p>
               <p>Then the communication is by the walk and the field? - Yes; it may be half a mile apart to the best of my knowledge; I knocked twice at the door, and could get no admittance; I threw up the sash of the parlour window, and jumped in; in coming into the room, I observed a dirty blanket, and some saw-dust; in the lower room to the left hand, there was a stamping press, with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120168"/>this apron nailed to it; here is the stamping press.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is not a stamping press, it is a cutting press? - It is a stamping press; this is a fly which fixes on here, and this stood on a little block of a tree fixed, and the apron nailed to the block to receive these kind of blanks as fast as they are cut and stamped; this is made with a handle that is pulled by that; there is a movement and cutter here, that cuts the impression from the blanks.</p>
               <p>Court. Put it together if you can.</p>
               <p>(The witness put it together, and shewed how it was worked.)</p>
               <p>Court. Now working it in that fashion, what could be the effect of it, would it cut or impress, or do either? - To all appearance when fixed on a tree you may either cut or impress any similitude you please with it.</p>
               <p>Now look at it, and shew the Jury whether with that instrument such a piece of stuff as that you have got in your hand could be made? - It is the exact size of the cutter that is in.</p>
               <p>As it is now, it cuts out blanks, but remove this cutter, it is a stamping press? - If you remove this cutter, and put the die between it, it becomes what you call a stamping press; this screw removes, then take it out, and put in the die.</p>
               <p>Did you find any dies any where in that room, or about the house? - No dies whatever, in either house.</p>
               <p>But without a die, that piece of copper could not have been under? - They must have a die to finish them afterwards.</p>
               <p>What else did you find? - On going up stairs into the garret, the prisoner was there without his coat.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see the prisoner below stairs? - No, he asked me leave to fetch his coat; I told him he might, but he must go with me to put it on, as such he came down stairs, where this press was fixed, and the apron nailed to the tree; and there was his coat.</p>
               <p>Court. I understood you to have said you found farthings in that apron? - Yes, my Lord, they were in the first house; I brought him down, and he put his coat on; his hands were greasy, and he informed me he saw me when I was at the door, and it appeared as though he had been at work at this press; the floor where this press was fixed was boards, and the boards were taken up, and the trunk fixed in the ground to deaden the found, and so it was at the house where we found them before.</p>

               <p>Then does it make a noise? - It would make a jarring if it was not for its being fixed in the ground; I have been where halfpence have been coined, and I always saw them fixed in this manner.</p>
               <p>Did you examine his person? - No, the officers did that.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HARPER sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with Beamont, Armstrong, and Shakeshaft; I have got some farthings; I went on the 11th with the other witnesses, and in going into the garden, Mr. Armstrong went first, and I went, I saw people in the house rather confused; we ran as fast as we could directly, and when we ran in, the prisoner had these two bags of farthings in his hands, and I seized them in his hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they hot or cold? - As cold as they are now; they are all finished for circulation.</p>
               <p>What papers are they? - I never examined or counted them; I seized these farthings in his hand, after that I went up stairs, and there I found nothing.</p>
               <p>SHAKESHAFT sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to this house with the other officers; I kept with the prisoner while they searched the house, on the 11th; I saw the farthings taken from the prisoner; he said he had just found them; I found these farthings in a table drawer, and several farthings I picked up on the stairs; I said it is very odd if you have just found them, that these are distributed about the house; we brought him away, and he was discharged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120169"/>before the Magistrate then; we then had another information; we went to the house; there we secured him again, and I searched him, and in his pocket I found ten farthings, the very same as those found at the other house; I believe they are all of the same die; there is some saw dust, and here is a sieve to sift them with; this sieve we found -</p>
               <p>Court. What use is made of the sieve? - They hustle them in a dirty blanket, and make them black with oil and saw dust, and then put them into this sieve, and fist the saw dust from them; here is some brimstone that I found; they boil them in brimstone and salt first, and then they hustle them in the blanket with oil and saw dust, and then sift them in this sieve to get the saw dust from them, and cleanse them.</p>
               <p>What is the metal of which they are composed? - Copper, here is some sessill which I found.</p>
               <p>Had you the curiosity to see whether the sessill corresponded with the size of the farthing? - I believe it does; there may be a small difference in the size.</p>
               <p>Did you find any copper? - Yes, there is every thing fit for coining except the dies.</p>
               <p>How large a thing is a die? - This something resembles one.</p>
               <p>Is a die of such a size that it can be easily made away with? - Very easily; that is a halfpenny die, but there is no impression upon it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I should be glad to know if I told him whether they were boiled, and hustled in a blanket as he has described? - I have been at the taking of coiners many times.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he inform you any thing of that sort? - In the first house he said he was making of buttons, and he desired us to go to the other house, and there we should find the shanks in a cupboard in a tea pot; we went there, but we could find none; there was some boards up there, the same as at the other place, and the flooring was taken up, and we supposed a press had been fixed there; we put our sticks into the mould, and found it soft, and I found amongst the dirt, these four farthings, answering the same as the others.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. You have seen a press, look at that, what press is it? - This is a cutting press.</p>
               <p>Can it be made into a stamping press? - Clearly so, by taking out the cutter, and fixing a die; it would do not for heavy work, but it would do for stamping farthings.</p>
               <p>Look at those farthings? - These farthings are counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Court. What metal are they? - It is a copper of a worser sort than what is used in the tower by sixpence a pound; it is copper worth about ten-pence a pound; it is what they call a bastard copper.</p>
               <p>Is that of the likeness of a legal farthing? - It is not like a tower farthing, but it will pass current for a farthing.</p>
               <p>Now look at that press? - I have looked at it before, I see there is every thing complete for coining except a die.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If he will examine it, he will see it is only fit for stamping slight impressions upon buttons? - It will put impressions upon any thing of a small nature.</p>
               <p>Would it make impressions of this nature? - Certainly it will.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If you examine the press, you will see it is a cutting press? - It may be made a stamping press; this is a receiver to catch the piece of metal that is cut as it runs through; then remove this cutter, and put in this solid piece of iron, and the die, and then it cannot run through the hole; it is preserved at the bottom of the die.</p>
               <p>Then it may be made a stamping press? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Shakeshaft. Did he say any thing about the dies when you went to the second house? - He said you may search for dies as long as you please, but you will find none here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found the farthings in Hoxton fields, and I have several witnesses here to prove what my business is, and what I get my living by.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am foreman to Mr. Lucas, who is a supervisor, and contractor for lamps; on Thursday, the 9th of August, as I was in St. Martin's-street, Leicester-fields, looking at my boy at work, I saw the prisoner coming up the street on the other side of the way, with something wrapped up in his apron; I says to him, what have you got there?</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - Two years.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120171"/>What is he? - He is what you call a cadoee, that is, a helper; I asked him what he had got there, his reply was nothing; I put my hand towards his apron, and he drawed it away, and would not let me see; I told him I insisted on seeing, and he said if I would step on one side, he would tell me what was there.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him it would better for him to confess? - No, I says to him, I shall not go any where, and then he opened his apron, and there was the patent lamp in his apron.</p>
               <p>What may be the worth of it? - Seventeen or eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Whose lamp was it, did you know? - I did not find out till afterwards; I asked him how he came by it, and he said he had taken it from Mr. Haling.</p>
               <p>Did you understand by that that he had stole it, or that Mr. Haling had given it to him? - When I saw the lamp, I took him by the collar, and took him back to Mr. Haling's; he begged I would not take him to Mr. Haling's, and said, you have a family of your own, and I hope you will not hurt me, but before that, I asked him if he worked for Mr. Haling, and he said, yes; then says I, are not you a bad fellow to rob the gentleman that employs you? then I took him to Mr. Haling, and he was taken before Mr. Justice Hyde, and committed.</p>
               <p>- SMITH sworn.</p>
               <p>I am foreman to Mr. Haling; I took this lamp from the prisoner, on the 9th of August; he had it inside his apron; I have had the care of it ever since under lock and key; he owned it to be Mr. Haling's at the Justice's, and that he took it.</p>
               <p>Hollyar. This is Mr. Haling's property; I know it by the No. 1582 upon it.</p>
               <p>When that was brought to you, did you look to see if there was any such number missing? - No, my Lord, but afterwards I found there was one wanting; I know that by the stock; there were twelve of that sort exactly; the prisoner was at work for Mr. Haling at the time, cleaning and preparing lanthorns for the Prince of Wales's birth day.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found the lamp in the back yard, under the water tub, and only picked it up to take care of it.</p>

            , a marine, deceased, late of his Majesty's ship the Hannibal; the instructions were taken by my clerk, Mellor, and the instrument on which Lewis or M'Daniel, or whatever his name is, was sworn, was drawn by me, and the oath of administration administered in my presence; this is the instrument he was sworn on (producing the will and jurata.) he was sworn before Dr. Scott, Surrogate of the Judge.</p>
               <p>Tell us the whole that passed? - When he came to the office, he came for administration to the deceased's effects; the instructions were taken by my clerk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Is not the jurata in writing at the time he swore? - No, it is a verbal oath, administered by the Surrogate, and not reduced into writing; it is a regular form of oath.</p>
               <p>Is there no instrument reduced into writing, and signed by the party swearing? - No.</p>
               <p>When he came, was Reilly with him? - Yes; the instructions were taken, he was afterwards sworn, and after he was sworn, I sent my clerk, in order for Mac-Daniel and one Rickhus to enter into the usual bond at the Prerogative-office; the instructions were not taken by me, but by Mr. Mellor; that instrument was drawn from those instructions; I afterwards saw him take the oath, my attestation is to the warrant; when Reilly came to the office, he said he came from Mr. Davis, and that Mr. Davis would be there presently; Davis came into the office, I think it was while I was drawing the jurata; I know it was before the party was sworn, because I know when I returned from getting the party sworn, he was gone.</p>
               <p>When Davis came, what did he say? - I see you are about the business that the parties have come to me as that morning.</p>
               <p>Repeat what he said? - As near as I can recollect he said, I see you are about the business that the parties had just come from him about.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say parties? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>What did you understand from that? - I understood that he meant M'Daniel and Reilly.</p>

               <p>He saw M'Daniel and Reilly then in your office? - Yes: Some short time after I went after my clerk into the Prerogative office, I saw Rickhus and M'Daniel, and it had just been discovered that M'Daniel had assumed the name of

               <p>How came you to stop Davis? - From the information of M'Daniel, in consequence of his confession.</p>

               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Shepherd.)</p>

               <p>I take it for granted you were examined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Davis was discharged? - He was.</p>
               <p>Did you at that time say, what you have now said relative to Davis's coming when the man was there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>However, after you were heard, Davis was discharged? - Yes; Mr. Garrow was present.</p>
               <p>How long ago was that? - On the 13th of June; the 12th M'Daniel was examined, the next day Davis was examined, and Reilly was re-examined the same day; Reilly was committed, Davis was discharged, and Rickhus was bound over to give evidence against M'Daniel that day, and was bound over to give evidence against Reilly the next day.</p>
               <p>Do you know where Davis lived? - At the Spread Eagle, in Gracechurch-street</p>
               <p>Do you know when he was taken up the next time? - Since the Sessions began.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him between the time of his being discharged by Alderman Crosby, and his being taken up again? - Yes, I have seen him upon 'Change.</p>

             I am positive.</p>

               <p>Did he come on the next day? - No, Sir; he did not, it was a holiday Monday; being a holiday, the Tuesday following, M'Daniel and Reilly came together, and Reilly brought a paper with the name of

               <p>What is become of that paper? - I don't know; it was not of that sort, which I thought necessary to be preserved; Reilly said he came from Mr. Davis, and asked if he was not there on the Saturday; I said, yes; and he said I must get the business forward as fast as possible, in order that it might be compleated against Mr. Davis came; in about half an hour after, Mr. Davis came.</p>
               <p>Did any thing more pass between Reilly and you? - Not at that time, not till Davis came again.</p>
               <p>Then when Davis came, he asked if the parties had been there? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did he name them? - No.</p>
               <p>Where were they? - They were waiting over the way; I told him they had been there, and where they were then; he desired them to be sent for, and they came, and I took the instructions immediately.</p>
               <p>They were all in the office together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass between them? - Not as I took notice of.</p>
               <p>Who gave the instructions? - We generally ask the administrator; but Reilly answered for him, and I told him to hold his tongue; he still kept on telling him, and said, it was, because the man did not know much of the nature of such business, and he was better acquainted with it, and that he had known him about five years; then I finished taking the instructions, and the warrant was drawn.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it Reilly or M'Danie that gave the instructions? - Both answered the questions; then M'Daniel was sworn, and I went with them to see them execute the bond at the Publick-office.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him sworn? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you any memory of the questions you asked M'Daniel? - I asked him if he had any father or mother, and several other questions, which Reilly sometimes answered for him.</p>

               <p>Was your questions directed to M'Daniel? - Yes; and I told Reilly to hold his tongue two or three times, and let the man answer for himself; when I had prepared every thing, they went into the Office to execute the bond.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120176"/>After you was called back to be a witness to this transaction, what did you do yourself? - The clerk was sent to inform the register, and the people were ordered to be taken into custody, and we went back to our Office; we met Reilly in the passage; we had got both M'Daniel and Rickhus into custody and Reilly seeing me speak to the clerk, ran off immediately; then I took them to the Office, and they staid there till the officer came and took them into custody; Davis was to come again in the afternoon, when I told him it should be ready.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What time was this? - - About twelve or one.</p>
               <p>What time did you see Davis in the afternoon? - About four.</p>
               <p>You was present before Mr. Alderman Crosby, afterwards? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Clarkson was likewise examined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Davis was examined? - Yes; and he was discharged.</p>
               <p>When was Davis taken? - When he came to the Office that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Was you there when he first came in? - Yes, he came to me in a great hurry, and asked me if the business was ready, and I told him that there had been some dispute about it; but I did not tell him the real fact.</p>
               <p>Did you go to fetch Mr. Clarkson? - Yes; and he told me to detain him, and Davis said he was ready to go any where wherever we chose to take him.</p>
               <p>Who did you leave in the Office while you went to fetch Mr. Clarkson? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>When he came back, he expressed great readiness to go with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have a good deal of business to do with navy agents? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing in all that you have described Mr. Davis to have done, that is not done by the most respectable navy agents in this town? - They often come and desire business to be done.</p>
               <p>Court to Clarkson. What is the substance of the oath? - That the deceased died intestate.</p>
               <p>Did you know Davis? - I have seen him several times as a navy agent.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of M'Daniel? - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person of the name of Sweetenburg? - He is a clerk in the Prerogative-office.</p>
               <p>Did you hear what passed between M'Daniel and Sweetenburg, with respect to his having been there before? - Mr. Sweetenburg said, he knew his face, and said to him, I think you have been here before; he said no, and persisted in the business he was about; Mr. Sweetenburg said to him, do you know the consequence of what you are doing?</p>
               <p>This was before the bond was executed? - Yes; I don't know that he said he knew the consequence, but he persisted in the business.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by persisting? - He insisted he had never been there before, then he executed the bond, and did not say any thing further about it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. You had seen Davis there before doing business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>For himself? - He did it for other people.</p>
               <p>Did he act as agent for other people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There is nothing so common, I believe, as doing business for other people? - Nothing.</p>

My learned friend, Mr. Silvester,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120179"/>in answer to an objection, has produced a pardon; I submit, that pardon by no means removes the disability under which that man stands from the conviction, nor affects it at all; it seems to me, that the effects of this pardon cannot operate; my friends have used it as a plea, in suspension of the execution of that judgment, which the man would be liable to without it; it seems to me that that circumstance, coupled with the terms of this pardon, is the strongest that can be, to shew that the man is not to be subject to the pains and penalties, under which he now labours; yet it is only taking from him any pains and penalties which were to be the consequence of that conviction; but the King's pardon to him, under that situation, certainly cannot operate to prejudice third persons; the pardon of the King goes only to prevent an infliction of punishment to the party who is convicted; I am not aware of any case, if the gentlemen are furnished with any, they will state them; but I argue before your Lordship, that if any question can be decided on principles of policy, of reason, and of expediency, this is one of the clearest; tho' the laws of competency and incompetency are certainly direct and positive, yet, when not specifically laid down, as in the case before us, or when we do not find judicial principles, they must be tried by the principles of reason: the witness is a man who has been charged with taking a false oath; which, in this particular case, amounts to a felony; therefore, he is a man at this instant convicted of perjury; in that very transaction, which he now comes to give evidence about; in that very transact on having once sworn that, which he now comes positively, and upon his oath to contradict; he is a man convicted of an offence; to free himself from the consequences of which, he is now set up as a witness; and tho' it states, that from some favourable circumstances, that pardon is granted; I am sure that I shall not be contradicted, when I say, that the very condition of his being pardoned, was, to give evidence in this cause: if the rules of competency, or incompetency, have any power at all; there can be no case so strong, in which a man is affected by those rules, as that case which now appears before your Lordship; because the man who is called as a witness, is to prove a fact, not only directly contrary to that which he has sworn, but directly contrary to that for the swearing of which he has been convicted of perjury; therefore he comes here to comply with the conditions of that pardon, by giving evidence, contrary to his former oath. My Lord, I do not mean to make a speech to the Jury; but I remember in the case of Mr. Underwood, when he was brought to the bar here, and when we took this objection, that he was come to contradict his own oath; in that case, you, who did not try the cause, but sat in Court, at the trial of the Goodridge's, you gave this as your opinion, tho' he may be entitled to no credit, tho' he comes now directly and deliberately, to swear that to be false, which he before swore to be true; yet, inasmuch as the law has not said, that a man, if he is not convicted, may not be a competent witness, and as he cannot be convicted, he must be received, tho' he has no credit here. My Lord, I think you will not expect us to shew, that that pardon ought not to operate to remove the disability; here I shew the man stands in such a situation, he not only cannot be believed, but he cannot be received; and I think I ought to call on my friends, to shew why this pardon is to remove this disability; why the King has any right by any instrument of his, to affect the lives of third persons; why, tho' he has a right to say, I do not chuse to execute this man, (because he has the prerogative of mercy) he has also a right to say, I will remove a disability which is to operate against the lives of all my other subjects, tho' a jury of the country have put him in such a situation, that he cannot be believed, tho' he cannot be heard in a Court of Justice; yet I have a right to say he shall affect third persons, and I will restore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120180"/>him to the degree of ability, that shall affect third persons; I am yet entitled to that prerogative in the Crown, which can put men in peril of their lives, by the testimony and evidence of a witness, who has been legally convicted of a crime that must destroy all belief; for the man being put in such a situation, that is a situation of incompetency in a witness, and we cannot dispute the verdict which has been passed against him, he is entitled to no credit; in short, it is a fact found by a Jury, and cannot be removed; now, how is this man to be set in a situation to affect the lives of third persons; tho' certainly the King has a right not to execute the judgment of this man; he has the right of not doing it because he, has the right to do it; it is from that, that the right of pardon arises; because, he in whom the execution of a law is vested, certainly has it in his power to execute it or not; but it is not because he is supposed the Judge, who are, or are not more peculiarly the objects of the law; if we come to the terms of the pardon itself, there is not a syllable in it of removing a disability; it frees him from all punishment which may be executed by the Sheriffs or the Judges, not from any impeachment that may be thrown upon his credit, nor from any impeachment of his veracity; I say it stands simply thus; I will not execute the law upon you, and that the sentence may not operate as perpetual imprisonment, I will give you an instrument, declaring, that I do not mean to execute the law; perhaps it may be said, this would operate against all forfeitures; and that, because, the King has a right to relinquish all his own right, it does affect the rights of third persons: My Lord, the rights of every man in this country can only be guarded by the rules of evidence; and therefore, by breaking down those rules of evidence by any exercise of the prerogative, the rights of third persons are not to be affected, which cannot be affected by any prerogative of the crown; I shall leave it to Mr. Garrow, who will aid my remark with many of his own, and at the same time, call upon my friends to shew how it stands; they produce an instrument, in which, not a syllable is started, that removes that disability; I think I may defy them to produce any case in which it has removed that disability; he produces a pardon, in that very transaction, in that very case, in that very point, in which he now comes to give evidence; I will venture to say, tho' I do not know any cases, but I almost challenge them to produce me a parallel instance, in which a man convicted of felony involving a perjury, is to set up a pardon to operate on the conviction of a third person; I think there never will be an instance, in which the Court will hold that a man so pardoned, can be set up as a witness; now coming to say that which he swore was false, and setting up against it a pardon, which only goes to remove any inconvenience which can happen to himself; but not to be put in a situation to affect the rights of third persons.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, as you are called on to-day to adjudge a point, I think, of more importance to the whole public than any that has ever come before the Court, I shall make no apology for troubling your Lordship with a few words. I take it, that nothing can be so clear, in any way in which this subject is considered, as that this is by no means that which they contend; they contend this is a charter of restoration to all legal rights which he had before; I contend it is a charter of remission and pardon; and of remission and pardon only, not a charter of restoration. In considering it in that way, I shall endeavour to prove it, first, by looking at the deed itself, seeing what it bears on the face of it, what must have been the King's intention; the King cannot, by any charter which he can grant to the subject, do that which my friends contend he has done by the present pardon, the thing itself states a remission of that which the King had a right to inflict, and I think nothing can be so clear that the King has gone to the full extent of his authority: You know all offences are construed in the law to be against the State, they are all in breach of the public peace; and the laws which are made are against all offenders: but, as the sword of justice must be lodged in some hand, as the power of pardoning must be somewhere; so in this country it rests in the King, the punishment of death and its consequences he may remit: Therefore these are properly and technically called pardons; they are not restorations, they merely go this length, for his offence aforesaid he shall be acquitted, of all indictments and impeachments; from that offence, he shall be freed from all impeachment; impeachment of his credit does the King venture to say, impeachment of his credit or his competency? of his ability or disability to be a witness? Nothing like it; but pursuing that context, you will find what it means; it means prosecutions, legal prosecutions for any offence he has committed; but has the King said that this man shall be, to all the purposes of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120183"/>society, the same as if he had never offended? Shall he be received into society as a man competent to give evidence? Mr. Shepherd says, the rules of competency proceed on the same ground as those of credit, for the protection of innocence: the King cannot break down, or infringe, or invade any one of the rules of evidence; he has no prerogative to say that innocence shall not be protected; he has no prerogative to say he will make an exception of any one of those, whom the wisdom of the law has said shall be incompetent: Look a little whether the reason of the thing would bear out that prerogative; is it consistent with the preservation of innocence that the King should have the power of restoring such persons to their competency? It may be said, why there is no harm done, it may conduce to purposes of justice to let a bad man give evidence: My Lord, Judges will be cautious; or, as you said in the case of Underwood, if we are called upon to hear him, I have no difficulty in stating, before he is heard, the Jury are to turn a deaf ear to what he says: I know you would say that in the present case; for all that was wanting in his case was that conviction; Underwood stood here as infamous as M'Daniel does; Underwood stood here as perjured; Underwood stood here everything but convicted of perjury; he stood here every thing but convicted of felony, but there was that, and that only difference between the witness of the day and

                  John

            , that Underwood had not been convicted, and this man has: I argue so to satisfy your Lordship that the King does not possess any prerogative inconsistent with the safety and innocence of his subjects; is it consistent with that to turn out this wild beast again on the public; to say that this man shall be received as a competent witness to charge other men with crimes? My Lord, when this prerogative was winked at, when this prerogative was established in the Crown, the King exercised it as he does all the other prerogatives, for the vindication of innocence which had been oppressed, for the setting those free that had been convicted, but not to involve the whole of his innocent subjects, at the peril of having such men as this M'Daniel to be witness. Mr. Shepherd has stated the situation of this man, supposing that there had been judgment, and I know it will be endeavoured to distinguish between the case, as it stands at present, where there has been no judgment, and where there has; how does this pardon come here? I say again, in remission of that crime and the punishment; this man may be laid hold of by any man who has got the conviction; if I had brought him in here yesterday to receive judgment of death, what should hinder your Lordship from pronouncing judgment: The King has discharged him from any personal consequences; consider this as if it has been in another stage of the business, I think it makes no difference, suppose there had been a judgment, before you could have awarded judgment, you must have asked him what he had to say; if he had pleaded the pardon, it is a charter of remission, and operates in stay of execution: now, to satisfy you that the judgment having or not having been pronounced, makes no sort of difference in this case; I state a case which has happened very lately, from a respectable authority, bearing some analogy to it, and your Lordship knows the very persons, Priddle, Holloway and Steevens were convicted of a conspiracy; subsequent to this, a person of the name of Crossley was tried at the Court of King's Bench for perjury, Priddle was produced as a witness, it was objected to by Mr. Silvester, that he was not a competent witness, and they produced the record of conviction for conspiracy; it was contended there, that in that case of Priddle, as there had been no infamous judgment; it did not go to his disability; Mr. Justice Buller declared he was of opinion, after great consideration, that he had looked into the books, that he had considered the subject and he said, that it was not the infamy of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120184"/>the punishment, but of the crime which occasioned the incompetency of the witness; then I say you need not produce any authorities to prove this; we all know that the Court of Quarter-Sessions have inflicted inflicted infamous punishments for a crime not infamous; therefore we may infer it is the infamy of the crime, not the punishment: I was mentioning to you the case of Priddle, and what Mr. Justice Buller said upon it, and Priddle was rejected as incompetent: I am at present arguing only to satisfy you that the fact of the judgement having been given or not, makes no difference; suppose that upon Priddle's case you had postponed the judgement, and in the mean time the trial had come on, Priddle would have been rejected, he had been convicted of an infamous offence, and then the law has said he has shewn himself so little attentive to truth, so little attentive to honor and honesty, that it is dangerous to society that that man should longer continue in such a situation ever to be a witness, and nothing shall restore him to that competency.</p>
               <p>In treason, the king may grant his pardon, a charter of remission, a charter of pardon, a charter remitting all the personal penalties attaching on the person convicted of treason, but the King cannot grant a charter of restoration to a traitor; your Lordship knows, that in order to partake of any of the advantages of society, there must be the consent of the whole society to receive him; the head of the society cannot say I will run my innocent subjects into danger; there must be the consent of the whole society, testified by act of parliament: nothing can restore a traitor, but an act of parliament; just upon the same principles. I contend it is here; and I contend nothing can restore the witness M'Daniel to the state of being a competent witness, but the consent of all the public testified by an act of the legislature; the King cannot do it, if he can, he possesses a prerogative infinitely more dangerous than those against which our ancestors struggled; a prerogative to lay snares for innocence; a prerogative to send back with a halter about his neck, a man into society against whom they would shut the door, as if he were too dangerous to be permitted to enter: he comes here pleading this pardon, not for any good reasons, but to transfer the load of guilt from himself, to pull it on another, to say that other man has been guilty; and all that is to be brought about by the magic of this pardon; I believe it possesses no such magic; three minutes ago he was kneeling at that bar, with a halter about his neck, ready to be fastened to some strong beam: Now is there any thing in this pardon that shews why that man, whom they was just now asking why the Court should not give him judgement to die, shall be admitted a witness to affect a third person? I ask them to point it out, to shew me any thing in which the King by any terms of pardon, by any charter of restoration, by any instrument that he can order the great seal of England to be put to, that he can convey that to this man; and if there was a way of doing it, the King's grant is not to be taken largely against the King, or against his subjects; the boon is to be extended to this man as far as the King intended it should go; but not largely against the King, and against the King's subjects: if it were not a new case, certainly one does not care a farthing, because I know your Lordship will tell the Jury that this man has purchased this pardon at the price of the lives of these two men; the prosecutor has bought his testimony; I mean no reflection on the prosecution, or any body concerned in it; but as to this man, as far as it relates to his testimony, it is the price of the purchase money, in order to enable this man to give testimony against these two men; I contend it is against all the law of this country, therefore I sit down content, unless my learned friends can produce something written in some authoritative book on the subject, proving the King has this right; I do contend with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120185"/>great submission, but great confidence, that this witness cannot be received.</p>

               <p>Court. I own the inclination of my opinion is at present strongly against the general line of argument that has been very ingeniously, and very forcibly put by the counsel for the prisoners; but can you, or Mr. Fielding, state distinctly to me, any case in which it is clearly settled and adjudged, that upon a conviction for perjury in particular, the competency of the witness is restored by the King's pardon. I have some imperfect recollection; I have heard mention that some such case has lately come under the consideration of the Judges, but I am not furnished with a note of it, and my recollection of it is not distinct enough to induce me to act so decidedly upon it, as to deprive the prisoner of the benefit of this objection, which has never yet been settled; for the question is certainly more important than I should wish peremptorily to decide, so as to bind the prisoner: my inclination therefore at present is this, I shall shortly state my reasons, that some parts of the argument that have been so ingeniously put, by by-standers may not be taken to be law; therefore I shall give some reasons, why I shall at all events receive the witness; but unless you give me some precise case, I shall receive his evidence subject to the opinion of the the Judges.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is as clear as the noon day sun; there is no doubt of the general operation of a pardon in the case of felony, and Judge Hale says in his Pleas of the Crown, that the Royal pardon not only respects the punishment, but restores to the culprit his plenam et liberam legem.</p>
               <p>Court. The safest line for a single Judge to take, where it has not been a case clearly, unequivocally, and authoritatively decided, is to receive the evidence, and to take care that if he does wrong in doing so, the prisoner shall not be prejudiced by his error: The argument in support of the objection has been so ingeniously and so forcibly put upon specious principles, which yet appear to me to be, speaking legally, false principles; but I think it right to say a word or two on that subject, and on the prerogative of the Crown to pardon: It is certainly true that the prerogative of the Crown in general, extends only to the interest of the Crown, and the direct interest of the public, of all which the Crown is the guardian; and therefore I hold that the Crown cannot release the vested right of any private individual; if therefore, a right becomes absolutely vested in a third person, any act which the Crown chuses to remit, the Crown may remit that penalty as far as relates to itself, and the public; but it cannot remit that interest which relates to the individual; the same principle is applied in the case of appeals, which are prosecutions allowed by the antient law of the country, upon principles which certainly would not have been received at this day; they are a species of prosecution, and were indulged to private revenge; but it is carrying that principle too far a great deal to say that the prerogative of the Crown should never operate in any case which may in it's consequences indirectly affect individuals, and it is impossible to illustrate it plainer than in the very subject which is the ground of the present argument; for the argument has gone all the length of saying that the Crown cannot by this pardon make a person whom the law says is incapable of being a witness, a witness against any individual subject; now it is perfectly within the knowledge of the two learned gentlemen, (perhaps some little speciousness may captivate the audience,) but it is perfectly known to them as well as to every other gentleman of learning, that that in this extent is by no means true: for that in cases of all felonies without exception, which are as clear legal disabilities; it is perfectly clear that in that case the pardon of the Crown restores the competency; it therefore is not true as a general proposition that the Crown has not the power to restore the competency of a witness; in convictions for felony it is perfectly clear that it is otherwise: then I am a little inclined to see this case<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120186"/>in a light that it has not yet been stated in; I have already said a little, but as much as is necessary, where I do not mean to give a decided opinion: With respect to convictions of perjury, that probably the opinions arose from the confounding his competency with the credit, because there the offence in its own nature, independent of any infliction of punishment of any sentence, independent of any consequences of the law, as soon as it comes beyond a doubt, and decisively ascertained that a person has once been found guilty of swearing what is not true, it is in common sense that the credit of that person can never be restored; that is the natural and philosophical consequence of the commission of the crime; the destruction of the competence; and the consequence of the law there, seems as much a part of the actual punishment of perjury, that that person shall be legally disabled from giving judgment on the rights of any subject; and if it is a part of the punishment, I have no doubt of the prerogative of the Crown to remit it, let who will be affected by it: this is not an indictment for perjury, but for felony, and though that felony is committed through the medium of perjury, though perjury is the species of felony, which the act of parliament has thought proper to make a felony, yet it may very well be doubted whether the act of parliament in changing the nature of that offence, has not changed the legal consequence, as well as the nature of punishment: Perjury is not punished with death, this is; the perjury is therefore merged in the felony completely; it is this, whether in strict legal consideration, the Court can take any cognizance of the legal consequences of perjury at all, and whether this does not stand a conviction generally of felony without benefit of clergy; if that should be the case, the other question will never arise: I think it by no means impossible that that opinion must be entertained; then the only consequence thus considered is, that a person in stating to the Jury the credit of such a witness, will certainly forget the nature of the felony, and that though it is made by act of parliament a felony, and can have no other consequence, yet common sense, and common understanding and acceptation, will say that the effect on the credit remains the same; an act of parliament may alter the circumstances, but cannot alter the nature of things. My present opinion is, that the King may restore the competency after the conviction, or at least before judgment, but that this is to be considered as conviction for a felony, and not as a conviction for perjury; I shall therefore receive the evidence, but I shall certainly communicate the subject to the Judges, in consequence of a verdict; if the Jury should be of opinion that a verdict ought to be given against the prisoner, I will take care their verdict shall have no consequence as against the prisoner, till I am satisfied their verdict should be allowed.</p>

               <p>Do you know either of the prisoners at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know them both? - I have seen that man before, Mr. Davis; I know the other still better; I have known Reilly between two and three years.</p>
               <p>Have you known much of him in that time? - No, I never knew any thing of him.</p>
               <p>You was not familiar with him, you did not know a great deal of him? - No, but I have known him for that time.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to believe he has known you for that same time? - Certainly Sir, he knows me.</p>
               <p>Did he know your name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is your real name? - John M'Daniel.</p>
               <p>Did he make any application to you in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120187"/>the month of June last? - He came down to Billingsgate to me, he told me he would get me half a guinea to earn; I asked where I was to go, or what was I to do, and he told me to come up to a Jew, one Davis, and he would get me the half guinea.</p>
               <p>When was this? - The same day that I was taken, in the morning early.</p>
               <p>Was that the first time that he applied to you upon this business? - No, he told me a fortnight before this.</p>
               <p>Tell us what he said to you a fortnight before? - He told me he had half a guinea for me to earn, but it was not time yet; he did not say at that time who the Jew was; then he brought me to the Spread Eagle in Grace-church-street, and then he brought me to Mr.
