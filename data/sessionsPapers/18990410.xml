                  </hi>. I am a wholesale tobacconist, of 30, Church Lane—the prisoner was in my employ last year as counterman and clerk—his duty was to attend to the customers and keep the books, day-book and ledger—Mr. Grosse was almost a daily customer—he paid every Sunday—the prisoner would make out the weekly statement from the goods entered in the ledger daily, and open the ledger when Grosse came on Sundays, and say, "You have to pay so much"—towards the end of Sep<lb/>tember I had a communication from Grosse's brother-in-law, and examined the ledger, and got a warrant against Grosse and Bronstein for conspiracy, and on returning Bronstein was gone, and I did not see him again till quite recently—Grosse was committed for trial, tried in this Court before my Lord, and acquitted—I then went to the police-court and got a warrant against Bronstein for falsification of accounts—this is the day-book (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—all the entries in it are in the prisoner's writing except the red ink—here are entries in it of goods supplied to Grosse on February 20th, 1898, in the prisoner's writing, £5 3s. 8d.—this (exhibit B) is the prisoner's writing; it is the weekly statement, including February 20th, and is receipted by him—the goods come to £3 11s. 5d.—the items do not agree—the entries on page 72 of the day-book have all been scratched out; indicating that it was paid—I put in these items in red ink when I took the warrants out, because they were not right; those are the right prices—this is the ledger, and in it on July 27th, 1898, £2 0s. 5 1/2 d. is debited to Grosse as having been paid to him that day, and on November 21st (exhibit C) I find £4 0s. 5 1/2 d. as the amount for that date, there being a difference of £2 between the ledger and the invoice—on August 16th the amount in the ledger is £2 15s. 4d. and the invoice £3 15s. 4d., a difference</p>

I am a tobacconist, and am Mr. Goorvitch's brother-in-law—on February 25th this year the prisoner came to my shop and and said, "As I am friends with you and you are brother-in-law to Mr. Goorvitch go to him and pray for me; I have done a lot of trouble to him and I am guilty, but for the sake of my own children I ask for forgive<lb/>ness"—I promised to go and speak to Goorvitch, and two days after he came to my place and told me that two days after Grosse was tried he came to London and he did not know what to do as he had not money to pay Counsel—I said, "Why does not Grosse help you?"—he said, "He has himself nothing"—I advised him to go and press Grosse, as he told me he had done him a great service in leaving London after a warrant was out for him—he said, "If I have to die in prison I would not bring him into trouble"—he afterwards told me he was in Calais all the time he was away—I asked him how it was that his age was 62 in the papers when his age was 48—he told me his age before—he said he did that purposely, as if he had imprisonment he would not get hard labour—he then left.</p>

I am chief officer of the Gold<lb/>smiths' Company at the Assay Office—articles come to my department to be stamped, which is done by the Company for a few pence for each article—manufacturers of silver have a private mark, which consists of their initials generally, which they register at Goldsmiths' Hall, where the registers go back for about 200 years—the manufacturer's mark is put on by himself with a punch, and then it is brought to Goldsmiths' Hall</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100010"/>
               <p>—these punches, No. 10 and 11, bear the manufacturer's mark, W.L. and S.M.—I find on these silver articles a manufacturer's mark, G.F.—it is the duty of the Goldsmiths' Company to impress the lion and the leopard's head; those are the distinctive marks of the London Goldsmiths' Hall, and the only other towns are Birmingham, Chester, and Sheffield—it was the custom up to 1890 to impress the duty mark, which was the Sovereign's head prior to 1874—the number was 104 and 105, that was 1783—there is also the date of impressing what is called the date letter—it shows when the article was stamped, and is changed every year—the lion, the Jeopard, the King's head, and the date letter are im<lb/>pressed by punches—punch No. 1 bears the mark of a lion, and I marked this piece of silver (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) with it—No. 2 is a smaller lion, dies No. 3 and 4 are leopard's heads, crowned No. 5 is the Sovereign's head, George III.—that was the date mark from 1874 to 1890—duty was paid then, but no mark was put—No. 6 is the date letter of 1784—die No. 7 is a Roman H. of 1783, the year before—No. 8 is a Roman H and a lion on it—these punches resemble those legitimately used at Goldsmiths' Hall, and are adapted for making those marks—on March 9th, between 8 and 9 a.m., I went with Inspector Morley and other officers to the prisoner's house, 72, Latham Street, Holloway, and took part in searching it—a cup-board in the kitchen on the ground floor was opened by a key—in it was a lot of rubbish, very dirty, and this black box fastened by a padlock which was opened by another key, and inside it were some tin boxes in which were the steel punches produced—I should say that No. 8 is an impression taken off the silver on to this metal—No. 9 is a similar piece of metal, made in the same way—No. 10 is a name punch, W, L.; No. 11 a punch, S. M.; No. 12 a name punch, W. B.; No. 13, letter K.; No. 14, a punch, with the prisoner's initials, T.

S. for William Shaw—we found those letters by looking at the registers—I cannot give any explanation of the strip of silver, No. 23—No. 24 is J.

S., which is on the two silver articles (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—that is the mark of George Smith in 1739—in a bedroom upstairs I found forty or fifty other punches adapted for making similar impressions to those downstairs, but they had not been used for some time—I consider that they had been used—I went into a small lean to shed, and saw on a shelf a number of tools, a punch with a King's head of 1749, and a large quantity of silver plate (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—No. 52 is a cream ewer marked with a lion and leopard's head, a date letter, the head of George I., and G.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My strong opinion is that the marks on the marked silver were made by the punches found—I was with the inspector during the search—a small proportion of the silver was un worked up—some was worked up, and not marked—only a small proportion of the silver was in the workshop—I am certain the punches had been used, within a year or so—the punches are struck with a hammer—apart from the marks, I should say the silver was modern; within twenty-five years within the present reign, at all events—technically, modern silver would be within about fifty years—some silver was marked in the ordi<lb/>nary way—I have compared the punches with the silver found—if the punches had not been used for ten years the tops would not be so bright from the hammer marks—I can say with certainty that one or two of the punches have been used within the last two or three years—there is</p>

               <p>nothing unusual in t he possession of the date cards—the prisoner's wan an ordinary silversmith's workshop—one punch had a king's head, probably of George III.—the imitations were good for the purpose for which they were used—they would deceive a fairly experienced person—the spoons are Victorian—I fancy I can trace the letter M, partly obliterated—that would indicate five years back—a good deal of silver is sold by dealers who travel about the country.</p>

Dear Madame,—I am very much surprised not to have had news from you; all the more so as I was in great straits, having no room or lodging, not knowing where to go, nothing to eat, no linen I hope that by your good heart, before I do you some bad turn, that within 48 hours I expect a reply before writing to the mayor of your village, or town, in order to avoid that all the village should come to know what bad conduct you have had; that you have been in prison at Bordeaux; that you have been expelled, and afterwards had been in Brussels and Rochelle. I shall not neglect anything, telling them of your present conduct in London on the streets now, and of the miserable blackguard with whom you live. I hope you will not make it necessary for me to communicate with your family. Send me a few pence that I may have my washing and something to eat. I hope to receive the money by post, c/o Robert, Titchfield Street, Dean Street, Soho. I embrace thee.—<hi rend="smallCaps">MAURICE</hi>

I live at 44, Paddington Street, nearly opposite the Apollo—I was looking out at my window on Easter Monday, about 6.10—I saw the prisoner and Haynes outside, and White and his brother—I only knew the Whites then—they all crossed East Street, and at the opposite corner I saw the deceased strike the prisoner on the face with his right hand, and knock him down—they were all arguing—that was the first blow struck—Haynes and deceased fought in the road—Haynes fell to the ground from a blow given by the deceased, who stood over him waiting for him to get up—Kingham came up and dealt the deceased a swinging right hand blow which knocked him down—he came from the opposite side of the street—the deceased was looking down at Haynes on the ground; the prisoner came up to deceased sideways—I cannot swear where he hit him, but when I got down to the street I found he had a cut over his right eye—he struck his head on the stone crossing—I arrested Haynes—Kingham was not there then—I took the deceased to the hospital—he was unconscious; he was assisted into a cab—there was a</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think it was the blow against the kerb which caused the man's death—I have known White about ten years—I have never been in his company—my room is on the third floor—the men were just opposite—it was day<lb/>light—White was not in a fighting position when he was standing over Haynes—I did not hear any shouting.</p>

               <p>pork—these boxes (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) all bear the name of Nelson and Morris—that is the name of the firm in America—we have white and buff sale notes—when meat is sold, the salesman writes on the note what the man buys and puts the price per stone as agreed, and the purchaser's name on the note and counterfoil, and the meat is taken to the scalesman who weighs it and places the weight in the first column—it is then handed to a clerk who reckons the amount and enters it in a book, and the sale note is filed—the process is the same both with credit and cash customers—I tally up the books at night—prior to January we found considerable loss at the end of the day, and on January 13th we were two top pieces short, worth £5 each, and two boxes of pork £1 each—we had not sold to Ward, Stewart, or Higley that day—on January 13th we had a porter named Higley, known as <hi rend="italic">Soldier</hi>—he has absconded—his duty was to lift the meat or do anything he was required—he had no authority to sell meat or to buy on his own account—the salesmen are dressed differently to the porters—on January 20th eight boxes of pork were short—we did not sell to Cassen, Ward, Stewart, or Higley that day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The practice is to enter the particulars in the day book from the sale note; this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—a similar form of sale note was in use last year, but this special form since December 30th—R.M stands for "ready money"—there are fourteen R.M.—those do not give the purchaser's name—the sale notes would not be marked R.M., nor would they have any name—this is not a sale note it is a ticket on which the clerk puts the customer's name—you might buy meat and have a ticket for it, but unless you pay the money it would not be sent to you—these (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are the sale notes of January I3th—this "Sold to R. M., £4 6s. 6d.," is beef—I do not find the names of Higley, Stewart, or Ward in the books—I have made inquiries, and they did not buy on January 13th—there are no ready-money tickets for the two top pieces—this is the pork book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—in a cash transaction the cashier would require the cash at the time—I have seen the tickets found on the prisoner when he was arrested—the pork all comes from Morris's in boxes like this—they sometimes contain 4, sometimes 5,. and sometimes 6 loins of pork—we sometimes find one short—they would not be turned out; they would be counted as they were entered—I know many hundreds of our ready-money customers—I do not know that the prisoner has been a regular customer—people some<lb/>times combine together to get a larger quantity at a lower price; but you very seldom find three stall-keepers without some amount of com<lb/>petition, and they do not combine—they are generally all there together—there would be an advantage in one man buying a triple quantity.</p>

               <p>I went in, and he gave me 2 top pieces, which I took, in consequence of what he said, to Hall, jun., the carrier, and later on, about 10 o'clock, the prisoner came to me and said, "There are 2 boxes of pork at Morris's," and told me to take them to Hall, the carrier, and a little afterwards <hi rend="italic">Soldier</hi> told me to take 2 more boxes—I went into Morris's shop, and took them, and <hi rend="italic">Soldier</hi> told me to take them to the carrier—on January 20th <hi rend="italic">Soldier</hi> came out and spoke to me on the rank, which is about the length and a-half of this Court from the shop—I went in and got eight boxes of pork from <hi rend="italic">Soldier</hi> and another man named Maddock, and gave them to Mr. Hall, the father, two at a time—the prisoner paid me, but I cannot remember how much—I was never paid on the same day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My attention was first called to this a day or two be<lb/>fore I gave evidence before the Magistrate on February 16th—I am em<lb/>ployed in the market by anybody who wants meat carried, and have from two to six jobs a day, and sometimes a dozen on Fridays—I also took a top piece to Whiting the carrier on the Thursday in the next week, for which Jones has been charged, I remembered the boxes of pork when the market constable spoke to me I told him about the pork as well as the beef—I did not mention the pork before the Magistrate on January 16th, but I did on the next examination—I keep no book—I have been taking things to the carrier's cart for the prisoner for some months—I saw him several times a week in the market—I know Higley and Ward—I have seen them in the market with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. Junr. I assist my father, a meat-carrier, of Daintry Street, Hackney—on January 13th Belson brought me a top piece in the market and afterwards another, and I put them on my pony cart, and before I went away he gave me 2 boxes of pork—I met the prisoner in Barbican—he said, "What have you got for me?"—I said, "Two boxes of pork and two top sides"—he said, "Go on; get down there"—I had directions from Belson where to go—the prisoner gave me a cloth, and said, "Cover this over the meat when you get down there"—I threw it on the cart, but not over the meat, and then went to the prisoner's stall—he was not there; but 2 men whom I did not know opened the cart, and put the meat on the stall—I gave them the cloth and told them to cover it over the meat, because they were my instructions—I got a job further Along, and came back past the prisoner's stall, and he gave me 3d., but said nothing—later in the day I delivered 2 boxes of pork at the prisoner's stall; and on the 20th I received 2 boxes of pork from Belson and took them to the prisoner's stall and gob my coffee money from him; And on the same day I received 4 boxes, which I took to the prisoner's house, because the stall was not there at that time of night; Mrs. Cassin took them in—I received 2s. from the prisoner; my father told me to ask for it—beef is covered with a cloth to separate it; but it is usual to cover it up on a stall unless the owner is there; it is not allowed to be seen, to prevent anybody stealing any.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head-constable of the Central Meat Market—I have had the conduct of this inquiry—I first saw Hall on February 1st. and he made a statement—on February 16th I saw Cassen in my office, and said, "A man named Jones, in Pentonville Prison, sent for me and made a statement that 2 top pieces were taken by a man named Belson, who took them to a carman named Hall, and forwarded them to your place; what you say I shall take down in writing"—he said, "I recollect a man called <hi rend="italic">Soldier</hi> asking me to buy two top pieces, he said he had bought them of a man, and that they were thrown on his hands. I bought them for £3 8s., and <hi rend="italic">Soldier</hi> sent a porter in for them, and sent them on to me. I received the top pieces by Hall, the carrier, I gave <hi rend="italic">Soldier</hi> 2s. 3d. per stone. A friend of mine named Ward brought one of the top pieces, he knew where I got</p>

               <p>the meat from. I have never bought anything from Morris's unless I received a ticket for it. I have not heard there is a warrant out against <hi rend="italic">Soldier</hi>, nor have I heard he has absconded to America. I did not buy any boxes of pork from Morris on January 13th last. I had 4 boxes of pork, but not from Morris; they were brought by Hall, the carrier; Ward had 2 boxes, and I had 2 boxes. Mine were taken to my house. Ward took his away. I received 8 boxes of pork on January 20th last; they were brought to my house by Hall, the carrier. A man named Higley bought them, and wo divided them afterwards between us. Higley had 3 boxes; I had 2 boxes; Ward had 2 boxes; J. Stewart had 1 box. I paid Higley for mine. I sent the old man who works for me with Higley's boxes on Saturday morning. A stout fellow I know, named Peck, took Ward's and Stewart's. I did not receive any other boxes that day. I received 4 boxes of pork on the following Tuesday, January 24th. Hall, the carrier, took them down. All these boxes of pork were brought to me by a porter known as <hi rend="italic">Sunlight.</hi> I think Ward brought them from Jennings. I did not buy them. These were delivered to my stall; I had 2 of them, and Ward had 2 boxes. Ward's boxes were taken by a man named Peck on a barrow. I received no boxes of pork from Morris on the 13th, nor the 20th, nor the 23rd, nor the 24th of January, 1899. Ward paid me for the boxes at my stall"—I did not ask him to sign that—Bird and I took him to the station.</p>

               <p>take it to Hall—I saw it in young Hall's possession, and told him to cover it to keep the dust from it—I keep no books of my purchases—Highley and Ward keep stalls in Bethnal Green Road, and I buy stock for the three—I get it cheaper; it is sent home in my name, and I share it out with them—I buy nearly every Friday—on February 16th I had more memory than I have now of what pork I bought on January 13th—either of us bought the pork on Fridays; Hall does not always deliver it; we either took it ourselves, or he takes it for us—I have never bought or received pork from Oliver—I do not remember the date when Hall delivered pork—I have sent it to my house more than once—I remember 4 boxes at one time, but I cannot remember who brought it—I close my stall at 2 p.m., and if Hall did not find me at my stall he would take the meat to my house—that occurs about twice a month—I buy 8 or 10 boxes at &amp; time—I cannot remember any date when I bought 8 boxes—there are 4 loins in a box—I bought 4 boxes last Friday, and 6 boxes the Friday before between me and Ward—the price of a box is about 15s.</p>

I say "Ten," and they give me a ticket of what it comes to—there is no name on the ticket—I have a ticket here of some which I bought the day before Good Friday, "18s. 2 1/2 d. and £1 19s. 7d."—I keep no books; I rely on my memory.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner</hi>)—I have carried on business in the City of London more than 27 years—since 1874 I have carried on the business of a fur and skin merchant; purchasing wholesale, and selling to the manufacturers—I have banked at the Aldgate branch of the City and Midland Bank for over 20 years, and during that time I have done a large business—during the last 12 or 13 years I have made bad debts to the extent of £19,600—during the last 2 years I have lost in bad debts more than £4,000—I have to buy for cash and to give long credit—in 1897-8 I was in money difficulties—I knew a Mr. Loftie, who was employed at the International Fur Stores, perhaps for 12 to 15 years—I met him in the way of business—he was manager of a fur factory, and passed the goods sent in—in June, 1898, I borrowed £100 from him—the cheque produced is the one he gave me for that amount—subsequently, in August, I bor<lb/>rowed from him a further sum of £400; the cheque for that is produced</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The stoppages between August 22nd and October 10th, which induced me to go to an accountant to offer a composition, were non-payments by a man named Gleitzmann, with whom I had a largo amount outstanding—I had not been signing accommodation bills with him, I had bought a large parcel of Thibet skins from him—at the time of my bankruptcy I had two so called accommodation bills running to which we were parties, drawn for the purpose of receiving the money to buy the skins and sell them within a month—the amount of my share of that debt would be about £300, but altogether I was interested with him to over £1,200—Gleitzmann stopped two days after me—it is a mis-understanding to say that there were two stoppages occurring between August 22nd and October 10th, which induced me to go to my accountant—I could not get the money from them—the other one was a man named Kaplin—Gleitzmann owed me money for goods I sold to him—I advanced him cash, and I could not get the money back—I befriended him—Kaplin did not stop, but I could not get the money from him, I had been trying for weeks, since July, in fact, and had failed to get it—he has not stopped to this day—the difference between my assets and liabilities mounted to £6,000—I could not get the money to pay my bills, being stopped like that—I wanted the money that I borrowed from Loftie—I do not know whether I paid either of the amounts into my business banking account—I might have paid some odd items in cash—I cashed both the cheques—it takes the bank about two days to clear them—I did not think there was any harm in cashing them—there is no trace in my business books of my having received the amount—on August 20th the paying in slip shows the payment in of £200, part of the money—I know it because on a Friday I took the money home, and knowing that I had</p>

               <p>bills to pay on Saturday and Monday, a friend of mine came round to see me, and I asked him to pay in £200, and gave it to him, and he paid it in on the Saturday morning—£70 of that money went in to pay Mr. Loftie, and I paid in £500—this is the paying in slip of that £200—it appears on the face of it to be a payment to one Kosminski, who will prove that he had no money to give me—the persons in my insolvency would not have dis<lb/>covered in my books that I had borrowed this £500—I did not want anyone to discover it, it was my private business—my object was not to conceal the true-state of my affairs—I did not feel myself in an insolvent state when I borrowed the money—I did not know I was insolvent on August 22nd, when I borrowed the money and made a fictitious invoice, and made other alterations—I do not know if Mr. Loftie is a buyer to a certain extent, but he pusses the goods—Jay's did not know that I was having money transactions with their buyer—I am a seller of goods to their firm, and a buyer, too—I did not want anybody to know of these money transactions—of the £1,217 I got from them I paid back to Mr. Loftie £500—I did not credit the difference of £500, but £788 6s., because £70 came up from the other £200—I cannot remember if the whole of the money which I drew from Jay's bank, to the extent of £788 6s., went into my bank—I suppose it got mixed up; I cannot positively say; I have had a lot of worries since—I know I took the money from Jay's, and I paid £788 into the bank: I believe it was out of their moneys—I cannot re<lb/>member who cashed the £50 note now produced—it may be that I did—it may be that I wrote the name that appears on the back, because I had to pay the man some money—it is not my name or my address—it is pos<lb/>sible that that is one of the notes I got from Jay's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The name is that of Mr. Fashner, 3, Edmund's Place—I had to pay him some money—he is a furrier, a manufacturer, with whom I have had business transactions for several years—I cashed the note my-self, having written the man's name on the back, because I had to pay him the money—Mr. Dadin is the director's buyer at the International Fur Stores—I have had one joint transaction with Gleitzmann, buying furs at a sale—I do not know whether Kaplin has ever paid up to the present time—I do not remember where 1 cashed the £50 note—I wrote the name of Fashner on the back, because I had to pay him some private moneys which I had borrowed from him—it certainly looks like my writ<lb/>ing on the back; I should not like to swear it is not—I did not pay the money with the note, because it was a biggish note; besides, I only had to pay the man about £40—I might have paid him by a cheque on my bank, but as I had the money I paid it to him—the payments by one Gleitzmann appearing in the cash-book, £62 and another amount, were by his brother—Kaplin has not a brother, too; but his payments in August are only small items—perhaps he did not want to give me any more, or something of the kind.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known him 12 to 15 years—I have been a buyer to Jay's for the last 7 years—he has been selling goods to them about 15 or 16 years—I have been there 17 years, and he has been selling goods to them through me for about 7 years—I should say that trans<lb/>actions are never carried through me beyond a certain amount, I report on them, and they are carried through by the directors—they tru t to ray reports, decidedly—the amount of the defendant's sales to Jay's have not very largely increased during the last few years—complaints have been made in a jocular way that nobody else could sell to Jay's except the defendant—my employers now know of my monetary transactions with him; they did not know before the matter was brought into Court—these are the only two transactions between me and him—I dare say there has been another, but I do not remember—I may have lent him money before, but I will not swear to it—I can explain my reasons for the borrowings and lendings between us, the seller and buyer to a large firm—I cannot say if he asked me for open cheques; he might have done so; he has been in the neighbourhood—I have no other banking account except that in the Hearts of Oak Building Society, Deposit Branch.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I lost a child 2 years ago from diphtheria—the sanitary authorities ordered the drains to be done up within a very short time—my wife was rather weak, she was near her confinement, and the doctor told me that I should have to go out of my house during the rebuilding of the drains—I tried to find some apartments, but my wife objected to going into them—being French, she could not speak English very well—she pre<lb/>ferred to go home, but she could not do so—I went to several friends to see if they could oblige me, to give me shelter; but I did not succeed—the defendant called at my place of business, and I told him about my distress, and he then offered me a room in his house—he told me he had the painters there, he would have to communicate with his wife, and would send me a wire—I received that wire, and we were accepted and went there, staying during the rebuilding of the drains—when I left I asked him my indebtedness—he said, "Nothing"—I said if I could render him a service at any time I should be very pleased to do so—this letter (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is one that I wrote after staying at his house.</p>

Marylebone—he then became unconscious again, and he died at 7.45 the same morning—I sent a telegram to the address he gave, and Mrs. Emily Wootton came to the hospital, where I saw her—I went with her to Sardinia-Buildings; we got there about 6 o'clock—I had been there at about 4.30—we went to Boom 84 and saw the prisoner—he opened the door—he only had his shirt on—I told him a man named Joseph Wootton had been found on the brick rubbish below his window—I asked him if he could give any explanation, whether he had been in his room—his reply was to the effect that he did not know anything of him—I noticed there were blood-stains on the right sleeve both of his inner and outer shirt—I saw a large fresh blood-stain just under the bolster of the bed—I saw a recent scratch on his forehead—I asked him how he accounted for the blood—I pointed out to him that it was recent—he said he had had a fight with Laurie Dunovan two nights before out<lb/>side the Caledonian public-house, at the corner of Drury Lane and Kemble Street—I said, "The blood on the sheets feels damp"—he made no reply—I noticed the curtain over the window was pulled down en the right-hand side—there had been a pair hanging over the window; the string was broken—the bottom of the left curtain was shut out under the lower part of the window, which was closed down on it—the beading on the right side of the window was off, and lying against the left side of the window inside the room—two square hampers stood by the window on the top of the other; each of them was about 8 in. high—on the left of them were two chairs against the wall, with some half-bushel baskets on them—one chair was partly in front of the window—there was a picture frame face downwards on the floor, and as I lifted the frame up the broken glass fell on the floor—I raised the lower sash of the window, and in the dust im<lb/>mediately below the sill I noticed recent finger-marks on the woodwork, which went downwards on to the stonework, and there was a stain almost in the centre of the sill, as if a heavy weight of flesh had been dragged over it—on the brickwork under the sill there were several scratches going up and down, as if something had been struggling to hold; on to the window ledge—I found two felt-hats in the room; I asked the prisoner who owned them—he said, "They are mine"—as I was examining the hats, he said, pointing to the one with the black band, "I bought that for mother's funeral"—I asked him to fit them on, and the one with the black band fitted him perfectly, the other did not—I told him to dress himself, and that he would have to accompany me to the station—he dressed himself, and I sent him to the station with a policeman—I told him he would be charged with injuring Wootton, who was alive then—the prisoner said, "I came home about 9.20 p.m. I had been in the Constitution public-house with my brother George and his wife Laurie Dunovan was in the public-house at the same time.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100048"/>
               <p>the base about 5 in. long, and the sides 4 in. and 3 in.—the wound ran through the muscles down to the bone—all the marks were quite recent—the man's nose had been bleeding when he was brought in—there was no mark of a blow—a fall such as this would be quite sufficient to rupture some blood vessels—on March 4th I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem examination</hi>—I found the 12th dorsal vertebra was completely shattered, so as to allow the adjoining vertebra, the one above and the one below, to come together—the spinal cord was completely ruptured—the 11th rib was broken, and a portion penetrating the right lung—there was a considerable amount of bruising along the spine—the cause of death, in my opinion, was shock due to the rupture of the spinal cord, and the other injuries—the injury to the buttock could be caused by a fall on to a brick from a height—I think the fall of 36 ft. from the sill to the ground would account for the injuries—he must have fallen in a semi<lb/>sitting position—he would not have been able to move his lower limbs at all after the fall—the wound on the toe looked as if it had been caused by rubbing against a rough surface—I think it could be caused by a man with bare feet trying to get foothold against the side of a brick wall—the grazes oould be caused by scraping over the surface of a stone window sill—the man's measure<lb/>ment after death was 5 ft. 7 in.—it is a little longer after death—he was a strongly built man, just wasting a little, owing to age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The wound on the toe could have been caused by hard pressure over a rough surface—the grazes on the face and forehead could have been caused by touching something in the fall—the shock of the fall is quite sufficient to cause the nose bleeding.</p>

I am divisional surgeon to the E Division of Police, and live at 3, Southampton Street, Strand—on March 3rd, about 9 a.m., I was called to Sardinia Buildings, Little Wild Street—I noticed stains of blood on the bed and bedding in Room 84; it was not quite dry—the dust on the window-sill was rubbed off in patches—the mortar on the wall below the window was apparently rubbed off, present<lb/>ing a white surface which distinguished it from the other portions—I went to the place where the body was found, and found some blood there—the same morning I examined the prisoner about 9 o'clock at the station as to his fitness to go before the Magistrate—he was calm and collected; he answered my questions; he was not under the influence of drink then; I cannot say that he was recovering from the influence of drink—I saw blood on the right arm of his shirt and under<lb/>vest, which was apparently recent—there was a stain on the right shoulder about 1 1/2 in. square, and 3 or 4 small stains on the right arm—the blood might have come there 6 or 8 hours before my examination.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100050"/>
               <p>on March 30th, about 8 p.m., I went to the prisoner's restaurant in Rath<lb/>bone Place, and asked him if a woman had been there—he said, "No"—I said, "I have just given her 15s.—she went into the house, and I wanted to catch her" he said, "If you advance two steps further I shall shoot you"—I advanced, and he fired, but did not hit me—I was not sober—I turned round and ran away, and had some more drink, and went back to the prisoner and said, "If you will get me my money back I will say no more about it"—he struck me across the head with this stick (<hi rend="italic">Produded</hi>), and I was taken to the Middlesex Hospital—I went back and gave him in custody for assaulting me—I said nothing to the constable about shooting—I am all right now.</p>

               <p>he said, "They came here for money, and because I would not gire them money, they upset the till"—I asked them to come to the station and see the inspector, and the prisoner said, "I admit I fired it, but it was to frighten him, in self-defence"—going to the station, the prosecutor said that a revolver had been fired in the restaurant that night, but he did not say that it was fired at him—he charged the prisoner at the station with the assault with loaded firearms, and the prisoner said, "I fired in self-defence, to try to frighten him"—the prosecutor had been drinking; the prisoner was sober; the prisoner produced this revolver at the station, fully loaded; he said, "I re<lb/>loaded it in case they came again one bullet bad been discharged"—when the prosecutor charged the prisoner at the station, he said that a girl had been there and left 15s. for him, or I think it was that he gave her 15s.—he did not say that he went and asked for the change.</p>

I went to 25, Rathbone Place, where the prisoner was employed, and found a bullet mark about 5 ft. 5 in. from the ground on the right-hand side—it struck the wall very near the staircase, and appears to have glanced off—in a narrow passage like that it must have been fired obliquely at the wall—the prisoner's em<lb/>ployer, the proprietor of the restaurant, gave me this staff (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) and the prosecutor identified it.</p>

I will tell you later," or words to that effect—we had no more conversation about it at that time afterwards he showed me some stones in a piece of paper, towards the end of the week—I asked him once or twice afterwards what he had done with the jewels, and he said, "I will tell you later"—about 4 or 5 days afterwards he showed me a few small diamonds and some large white stones, and 3 or 4 oblong-shaped emeralds, loose, in a piece of tissue paper—there were about a dozen or 20 in all—he said, of his is part of the stuff which has been broken up"—he showed me a tiny scarf-pin, a sailor's cap; there was one pearl to form the crown of the Vap, and three small diamonds in the peak, like a naval officer's cap—he showed me nothing else—I saw a piece of broken end of a chain, with 6 or 7 brilliants, like Mrs. Selwyn had worn round her neck—I recog nised the back part of it—I do not remember what was in front when she wore it—he said there were some beautiful brooches, a bee, butterflies, and swallows, and diamonds; he did not say how many—he gave me no more definite description—he doubled up the pin and threw it down a water-closet in the back garden—a few days after that we had some words, and he said he was afraid some detectives were watching him—I do not know what became of the rest of the jewellery he had shown me; I saw no more of it—I knew at that time about Miss Bartlett, his supposed second wife, but I never met her till 2 or 3 weeks ago, 2 or 3 days before I appeared at Westminster Police-court—the prisoner lived At Mrs. Clarke's house—he was butler, and slept there—I knew that he</p>

I am the wife of William Bartlett, and live at 41, St. Mary's Square, Lambeth—in July, 1895, my daughter, Alice Louisa Bartlett, went through the form of marriage with the prisoner, but she continued to live at my. house—the prisoner did various things, he was a waiter at a night club, and butler to Mrs. Clarke, and manager of a public-house—from time to time he came to my house, and stayed with my daughter—I believed him to be a single man—he is de was scribed as a bachelor in the certificate—about the first two years he was not away, except at night—since then he has been away 2 or 3 weeks at a time—he has always said that he was away on business—we did rot know what he was doing—he told us that he was employed as a butler at Ovington Gardens—I read of the robbery in Brompton Square in the newspapers—the prisoner came home to my house one day early in October; we were talking, and I asked him if he had heard of the robbery at 4, Brompton Square—he laughed—I said, "You know something about this?"—he said, "Yes, I did it I let myself in with a latch-key, and in the hall I met a dog, which bit my hand"—I said, "You ought to have it cauterised"—he said, "I went ito the lady's bedroom, and opened the wardrobe doori and took the keys from under the case, and opened the box, and emptied the contents into my handkerchief, and replaced the case. There was a man waiting at the norner, and I gave him the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi>, It was nearly all broken up within</p>

               <p>an hour, and the <hi rend="italic">dud</hi> stuff was thrown into the Thames; it took me seven minutes to do it; I sent up the housemaid to do the lady's room when I came out, so that she should not miss me"—that was all he told me at that time—my daughter was present—the matter was not mentioned again between me and the prisoner, except once when he came home; he looked awfully worried, and I asked him what was the matter with him—he said, "So would you if you had gone through what I have done the—last few days"—this was November 19th, as far as I can recollect—he said he had been told that a woman was wearing the rings in the Strand, and he went home to the husband of this woman, and he nearly throttled him, a Mr. Collins—I have seen Mr. Collins, and know—there is such a person—I believe he is boots or something at the Hotel Cecil—the prisoner said, "If the rings were found upon her, it would mean five years for me"—I had no further conversation with him afterwards about this robbery, because he has not been home much—I first made a statement to the police on Monday, March 22nd—I had not seen Miss Ferris at that time—I went to Scotland Yard in connection with the robbery—we did not know then of the bigamy; I thought he was my daughter's husband—my husband is a wood-carver—Mrs. Lambert bad been to my house, but not Miss Ferris—Mrs. Lambert was the woman he ran away with—she told my daughter that he had gone away with <hi rend="italic">Tootsie</hi>, Miss Ferris.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to the police after I had heard of his carryings on with oiher women—I should not have said anything except that I thought he was a straightforward man—I would not have said anything if he had behaved himself rightly to my daughter; I should have had no cause to do so—I gave my statement when I went to Scotland Yard, about the second conversation; the one about Collins and the woman who was wearing the rings in the Strand, and the fight Shinn had with Collins; but I did not say anything about it at the Police-court because I was not asked—I did not know <hi rend="italic">Tootsie</hi> Ferris at that time—I knew the prisoner was living at 17, Ovihgton Gardens, but knew nothing what ever about 4, Brompton Square—it was only his own statement that made me connect Brompton Square with himself—I knew there had been a robbery there, and I said, "You have done it," and laughed at him, and he said, <hi rend="italic">"I done it</hi>"—I have heard him talk about different things he has been connected with—I do not suggest that he has ever been charged with any other offence, burglary, or any criminal offence—I have heard him talking about different things that he has done—I know he has been connected with a lot of fellows who have done things, burglaries and things, people who have been convicted, but not that he has been in them; I do not suggest that—I know that his associates have been thieves—he never said that he had been guilty of an offence of this kind before—there was no connection between him and this ad dress at all—I first knew of <hi rend="italic">Tootsie</hi> Ferris the Saturday as Mrs. Lambert came to my daughter's—Monday I went to Scotland Yard, and Tuesday or Thursday the same week I made the acquaint ance of Miss Ferris—it was to my house that Ferris came to give information to the police—a telegram was sent for her to come to my house—he told me the robbery did not realise as many hun<lb/>dreds</p>

               <p>as the things were supposed to be worth thousands—he told me that they were worth £3,000—I do not know who had set that value upon them—the lady had given evidence at the Court—the robbery was in September, and I did not see him until October—it was stated to be worth thousands, in the papers—I never heard or saw any of the pro<lb/>perty; he never gave any to my daughter or to me—all I know is about six £5 notes, which he gave to my daughter to mind—I cannot remember the date when he had them, but I know he went to Gatwick Races on the Saturday—he pawned things himself—he has had money to go about with so many women—my daughter has not had the money—I gave the £5 notes back to him again when he went to Gatwick Races—I cannot remember the date.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my parents at 41, St. Mary's Square, Lambeth—in July, 1895, I went through a form of marriage with the prisoner, and until recently I believed myself to be his lawful wife—he represented himself to be a bachelor when he was keeping company with me, and I believed him to be single—one day in last October he came to our house, and this robbery was mentioned—we had a conversation on general topics—I asked if he had read anything about the Brompton Square robbery, and he said that he had—I asked him if he knew any<lb/>thing about it—he laughed, and afterwards said, <hi rend="italic">"I done it</hi>"—he said he went in at the front door with a latch-key—hedid not say where he got the latch-key from—he said, "A dog snapped at me, and I went up into the bedroom, and opened the wardrobe, and found the keys of ths jewel-case, and opened it, and emptied the contents into a handkerchief; after that 1 locked the case, and replaced the keys, and came downstairs and went out again"—he said there was a man waiting to receive the jewellery at the corner of the street, and that he gave it to the man—I do not re member that he told me anything more about the matter—I never saw anything of the jewellery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He told me he was living with a woman at the time when he married me, but that he had parted with her—it was not Miss Ferris; it was the woman who really is his wife—I made no inquiries as to who the woman was; I believed him—he did not give me any reason why he told me about the robbery—he did not ask me to keep it quiet—I suppose he trusted me and also my mother, who was present—I had not heard of Miss Ferris at that time—I did not ask about the young woman who was at Ovington Gardens, where he was butler, nor inquire who were his fellow servants—I had hoard that Mrs. Selwyn used to visit Mrs. Clarke—I knew that the house at which the burglary had taken place was one that was known to him as being where Mrs. Selwyn lived, and that she visited Mrs. Clarke—I suspected him of the robbery from his manner when we asked him about it—I do not know why we asked him about it; it came up in conversation, that is all—I said I believed he had done it, simply from his manner—I decided to keep it quiet at first—I should not have told unless he had gone away with this woman—I did not ask him what he had done with the money he had made out of this big robbery—I had not the slightest suspicion he was keeping company with Miss Ferris—I did not want to know what he had done with the money—I held six £5 notes for him in October or November—he said that</p>

The information was first given on March 20th, at Scotland Yard, and it reached me that evening—Brompton Square is in my division—I had heard of the robbery atthe time—I was not in the division then—the police knew of it—on the following evening I went to St. Mary's Square, and I saw Mrs. And Miss Bartlett—I first saw Miss Ferris on the 24th—a statement had been made at Scotland Yard by Miss Bartlett, and that was how I got the information—on March 24th I received a communication, and went to 41, St. Mary's Square, and saw the witness Ferris—I had not seen her before—she made a statement, and I took a note of it—at that time I was not prepared to act, because I believed Miss Bartlett was the wife, and could not be called as a witness—he was first charged with this offence on March 27th, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I was with Sergeant Felton in the Old Kent Road, and saw the prisoner in a public-house—I said to him, "Is your name Shinn?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "We are police officers, and shall arrest you for stealing a quantity of jewellery on September 28th from 4, Brompton Square, the property of Mrs. Selwyn"—he said, "Right, I am with you"—he was conveyed to the Police-station in charge—on the way he said, "I was at 17, Ovington Gardens; I know nothing"—the charge was read over, and he made no reply.</p>

Ferris that I had done it—regarding the statements made by Miss Ferris, Mrs. and Miss Bartlett, saying that T had done this robbery, the only conversation that took place was at Miss Bartlett's house in front of her mother—I did not show Miss Ferris the jewellery, I never had it in my possession—as to the conversation with the Bartletts, this is what it was: about a fortnight or three weeks after the supposed robbery I went home as usual, and Mrs. Bartlett asked me if I had heard anything about it—I said I had heard all about it—Mrs. Selwyn. is a personal friend of Mrs. Clarke's—I was really relating the conversation between Mrs. Selwyn and Mrs. Clarke—I told them exactly what Mrs. Selwyn said—it seemed such a strange thing that someone had taken the key and walked upstairs—they suggested that I had done it in a joke, and I replied in a joke, "Yes, I did"—I was laughing at the time—we were very good friends at the time—that was merely jocular—I never said a word about the dog having scratched my hand—not a word was said about having my hand cauterised—I had not had my hand bitten by a dog, nor scratched by a tooth, nor touched in the slightest way—Miss Ferris did not bind up my hand for anything at all—it is not true that I ever kicked Miss Ferris downstairs, or rushed after her while going downstairs and kicked her—I never touched her in my life on any occasion, or used any violence of any kind at any time—I never gave six £5 notes to Miss Bartlett to take care of for me—I never had six £5 notes—as a matter of fact, I was in October and November very short of money—after leaving Mrs. Clarke's employment. I pawned my things from time to time to provide money—Miss Bartlett did pawn a Watch and chain of mine for £2 10s.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 30, Shepperton Road—I am the wife of Herbert Benjamin Williams, and the daughter of the prisoner—about 8.40 a.m on February 22nd I was in bed with my husband; he is the occupier of the house, and we have three rooms there—we sleep in the back room, and there are folding-doors—I heard someone turn the handle of the bedroom door—I called out, "Who is there?"—I received no answer—I called out again, and immediately the door was broken open, and my father entered the room—he took hold of my right hand, then commenced swearing—he said I was like my dirty——mother—then he took this large knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) from his pocket and plunged it into my side, and then pushed it in further—as I was getting over the bed I received</p>

               <p>another stab in my left breast—my husband rushed round the bed to get hold of my father, but my father pushed him under the mantel-piece, and I saw him try to rip my husband's stomach open—I caught hold of the knife and pulled it on one side, and was holding it, when my father pulled it through my hand, which was cut; he then pulled us out of the room into the passage—he is a very powerful man, and my husband had only just got up from a bed of sickness—I saw Mrs. Charlton, and said, "My father has stabbed mo in the side"; she opened the street-door and called for help—our room is on the level with the street—we all fell down in the passage, and I do not remember anything else—after a time I recovered, and was attended by a medical man—I never had any reason to complain against my father, but he had not been a kind father to me—he has threatened me before. On February 14th my mother came to me for protection from my father, and I let her stay a little while—she asked me to go to her home to get some of her things—my father came home while I was there; he told me to leave the things alone, and he insulted me, calling me dreadful names, and he threatened to take my life—I had to get protection; I went to the Police-court and took out a summons against him—he lives at Wheathampstead, East Lane.</p>

               <p>an office at Kingston—my private address is St. Clair, Hampton Road, Teddington—I am a Magistrate in Middlesex, Chairman of the Teddington district, and Clerk to the Kingston Guardians—my wife is still alive; for many years she has suffered from heart disease—on December 29th I found this letter and envelope (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) at my office—I was completely stunned at the time by it—I was advising one of my Committees at the time, and I was hardly able to go on—my first thought was of my home; I complied with the request, and when I got home I gave the letter to my wife, and told her that I had sent the money—I sent it to 554, Old Kent Road; 2 new £5 notes. (<hi rend="italic">This letter, signed "T.J.

Urgent letter awaits you at Kingston office.—<hi rend="smallCaps">ADAMS</hi>"—on the morning of January 6th I found this letter at the office, marked as the others, "Strictly private, most urgent."

Mr. Edgell can see you at the office to<lb/>day before I"—I sent that because I had no intention of having any correspondence with this correspondent, unless it was face to face—the appointment was not kept—the next I heard of it was on February 14th, when I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated February 13th, signed "C. J.

No other appointment"—the offices at 9, Fleet Street were my brother Harry's—I spoke to him about it, and he lent me his offices—on Saturday morning I went there; I was very late—I found my brother there, and the prisoner Fletcher was sitting at his table—I heard my brother say, "Write your name"—the prisoner took a pencil, and wrote something on this paper(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), "C. J. Adams"—my brother said, "Now write your own name"—he answered, "That is my name"—my brother said, "No; write your own name," and he again said, "That is my name"—my brother said, "What do you want?"—he replied, "Nothing"—my brother said, "Why are you here?"—he said, "In reply to your telegram," or "In answer to your telegram"—my brother said, "Do you retract the contents of those letters?"—he replied, "Yes"—my brother asked him to write a statement to that effect, which he declined to do—then I think he said, "Then there is nothing else?"—my brother replied, "Not that I know of"—Fletcher then went away—when I got home that night this telegram was handed to me, open, by my wife: "Shall bring living proof; in possession of wires, etc."—I was very much distressed, as my wife had opened it—I put myself into communication with the police—I wrote this letter on Sunday, the 19th.

               <p>me and my visitor—about 7.10 I heard footsteps downstairs, and I called from upstairs, "Who is there?"—I got the answer, "Adams"—I said, "Come upstairs to my room"—the prisoner Fletcher came up, very well dressed, walked into the room, and took a chair by the fire—as he came in I said, "What is your name?"—he said, "Adams"—before I could ask him a question he began to say how exceedingly sorry he was for all that he had done, and the letters he had written—I said, "But who are you? What is your name?"—he said, "Adams, the same as you saw at Fleet Street on Saturday, but I found I was talking to the wrong gentleman"—I said, "But who are you, Adams? What do you know about me?"—he said, "I am exceedingly sorry for the pain I have caused you; if you will help me this time, may God Almighty strike me dead if you ever hear of me again"—I said, "Are you the man who has been writing me these cruel and scurrilous letters and telegrams during the last six weeks?"—he replied, "lam sorry to say I am"—I said, "I must have some assurance that these persecutions will cease; I do not know you"—he repeated, "If you will only help me this time, I swear to God you shall never hear anything more of the matter"—I said, "I shall require something more than verbal assurance; will you sign an assurance to that effect?"—after some hesitation he said, "Yes, certainly "; I said, "Now pay attention to this which I have written," and I produced this document to him: "I hereby acknowledge the receipt of the second sum of £10 asked for in my recent letters and telegrams, and promise I will never molest you again or charge you with the same acts of in<lb/>decency"—I read that to him slowly and loudly, and he signed it in precisely the same way as he had written it at my brother's office, "C. J. Adams"—I told him that the effect of the past few weeks had quite upset the balance of my mind, and he expressed his regret—then I counted 10 sovereigns on to the table separately, so that the detectives might hear them—they were standing at the door; he picked them up, and entreated me to forgive him—I said, "I shall never forgive you; get out of my sight"—the detectives received him at the door—there was a short struggle, Magner said, "Are you Adams?"—he said, "No"—Magner said, "I heard you tell Mr. Edgell you were Adams; where is he?"—Fletcher said, "That is for you to find out"—he lit a cigarette just after that—since he has been in custody I have received another letter in the same feigned writing—I cannot say if that was before Cox was arrested—there was no address upon the letter; the date on the envelope is February 2 4th—it begins, "I cannot see an innocent man suffer; I wrote the letters."</p>

               <p>the 19th; under my advice, the letter dated February 19th was written by Mr. Edgell, making an appointment at his office on Tuesday, February 21st—on the Tuesday evening J attended at Mr. Edgell's office, with Sergeant Easter, to keep observation—about 7.5 Fletcher entered the lower part of the premises, and Mr. Edgell, who was standing on the landing, said, "Who is there?"—he got the reply, "Mr. Adams"—Mr. Edgell re<lb/>quested him to come upstairs, and while he was ascending the top flight of the stairs said to him, "Are you the man who has been writing me these menacing letters"—Fletcher said, "I am sorry to say I am"—Mr. Edgell said, "Come into my room"—they went into the room, and the prisoner said to Mr. Edgell, "I beg of you, dear Mr. Edgell, to forgive me; I was driven to do this through want, and I swear by God you shall never hear from me again"—Mr. Edgell said, "But I sent you £10 a short time ago," and he replied, "Yes, I know you did, and I would have left the country if I could"—Mr. Eldgell said, "But I do not know you, Adams; what do you know about me?"—ho replied, "Nothing"—then Mr. Edgell said, "Then who told you to write those letters and telegrams to me?"—he replied, "No one"—Mr. Edgell said, "What is your name?"—he replied, "Mr. Adams; I saw you at Fleet Street on Saturday last, but I found I was talking to the wrong gentleman"—Mr. Edgell said, "Your conduct during the past two months has been cruel, and you have completely broken my heart, and the effect on my heart has broken my nerves; do you still insist in what you say?"—he said, "No"—Mr. Edgell said, "Do you still insist on getting the £10 to buy you off this cruel persecution?"—Adams replied, "Dear Mr. Edgell, you give me this £10, and may God Almighty strike me dead if I ever trouble you again, and may He paralyse me if I do it; I know in my heart that you have been the victim of a most cruel accusation, but I was driven to make it through want"—Mr. Edgell said, "Is it likely I am going to comply with your demand?"—the prisoner said, "For God's sake, let me have £10, and I am out of the country to<lb/>morrow, and you shall never hear from me again"—Mr. Edgell said, "If I comply with your request I want some-thing to protect myself against you in writing; your verbal assurance is not sufficient for me that you will cease these menaces; I suggest to you that you give me your signature"—then Mr. Edgell read out a document which we had previously arranged, and the prisoner signed it—then Mr. Edgell counted out £10 in gold on to the table—I could hear it counted out—the prisoner put the money into his pocket and said, "Do you forgive me, Mr. Edgell?"—Mr. Edgell said, "No, I shall never forgive you for the wrong you have done me," and he directed him to leave his office at once—I and my companion met him outside the door—I told him we were police-officers, and should take him into custody for demanding money by menaces—he said, "Get out of the way; what do you mean?"—he struggled to get down the stairs—he was knocked down, and the money and several documents were taken from his band—I said, "What is your name?"—he said, "Find out"—I said, "Is your name Adams?"—he said, "No, it is not"—I said, "You just told Mr. Edgell your name is Adams"—he replied, "I tell you it is not"—I said, "Where is Adams, then?"—he replied, "That is for you to find out; I was told there was money to be got out of Mr. Edgell"—then he said, "I am only</p>

I went up to the first-floor landing at Mr. Edgell's offices—I gave directions that the door where Mr. Edgell and Fletcher were should be left open—I had no boots on, and I stood close to the door; I swear I could overhear every word which passed between them—I have made inquiries about Fletcher—I do not know that he was not destitute; he had 4d. on him—he said that in connection with Cox they were engaged in a picture business, and had just made £150, but they did not tell me where it was—when Mr. Edgell spoke to Fletcher he did not say that he came from Adams—he did not say that Adams was in a destitute condition—I did not hear him mention the name of Brooks, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Adams—Fletcher did not say he had come from Asanas for money from Mr. Edgell—he did not say, "I was told to sign what I was asked to sign"—I made the entry in my book before I left the room: Fletcher was still there—I did not hear the name of Brooks mentioned till I was at the Petty Sessions—I heard it mentioned between Fletcher and one of his friends—I went to Fletcher's house after his arrest, and saw Mrs. Fletcher—I did not take the name of Reuben Brooks; Easter did—an attempt has been made to arrest him—we had no evidence to go upon; an officer went to his address—I do not know that he was said to have gone to Scotland <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Waterloo Station—everything has been done by the police to arrest Brooks, as soon as in<lb/>formation was obtained—slight as it was, an application was made to the Magistrate, and every endeavour has been made to arrest him, and he would have been arrested I was not for certain other members—I do</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies—I produce the file of the West Australian (Gold District) Trading Syndicate, Ltd.—I have the file before me—that company was registered on February 20th, 1896—I have the memorandum before me—it was formed, among other purposes, for the export of goods between England and Australia—the capital of the company was £20,000, divided into 60,000 ordinary shares of 5s. each and 5,000 shares of £1 each; what would be called founders' shares—the registered offices of the company were at 19, Basinghall Street, E.C.—the signatories to the Memorandum of Association are witnessed by H. Bernard, 19, Basinghall Street, London, E.C., merchant—I produce, from the file, a special reso<lb/>lution of July 27th, 1896—it was passed on July 10th, and confirmed on July 27th, 1896—that was a resolution for winding up the syndicate, to reconstruct the company, and authorising the liquidators to enter into and approve an agreement with the new company, when incorporated—that resolution is signed by H. Bernard, as secretary—I also find on the file a consent by the syndicate to the registration of a new company in the name of the West Australian (Gold District) Trading Corporation, Ltd.; the same name, substituting corporation for syndicate—that reso<lb/>lution is signed by a Major-General Alfred Tulloch and Mr. Mills, as liquidators, and Hugh Bernard, as secretary—the consent is dated July 27th, 1896, also—I produce, also from the file, the return of the shareholders in the syndicate up to July 27th, 1896—chat return shows as issued, ordinary, 58,600; and lounders', 4,980; showing a total paid up, of £19,630—I don't mean that actually cash was paid up as it appears there, but shares of that value—according to this statement it shows cash was paid up—it should repre<lb/>sent cash—this is calls received that should be cash—it represents the shares are allfully paid in cash to that amount—this entry represents that cash had actually been received to that amount—it is signed by both the liquida<lb/>tors, and H. J. Squier, manager; Mills and Tulloch were the liquidators; Tulloch's signature is not his own signature; it is Tulloch; per Mills "; Mills signed for both himself and Tulloch—we should receive that; it is signed by the manager and one of the liquidators in a number of cases—if it is enough for one liquidator to sign, that is enough—we should not inter<lb/>pret the law to that amount; we should not know whether one had a power of attorney for the other or not—I should have thought in a matter of that kind you would not take such a course—I do not say in this case it is not right, but it seems to open the door to fraud—I find among the shareholders the name of Edward Lee, of 54 Waterloo Place,—he appears to hold 25 ordinary shares and 100 founders—there is the name of Louis Henry Goodman, of 212, Cromwell Road 650 ordinary shares and 100 founders'—I find the name of Edward Lee appearir gagain for 100 founders'</p>

               <p>shares more—they are £1 each—that would make 200 founders'—as far as we know, we believe that to be a mistake; Hugh Benard is down for ordinary 6,500, and 120 founders'; Bernard is next; 6,500 ordinary, 120 founders'; Herbert J. Squier, 2,568 ordinary, 304 founders'—that return is signed by Squiers as manager—I also produce the file of the West Australian (Gold District) Trading Corporation, Limited—that was a company registered on July 28th, 1896, the capital is £505,000, divided into 505,000 ordinary shares of £1 each, and 5 000 founders' shares, also £1 each—amongst the objects I find one was to ex<lb/>port goods to Australia, and other merchandise; a variety of things, and to take over all the contracts of the syndicate; that might be by agree<lb/>ment—at Clause 3 of the Articles of Association I find an agreement referred to—it does not mention the date; it refers to the parties, and says that a draft has been initialled; it refers to an agreement—I have several agreements on the file; I have one of July 27th, 1896—that is an agreement whereby the corporation takes over the assets and liabilities of the syndicate; by that agreement the holder of an ordinary syndicate share of 5s. becomes entitled to 2 shares in the corporation of £1 each, and the holder of a founders' share in the syndicate becomes entitled to 20 ordinary shares in that corporation; there were no founders'—he gets twenty ordinary shares for each founder's share, and as to each 200 ordinary shares of the corporation so acquired gives the holder of the 200 shares a right to apply for a £1 founder's share in the corporation, at par—that agreement is signed by Edward Lee and Goodman as directors, and by Hugh Bernard as secretary of the syndicate; it is also signed by Louis H. Goodman as a director of the corporation, and by Tulloch and Mills as liquidators of the syndicate—annexed to that agreement I find another agreement dated July 10th, 1896—a copy of one dated July 10th—that is an agreement between Henry Goodman, Joseph Edward Lyall, and Joseph Chapman of the one part, and the syndicate of the other part—that contract relates to an ore disintegrating process—it is not the same name as it was known by afterwards—the Ore Atomic it is called through the correspondence—Article 76 of the corporation gives the names of the first directors of the corporation, as "Louis Henry Goodman, Sir Edward Lee, and Dr. Charles F. Ogilvie"—the registered offices of the corporation are—28, Basinghall Street, London, E.C.—I also produce the order to wind up the corporation, dated January 25th, 1897—they were Bowes, Scott, and Weston, carrying on business as engineers and contractors.</p>

The return of July 28th, 1896, shows you that it was lodged at Somerset House on September 21st 1896—a good deal later the annual return of the syndicate, dated July 28th, was lodged, September 21st, 1896—it ought to be lodged within seven days—the question might arise about its being in liquidation at that time—whoever received it ought to have seen that it was out or time—we should not take proceedings; we should receive the document—it should have been filed within the first few days of August—I do not see any endorsement referring to the agreements mentioned as being signed by Bernard—the solicitors to the company, Messrs. Sutton, Ommanney, and Rendall lodged them at our office; it does not follow that they prepared them—it does not bear their names on the back; there is nothing on the endorsement to connect them with it; in no part of it—their names are written on the front, "Filed by Sutton, Ommanney, and Rendall."</p>

I am a farmer at Hill House, Chigwell, Essex—in March, 1896, I received by post the prospectus which is pro<lb/>duced of the West Australian (Gold District) Trading Syndicate—having read it, I applied for 100 ordinary shares and 5 founders' shares—this is my application form—I enclosed with this application form my cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) for £17 10s.—I had notice that those shares were all allotted to me—on March 31st I signed the further cheque for £12 10s., the amount payable on allotment—in July of the same year I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi> newspaper of the prospectus of the West Australian (Gold District) Trading Corporation—about the same time I received a dividend on the shares in the syndicate at the rate of 100 percent—I thought it paid better than farming—about the same time I received by post a copy of the prospectus of the new corporation—I filled up the form in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi>—I had read the prospectus in the news-papers; it wan similar to that—enclosed with it was the printed report of the speech made by the chairman, Mr. Goodman, at the meeting on June 18th—I read the statement in the prospectus that there was already a large number of depots in full working operation; that the syndicate had already shipped £60,000 worth of goods to Western Australia, and that they had already made profits equal to twice the amount of their capital; and that they had made profits sufficient to pay a dividend many times more than 100 per cent.—I read the statement in the report made by Sir Edward Lee to the effect that he knew of one deal alone which gave them sufficient profit to pay this dividend—I believed that about Sir Edward Lee; I thought with a man with a handle to his name that there was something genuine about it—I filled up an applica<lb/>tion form for the allotment to me of 300 ordinary shares in the corporation (<hi rend="italic">The document was handed to the witness.</hi>); this is my signature—that was the number I was entitled to under the agreement—I became entitled to one founders' share in the corporation as the holder of more than 200 shares at par, and paid £1—I got my certificate of my shares some time in November</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100082"/>
               <p>—in addition to the shares I became entitled to under the scheme, I applied for a further 50 ordinary shares in the corporation, at £1 premium, and I sent a cheque for £25 to pay for them, and a further cheque for £25 on allotment, and two further cheques for £25 each; that completed the pay<lb/>ments—that made another £100 I paid for those shares—I did not get any more dividends; they are a long while coming—I got the certificate for the shares with the large red seal on it—the next thing I heard of it was that it was being wound up—I saw the advertisement of the prospectus in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi>; that was all I saw—I am not certain if this address of Mr. Goodman that was sent out with the prospectus was not contained in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi>; I could not say now—I could not say if on the prospectus of the corporation Mr. Bernard's name does not appear—I was asked at the Police-court whether that was so; I was not certain whether it was there or not—I cannot say for certain whether it was there or not—I cannot tell whether in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi> there was any notice of this speech; I cannot say so long back as that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Apart from the prospectus of the corporation, I think I saw a report in one of the financial papers—they find their way down to Chigwell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow and live at 39, Aden Grove, Stoke Newington—I got a copy by post of the prospectus of the West Australian (Gold District) Trading Corporation, Limited—I think I have it here—that is what I received—that has got on the back "The Western Australia (Gold District) Trading Corporation, Limited; capital £505,000—it has the prospectus inside, with a sheet for a form of application and a report of a meeting of the Western Australia (Gold District) Trading Syndicate, headed "West Australian (Gold District) Trade Syndicate, Limited, an important extension in view," and notes on the progress of trade. in the Colony of West Australia—I read those papers—I thought it a good investment—I noticed the statement about the dividend, the 100 per cent. dividend, and the statement as to the profits that had been made; I read it all through—in reliance on the statements in these documents, I applied for 5 ordinary£1 shares at £1 premium in the corporation, and I paid £2 10s. on application in cash at the Capital and Counties Bank—the shares were allotted to me; I paid up the balance of £7 10s. in full in cash—I have my certificate—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), but I have been looking for it many times—I am afraid it is useless.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired Major-General of the Bengal Staff Corps—I was a director of the West Australian (Gold District) Trading Syndicate—a friend of mine in the City invited me on the board—I was introduced by Mr. Dalby Walsh, who introduced me to Mr. Goodman—I had some conversation with Mr. Goodman before I agreed to go on the board—he told me that the company was being formed for trading purposes in West Australia, a little syndicate of about £20,000, I think—he told me he would qualify me for a director—he gave me 100 founders' shares in the syndicate—it was 100 original shares—he told me he would give me 100 ordinary shares, but he gave me 100 founders' shares instead—I don't think there were any articles of association of this company—I don't think there was any</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100083"/>
               <p>qualification required for a director—I do not know whether I did ask or not whether there was any qualification: yes, I think I did, and I think I was told there was no qualification—he made me a present of these shares—having become a director, I attended the meeting of the syndi<lb/>cate—referring to the minute-book. the first meeting of the board of directors was held on February 24th at 19, Basinghall Street—Goodman, the defendant, and Mr. Senior, a director, were present—on Exhibit 16, page 22, it says, "In the absence of Sir Edward Lee, the election of the board of directors was deferred"—I cannot tell you what was said about the absence of Sir Edward Lee—I am not quite certain about Sir Edward Lee being contemplated as a director on February 24th—I know there was a question about electing the chairman of the board of directors—there were only us three present, myself, Goodman, and Senior—as a matter of fact, we did not elect a chairman; I always thought the managing director, Mr. Goodman, was the chairman—it was resolved at that meeting that two directors should form a quorum—I remember that we resolved that the defendant, Mr. Hugh Bernard, be appointed manager in London for the company—we also resolved that Mr. C. D. Napier Grant should be appointed general manager in Australia—I do not know whether Sir Edward Lee was present; I recollecc that Mr. Goodman was made managing director, subject to the approval of Sir Edward Lee—I was put into the chair always because Goodman was managing director and chairman—I was acting for the time, because he said he could not take the chair when he was managing director—I do not know whether I was chairman on the first day Sir Edward Lee was not present—looking at the last minute, I see that the draft prospectus was submitted and con<lb/>sidered, and various alterations made therein; I remember that—I do not remember any of the alterations that were made in the prospectus—I do not know that some paragraphs were cut out of it—I do not re<lb/>member what the alterations were—we had another meeting on the next day, February 25th, and myself, Mr. Goodman, and Mr. Senior were again present—looking at the minute, "Letter from Sir Edward Lee, dated February 24th,1896, was read, and instructions given to the secretary to write and acknowledge receipt of the same, and to state our regret at his inability to accept an appointment on our board," I recollect that that did take place—the next minute is, "The draft prospectus as altered at the last meeting was submitted, altered, and finally approved by the board, and a copy was initialled by the directors for the purposes of identification"—I recollect that—that is the one that was initialled by the directors on that occasion—I see my own initials on it and the others—the next meeting was on February 28th, and I find at that meeting that myself, Mr. Goodman, Mr. Senior, and Sir Ed ward Lee were present as directors—I think that that was the first time that Sir Edward Lee attended—there is a minute, "Sir Edward Lee not having been present at the previous meet<lb/>ings held on February 24th and February 25th, the minutes of such meetings were read over, and Sir Edward Lee having signified his approval of such minutes, initialled the same"; that took place—"Copy of the company's prospectus, dated February 25th, 1893, as approved at the last meeting, was finally approved and authorised to be issued, and a copy of such prospectus was signed by all the directors for the purpose of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100084"/>
               <p>identification"—that same prospectus was then signed, instead of being initialled simply—all our signatures are upon it, including Sir Edward Lee's—Mr. Goodman at that meeting was appointed managing director—I remember it was resolved that three directors should form a quorum instead of two, on the motion of Mr. Senior—at the next meeting, on March 9th, myself, Mr. Goodman, Mr. Senior, and Sir Edward Lee were present—at that meeting the agreement between the company and Mr. C. D. Napier Grant was submitted and agreed to, by which Mr. Grant's salary was fixed at £750 per annum and 2 per cent. com<lb/>mission on the net surplus profits of the syndicate, after the payment of a dividend of 10 per cent. on the ordinary shares, with an additional bonus such as the directors might think fit to vote him; and Mr. Latham was also appointed engineer and surveyor at that meeting; and Mr. H. J. Squier, the defendant, was appointed buyer to the company—at the next meeting, on March 11th, the same four, Mr. Good-man, Sir Edward Lee, Mr. Senior, and myself were present—that meeting was held at the Café Royal, Regent Street; and the power of attorney at that meeting was handed to Mr. Grant to go to Australia—Mr. Grant was present at that meeting; it was a farewell entertainment to Grant before he went out—at the meeting on March 26th, myself, Mr. Goodman, and Sir Edward Lee were present, and also the defendant, Bernard—at that meet<lb/>ing Bernard was appointed secretary to the company in the place of Mr. Slater, who was prevented by ill<lb/>health from taking up the appointment—I always considered him as the secretary; I think I considered him to be manager as well; both, I think—he was appointed manager at the first meeting; and at the same meeting he was appointed secretary—the Capital and Counties Bank was the bank of the company—here is the 4th minute: "Be instructed to pay all the cheques paid on behalf of the company on any banking account, whether the account is overdrawn by the payment thereof or in credit"—that was the instruction given to the bank; provided they were signed by any one director and countersigned by the secretary—I do not know why nothing is said there as to the inducement for the Capital and Counties Bank to act in such an unbanking-like way, to cash any cheques presented to them, whether the account is overdrawn or not I was not chairman—the next minute but one says: "That the bank be instructed to treat all statements acknowledging the correctness of this com pany's accounts with the bank, of all receipts for the delivery of vouchers, &amp;c., which are expressed to be made on behalf of the company as having been duly made, provided they are signed by the secretary for the time being"—I do not know that I proposed it—it does strike me as being rather an extraordinary resolution; it did not at the time—I recollect at the meeting of March 26th a letter was brought up telling us Mr. Senior had re<lb/>signed his directorship—I recollect a letter from Mr. Senior being pro<lb/>duced by the secretary, announcing that he wished to resign—the resigna<lb/>tion was accepted; I am sure of that—I think this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I think this letter was read on March 26th, to the best of my belief—at the same meeting I remember the resolution which is in the second minute, that the secretary is instructed to give notice of the allotment of shares to all applicants; and there was a proof of a letter of abotment submitted and approved by the directors—the allotment of shares was, I think,</p>

               <p>left to the secretary to allot to everybody who applied for them—I do not think the directors ever met for the purpose of deciding on the allotment—our next meeting after March 26th was on June 2nd—myself, Mr. Goodman, and Sir Edward Lee were present—"The minutes of the last meeting, held on March 26th last, were read and signed. Letter, dated March 26th,1896, from Mr. L. H. Senior notify<lb/>ing his desire to resign his position on the Board of Directors, was read, and it was unanimously agreed and resolved to accept this gentleman's resignation. The secretary was instructed to notify Mr. L. H. Senior to this effect"—I think I was wrong when I said it was done at this board meeting; I think this is right here—June 2nd was not, in fact, the first time that I heard of Mr. Senior's resignation; I had heard it before—I was wrong when I stated it was brought forward at that meeting; I recollect now there was delay between them—I heard of it, I think, at that time, but there was a delay in bringing it forward somehow or other—I cannot explain the delay; I do not recollect it, but I know there was some delay in this way; at that same meeting, June 18th was appointed for the statutory meeting of the company, and on the same day as the statutory meeting there was a meeting of the directors at the office of the company—I think that was before the statutory meeting—Mr. Goodman, Sir Ed<lb/>ward Lee, and myself were present—at that meeting, "It was proposed by Sir Edward Lee, and seconded by Major-General Tulloch, and was unanimously resolved, that a dividend at the rate of 100 per cent. per annum for the 3 months ending May 24th be, and hereby is, declared, and that this resolution be notified to the shareholders of the company at the statutory meeting to be held on this date at Winchester House, Old Broad Street"—I can give only an explanation of the ground upon which I seconded this motion by a telegram that I saw, that is all—that was produced by Mr. Goodman to show that this amount had been made in Australia to pay for this; I do not know how it was done nor anything else.</p>

Goodman having retired, it was agreed that the price to be paid for this concession and patent right should be, and is hereby fixed——at"—I do know why it was left blank, I am sure; I cannot tell you—I did not fix the price; I do not think we fixed the price at that time—that is why we left it blank probably—I do not know; there was something happened—I under<lb/>stood that Mr. Goodman was interested as a vendor in this process—I for<lb/>get what the price was exactly—it was £30,000, I think, in cash, and something in shares; about 120,000—I know the price was afterwards fixed at £30,000 in cash and 120,000 ordinary shares in the new corporation, and 1,200 founders' in the new corporation—I went down to the place where this ore atomic reduction was being shown, and saw the process going on there—I thought, myself, if it it were really all right it would be something splendid—they said it was all right—I went down with Mr. Goodman to the place at Battersea, or somewhere there; one of the wharves there—I do not know who it was there—I saw the process—I saw the ore, at least the stone, being thrown into this place, and coming out by some wonderful process, not in gold; it came out in powder, and the gold and everything else was in that—I had nothing to do but go and pick it up, so long as you had the stone—I do not know where the stone was that was put in or who put the gold in the stone—I thought it was all right; I thought it was honest enough—I saw a whole lot, some hundred-weights, like that—they said it was all right down there—I was appointed one of the liquidators of the syndicate, for the purpose of its being wound up, in order to form the new corporation; I and Mr. Mills were appointed liquidators—I did not know what that meant; it was given to me, I thought, as a bonus kind of thing—Mr. Mills was an accountant and everything else; he knew all about these things—I did not expect to get anything out of it; there was 50 guineas attached to it, that is all—I never got my 50 guineas—I forget whom I asked, one of those sharp fellows down there; they are the ones—I think it was the Official Receiver; I would not say a word against Counsel—I had nothing to do with the new corporation—they never asked me to be a director—I did not know there was a chair to be filled; they did not ask me—I held 100 founders' shares in the syndicate, and that entitled me to 2,000 ordinary shares in the corporation—I did take up 10 founders' shares in the corporation, and paid cash for them—I did not take up the 2,000 ordinary—as a director of the syndicate I had nothing to do with the shares; I neither bought nor sold, or anything else—I had my 100 founders' shares, and I kept them—I might have got £35 a piece for them if I liked to sell out—I had nothing to say to that when I was on the syndicate—when the corporation was formed I became a shareholder only in the corporation, and at the outset I bought four of the original syndicate's founders' shares, for which I paid £36 a-piece, £140—I think that was just after the corporation was formed—I bought them from the manager of the bank down at Ealing, and I have those shares at the present moment in my possession—then I went in for 500 ordinary shares in the corporation, for which I paid £2 2s. 6d. or thereabouts; I am not certain; something</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100089"/>
               <p>over £2 a-piece—Mr. Squier led me to buy those 500 ordinary shares in the corporation; he came up and told me one day to go and buy, and I bought—I was sitting in my office; he came up and said, "Just buy," and I did; I went and bought; they were then at two guineas or £2 2s. 6d., and I had nothing to do with shares except when they got to between. 10s. and 12s., and then I sold out my holding to pay for them—I sold my shares that I held to pay for the differences—there was a settling day, and I had to sell for 10s. what I had paid £2 2s. 6d. for; but the others that I bought, the founders' shares, I hold them to the present moment—some were sold at 10s., and some at 11s., and some at 12s.—I had a great many more; I sold the 2,000 to pay for them, but I had no dealing of any kind any more in that way—I have said more than once that I had ultimately 200 guineas for my services as a director—I think that was by a resolution at the meeting of June 18th—I remember at a meeting of the shareholders on July 10th Mr. Goodman again made a speech—at that meeting it was proposed that the remuneration of the directors be the sum of 200 guineas each, and of the chairman 250 guineas—when that resolution was passed Mr. Goodman took the benefit of being the chairman—I got 200 guineas and he got 250 guineas—this is the cheque by which my fees were paid—it is a cheque drawn by Bertie Squier, the defendant, on the Bank of Scotland—I do not know why Bertie Squier paid my fees of 200 guineas as a director—he banks with the Capital and Counties Bank—I cannot account for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MUIR</hi>. I was introduced to Mr. Goodman by Dalby, Walsh, and Co., I think—I do not know, I am not certain of that—it was through Dalby, Walsh and Co.—I do not know exactly what they are called, accountants or something—I do not know if they keep a list of directors in want of employment; I do not know anything about that—I do not know how Mr. Goodman found me out—I do not know how Dalby, Walsh and Co. found me out, we met together somehow or other—I did present Mr. Walsh with a gold watch or something of that sor:—I think I gave this watch just when the corporation was formed—I know now that no qualification was necessary for me to become a director of the syndicate—the first stipulation was to receive 100 shares in this company; Mr. Goodman very kindly gave me 100 founders' shares instead—I always thought the company was kept up and every<lb/>thing else by Mr. Goodman, he being a rich man and everything else—he told us he would provide the money—I do not know that he provided large sums of money—some one provided large sums of money—I was a director—I thought Goodman was supplying the money—I do not know who it was stipulated that I should have 100 shares in this company—it might have been Mr. Walsh, I did not anyhow—I do not know any<lb/>thing</p>

               <p>about Mr. Walsh also stipulating that he should himself receive 200 shares in this company—I do not know that he received 200 shares—I did not tell Mr. Goodman that it was not usual for the managing director of a public company to take the chair at the meetings of the board; my memory is quite clear on that subject—I do not know how often I visited the office of the compary while I was a director; I used to drop in there occasionally, not every day—I do not know how many times a week; 3 or 4, 2 or 3—about 4 times—I also visited Sharwood's warehouse twice. I think; that was all, to inspect the goods that were being ordered for Western Australia—that was a place where they had preserved provisions, tinned foods, and so on—I believe there were large quantities of those foods ordered and sent out to Australia—I also went to Messrs. Bowes, Scott, and Weston to see the Krom rolls at Battersea; I saw them at work; the Krom rolls which had been ordered for the company, and which were sent out to Western Australia—the place where I saw the ore atomic being worked out was not at Limehouse—none of the companies of which I had previouslv been a director were gold mining companies—I was in the Bengal Staff Corps—gold-bearing quartz is crushed in the Krom rolls—I suppose that is an expensive form of machinery—this particular consignment cost a lot of money, I should think—it consisted of putting the quartz into a retort and applying heat and gases to it, so far as I know—I do not know about the process, but the stuff went out from the retort into a lot of water, and separated there—I understood it become friable by means of that process in a very short time—I should think it was very much cheaper than being crushed by machinery—I do not know much about it—I did not know that the patents were certified to, by Mr. Fletcher Moulton and Mr. Bous<lb/>field—I do not know whether I saw a copy of the prospectus of the cor<lb/>poration; I do not think I did; I do not think I ever got a copy of it—I was a party to the resolution to buy this process on behalf of the syndi<lb/>cate—I do not think the solicitor to the syndicate was present at this meeting on July 9th, when we resolved to buy this process—I was present at the meeting on June 18th, when the 100 per cent. dividend was announced—on that occasion there was, in an ante<lb/>room to the room in which that meeting was held, an exhibition of the goods which the com<lb/>pany were sending out to Australia—I think those goods were inspected by a number of people who were present at the meeting—I was present, but they did not want much explanation—I know Mr. Dawes, of Ealing; he is a particular friend of mine—I do not remember showing Mr. Dawes a copy of the telegram which I said, in my opinion, justified the declara<lb/>tion of 100 per cent. dividend—I told him about it, and he is a man who now has a share or shares in his possession—I told him about the telegram—I did not show him a copy—I think the question of 100 per cent. divi<lb/>dend was frequently discussed between the directors—we did not have any figures placed before us—I did not have a statement placed before me by Mr. Squier and Mr. Bernard, showing that on a sale of 800 tons of iron they estimated a profit of £1,200—I cannot say what was the material myself and my fellowdirectors had which justified the declaration of 100 per cent. dividend—we did not consult the officers of the syndicate—I only went on the telegram presented by Mr. Goodman, and I trusted</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILDEY WRIGHT</hi>. I was told I was to have 100 shares given to me, and Mr. Goodman kindly gave me 100 founders' shares in place of the ordinary shares—I believed that to be a personal gift from Mr. Goodman to me; as a matter, of course, it must be—I bought that Mr. Goodman's own money paid for those shares—I had not the least idea whatever that that money was drawn from the funds of the syndicate—I believe in the same way that Mr. Goodman had made a present of the money to purchase 100 shares for Sir Edward Lee—I did not know at the time when I first joined the board whether any qualifica<lb/>tion in holding shares was or was not necessary to me as a director; I do not think there was anything about it—I did not know at that time whether any due qualification as regards share holding was necessary as a director; there was no qualification required—at that meeting of February 24th I did not understand that earnest efforts were being made to induce Sir Edward Lee to join the board—I suppose that Sir Edward Lee had been asked to take a director's place—I thought he had been asked—from the very first I believed Mr. Goodman to be a very wealthy man—I believed him to be also a man of large business experience and capacity—he always represented himself to be so, and I thought I was justified in trusting to him and following his lead—Mr. Squier and Mr. Bernard, I believe, were recommended to the board for their various appointments by Mr. Goodman—that was done in my presence, I think—from the very first to the very last Mr. Goodman took the entire management, control, and direction of the company, and as managing director everything that he suggested was practically accepted by me and my co directors—I do not know whether Mr. Goodman said that if the public did not subscribe for all the shares open to them he was in a posi<lb/>tion to take the whole of the balance of the shares up, and would do so with his own money—I trusted to him fully as, being a moneyed man, and as you call it, a one-man company, I thought he was wholly and solely taken up with furthering the company's interests, and paying money whenever it was wanted—I do not think Mr. Goodman told me that if the public failed to take up all the shares open to it he would take up, either in his own name or in other names, the whole of the shares, and pay for them—I remember the second meeting of the board, when a letter was read from Sir Edward Lee declining a seat on the board, and I know that shortly after that he reconsidered his decision and consented to become a director—I cannot say whether he told me that the two factors that chiefly influenced him in reconsidering his decision were, first, his implicit faith in Goodman's honour and business capacity; and, secondly, the fact that I myself, a man of my position, had consented to join the board—I do not know that it would rather have surprised me if</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100092"/>
               <p>I had heard a statement that another man had joined the board because I was on it—I may have said at Bow Street: "I do not know if I had heard of Mr. Senior's resignation before the meeting of June 2nd "; I get confused—I do not think I ever had any conversation with Sir Edward Lee or Mr. Goodman about Mr. Senior's resignation—I had seen several telegrams, or parts of telegrams, or cablegrams, before June 18th, showing, to my mind, that a profit was being made in Western Australia—I do not know whether I saw the original telegrams or not; I am not certain about it, they may have been original telegrams or copies for all I know—I recollect something about seeing either a cablegram or the copy of a cablegram about the prospects being encouraging, but the other part of the telegram about small remittances creating a bad impression with the Bank in Australia I do not remember anything about—I do not remember ever being shown that part of the cablegram which related to the unfavourable impression created by small remittances; that last bit of it is all I remember—I do not know whether, when copies were shown me, they were copies of the whole, or parts, of the telegrams that were received—I cannot say that I saw or heard of the prospects being encouraging and so on after the date of the telegram of April 30th, 1896—I do not think I ever saw any of the private letters sent by Mr. Grant in Australia, either to the syndicate or to Mr. Goodman, but I may have seen one or two of the public ones—they were long letters for the most part—I saw the whole of the letters—I cannot recollect the contents of any of them—I do not think I ever saw this telegram of May 9th. "Depot and Banking Account here. I have not been able to make any definite arrangement. I have not sufficient money in hand. Most strongly advise you to remit by telegraph"—I do not think I ever heard of this cablegram being sent to Grant; "You must not rely on receiving remittance until established, Perth"—I saw the whole of this telegram: "Everything finally arranged, offices Barrack Street, Perth, and Hindes Chambers, Coolgardie, when can I rely upon remittance, great local demand, gal<lb/>vanished iron, at what price can you supply. Freight paid at port of shipment, I can sell large quantity £30 at per ton," or a copy of it—I think I saw the answer to that before it was sent out: "We can supply cast freight and insurance Fremantle £18; we have shipped 100 tons, what quantity will you require"—that was despatched from the syndicate office in London to Grant in West Australia—I do not recollect seeing this telegram from Goodman to Squier, "Sent you copy cable; have wired Walker's and put order in hand; profit, about £5,000"—I think I saw some telegram that distinctly had the words "£5.000 profit"—we did not declare anything until we saw the telegram—Mr. Goodman did not tell me about June 18th that he had investigated fully the affairs of the company, and was satisfied that marvellous profits were being made, and sufficient to pay that dividend—I do not remember his saying that he was going to make some startling statements at the meeting as to the profits that had been made which he had verified from his own in<lb/>vestigations—when I called at the office of the company I was led to believe, by what I saw, that a large business was being done—I never saw anything to cause me to believe that anything wrong or crochetty in any</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100093"/>
               <p>sense of the word was going on—there used always to be there large samples of goods apparently fit and proper for the Australian trade—I only saw what was there—I relied on Mr. Goodman as to their being fit things for the Australian trade—I saw from time to time invoices which conveyed to my mind that a large business was actually being done—I really cannot say whether all the cablegrams that had been received were produced at the board meetings and shown to the directors—I do not know whether all the telegrams sent to Australia were reported to the board—I constantly saw my co<lb/>director, Sir Edward Lee; in my judgment, he had the same opportunities as myself, and no more or less, of forming an opinion of the trade done and the profits earned—his conduct conveyed to my mind the impression that he was in every respect an honourable English gentleman—I never had the least reason to doubt his <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi> or honesty.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HALL</hi>, There was one office of the syndicate at 19, Basinghall Street, and another office of the corporation at 28, Basinghall Street—quite separate, but after the corporation was formed, 19, Basinghall Street was given up—when I first became acquainted with the company it was at 19, Basinghall Street—when you entered from the corridor Mr. Squier's room was the first room on the right, and then pas<lb/>sing on down the passage you came to the secretary's room, a further room to the left—the name on the door of the secretary's room, I think, was Slater—I do not know about his name being up as secretary; "Mr. Slater" was up there, that was all—Slater became ill, and then Mr. Bernard came on the scene and took his place, and continued to act for Slater until he was himself appointed by the resolution we have just heard—it was simply in the place of Slater that he was acting—I know nothing about Slater—when I first went there I saw the name of Slater, I think—I did not make inquiries as to who Slater was, or what his qualifications were for the post he occupied—at that statutory meeting the only part Mr. Bernard took was to read the notice convening it—he was ultimately appointed as secretary to the company, and continued that until the corporation was formed—I remember the resolution of the corpora<lb/>tion which appointed him manager—I have nothing to say as to the corporation; I was not on it—up to the time of the formation of the corporation Mr. Bernard simply occupied a secretarial position—I do not know that the resolution appointing him manager was on July 28th, or that on August 7th he went out to Australia—I know as a fact that he went to Australia, but I have nothing to say about the corporation at all; I was not a director or anything—I went three or four times a week to the office of the syndicate, at 19, Basinghall Street, and on a number of occasions saw a number of people with bundles and packages for business apparently; they used to come backwards and forwards—all these people who conducted the selling to the company, or whatever it was, were shown into Mr. Squier's room—I think none cf these people saw Mr. Bernard—I do not know whether the code<lb/>book was kept there or in Mr. Bernard's room; sometimes it was kept in Mr. Squier's room. I suppose, and sometimes in Mr. Bernard's room—I think the course of business in coding telegrams was, after a telegram had been sent in code to Australia, to put the code-form on the file, and that was subsequently decoded—</p>

               <p>supposing Mr. Squier kept the code-book, I cannot say that it would be he who prepared the code form—Mr. Bernard was quite a subordinate with regard to any business that was carried on—he was employed in the secretarial work, that was all—by "subordinate" I mean under the managing director, and that; subordinate, that is, to Mr. Goodman—I do not know that Mr. Goodman gave orders and that Mr. Bernard obeyed them—I had no knowledge of Mr. Bernard's doing any of the buying or selling business.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. I saw the prospectus of the syndicate—the object of the syndicate was to trade with Western Australia, and the ultimate object was to form a larger trading corporation—at the time I came in contact with Mr. Goodman I do not think the prospectus had been drawn; I think it was drawn afterwards—I do not know who pre<lb/>pared it; Mr. Hall, I suppose, the solicitor to the syndicate—I think Mr. F. J. O'B Hale was present at the first meeting I attended—the prospectus was gone through, and the different parts considered; and it was arranged that there was to be a reprint of it before the next meeting—at that time I appreciated that if this was to be a trading company with Western Australia somebody would require to be sent there—and accordingly a Mr. Grant was engaged for that purpose—I also appreci<lb/>ated that somebody would have to be employed here as a buyer, to obtain the things that were to be sent out there—the whole management was in Goodman's hands—I practically believed him to be a man of considerable means, and I think the other people who were brought in contact with him shared that opinion—I think I went to his house twice when he was living in Cromwell Road; he was living there as I should expect a man to live with a very large income, in a magnificently furnished flat, and everything there denoted wealth—I never had anything to do with the entertaining part of it—I did not go to an "At Home," I just went to call and had a cup of coffee and a talk, and soon—the place was furnished with pictures, and so on—he did not show me his Legion of Honour, or a picture of himself in his Court dress, or anything of that kind—I went to his place of business in London at Ludgate Hill half-a-dozen times, I think—he had the whole house there—he had an office there of his own, that was all, and all the etceteras for dentistry, and all that—I was once in the operating room—the name of Goodman was on every window—he let us know that he would finance the syndicate—there was no anxiety for money, we believed he would find it; he represented that he had the power to find it—it was at the fourth meeting that I first heard of the question of ap<lb/>pointing a buyer, I think—in appointing a buyer I should be anxious to know whether I was appointing a respectable man of good character, and so on—I did not know who the person was who applied for the position of buyer; he was introduced by Goodman, and I thought he was all right—I mean seriously to say that I did not know that the man who applied for the position of buyer was a man who had been 15 years in the same employment—I took it for granted he was a man of position and every<lb/>thing; I thought he was a gentleman—I took it for granted, as he was introduced by Mr. Goodman, that he was all right; whatever Mr. Good-man said I accepted without any sort of question, mostly—I do not know</p>

I am a retired lieutenant-colonel in the Indian Army, a medical officer in the service with the rank of lieutenant—in 1896 I met Mr. Goodman in the office of Mr. Baslewood, the broker—I cannot recollect the month—I afterwards called on him at his place of business at Ludgate Circus, and in the course of conversation he mentioned to me this West Australian Gold District Trading Syndicate, and drove me to the offices of the company in Basing-hall Street, and introduced me to Mr. Bernard, the secretary—to the best of my recollection Mr. Goodman said that the company was doing a good business, and advised me to buy some shares in the syndicate—I heard Mr. Goodman make a speech at the statutory meeting that was held on June 18th—I do not recollect his saying that they had already shipped £60,000 worth of goods; I think he said that they had made profits equal to more than twice the amount of their capital—Sir Edward Lee was there, and I heard him make a speech—I purchased in the syndicate 250 ordinary shares and 15 founders' shares from a Mr. Ford, I believe, before the meeting; I think that transaction took place a day, or a few days, after Mr. Goodman drove me down to the office—in giving my evidence before, I took my evidence from my cheque book—I think that first transaction in shares was before the statutory meeting, otherwise I should have had no <hi rend="italic">locus standi</hi> there; I should not have been admitted—I paid a cheque for that amount of shares, £446 15s., at the company's offices—I have a sort of idea that I paid it to Mr. Bernard—my next purchase was not long afterwards—I took my evidence from my cheque book on the former occasion—I think it was 600 shares—I am not quite sure whether it was after the statutory meeting: unfortunately it is in the other cheque book—the second shares I bought were after June 18th—that was a pur<lb/>chase of shares from a solicitor, £600, I think it was—that trans<lb/>action also took place in the office—a day or two afterwards Mr. Goodman asked me to go into the market and buy all the shares I could get in the syndicate, and accordingly I instructed my stock-brokers,</p>

               <p>Messrs. Buchan and Company, to buy them—Mr. Goodman did not tell me what he wanted me to get these shares for at the time—I in<lb/>structed my brokers to buy them by Goodman's request for himself—in that way I secured, I think the correct number is, 920 shares—I told Goodman afterwards that I had bought all the shares I could in the market, but I could not get one founders'—he said I might keep them for myself; I said I did not care to have them as I was not in a position to pay for them; I bought them at his request and he must keep them, but subsequently on his advice I took them up myself—when I entered into that transaction orginally I did so on behalf of Mr. Goodman, as I understood—on July 29th I purchased 50 founders' shares in the syndi<lb/>cate, and paid £1,450 for them to Mr. Barclay Bennett—nothing had been said by Mr. Goodman about buying them—on the same day I pur<lb/>chased 10 founders' shares more for £208 odd from Messrs. Marcus and Peezmik—they are brokers—on July 30th I paid £1,064 more for further shares I bought in the syndicate, through some brokers named Messrs. Summers and Oxenford—later on Mr. Goodman advised me on no account to part with them—he said he hoped to get every share there was to he had in the market; he hoped to get every share and corner the market was his expression—he informed me on that date or some other date that the syndicate was going to be formed into a corporation—I remem<lb/>ber dining with Mr. Goodman at his house; I think Squier was present at the dinner, and one or two brokers, but I forget their names; I think Sir Edward Lee was there, in fact, I think I was introduced to him on that occasion; that was the first time I saw him—Mr. Goodman said at that dinner party that he thought I had got so many shares in the syndicate that I ought to become a director of the corporation when it came out—he also suggested that I should go on the board of the British and Colonial Trading and Development Corporation—they have practically the same offices—I qualified as a director there, and paid some £200 for those shares—that company has long ceased to exist—the first meeting of the corpora<lb/>tion board was held on July 28th—Sir Edward Lee was in the chair, I was present, and so was Mr. Goodman—we three gentlemen accepted the office of first directors of the corporation—at that meeting it was resolved that Mr. Squier should be appointed manager of the corporation at a salary of £800 a year, and Mr. Bernard assistant manager at a salary of £500—at the unanimous request of the directors, Mr. Goodman accepted the position of managing director of the corporation—at that meeting the prospectus of the corporation was finally initialled and approved—that copy handed to me I believe is the copy of the prospectus approved by the directors at that meeting—by looking at the minute of July 29th, 1896, there are the same three directors, Sir Edward Lee, myself, and Mr. Goodman present, and I find at the end of the minute, "The board discussed fully the question of the management in West Australia, and it was decided to hand a power of attorney," &amp;c.—that was the last resolution passed—on August 7th, Mr. Goodman and myself were only present—on October 29th, 1896, Mr. Goodman, Sir Edward Lee and myself were present—the minute is: "The question of the books of the trading side of the corporation having been discussed"—I cannot remember why the books were sent for—on November 24th I find, "It was proposed by Mr. Goodman, and seconded by Sir Edward</p>

               <p>Lee, that Mr. Grant be invited to attend before the board then sitting, but this was objected to by Dr. Ogilvie, who refused to meet Mr. Grant without the solicitor being present. Dr. Ogilvie then left the meeting, and Mr. Grant and Mr. Olvay were received by Mr. Goodman and Sir Edward Lee"—it is quite correct that I had declined to meet Mr. Grant without the solicitor—one day later on I examined the allotment book of the corporation, and noticed the names of several people who had had shares allotted amounting to 69,450 shares, of which 9,800 were allotted to Mrs. Goodman, of 212, Pronn Eoad; then 8,400 to Janette Rankin; 7,000 to Theodore Claude Vautin; and 2,500 to Mrs. Marbin—there are two or three separate items; one is George Morgan, the secretary, 8,700, another 5,000, and another 6,550—that is over 20,000 to the Morgans, and 4,400 to Mrs. Squier—all those entries were in pencil—I spoke to Mrs. Morgan about these entries—I have not made a note of the date when it was purported that they had been allotted—the secretary of this corporation was a Mr. Morgan—when I noticed these pencil entries I at once spoke to him and asked him what it meant, and from what he said I went and saw Sir Edward Lee at Waterloo Place, who said he had done it by the authority of Mr. Goodman, and I also went to the solicitor—I told Sir Edward Lee first what I had seen—I am not quite sure I mentioned that I had seen Mr. Morgan about it, I may have done so; it is most probable, but I cannot swear that I did now—I told him what I had seen in the allotment book—he being a brother director I perhaps told him all I knew—I did not understand the meaning of this being in the allotment book without our knowing anything about it—he said it was not right—I proposed to go and see the solicitor the next morning and he agreed to do so—I went to see Sir Edward Lee the next day before I attempted to go to the solicitor—we sat talking on ordinary subjects for a time; I said, "We must go on to the solicitor now:" he said, "Since you were here yesterday afternoon I have seen Mr. Goodman, and he has explained the circumstances to me, and I am quite sure it is all right" and he was not going with me—I said, "Whether you go or whether you do not go, I am going; I do not like the look of this business, and I am going myself," and I went and saw Mr. Rendall, the solicitor; I went straight there—the name is Sutton, Ommanney, and Rendall—I asked Mr. Goodman how he could declare a dividend of 100 per cent, when there were no funds at the bank to pay it—I am under the impression it was at a board meeting, but I am not sure—he said that the money had been earned which was coming from Australia—I think in all I invested £4,000or£5,000 in this syndicate company and £5 in the corporation; some shares I paid £3 for—I do not mean £9000 altogether.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MUIR</hi> I have had very considerable experience in Stock Exchange dealings, extending over several years—many of those dealings were entirely speculative—I have also had experience as a director of only one other company, West Australia—I cannot tell you the date when I become director of that, it was three or four years ago, when the thing was started—it is not ten years ago—I wiil not even say it was not five years ago—I think it is in liquidation now—I have nothing to do with West Australia except as a shareholder—I am not on the board now; I was a director—I do not think I had anything</p>

               <p>to do with the West Australia Electric Light and Supply Com<lb/>pany—West Australia was interested in the promotion of it; farther than that I had nothing to do with it—I cannot say whether that was wound up—I never had a share in the Barratt Gold Mine Syndicate—I think I was a director of Barratts—that is in existence still, I believe—I cannot tell you what the shares are worth now, or whether they are worth nothing at all—I am not still a director of it; I resigned some years ago—I was a director of the Storm Club Syndicate—my memory is very treacherous; I wish to keep nothing from the Court; when I said I had only been a director of one company it was to the best of my belief, but when you remind me about it I remember that I was—I do not know what Mr. Goodman's wealth was—I met him in a stockbroker's office, and my acquaintance with him was confined to the stockbroker's office up to the time of the West Australia business—I saw him at the office, and I was at his house on three or four different occasions—I met him at Ostend, and was his guest there—he appeared to be in a position of considerable affluence, and very generous with his money—the gross amount I paid for shares in the corporation or the syndicate was £3,000, or £4,000, or £5,000—I sold a good many shares—I think I sold 100 at ls. and something, and the balance, after the thing came to grief, I sold at about 6d., the shares I had paid £3 for—my object was not to make money—I sold 100 because I wanted a little money to pay for other things—I put my money in the shares of this corporation or syndicate as an investment; I stuck to it to the last—it may have been a speculative investment—I could have sold some of them to advantage if I had sold at the right time, not the whole; I bought some at £3—I cannot say where they went to—if they rose I could have sold them to advantage, but I did not offer them for sale—I cannot say I was waiting for something better; it never occurred to me to sell them, I did not think of it; I thought with a syndicate that paid 100 per cent. we should do something better out of it afterwards—Mr. Goodman offered me 10 founders' shares—I never took up the certificate; he showed me a contract and said I could have them—I believe he lent me £1,000 in July, 1896; I believe you have an I O U to that amount; I was not aware of it until I saw it in Court the other day—I suppose he also gave me this promissory note for £500, which I discounted at Parr's Bank; that was on account of the shares I bought from him to a certain extent—I do not say I have spent that money—I have a note here, "L. H. Goodman. In payment of loan received from him, July 15th, 1897, £2,275 15s. 3d."—that was paid three days after I had the money—that is the same loan—my counterfoil is July 18th—I do not know about the bill, or if it is still in the possess on of Mr. Goodman, and was discounted through Parr's Bank in Lombard Street—I bought the shares and then I consented to take them up; I had not the money, and he said he would lend it to me—it did not come to £5,000, only £2,275—I repaid it three days afterwards—here is my counterfoil—I had to give that as security for money I was borrowing from the bank; I think that was it—I do not think the whole £5,000 was ever credited to me; I could tell you if I had my bank book—as far as I know, that counterfoil represents all the money I had of him, and I repaid the whole of that £5,000; this</p>

               <p>is dated July 18th, 1896—I believe the £5,000 promissory note was never discounted; it was held by the bankers.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILDEY WRIGHT</hi>. When I made this dis<lb/>covery about the allotment book I went to Sir Edward Lee and informed him of it—he appeared intensely astonished and surprised—I have no reason to doubt that that was genuine astonishment and surprise—I ac<lb/>cepted the suggestion made that we should go to the solicitor in the morning—when I saw him in the morning he told me that he had seen Mr. Goodman in the interval between seeing me the preceding night—I think the shares were in the allotment book—I cannot say if the book is here—it was at the end of the other shares that were left—I went on to the solicitor alone—I had an opportunity during the time I was in business relations with Sir Edward Lee of forming an opinion of his integrity and honour—I always believed, and do now believe, him to be an absolutely honourable man; I have never had any reason to believe otherwise than that he was, and have not now, to my personal knowledge—I look upon him now as a truthful and honourable man, as far as I am concerned—I was closely associated with him for these few months as a director of this company.</p>

I think I was first connected with the matter in June—whatever I said before the Magistrates was correct—until August, until Mr. Bernard went away to Australia, I had an oppor<lb/>tunity of observing his conduct—he was the secretary to the company—I was not aware he interfered with other people's business—as far as I know he showed no anxiety or curiosity about anything except what was in his own department—I merely saw him as a secretary—he was appointed manager on July 28th—I was simply a shareholder—I had nothing to do with the board—I had an opportunity of observing Mr. Bernard—I said before the Magistrate that I took a great liking to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. C. F. GILL</hi>. When Mr. Goodman asked me to go on the market and buy all the shares that I could, I assented to that—I went to my brokers, Messrs. Drucker, and gave them an order to buy all the shares they could get—I understood what he desired to do was to control the market in some way—I told my broker I was acting for Mr. Goodman—I saw no impropriety in carrying out his instructions—it did not occur to me that there was any reason I should not do what he asked me to do—Mr. Goodman inspired me with very great confidence—when I dined at his flat, everything was done sumptuously, lavishly—he had a footman at table—that was the first time I had ever been in his house—the impression produced upon my mind was that Mr. Good-man was really a man of wealth—I was his guest at Ostend; there every<lb/>thing was done on a scale of great magnificence; you had what you wanted—I merely had my own bedroom—if he had not invited me to go to Ostend I should not have gone there—with regard to extravagance you must go by your pocket—he was living very well at Ostend—when I joined this corporation I carefully examined the prospectus, and I saw the names of the people who were connected with it—I was gratified to see an eminent member of a firm of solicitors—they would inspire me with confidence—that member of the firm was not present at all the meetings, but at many of them—with regard to the ore atomic process I made inquiry to satisfy myself whether it was valuable as far as I could—I took it for granted it was valuable from the statement of Mr. Goodman—I am not</p>

               <p>aware that I ascertained it from any other source—I saw experiments tried, and I was satisfied as far as my judgment was capable of forming an opinion—I do not think that I took any other Step than going down to Limehouse—I thought I was satisfied—I had no doubt about it in those days—I do not know that I am capable as an expert of forming an opinion on these things—one or two experts were there; I forget the names—I told Mr. Rendall the Company was not good enough—I did not think I retired at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Goodman never advanced me any money at all except for the purpose of taking up shares that I had bought at his request—I never asked him or anybody else to lend me money—that was the only purpose for which he lent me money—as far as I know I do not owe him a penny now—I was quite surprised when I saw that I O U—he has never suggested that I owe him any money—I do not know that he returned me as a creditor in his bankruptcy; I have not heard so—since I was at the Magistrate's Court I have received a document of some kind for £1,000 with reference to that I O U; I never heard of it until then—it was soon after I gave my evidence at the Magistrate's Court, but up to that time I never heard anything about owing any money to Mr. Goodman—I have endea<lb/>voured to find that document to bring it here, but, unfortunately, I could not put my hand on it; I wanted particularly to show it to the Court—I was cross-examined at the Police-court when I first gave evidence about the conversation with Sir Edward Lee—my recollection was the same then as it is now, that he did not tell me what the explanation was that Mr. Goodman had afforded.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When he refused to go with me I went by myself to Mr. Rendall's, and reported what I had seen to him—I got no explanation from him of it; but I know that he acted on my advice and informa<lb/>tion—he went to see Goodman about it; I have letter from him to that effect.</p>

I am an advertising agent, carrying on business at 26, Nicholas Lane, in the City—I was employed to have inserted in a number of newspapers a report of the statutory meeting of the Western Australian Syndicate of June 18th, 1896—my instructions came from a Mr. Walter and a Mr. Beauclerk—the report of that meeting through my agency appeared in 25 papers, chiefly financial papers: a very few in the provinces, chiefly in London——I got instrnctions to have advertised the report of the meeting of the syndicate on July 10th—I got that reported in various newspapers—I am paid by cheques by the West Australian Trading—the first advertise<lb/>ment was partially paid by Mr. Beauclerk—the btilance was not paid—I have got the cheques here—I advertised also the prospectus—the total amount I was paid was £2,606—I spent that amount of money with the papers—the bills have not been paid—the prospectus of the corporation is advertised in the same way in a number of newspapers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now carrying on business as an accountant at 8, Old Jewry—before I became connected with this syndicate, the West Australian (Gold District) Trading Syndicate, I had never had any connection with Australia—the syndicate was first mentioned to me in January, 1896, or the latter end of December by Mr. Goodman—I was shown the draft prospectus of the syndicate—I afterwards went to Western Australia as manager—there had been no preparation of the ground in Western Australia by any one sent out belore to prepare the way for this company to my knowledge—I was told there had been—I did not find any traces of that having taken placein Australia—I was there from April till September—I arrived hereon November 18th—I was engaged to go out to Western Australia as manager—my salary was fixed at £750 and commission—a Mr. Latham went with me, Mr. Oliver followed later—Mr. Latham is an engineer—on March 17th, I think it was, I sailed; I</p>

               <p>really forget the date—about the middle of March, my passage was paid—the total sum of money we took between us was £20, supplied by Mr. Good-man—we arrived in Western Australia some time about the middle of April; we landed at Albany and proceeded straight to Perth—there is a railway from Albany to Perth; I went by railway—I arrived at Coolgardie from Perth about April 28th—I telegraphed on April 28th: "Why do you not remit? I am entirely without money. Reply immediately, Union Bank of Australia. Grant"—that was to Mr. Goodman; it is addressed "Dentistry, London," his telegraphic address—on April 24th a cable was sent to me from the syndicate, telling me to make immediate application to the Union Bank of Australia, Perth: "You must secure offices, Perth;" and with that I received a remittance of £50 from the syndicate—on April 30th I telegraphed, acknowledging the receipt: "Remittance has been received. Small remittances cause a very bad unfavourable position. Union Bank of Australia. Company will be registered forthwith. Offices, care Parker, solicitor, Perth. Prospects are encouraging"—that is ad<lb/>dressed to the syndicate under its telegraphic address, "Seneschal, London"—on May 3rd I received a cablegram sent to me on the 2nd: "I am sending you a consignment of £4,000, follow the instructions of 24th day of April"—on May 12th I wrote this letter from Coolgardie, addressed to the manager of the West Australian Trading Syndicate, Ltd (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Sir—I have no letter from you or the company to acknowledge by this mail; but I am in receipt of a cable dated May 3rd, which I read as follows: 'I am sending you a consignment of £4,000. Follow the instruc<lb/>tions of 24th day of April.' I trust I have translated this cable correctly, but I fail to understand its meaning. I do not know if I am to understand that £4,000 cash has been sent to me, or if £4,000 worth of goods have been shipped to me. In either event the telegram is very badly drafted. The total amount I have received from London since my arrival is £150. I cannot understand the policy of the board. By their action they are destroying the credit of the company out here Is it reasonable to think that it is possible for a company to come out here and start a trading business on a total capital of £150, more especially when they are unknown, have no property on which to erect stores or buildings, and, in fact, cannot even open an office because they have not sufficient money to pay rent for same?'—those statement sare correct—I also said, "As regards salaries, I have been unable to pay any, either to Mr. Latham or myself, and consequently, although the company are indebted to me for 3 months' salary, I am without any. Mr. Latham is situated similarly. I do think, and do not hesitate to express the opinion, that there is every hope of doing a large business here, but it must be managed on business lines, and it is quite impossible to open stores on the field without sufficient money to acquire premises with. It is quite useless to ship out here a lot of goods without sending me money to enable me to pay the charges after leaving the wharf, customs dues, and to acquire a place of some sort to sell them in. * * * I feel that a great success for the company, or its absolute failure, is now in the hands of the board. I have done all I can on this side without money. I now want to acquire suitable warehouses here"—that was at Coolgardie—" open stores at Menzies, Hannan's, and Mount Margaret, if the board enable me to do this"—Menzies, Hannan's, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100105"/>
               <p>Mount Margaret are up country stations; they are beyond Coolgardie—"I shall make a great success for the company. If they do not the Responsibility must rest in London ")—then on the 16th I cabled from Coolgardie that I had taken offices at Perth—" Everything finally arranged, offices Barrack Street, Perth, and Hinde's Chambers, Coolgardie; when can I rely upon remittance? Great local demand galvanised iron, at what price can you supply, freight paid at port of shipment? I can sell large quan<lb/>tity at £30 per ton"—on the 19th I received this cablegram in answer: "We can supply cost freight and insurance Fremantle £18, we have shipped 100 tons, what quantity will you require?"—Fremantle is the port near Perth, on the west coast of Western Australia—these are office copies of the telegrams; they are not the originals, the originals are in the hands of the Official Receiver—I remember them perfectly well—Fremantle is about 12 miles from Perth—it is connected by rail<lb/>way—it is about 300 miles from Fremantle to Coolgardie—if you leave by the 5 o'clock train in the evening you arrive at 9 next morning—Goods shipped to Fremantle from Coolgardie would pass through Perth; they would not be transhipped—that is the only route—the only railway is <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Perth for Coolgardie; there is no change at Perth—the cost of trans<lb/>porting a ton of galvanised iron from Fremantle to Coolgardie would be, at that date, I should think, between £8 and £9 a ton inclusive—with the tele<lb/>gram of the 19th I received £250; that would make about £400 up to that date altogether—on May 24th I cabled from Coolgardie—it was received in London on the 25th, "Seneschal, London. Require 300 tons galvanised sheet corrugated iron, 100 tons galvanised sheet flat iron. Endeavour your utmost to ship the entire quantity required with best possible de<lb/>spatch. Telegraph me fully when it is expected to arrive"—I received the cablegram of May 29th: "I will remit you next Thursday. Ship by steamer 100, 2nd day of June; 100, 11th day of June; 200, 18th day of June"—I think the first consignment of goods from the syndicate came the latter end of June or the early part of July; they were samples—the first) consignment of goods arrived, I think, in August or September—I received a cable of June 5th; it is in cipher—I found an obscurity about it, and telegraphed for a correction: "Do you require any more galvanised sheet iron, corrugated galvanised sheet flat? Advise you to order immediately. Prices goings up 3s. 6d., 25s. There will be a meeting soon, statutory. Suggest telegraph me as follows:—' Transactions are enormous., Continue shipments steadily. I expect the profit on——to be £25,000'"—I did not know what "Prices going up 8s. 6d., 258.," meant—I telegraphed on June 9th asking for a repeat of a certain portion of that: "Please repeat your tele<lb/>gram from culcitella to middling. Why do you not remit as per your telegram of May 29th? I cannot act in accordance with suggestion until remittance has been received"—I received the telegram of June 10th repeating the message, and it was explained by the insertion of the words, "Shares are at a premium" before the words "3s. 6d., 25s.," and then it all read straight—I received a letter dated June 5th from Bernard—I did not receive it till eome five weeks later—I know his writing—it is signed "Hugh Bernard, Manager" (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—the concluding passage of the letter reads: "We sent you this day the following telegraphic com-munication,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100106"/>
               <p>and then follow the code words of the message, which are, "Ribaldry, culcitella, outburst, skinless, Fantopola, Fatuscada, middling, statutory, suggest, Tawdry, Treble, snobbish, prettiness, propulsada"; then, "We sent you this day the following telegraphic communication," and then follow the code words: "We will not make any remarks on this message, as its purport and object will be well known to you, and further, it will have, of course, had your careful attention, and have served its purpose before this reaches you. By this mail we send you a <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> of 4th, showing latest quotations for the shares of this company, and notice of application to the Stock Exchange for a settle<lb/>ment."—I believe that to be in Bernard's handwriting—I believe both the code words and the translation are in his handwriting—on June 10th I wrote a letter to the syndicate, addressed to the managing director, West Australian (Gold District) Trading Syndicate. <hi rend="italic">Read</hi>; "Since writing to you last week (June 3rd) I have received the following cable, dated June 5th"; then follows the cable: "To the above cable I replied to you under yesterday's date as follows: 'Please repeat,'" etc.; then "The third and fourth words in your cable of June 5th reached me as 'Vulbust' and 'Syinless,' neither of which words I can find in the code" Then I go on: "Your cable of May 29th promised a remittance 'next Thursday,' which would be on June 4th. Up to to<lb/>day, however, no remittance has come to hand, and under the circumstances I hardly see how you can expect me to adopt your suggestion and send a 'bull' telegram (which would, no doubt, be laid before the shareholders at the meeting you say is shortly to take place), and the responsibility for which would rest with me. If you suggest that I should send a cable that I expect a profit of £25,000 on present transactions, I regret to say I cannot adopt your suggestion. If, again, you suggest that I am to cable an expected profit on a capital of £25,000, I fear I must decline to do so until I am satisfied that such capital is available to work with, and in view of the contents of your letter dated May 1st, the receipt for which I now beg to acknow ledge (such letter reached me yesterday, June 9 th), I know that such amount of capital is not available. At present I am not in a position to<lb/>meet coming engagements as regards freight of goods you have already consigned, nor am I even in a position to pay duty on same"—what I said there was true—there had been no profits made up to that date—I was not in a position to pay for the charges on the goods if they had arrived—then, "<hi rend="italic">Head quarters.</hi>—I much regret that you should see fit to write what I consider a censure on my actions in this respect. I have already written to you fully on this matter, and I now repeat that <hi rend="italic">commercially</hi> Perth cannot be the headquarters of the company if it is intended to trade in Coolgardie and other goldfields. The directors should allow me to be the judge of what is best on this side. Perth is 12 miles from Fremantle, and goods landed at Fremantle and intended for sale up here would certainly not go into the city of Perth unless it was intended to add about 20 per cent, to the freight and warehousing charges. Goods-would be put on cars outside the Custom House at Fremantle and for<lb/>warded direct to Coolgardie without unloading. Again, goods landed at Albany"—that is the mail port—" would not go near the city of Perth, but would come to Coolgardie via Northam; to send goods intended for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100107"/>
               <p>sale at Coolgardie round by Perth would be a distinct waste of time and money, both of which I am anxious to avoid. I am fully established so far as necessary at Perth. The legal headquarters of the company is there and must be there, but as regards acquiring useless warehouses in that city seems to me to be an absurdity. At any time I require warehouse room there I can get it immediately if I am in the city, and if not a telegram there will secure the same result. <hi rend="italic">Consignment.</hi>—While I am writing, your letter of May 8th has reached me. I regret to hear by this letter that your shipments have been delayed, but if you have been placed in a critical and ridiculous position, as you say, I, on my part, must say that the fault is entirely your own, and that I am in no way to blame. I understand from your letter of May 1st that the first shipments will Con<lb/>gist of apparel, boots, hats, blankets, rugs, and leather manufactured goods, such as belts, leggings. "Then" <hi rend="italic">Your drafts on me</hi>—You may rely on my honouring all such, that is if I am placed in a proper financial position to do 80, I must again repeat I have no money in hand to pay customs dues, etc. I am quite in a position to realise the necessity of being careful as to whom I do business with; the laxity of local buyers in West Australia is only too well known. As regards the Union Bank I had better inform you at once that at present we can expect no assistance from that institution on this side. Our account has not been such as to give them any confidence, and I am satisfied they have made their own inquiries as to our standing and position."—Then there is a paragraph about the whisky:" <hi rend="italic">Auld Scottie Whisky</hi>—I note that 300 cases will leave by 'Primshire via Singapore for Fremantle, and that two sample cases will arrive by S.S. <hi rend="italic">Cuzes</hi>, consigned to Perth. I will attend to this matter. I will do my best, but I do not expect to be able to sell this first shipment to arrive." Then "<hi rend="italic">Up-courtry Stores and Branches.</hi>" I now come to what I consider the most important part of your letter, for it seems to me that this paragraph totally alters all my ideas, and all our arrangements made in London. The very object of the company, as I understand it, was to trade in the goldfields—the very title of the company implies it. Now, however, I am definitely in<lb/>structed that I am to trade in Perth (which is not in the Gold District), and in Perth alone. Of course, I shall carry out your instructions, but I must point out that by your instructions the objects of the company are now confined to trading in Perth, a large and well-established city, with many flourishing; shops, stores and hotels, and certainly the prices we shall realise in that ciiy will be very different to those we could get on the gold-fields. I may add that my reading of the three letters I have received from the company, and their cables, that their financial resources are very limited, and I can only assume that they instruct me to trade in Perth, and thus alter the original ideas, because they have not sufficient means at their command to allow the goods to go up-country. The mail is just leaving and I must therefore close. Again assuring you of my best endeavours to make the company a success"—while I was managing in Western Australia I was never in a position to trade up-country—with<lb/>out doing that it was impossible to follow the movements of the diggers and supply those up-country stations in the way which the business required it in the passages that have been read—I also sent this cablegram, "Seneschal, London—You may ship 400 galvanised corrugated iron, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100108"/>
               <p>will leave immediately Perth, and wait until you remit by telegram there: Your letter of (——) came to hand to<lb/>day, May 8th: Your instructions are having every attention: Nothing can be done if you do not remit Public Battery, a thorough good business; 40 Krom rolls and cyanide plant." "Buggy" means "Ship at once to Fremantle (—)sets of Krom rolls capable of treating 40 tons a day of twenty-four hours." "We have sold six saddles Like mine: You must ship quickly by steamer"—I had not sold anything at that date—the six saddles referred to in the telegram of June 12th, were my first sale—on June 15th I sent a cable, addressed to "Seneschal, London," "We have obtained grant battery site water gratis, but salt; tell inquirers the profit will be great and immediate. Telegraph immediately if you can ship." That related to the erection and running of a public battery on the Goldfield of Coolgardie—I had got the grant of a site—on June 15th I sent a cable; the signature is W. A., T. S., Limited: "Shipped 300 galvanised corrugated iron, 100 galvanised sheet flat. Do you require any more? Have no reply yet statutory, 18th day of June"—then on June 16th: "Please refer to my telegram of the 12th day of June, 400 more than shipped, continue shipments steadily, by what vessel have you shipped? When is it expected to arrive? Sale of shipments likely to show a very great profit"—I was not able to make any sale of any of these goods to arrive, I had none of the information necessary to enable me to do it—on June 19th I received this letter: "Up country stores. Our desires in our letter of the 8th May last will, we feel assured, have your best attention, as promised in your cable of the 12th instant. You will see that for the present, at all events, the busi<lb/>ness must be confined to your head quarters at Perth, unless you know of something exceptionally good. We have several further consignments ready for next week, and these will reach you in the same way through the Union Bank of Australia." And on June 24th I wrote to the company; it is a very long letter—then on the 27th there was a cablegram I received: "Special settlement granted, shares pooled. Ordinary shares are at 11s. premium, founders' £6. Goodman requests me to telegraph you as follows: Gratuity, £200; Latham Olivier, £25. Have much pleasure in stating that you are appointed agent Bass beers. Galvanised sheet iron corrugated: do you want any more?"—that agency for Bass's beers, I subsequently discovered, was for beer in bulk—in my opinion that was no use, I was not able to make anything of it in Western Australia—there is draught beer sold there, but I do not think it could have been imported and sold at a profit in Coolgardie—there was another agency of someone else for the bottled beer—I also received this from Bernard, as manager in London: "On 20th inst. we wired you as follows." Then follow the code words. "From this you will understand that for the present we can give you nothing more definite as to the name of the steamer in which the galvanised iron will leave. Saddles: 12 sets of these with bridles are already under way"—I had not the saddles before—that refers to a consignment of saddles to me—" Heidsieck, we have not succeeded in arranging terms with Messrs. Heidsieck and Co., and are in the alterna<lb/>tive negotiating for the agency for the * Piper Heidsieck 'brand"—on August 28th I sent a letter to the syndicate addressed to the managing director again; it says: "Your consignments. These, or rather, the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100109"/>
               <p>majority of them, have just arrived at Fremantle; when it will be pos<lb/>sible to clear them I cannot say." Then is set out a cable I had sent on: "I will leave as soon as possible for Northam, and report. I have seen reports meetings June 18th, July 16th; will write you thereon." Then: "The two papers which I have been shown are the <hi rend="italic">British Australasion</hi> of June 25th, and the number of the same paper published on July 16th, and they contain what purports to be reports of the two meetings men<lb/>tioned above. The statements, or some of them, are of such an extra<lb/>ordinary character that I cannot understand them in conjunction with the facts as known to me on this side., However, 1 will write you fully thereon by next mail; meantime, I had better say at once that if your speeches are correctly reported I cannot support many of the statements made"—up to that time no profit had been made in "Western Australia—I think Bernard arrived at Perth about September 9th—this cable-gram of September 9th is to Bernard, sent from the West Australian Trading Corporation, 28, Basinghall Street, E.G.: "Send all the news you can for newspapers. Telegraph immediately"—when it arrived Bernard was not able to attend to business and I opened the telegram—I handed it to him—I spoke to him about it—he said it was nothing to do with the company; it had come from a Press Agency in London; nothing more—Bernard did not take the management of the company after he came out whilst I was there—I arrived here on November 18th; I left about the middle of October—I had been served with a copy of a power of attorney, revoking the power of attorney which I held from the syndi<lb/>cate, and I considered it necessary to come home and see the directors—my authority to act for the syndicate had been revoked—when I left Bernard was left there—this letter of September 11th is a private letter to Goodman from Bernard: "Your cable reading 'money tight, all well, 35s., £85,' duly reached me. It was as a token that your promise to keep me posted as to market movements had not been forgotten in the multiplicity of your affairs, I wired you through Reuier yesterday, as follows: 'Process causing intense excitement goldfields, phenominal royalties offered'"—I was out there at the time that cable was sent—I never heard of anything of the kind; if there was I should have heard of it—this letter is dated from Perth—Bernard had never been to the goldfields at that date, unless he had been in Australia before—"Now, as a matter of fact, the whole of your remarks at the meetings of our company in London are as well known here as at home, and severe criticism has been indulged in freely as to what it means. I could tell them, and shall do so in demonstrative form sooner or later, but of course the time is not yet come. I also wired you yesterday the following. 'On my presenting myself at the office of Mr. Sparrow, agent for Messrs. James Fell, I found to my disappoint<lb/>ment that that gentleman was away at the opening ceremony of the railway to Kalgoorlie.'"—that opening ceremony took place at Kalgoorlie some hundreds of miles beyond Coolgardie—"I have, therefore, to wait till his return on the 14th inst., when I will advise you by wire, of progress. In the mean time I am unwillingly at a standstill over this matter. I also wired you yesterday the following: 'Using utmost despatch, Sparrow. Syndicate holds good position here. Grant most</p>

               <p>energetic, but complains secrecy observed respecting London movements; is suspicious enough to be wicked; await letter'"—the syndicate had mot a strong financial position—" I trust the whole of this wire was intelligible to you. I will, however, proceed to give you my meaning more fully. In doing so, I hope you will appreciate the delicacy of my position, and believe that if I ask you to await my next letter for more details it is from the honest fear that 1 might in a few days' stay be guilty of a hasty judgment. However, it is my duty to report to you that before Mr. Grant would discuss the situation from the point of view of the company's interests he informed me that he proposed to make no secret of the fact that the prospectiis of the corporation was not based upon fact, and that if the London office did not take him more into their confidence, he would take the earliest opportunity of returning to London, making his claim according to his agreement for his percentage on the profits made by the syndicate, which he estimates on the terms of the prospectus of the corporation, or, in other words, the difference between the capital of the syndicate and the purchase price paid for the goodwill, &amp;c., of the same by the corporation. Now this is wicked, if meant, but if not meant it should never have been spoken. On the other hand, I must confess that in my opinion it was expressed in the heat of the moment, and there is a great deal to he said in favour of his stand-point.

Trust this duly reached you and was intelli<lb/>gible"—that letter is dated from Perth—Bernard had not been at the ceremony of the Kalgoorlie extension—the Trading Corporation had nothing whatever to do with that extension—I never heard of any high compliments at that opening to the enterprise of the corporation, or of any promise of Government support, or that the profits must be many millions—this is a letter dated July 17th from Bernard to me: "We are since in receipt of your letter dated June 10th"—I think I arrived in November—on my arrival I saw Mr. Goodman and Sir Edward Lee and Dr. Ogilvie—the day after I arrived in England I reported myself at the office, and asked to see the directors—I saw them; they were present—the solicitor, Mr. Rendall, was with them, I think; and I told them I had come home in consequence of having my power cancelled, and I made a claim on them for certain sums of money which are still due to me, and which is now in the Court of Chancery—I mentioned the telegram of June 5th, asking me to send a telegram in view of the statutory meeting—they all denied having seen it—General Tulloch was not present—he was not a member of the board of the corporation—Sir Edward Lee said he had seen no such telegram at all, and he also added that he had never seen any of my correspondence—I had never sent any cablegram or com<lb/>munication of any kind stating that a profit of £5,000 had been made, or anything to that effect; there was no truth in the idea—I do not re<lb/>member the date, but I was present at a general meeting at Winchester House—Sir Edward Lee was in the chair, and I believe he said he was in the chair through the absence of Mr. Goodman through illness, and he made a speech, and eventually informed the shareholders that I had arrived from Western Australia, and told the shareholders that I could tell them how the business was going out there—I then was asked to speak, and I did speak at that meeting—I said, so far as I can remember, that I was not satisfied with the way in which the business had been conducted on that side—under the advice of my solicitor I read to them a certain cablegram that I had received, and the letter I had written in reply to this cablegram—that was the cablegram of June 5th, and my letter of June 10th—I told them there was a prospect of doing a very good business there, had the business been conducted on this side with proper management, and had sufficient funds been supplied to the manage<lb/>ment out there to carry on the business in a proper manner—I do not remember that Sir Edward made any reply, except to tell me that he knew nothing whatever about any such telegram or letters,</p>

My dear Mr. Grant, the bearer of this, Mr. Ellis Wills, has made his way to Western Australia with the object of making money there, and knowing him to be a gentle-man of excellent business attainments, I have given him an introduction to you, his primary object being to get some employment, and in this it it occurred to me that you might possibly be in a position to give him a helping hand. Let me take this opportunity of congratulating you on the splendid results which have attended your labours; they are regarded over here as well nigh phenomenal"—I never saw anything whatever in the conduct of Sir Edward Lee that was not to my mind thoroughly straight-forward or honourable—the interview I had with the directors I think, was about November 19th—I was there for about 20 minutes, I should think; it may have been a little longer—I communicated to the directors the details of the business that had been done in Australia, or had not been done—I told the directors that I desired to attend the meeting of the shareholders which would be held in a few days, and that I would, if allowed, go fully into matters at the meeting—on one occasion, before the board meeting, or my interview with the directors, or the meet<lb/>ing of November 27th, Sir Edward Lee called on me at ray chambers in Jermyn Street—I did not go into any details—then he expressed the opinion that he wished to come to the meeting and hear my statement—at the meeting Sir Edward Lee said he was reading from a paper prepared for Mr. Goodman—he said in his judgment, though he did not know it at the time, Mr. Goodman in the past had in his opinion taken far too roseate a view of what was going on in the Colony, and that some new blood was wanted on the board and some good commercial men at the head of affairs or something of that kind—I do not think much of Sir Edward Lee as a business man—my opinion from what I saw was that he had little or no business capacity, and was not a business man—he gave me to understand that he thought a great deal more had been done than had been done, and that he was no party to my dismissal, and did not know of the fact—I looked on Mr. Goodman as the founder of the com<lb/>pany, and as the managing director generally—I thought he had entire management of it.</p>

                  </hi>: I live at 26, Grove Hill Eoad, Denmark Hill I went as clerk to the West Australian Syndicate at Basinghall Street on 18th May, 1896. It was myduty to take down business letters in shorthand, and then to type them. Mr. Squier used to dictate the letters to me. I have, I think, sometimes taken down a note in shorthand from Goodman I believe Bernard wrote the cablegram for Australia. The cablegram, Ex<lb/>hibit 19, is in Bernard's writing. The cablegrams were also pub into a press copy book, and at folio 386 of the book produced I find (Exhibit 88) a press copy of the cablegram of June 5th (Exhibit 19) signed Hugh Bernard, in his handwriting. I do not remember seeing that cablegram before it went out. I did nob see them as a rule. Exhibit 34 is signed for the syn<lb/>dicate by Squier I typed some of the letters sent to Grant They were as a rule written first by Bernard It was part of my duty to copy into a book the invoices of goods purchased. That book is produced (Exhibit 89). Ber<lb/>nard has copied some of the invoices into this book. The total amounts shown in this book of the goods shipped to Australia up to June 18th, 1896, is £4,481 16s. 10d., which includes 102 tons 9 cwt of galvanised iron of the invoice value of £1,471 6s. 7d. The total amount of goods shipped up to July 18th is £.7,920 7s. 5d., including 264 tons 16 cwt. of galvanised iron of an invoice value of £3,838 5s., 7d. The total amount shipped up to July 28th is £11,196 11s. 1d., including 450 tons galvanised iron. I saw in the office, before June 18th, the notes of the speech which Goodman delivered at the statutory meeting. They are now produced. Exhibit 90. They are type<lb/>written in part, with alterations in blue pencil by Bernard and in lead pencil by Groodman. On page 19 of the notes I find the words, "Cable continue shipments steadily, profits must be enormous, ship at once plant for another public battery; profit £25,000. Produce copy of last cable." The figures, "£25,000," are crossed out in lead pencil and the words, "pro<lb/>duce copy of last cable," are crossed over in ink. On the last page are the words in pencil, "We have made profits equalling twice the amount of our capital; take advantage of the compulsory meeting to give a little bit of sugar for the bird and we look forward to an early date." This is in lead pencil. (<hi rend="italic">Cross-examined for Goodman.</hi>) I first went to the sydicate's offices on May 18th, 1896, and left on the Christmas Eve following—the</p>

               <p>into the affairs of the West Australian (Gold District) Trad<lb/>ing; Corporation—the petition for winding-up was presented on December 14th, 1896—that was a creditors'petition—the unsecured debts are about £15,000—in addition there are two sets of debentures, one to the amount of £2,500, and the other to the amount of £5,000—taking the shares which have been issued at their face value, there will be, according to our estimate, a loss to the shareholders of about £385,410—the total number of shares subscribed for by the public was 12,119 ordinary shares, which were paid for at a premium of £1, making: a total sum of £24,238—there are some not paid for—the amount should be £24,238—in addition there were 1,071 founders' shares, subscribed for in cash, representing £1,071—80 far the assets have realised about £7,000—I have put the estimated value of the unrealised assets at £1,000 myself; J think that is an out-side estimate—it includes the value of the ore atomic process; it is almost impossible to pub anything like an accurate estimate on that—I find that Sir Edward Lee was allotted in the syndicate 100 founders' shares—by the cash-book he appears to have paid that sum on May 21st, 1896—that sum of £100 was paid out of the proceeds of a cheque that was drawn on the company's funds—on May 19th so far as I have been able to trace it—I have no doubt of that—that was a cheque for £160 that was drawn on May 19th—on the counterfoil of that cheque for £160 drawn on the company's account, I find in pencil an entry, "Lee £100, Tulloch £60"—that entry on the counterfoil is in the same handwriting as the body of the cheque—I believe that to be Mr. Bernard's writing—Sir Edward Lee bought 25 ordinary shares of the syndicate.</p>

               <p>shares—at the date of the liquidation Bernard only held 5 founders' shares—he transferred all except 65, in October, and 65 he transferred in November, 1896; at least that was the date of the registration—he was not in this country at that date—that is the date it was registered in the books—I have also examined the trading books of the corpora<lb/>tion—the ordinary books for a trading company were kept in the office—I do not find any trace at all of any profit ever having been made on the sale of goods—there is no trace of any profit and loss account any<lb/>where—I find no trace in the books of any remittance ever having arrived from Australia, or any trace of its being promised by Grant or Bernard from Australia—this is the cheque which was apparently drawn to pay for the cablegram of June 5th for £3 16S.

Mr. Duncan is the receiver for the debenture-holders—he was not appointed in any way by the Official Receiver—he is not holding an inquiry into the matter; he is realising the assets for the benefit of the debenture-holders—I do not know that Mr. Bernard cabled from Australia to Mr. Duncan, offering to return at once, and give any evidence if he were needed—there was a suggestion that he would return if the expenses of returning were paid, but whether he cabled that, or whether the agent of Mr. Duncan cabled that, I cannot say—I know that there was some message of the kind that reached this country—under the scheme for reconstruction legally Mr. Bernard could not receive 5 founders' shares without payment, but I am afraid he did—the 5 founders' shares were registered in his name—there is no trace of any payment made by Mr. Bernard for the shares, nor for the 1,000 ordinary shares; he was entitled to a great deal more than 1,000—whether he had them for himself or others 1 could not say—it might show, to work it backwards, from the number he held in the corporation, what number he held in the syndicate in his own right—he did not pay for any shares in the syndicate except some he transferred to another person named Scott, who paid him the moneys—there are 6 transfers out of those registered here in the syndicate, one of 2,000, one of 400, one of 200, one of 100 ordinary, and 250 founders' and 20 founders'—I cannot say in whose handwriting they are—the share ledger does not show who transferred them—it is possible that if Mr. Goodman entered those shares in Mr. Bernard's name Mr. Goodman may also have transferred them.</p>

               <p>—there was required £3,000 odd, the reason being that Goodman did not get all that he could hare drawn as his dividend, because he was indebted in a cross account to the company; that is the main difference.</p>

I live at 8, Norland Square—early in 1876 I was asked to become a director of the West Australian (Gold District) Trading Syndicate, and I did—I was present at three or four meetings—I proposed the alteration as to the quorum, 3 instead of 2—I wrote this letter of March 26th, addressed to the secretary of the West Australian Trading Syndicate, Limited: "Dear Sir,—I beg to inform you that I have decided to resign my position as a director of the West Australian Trading Syndicate, Limited, from this day's date. Kindly acknowledge receipt of this information, and oblige, yours faithfully, (signed) <hi rend="smallCaps">L. H.

My letter was timed to arrive during the meeting of the board of which I had notice, so I cannot understand why the matter was not dealt with at once. Please take notice that I consider myself as having ceased to be a director of the West Australian Trading Syndicate, Limited, from the time of receipt by you of my letter of resignation"—shortly after re<lb/>ceiving that letter I saw Bernard on the Underground Railway—I spoke to him about my letter—he said it had been opened and read at the meet<lb/>ing, and that Mr. Goodman suggested it should be left over for con<lb/>sideration to a future meeting—within a few minutes of seeing Mr. Bernard, I went straight up there, and saw Sir Edward Lee—he said exactly the same that Mr. Bernard had said—I then consulted my solicitor, and through him I threatened proceedings against the company for keeping my name as a director—after consulting my solicitor I called on Sir Edward Lee at Waterloo Place—I said that I had determined to give up the thing, I did not like the look of things, and I recommended him to do the same, and I said he would be sorry for it if he did not—he seemed rather impressed by what I said at the time, I thought—under a threat of taking an injunction, my name was removed finally about,.

Sharwood's premises—I did not go to other places with Mr. Goodman in connection with the business of the company—I did not see all, or anything like all, of the cablegrams that it now appears were received from Mr. Grant in Australia—I may have seen some of them, but certainly a very small proportion—the cablegrams that I did see were all favourable to the conclusion that a good and substantial business was being transacted in Australasia—only those telegrams were shown me that produced a good effect on my mind to convince me that good business was being done; those that were hostile were withheld from me—I cannot say I ever knew that Mr. Grant was clamouring for money, or anything of that sort—I may have heard that he had written for remittances, but I thought those remittances were always forthcoming, and I was under the impression that there was plenty of money to meet all his requirements—I remember seeing the telegrams, "Profits will be good," and "Great local demand for corrugated iron," and also the cablegram saying that Mr. Grant could dispose of a large quantity of iron at £30 per ton in Australia—I think there was a report from Mr. Squier as to the cost at which that iron could be obtained in this country—I do not remember the amount, but the price was such that it would produce when sold in Australia a very large profit—I did not see the cablegrams sent out from this country to Australia—I did not see the cable of June 5th that suggests to Grant in Australia that he should tele<lb/>graph all sorts of stories, that enormous profits had been made, and that the transactions were enormous, and so forth—I was never aware of any such cablegram being sent—I was shown this telegram from Squier to Mr. Goodman on May 25th to 1, Portman Mansions by one of the defendants, "Sent you copy cable, have wired Walkers and put order in hand, profit</p>

               <p>about £5,000"—I cannot tell you by whom, or whether it was before, the subject of the proposed dividend was mentioned to me—Mr. Goodman first mentioned about the dividend being declared—he said that business had been very prosperous, and the profit was such as to justify us in declaring a dividend—I had most implicit and unwavering confidence in Mr. Goodman, and in the statements made by him to me—he told me the dividend they were able to pay was at the rate of 100 per cent.—I had conversations with others of the defendants, and people in position at the office of the company with reference to the business that was being done—the nature of those communications was simply to the effect that a good business was being done—I heard it from all the officials in the office, from Mr. Bernard's lips, from Mr. Squier's, and from Mr. Good-man's repeatedly—I had seen the telegram of June 15th from Mr. Grant to the syndicate: "We have obtained grand battery sight, water gratis but salt. Tell engineers the profit will be great, and immediate. Telegraph immediately if you can ship"—and also a cablegram of June 16th from Mr. Grant to the syndicate: "Continue shipments steadily.

Sale of shipments likely to show a very great profit"—I had seen that: "shipments likely to show a very great profit"—these telegrams and cablegrams produced a great impression on my mind—I thought that we were quite in a position to declare a dividend—at the statutory meeting on June 18th a cablegram or a telegram, or a copy of one, was put into my hand—I may have seen it possibly before at the board meeting—as far as I remember Mr. Goodman told me that he had<lb/>some rather startling revelations to make at the meeting, all of which were favourable—the manager said the business done was really in excess of that which had been previously represented, and that he himself investigated those statements for the purpose of ascertaining their truth—he said that the syndicate were traders for profit, and had in fact shipped very little that had not been previously ordered—I believed it at the time to be true—he said that the syndicate had already shipped some £60,000 worth of goods, and he (Goodman) had given his personal guarantee to the manufacturers and others to the extent of about £40,000—I believed that the syndicate had actually shipped these £60,000 worth of goods at that time—I had been told by Mr. Goodman that he had become a guarantor in respect of goods for the syndicate to the extent of £40,000 or thereabouts—he did not tell me who were the parties to whom he had guaranteed—I did not inquire—it was generally understood and believed by those in the office that £60,000 worth of goods had been shipped—I do not remember being told by others besides Mr. Goodman as to that particular item—Mr. Goodman said that the syndicate was in a position to pay a dividend many times that amount, for they had made profits equal to more than twice the amount of their capital (£20,000), and that had been done within 2 months—I believed that—I believed all Mr. Goodman's statements—I always thought him a man of a somewhat sanguine temperament, and a man who took an optimistic view, and I always looked for the grain of salt—I thought that he a little exaggerated, but I took it <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi> I may say—Mr. Goodman told me he would, in the event of the shares not being taken up by the public, take the balance up himself—I always re<lb/>garded</p>

               <p>him as a very wealthy man, quite capable of doing so—he always expressed his intention and willingness to do so I said: "Sir Edward Lee proposed a hearty vote of thanks to the chair-man, remarking that the results shown by the company in the short time during which it had been trading were simply phenomenal. As a director he knew of one successful deal, which of itself gave them suffi. cient profit for the payment of the present dividend"—I believed that the trading had been simply phenominal, having regard to the circum<lb/>stances, or I should not have said so—the contents to the telegram I saw at the statutory meeting was that a profit of £5,000 had been made on the sale of corrugated iron, so far as I remember—I am perfectly clear about the profit of £5,000—I believe that that profit had been made—when I said, "As a director he knew of one successful deal which of itself gave them sufficient profit for the payment of the present divilend," I referred to the dealing in corrugated iron and the telegram that I had seen—there was a board meeting on July 9th, at which I proposed the purchase of the ore atomic reduction process from Mr. Goodman—I had recent information as to the nature of that ore atomic process before I pro<lb/>posed it—I made also inquiries from other sources, and I saw the results of experiments made about the process, and I had a. very firm belief in its efficiency—I had nothing to do with fixing the price of that—I heard it afterwards—I thought it so good a thing that you could not pay too high a price for it—I knew that Mr. Goodman had some interest in the process at the time, but I did not know the extent at all—I did not know what he paid for the interest he had—between June 18th, the statutory meeting, and July 10th, the extraordinary general meeting, I bad heard increasingly good reports of the business and the trade done by the syndicate; from Mr. Goodman, and the same parties as before—I heard Mr. Goodman say, "When I last stood before you our undertaking was an infant, although a very vigorous baby, for unlike other infants, it was able to lilt a load equal to its own weight, and to carry in its arms a dividend at the rate of 100 per cent, per annum. Since we last met, the business of our trading syndicate has increased by leaps and bounds; in fact, we have had to charter our own vessels to cany out our goods, and I may tell you confidentially that this trading branch of our business is bringing us in a revenue at the rate of £85,000 per annum"—I believed at that time that the trading of the syndicate had increased by leaps and bounds; it was a general topic in the office—I had not heard before that the syndicate had had to charier its own vessels to carry out its goods to Australia—I heard Mr. Goodman say it—I thought it quite possible he had done so, and I believed it—he said: "that this trading branch of our business in bringing us in a revenue at the rate of £85,000 per annum"—that would be practically about £25,000 for the four mouths that had been carried out—I believed that statement—I had not heard any<lb/>thing about those tigures that were mentioned, or anything like them, before I went into the meeting—I believed that "Under the energetic direction of our chief manager in West Australia, new districts are being opened up throughout the gold area"——I said: "Surprise had been expressed that such remarkable success had been gained in so short a time, and with so small a capital, but for months previous to the</p>

               <p>company's formation, Mr. Goodman had had pioneers in Australia working at his own expense, and when the syndicate was established hey knew exactly how to go to work, what was required, how to buy at the cheapest markets, and how to make very large profits"—Mr. Goodman told me distinctly he had friends of his prospecting and in<lb/>specting the place, and paving the way for the starting of this business, and that he had them before forming the syndicate—he told me that they had done so at his expense—from what he said I was justified in telling the shareholders that: "thus the syndicate knew exactly how to go to work, what was required, how to buy at the cheapest markets, and how to make very large profits"—I said: "When the business was pro<lb/>gressing by leaps and bounds they had some difficulty in regard to finances, upon which Mr. Goodman made himself personally responsible to the extent of some £60,000 for goods sent out to Australia. They had thus had more capital to work upon than appeared"—Mr. Goodman told me as to the guarantee for £60,000; I did not fabricate the statement—I was present at the confirmatory meeting required by the Statute, held on July 27th—I heard Mr. Goodman say that he had never sold or offered for sale a single share either directly or indirectly, and he challenged any<lb/>body to disprove this statement: "I will give £100 to every important hospital in London if anyone can stand up and prove that my veracity on this point is to be doubted"—I believed that statement—I received at the time of the conversion of the company, or shortly afterwards,2,050 ordinary shares in return for my 100 founders' shares—about October 5th I purchased with my own money 100 ordinary shares in the oorpora<lb/>tion at £1 17s. 6d. each through a Mr. Meadowcroft—this is a cheque for £186 (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) dated October 5th—that is the cheque I paid at that time—it was passed through my banker, and paid by me for the purchase of those shares on October 5th—they were in the corporation, not in the syndicate—I bought those shares because I had faith in the corporation's future, and believed it to be a thoroughly good investment—I had no idea at that time that either Mr. Goodman, Mr. Squier, or Mr. Bernard, General Tulloch, or Dr. Ogilvie had been dealing, or were dealing, in those shares, going in and out of the market, or anything of that kind—except receiving 100 shares, and 25 shares in the syndicate, and receiving the shares in the corporation in exchange for them, and my purchase of those shares for £186 in October, I never in any way whatever dealt with any shares of the company—through my advice my only sister invested in the company and lost a good deal of money, and other relatives and friends of mine did also, some thousands—I did not advise them particularly, but they knew I was interested in the company, and that I believed it was a good company—one friend alone (Mr. Earle), the very gentleman who has become bail for me, paid over a cheque for £ 1,500, and lost every penny of it—<hi rend="italic">on</hi> January 31st I sold through Mr. Meadowcroft 1,000 of the shares I held for the large price of 9d. each—I paid Mr. Meadowcroft the com<lb/>mission for selling them—the meeting in November was to take place on a certain day—previous to that day I was told that Mr. Goodman was very ill—I was most anxious that he should occupy the chair, because he knew, of course, more about the affairs of the company than anyone else—I called at Mr. Goodman's house the night before, and found him in</p>

               <p>bed—he told me his doctor had pronounced him very much better, and he would be quite capable of taking the chair on the following day at the meeting—I was very glad to hear it<lb/>the time of the meeting arrived and Mr. Goodman did not put in an appearance—the solicitor of the company, Mr. Rendall, came, and handed me a medical certificate to say that Mr. Goodman was quite incapable of attending—then Mr. Rendall said I must take the chair—I said, "Why? Why should not the senior director, Dr. Ogilvie, take the chair?"—he said, "He will make a mess of it. You must do so," and I had to face that terrible ordeal without a minute's notice, and not knowing the details of the company; but I was very much gratified to find that Mr. Grant, who had just previously arrived from the scene of his labours he had gone through in West Australia, would be able, as I believed, to say that he had done a very considerable amount of business there; but instead of coming to bless us, he came to curse us, and said he had done no business whatever, which positively astounded me—I had previously written Mr. Grant a letter introducing a gentleman who bad gone out) there, and I think ic was very unfair that Mr. Grant had informed me, in answer to my letter, that the business had not been done, when I believed that a great deal of business had been done—from time to time I sought the advice of Mr. Rendall, the solicitor, and a partner in a firm of solicitors, Messrs. Sutton, Ommanney, and Kendall—they have been alluded to as an eminent firm, and they are, and I think it is unfair that the prominent part they took in the formation of these companies cannot be brought to the front; direc<lb/>tors are held blameable for what appears in a prospectus, but the solicitors who draw them up, or rather who father them, and from seeing whose names on them one believes the contents of a prospectus to be perfectly true, whereas they are not true, are not blameable—I took their advice throughout as to the dealings of the company—a member of that firm was present at all the board meetings, and when any difficulty or complicated matter arose they were referred to, and their advice was taken—they knew the whole history of the trading syndicate, they knew what had been done, and what had been left undone, but notwithstanding that they fathered the prospectus when they knew it was misleading—if the object of this prosecution is to put a check on the formation of fraudu<lb/>lent and bogus companies, I think that if the prosecution paid a little more attention to the solicitors who gave advice, rather than to directors who take their advice, it would be better—Mr. Senior did not say that he thought I had better resign, and if I did not resign my directorate I should live to regret it; he never made any statement of that kind—I think the incident as to the loan of £1,000 has not been put very fairly to me, inasmuch as it would appear that I had purposely gone to the office in order to enter into a conspiracy with Mr. Goodman in order to get money when the circumstances did not justify such an advance-nothing of the kind occurred—this was being negotiated at the office by Mr. Goodman, and I happened, accidentally, to be there—he called me in and introduced me to Mr. Trubshaw as a City merchant—very much later on he told me he was a professional moneylender—he produced a letter or a telegram to the effect that money was forthcoming, and so on—under the circumstances I felt justified in recommending the loan to be</p>

               <p>with reference to the business of a company—I should take it that it is one of the duties of a director to accept without confirmation any state<lb/>ments made by the managing director—on June 18th I proposed a dividend at the <hi rend="italic">rate</hi> of 100 per cent, per annum for the three months end<lb/>ing May 24th—I saw the telegram of June 16th from Grant to the syndicate in London: "Please refer to my telegram of the 12th of June. 400 more than shipped. Continue shipments steadily. When is it ex<lb/>pected te arrive? Sale of shipments likely to show a very great profit—it did not at the time convey to my mind that the shipments had not yet arrived—I did not think very much about it—I had very little to do with the conduct of the business—I say in a casual way these telegrams were submitted to me—the entire management of the business was in Mr. Goodman's hands—I believed the goods had arrived long before May 24th, not from having seen that tele<lb/>gram, but from other information that had been imparted to me—I heard in the office, from Mr. Goodman, Mr. Squier, and Mr. Bernard, that they were constantly shipping goods to Australia, and I believed they were doing so; I had no doubt about that—the business had every aspect of a very thriving business being carried on at that time——I saw some of the invoices from time to time, but the management was so completely in Mr. Goodman's hands that I, like the other directors, did not take a very active part; not so much as I ought to have done perhaps—I did not know that the first shipment was on June 2nd—I did inquire what the date was—I imagined that some of the shipments were sold in advance by Mr. Grant; that is what I was told: sold on arrival—I was under the impression that the goods had been sent, and were being sent constantly to Australia—I do not know that that particular telegram influenced me to any great extent—I had certain telegrams submitted to me—I did not take much heed of their contents—I do not know that I saw the copy cable referred to in that inland telegram of May 25, from Mr. Squier to Mr. Goodman; "Send you copy cable, have wired Walker's and put order in hand, profit about£5,000"—I took it for granted that it was <hi rend="italic">bonafid</hi>—acting as a director, I proposed that dividend of 100 per cent, per annum for three months up to May 24, because on that date I was informed that one deal alone in corrugated iron had realised j£5,000—I do not think I asked to see the document—I do think 1 did—I inquired what the ex<lb/>penses of management, the rent of the offices, and so on, were that were to be set against anything that had been earned, but I was always met I with this answer: that the business practically, having only extended I over three months, was really carried on by cablegram—I asked for papers I and documents and books, but they said in due course they would be forthcoming from the other side; the balance-sheet would be made up then, and it would be found that there was ample money to pay the dividend in question—there was a memorandum before the board meetings, and so on—I do not think any statement was drawn up showing how that dividend of 100 per cent, per annum was arrived at; in fact, I asked for it, and was told there was not one—I think I asked before I proposed the dividend—I was told we could not have one, because the accounts had not arrived from the other side—the material I alluded to was a telegram as to that one deal in corrugated iron, and corrugated iron was</p>

As a director, he knew of one successful deal which of itself gave them sufficient profit for the payment of the proposed dividend"—I certainly thought I was justified in making that statement, or I should never have made it——I do not now because the bubble is pricked, and the whole history of the place is known, but at the time I had the conviction that it was a sound and going concern, and I should not have declared a dividend unless I thought it was honestly earned—I think I was guilty of great acts of omission as a director, and I am sorry for it, and I am sorry that I ever associated myself with this miserable company—when I said on July 10th: "As one behind the scenes I could bear testimony to the fact that this baby was vigorous, as had been described, and it was due to the careful nursing it liad received at the hands of the chairman "I meant Jto infer that I was a director, nothing more than that—I admitted just now that I did not use those means that were at my disposal with the discretion a director ought to adopt—I did not realise the influence it would have on the share-holders; I believed it to be true—they may have considered it of more value than I did myself—I do not know with what object I was presented with £100 to take shares on becoming a director; that is a question Mr.</p>

Macdonalds they were; and I should not think they would take shares in a company they knew nothing about—I do not understand book-keeping, and I am very poor at figures—I admit I should understand a profit and loss account, perhaps—I inquired whether there was such a document as that drawn up in con<lb/>nection with this company, and found there was not—I made that inquiry repeatedly and constantly, as I said before, to Mr. Wright—I made it to the board—I made it before I proposed the dividend of June 18th, and I was told it was absolutely impossible to get it—I stated that on July 10th Mr. Goodman had given a guarantee for £60,000—he said so—on June 18th it had been £40,000—I had no authority beyond Goodman's words for putting it at £60,000—he told me upon several occasions, and he was believed to be a very</p>

               <p>so; I remember it perfectly well; it was with regard to his resignation, and it came out in evidence at Bow Street that Mr. Senior was introduced by Mr. Grant, and was a friend of his, and at the time he was a director of this company he was trying to negotiate an insurance for a very large sum on Mr. Goodman's life, and it came out in evidence that if he had succeeded in that half the com<lb/>mission would have gone to Mr. Grant and half to him, and it is a significant fact, or else a strange coincidence, that at the very time the insurance fell through Mr. Senior resigned his position as a director—I think if he was a friend of Mr. Grant's he should have given his warning to him instead of asserting that he warned me—he did nothing of the kind; on the contrary, he tried to induce me to procure some insurances for the company he represented—I do not think I was present at the board meeting when Mr. Senior's letter of resignation arrived—I know the conditions under which those minutes were prepared—they were prepared by the secretary from rough agenda sheets prepared by the secretary—I do not dispute that they were substantially correct, but in points of detail they are not accurate—I am put down in those minutes as being present and proposing resolutions when I did not do either—I will not dispute the fact that I was present at the meeting of March 26th—I have no recollection of it, but I suppose Mr. Senior's resignation was discussed—I suppose the letter from Mr. Senior arrived in time for that meeting—I should take it for granted it was discussed, and I regarded it as a very good thing—I should think undoubtedly it was at once accepted—I do not know of anything to the contrary—so far as I am pet<lb/>sonally concerned it would have been accepted at once, because I did not think he was an acquisition to the board—he gave very adverse evidence against me, and I feel strongly about it—I have not the least recollection of its being discussed on the 26th at that meeting—I did not hear of Mr. Senior's name being retained as a director on the board till June 2nd—Mr. Senior called on me at Waterloo Place—I do not remember his saying anything whatever about his resignation—I do not swear he did not—it is three years ago, and it is impossible to swear to it—I have no recollec<lb/>tion about it—he called to get insurances if he could for his business—Mr. Senior did not tell me that I should be careful or I might have cause to regret it—I say emphatically he said nothing of the kind to me—it was my impression that Mr. Senior's resignation was due to a totally different cause than that which he himself has stated—he asserts that I was pre<lb/>sent at board meetings with Mr. Senior before he resigned—I do not re<lb/>member being so—my name appears in the minutes—I am aware that. the board meetings were a little irregular and sometimes very short—I have said possibly. "Mr. Senior, the third director, I never to my knowledge saw"—I will give you evidence of it; there is a gentleman I see in Court now who saw me at Bow Street nod to a certain gentleman, and I asked him who he was, and that was proof positive that I did not know Mr. Senior or remember him; it was Mr. Senior—he called on me at Waterloo Place—lots of people call on me—I saw so little of him that I had for gotten him—I may have said in my examination that I never bought or sold any shires—I did not con ider that I was selling them, I was pracically giving them away—I said to Mr. Moran, I was so disgusted,</p>

               <p>"Take them and do anything with them"—but I bought shares—if I said that I never bought or sold any shares it is incorrect, but it is an unintentional mistake, I did buy 100 in the name of Meadowcroft, and paid for them—I do not know if they were in my name or Mr. Meadow-croft's name, the scrip is here—if I said that I did not buy any ordinary shares in the new company it is irreconcilible, and I should take it it was said under a misapprehension—I should tnke it it did not occur to me at the time—I have never dealt or trafficked in shares beyond what I have said—if I said that I made a mistake, that is all I said—I do not know why these shares did not appear in my name—they were bought by Mr. Meadowcroft, who is a very sold friend of mine, I p aid him com<lb/>mission, I retained the majority, the rest he retained and paid me—they were put in the name of James Meadowcroft, I cannot tell you why: I saw him and told him to buy them—it was the time when I was recommended to buy them by Mr. Goodman—I do not know why he did it—he is a man in whom I place implicit confidence—it did not much matter whether it was in his name or mine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner</hi>). I was formerly secretary of this company—I was engaged by Mr. Goodman as a clerk, in the first place at' a salary of £3 per week, and I remained at those duties until Mr. Slater" the secretary death—I was then appointed as secretary—Mr. Slater's name appeared as secretary on the prospectus of the syndicate—I acted as secretary during his illness—he ultimately died, and I was then appointed secretary in his 1 place—he was down at Ventnor in the mean-time ill—when I was first appointed my duties were to correspond with Mr. Slater and report to him daily, or almost daily, what went on, and take suggestions from him as to the floating of the syndicate in the early days—first I was a clerk, then manager, as it were, and then secretary, and do I remained until the roconstruction of the company into the corporation—I was assistant manager to Mr. Squier in the first place—I went to Australia immediately following the reconstruction—I had only been about ten days manager then—before I went to Australia Mr. Squier had sole control of the correspondence and all the cables that went out—my duty was to make a copy of them, decode the copy, and place it on the file in the office for reference—sometimes the cables were decoded on the following day, sometimes a day or two after; whenever I had spare time—they were first put in code form, then copied into the press letter copy book of the company, and subsequently a copy would be made from that decoded and placed on the file—I never once sent out any of these code cablegrams—I never knew when they would be sent, or what would be sent—they would be made, out and sent into my office or into the clerks' office for transmission—during the time I was acting as secretary many people</p>

               <p>came to the office; travellers, merchants, and so on, and stockbroker, and jobbers, and others, a great number of Mr. Goodman's friends, and so on, gentlemen—Mr. Squier saw them—the correspondence with Aus<lb/>tralia passed before me from time to time—I had opportunities of observing and knowing everything—Mr. Squier saw the merchants and stockbrokers who came—there was a Mr. Dezeckly in the office; he used to interview a number of stockbrokers, he had a lot of friends on the Exchange—when I was first introduced to Mr. Goodman I was asked to collect what data T could dealing with the trade of the Colony, and what its requirements were, and so forth; and I did collect all the information I could with a view to forming a prospectus; in fact, I was asked to put the information into prospectus form in the first place, and then it was supervised and improved by suggestions from Mr. Grant and others and finally approved—a got up the prospectus of the syndicate about Western Australia from the Agent-General's office chiefly, and what the require<lb/>ments in Western Australia were, for Mr. Goodman in forming the pro<lb/>spectus—I had nothing to do with the prospectus of the corporation—I was ordered to Australia on the day that that prospectus was approved by the directors—it was not prepared at my office but at another office altogether, No. 28 of the same street—there were several notes already typewritten, and I was asked to arrange them in something like order and rotation, for Mr. Goodman's guidance on the occasion of the forthcoming speech, and I did that, and there were one or two discussions, and I made some notes as they appear—I put the typewritten notes together and filed them in order, and made some notes myself—I should like to see the originals—I have not yet—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the first: "Four years ago there was scarcely any capital embarked in W.A., now some £50,000,000 is invested"—that is not type<lb/>written—a little further on: "£60,000 trade," is not my writing; it is Mr. Goodman's—whether he made them after I had made mine I cannot say at this distance of time, to be fair—I do not know about those in red—I see one of mine here: "Agency, what has been offered and accom<lb/>plished"—they refer to what was going on in the office, of course—another Says: "On the eve of what is going on in the colony, of a wave of great prosperity"—at that time I believed there was a great opening in the colony of Western Australia—I think everybody shared that belief—there was a lot in the papers of that time—it was on the top of the Boom in Western Australia—another note of mine says: "Being a trading com<lb/>pany, we are not engaged in any speculative transactions"—I believed that at the time, and I believed that that idea was always carried out—this note: "We have pleasure in declaring an interim dividend for the first 3 months at the rate of 100 per cent," is Mr. Goodman's—I had nothing to do with that note—this: "We have made profits equalling twice the amount of our capital: take advantage of the compulsory meet<lb/>ing to give a little bit of sugar for the bird "; is in Mr. Goodman's writing—I had nothing to do with that—it is an expression that is quite new to me—Mr. Squier sent the cable: "Do you require any more galvanised sheet iron?" and so on—"Suggest telegram as follows: 'Transactions are enormous. Continue shipments steadily'"—all the cables would be in my writing without exception, I think—my knowledge of that particular one</p>

               <p>is that it was sent in to me to be dispatched and I made, as my custom was, a fair copy of it on an Eastern telegram form, a copy in code—I did this and sent it out into the clerks' office to be sent off—I should not have re<lb/>membered it but for the fact of the little cheque—it appeared that there was not sufficient petty cash, and I drew a cheque and suggested that Mr. Goodman should be asked to cash the cheque for the purpose of sending out the cable, but Mr. Goodman was not present, and I had to send a clerk and ask him to oblige me—with regard to the letter to Mr. C. D. Napier, Perth, it would be, as in most of my other correspondence, my-custom always, before closing a mail letter, to send into the office where it was being copied, and say, "You had better ask whether Mr. Goodman has anything to add"—I should sign it—it is type<lb/>written—I attached no significance to that at the time—at the time I wrote the letter I should not; have decoded the words—I see it is on the same day, the mail day, and I should have no time for that—decoding would take place some time afterwards; mail day is Friday, and then comes Saturday, and it would not be done then, and then it would be done in the next week—the course of business as to the cablegrams was the same as I have described in re<lb/>gard to this; always so, without exception—with regard to letters written by Mr. Grant from Australia direct to the managing director, if I was first in the office I should open them, and if Mr. Squier was there before me he would open them, and they would be placed on the file of corre<lb/>spondence, after they had remained a day or two in the private office of the board room—I think those orders for iron are responsible for all the mischief—the iron was being sold to arrive, and Mr. Grant's cables were so worded that everybody, I think, including myself, was misled—his advice was that he could sell iron at £30 a ton, providing it was freight paid port of shipment; and then his inquiries as to the importance of knowing when they would arrive led to the belief that those shipments of iron were being sold by him to arrive, which is the usual custom of the iron trade all over the world—from anything I knew: I thought the iron we were shipping at £18 a ton would be sold on arrival at £80; I thought everybody did; and then it was found that the iron cost not £18, but only £14, as the in<lb/>voices show—the same explanation applies to all the cables and letters—I was present at the meeting at which this spbech of Mr. Goodman was made—I read the notice convening it, and I handed up the notes to the chairman as he went along—I had a letter dated August 5th, informing me of my appointment, and I left London on August 7th—I was never in the corporation offices, except on a flying visit perhaps—I went to Australia to superintend, in the first place, the patents of the ore atomic reduction process—it was a patent acquired by Mr. Goodman and sold to the syndicate in the first place—I had acquired right in respeot of it—I heard a good deal about it from him—I had seen it demonstrated—when I got to Australia I believed that this ore atomic process was a valuable one—I took steps to have it registered in Aus<lb/>tralia immediately on my arrival—the drawings and specifications had been sent on, and were there when I arrived—they were sent by James and Fell, the patent agents, to their agent out there—I learned the moment I arrived in the colony that there had been articles in the Australian papers with regard to this process—I saw one or two articles</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100136"/>
               <p>in regard to it in the Coolgardie mining papers—I arrived in Westeni Australia on September 5th—I went overland, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Brindisi, the same as the mails—I will not say my attention was drawn to this article about the ore atomic, but Mr. Sparrow, or his manager, told me about it on my arrival—Mr. Sparrow was not the solicitor of the corporation Mr. Grant said he was, but it was not so—he was the consulting engineer and the agent of Messrs.Tames and Fell, the patent agents, of London—he was acting with regard to the registration of that patent—everything was sent to him direct by James and Fell, his London principals—when I sent that telegram of September 11th, I believed that this process was causing intense excitement; I had evidence of it; I was besieged by inquirers—I believe that I was justified in using the phrase "phenomend royalties'—I interviewed a few firms in the colony who had attorneyship for all the mining companies operating on the goldfields, the law requires that there shall be an attorney registered in the colony, and this business is confined to a very small circle—I went round with Mr. Sparrow's manager in the first place, and told them what I was proposing to do, and I demonstrated it, and I said I should invite all the experts and press to witness the demonstrations, and Mr. Sparrow's manager assisted to demonstrate it because he was a practical engineer—Mr. Sparrow was away at the Kalgoorlie extension opening—I was offered £l per ton, and I was told in London I should only get 4S. a ton—it was in conse<lb/>quence of getting an offer of £1 per ton that I telegraphed these phe<lb/>nominal royalties—I had maty offers of that—from Australia I wrote several letters; these are the only two that have been taken hold of by the prosecution—I wrote regularly—eventually I heard that proceedings were being taken in this matter in England—I wrote expressing my intention to surrender—we waited for Mr. Moran's return to the colony from London; he had gone to London—he was back—he had been appointed, I heard, by the Official Receiver to take charge of the assets of the company lying at Fremantle, which were very large—I thought I would wait till he came back to hear what news there was, and I said: "What had we better do? Who has got this now in hand?" and he said I had better telegraph to Mr. Duncan—he said his address was "Factotum"—I did so, to know if I should leturn to London in case my evidence was required, in which case I should like to apply to the agent in the colony to advance my expenses and passage money—I was dis<lb/>missed altogether without notice or reason or anything else by Mr. Goodman by cable on December 1st, long before it went into liquida<lb/>tion—immediately on receipt of my dismissal I wrote the letter of December 4th to Mr. Goodman: "I have just been notified," &amp;c—I returned to England last August, and when I heard that criminal pro<lb/>ceedings were about to be taken I wrote to Mr. Sims—I had not posted it, but it was stamped and sealed up—I was escorting my wife to the train; I had been to take advice as to what I should do, to tell you the truth, when I was arrested—I should like to add, if I am not out of order, that that cable which I sent, which has been rather severely criticised, speaking of the Government support which was promised, that; it was not only promised, but extended, I mean to my corporation—at the time I wrote the letter of September 17th I had had communication with Sir Gerard Smith, the Governor, and a promise had been held out</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100137"/>
               <p>of Government support—the facts were these: I bad the honour of being introduced to his Excellency on his return from the opening ceremony of the Kalgoorlie railway extension; it had been a sort of public holidays in the colony, and was quite a little event; he mentioned that our company had come under his notice, and that he had been speaking of it and comparing it with mining companies: he said that trading companies were what were wanted for the colony; there was no other, and he thought we had practically the whole of the colony before us; he felt quite sure we should do very well, and that I was at liberty to inform<lb/>my directors that in all cases we should have the fullest Government support—he asked me questions as to capital and so forth, and I thanked him for the compliment conveyed—I felt Mr. Goodman would be gratified to know that that conversation had passed, and I sent that telegram to Mr. Goodman accordingly, addressed to him privately, immediately after that interview—that is what suggested it to my mind, and nothing else—the corporation had just started when I left London, and I was under the impression that most of the capital had been underwritten—before I left London I was told so—I found in the colony that Grant had done no-business; that was Grant's fault—he told me he proposed to return to London—goods were there and were not sold, and I assumed there was no effort made to sell them—there is a minute in the early days of the syndicate which has been criticised—it would almost appear from the criticism that there was the right to the secretary and Mr. Groodman to draw moneys <hi rend="italic">ad lib</hi>,—I may tell you that that minute was a minute supplied by the Capital and Counties Bank, and is the usual form used by all companies, and is printed by them and supplied to the secretaries of companies by the bank—this cheque for £100 was paid to General Tulloch.

               <p>Amount of profit had been made, from conversations and everything which I heard and saw in the offices—no calculation was made or any statement drawn up showing how that dividend was to be arrived at, to my knowledge, nor was any account taken of the expenditure to my knowledge—I did not keep the books of the company, there was a book-keeper and an auditor to supervise all that—referring to my letter of June 26th, at page 61 of the Exhibits, to sell goods to arrive you must know the name of the maker, the mark of the goods, and the ship; generally that would be so, of course, but not necessarily the name of the ship—it is usual to say, for instance, the June or July delivery, or the April and May delivery, or thereabouts—that is the usual form of con<lb/>tract in such cases—this letter of June 26th shows that up to that date only 100 tons had been shinped, evidently—I mean to say that it was believed that the moment Mr. Grant was informed that iron could be and would be delivered at a certain date he would have sold it or would have been able to sell it—I say it was the geueral belief in the office that iron had been sold to arrive that would pay a dividend at the rate of 100 per cent.—it was only necessary to send it and the profit was made—I do not say it was believed that the money had changed hands—I thought it was quite possible it could be done—it was written that he might expect the iron, July delivery, and that was being carried out—I had not wired the gauge—the letter of June 24th, 1896, would not arrive until after the dividend had been declared and paid—it is true, as he says, that he had not got any particulars which would enable him to sell the goods to arrive; we learnt that afterwards, that those particulars were necessary—we understood that Mr. Grant bad written the moment he arrived there, about the great demand for iron; and advising us to be prepared I to meet the big demand—prior to this there is some correspondence—I do not suggest there is some other cablegram which has not been put in—the moment Mr. Grant arrived in the colony he wrote saying that the Government had passed some resolution as to the use of iron in all structural matters—I only mention that, and I say that there was A great demand for all kinds of galvanised iron—it was accepted further that we could not make much of a mistake in giving 24 or 26 gauge, the usual gauge, and we inquired of Messrs. Walker Brothers, who supplied the iron, whether they knew what was required, and they said they had already supplied the Government of Western Australia with their brand and with that particular gauge—I found afterwards that that was true—I believed this dividend of 100 per cent, was justified; but I know it was prematurely declared, it should not have been declared at the time—everybody knew that declaration of that dividend—it was only an estimate after all said And done—as the syndicate was about to be merged into the corporation it was suggested, if I remember rightly, by General Tulloch, that the earlier subscribers to the syndicate would be left out in the cold and that the profits on these iron orders would go to the shareholders in the corporation when the reconstruction took place, and, therefore, he said, "I think those who have supported us from the first oughttohave a share in these profits, and we ought to pay them a dividend now before we go any further and it is too late," and that was done—that conversation at which this course</p>

               <p>was adopted, of declaring a dividend which had not been earned, if I recollect rightly, took place at one of the board meetings—I should not like to be positive at this distance of time, but I think it was in the board room—I should not like to be positive now what directors were present, it is three years ago—on May 26th I when the circular was sent out to several persons who had taken shares not a single article of merchandise had arrived in Australia, but all these goods were in course of shipment at that time—I may as well say at once that I do not remember anything about this circular—I appear to have signed it, but I do not recognise it as my diction—I know what the clerk said, of course, but I have no recollection of it—it hangs upon this, "The purchasers on the other side are busy in the disposal of this large consign<lb/>ment"; that is wrong—it should have been Busy in preparing to dis<lb/>pose of them "; of course that would have been more correct—as a matter of fact I cannot deny that statement was untrue—of course, it was signed by me—whoever may have said that I drafted it, I can only give you my denial—I have no recollection whatever of drafting any such circular—I signed it, evidently—I do not suppose I read it—I might have done, but I should say not—if I had read it I should have altered it and made it more correct—I supplied the witness Clarke or Bernard with it—they did the type-writing between them—I did not supply them with a draft as Clarke has said—I have no recollection of doing anything of the kind—I will swear I never read it—I will not swear I never handed them the draft, because it might have been given to me to do so—the letter goes on: "The range of profits have proved to be so great that my directors look forward to the statutory meeting of shareholders"—there had only been the profits up to that time, predicted by the orders in hand—I have not started to justify this letter—I do not say that is not true or part of it—the share capital of the syndicate was only £20,000, after all said and done—I remember the cable of June 5th: "We will not make any re<lb/>marks on this message, as its purport and object will be well known to you and further it will have, of course, had your careful attention and have served its purpose before this reaches you"—that was not my note at all—I do not admit that I wrote that cable—I do not admit that I supplied that note—I have signed it, but it would not be intelligible to me—there is a string of code words which if read out are unintelligible to anybody unless decoded—I decoded that message either on that day or within £ day or two subsequently—I did not understand it—I do not deny that I decoded it and put it on the file in thd usual way—it says: "Expect profit to be £25,000"—I immediately asked Mr. Squier what it was, and he told me that it was his view of the situation generally, and suggested that Mr. Grant should confirm it—his department was very busy at the time, and I think it was an outburst of zeal on Mr. Squier's part, forgetting that the transactions, however numerous and enormous tbey might be in Basinghall Street, had not had time to reach Mr. Grant's head-quarters—I presume he forget that—I do not know that I accepted any liability in the matter—I understood what the message meant when it was explained to me—it was suggested that £25,000 profit was the estimate made in the London office, and a suggestion that Mr. Grant confirmed that estimte—I</p>

               <p>perfectly understood that—I had nothing to do with its purpose—I saw the letter of July 10th from Mr. Grant stating, "Your cable of May 29th promised a remittance 'next Thursday,'" and so on—"Up to to-day, how<lb/>ever, no remittance has come to hand, and under the circumstances I hardly see how you can expect me to adopt your suggestion"—I under<lb/>stood the view that Mr. Grant took of it, and the interpretation he put on it—I do not say that I went through and corrected these notes for Goodman's speech—I made the alterations in one or two instances when it was pointed out to me—they were handed to me, and I just put them some, thing like in rotation—that is all I did—I do not know anything about "£60,000 trade"—I never saw this before—I was at the meeting—I heard the speech made, but I understood £60,000 was a sort of an estimate of the capabilities of the company at the time, rather than a definite statement of what had been accomplished—the exact words are: "They had already shipped some £60,000 worth of goods"—I understood Mr. Goodman afterwards to say he only said £6,000—I spoke to him about it the afternoon of the meeting when it was all over, and he said it was only £6,000, or that was all it was intended—I knew afterwards that this speech was circulated with the prospectus of the company, containing £60,000, but I never saw that till I got to Australia—I never saw the prospectus of the corporation—I saw it as the newspaper printed it—I suppose I must have heard Mr. Goodman say £60,000 at the meeting he is reported to have done so—I knew that he had in his mind ship<lb/>ments to a very large extent—I knew the machinery was to come to some £25,000—I thought he meant it as a rough estimate generally what was in course of shipment and in contemplation at the time he had given his personal guarantee to the manufacturers and others to the extent of about £40,000—I understood that to be quite true—I never saw such a. document—it would not pass through my hands—I heard of it from Mr. 1 Squier and Mr. Goodman—it referred to the machinery and to the galvanised iron—on page 84 in my handwriting is a correction, "Mr. L. H. G. undertaking and guaranteeing"—Mr. Goodman told me t<lb/>o make a note so that he should not foreet to mention something about it—I was told to write down: "The declaration of dividend," and that was the time to come to it—that memorandum was for reference by Mr. Goodman in his speech to the 100 per cent, dividend, the circumstances of the declaration of which I have told you about—"On the eve of a great era of success in the colony" is part of my writing, but the other is not—then the next entry in my writing is "Being a trading company, we are not engaged in any speculation transactions; we are simply buying and selling, and entering into contracts which are shown n to be secured before they are entertained"—that is right enough, I think—I was not sent out to supplant Grant—the circumstances which led to my superseding Grant were not anticipated when I left London—a power of attorney authorizing me to supersede Grant on getting a cable reached me almost immediately on my arrival, but I left with a power authorising me to act in concert with Grint in the ore atomic process—I knew that Grant had re<lb/>fused to send what has been called the bull telegram—it was not for that reason he was superseded, but because Mr. Grant appointed a Mr. Miller in West Australia to take all the assets of the</p>

               <p>Company; he had asaigned, eyerything over to Mr. Miller in September, 1896; instead of selling the consignments he assigned them to a perfect stranger; Mr. Liatham was there and I was there, and there were 8 other representatives of the company—there was no occasion to do the shipments up in such a way that anybody else could sell them—it was not part of the business on which I went out to Australia to cable out news which would promote the shares on the market—here is the cablegram of September 9th, "Send all the news you can for newspapers, and telegraph immediately"—my instructions were to demonstrate the ore atomic process as soon as I got there, and to invite the Press and send home the Press reports, and so forth—I did not tell Grant that that referred to something else, and not to this corporation at all—I deny the truth of what Mr. Grant has said—I did not tell him it did not come from the company at all, but I did say I was surprised it did not say where it came from, because I had made other arrangements—I was familiar with Reuter's code, and had arranged for that—I do not admit that that was sent with my knowledge to influence the price of shares on the market; I never was responsible for the cable being sent—I deny that that was what I understood it to mean when I got it—it meant that I was instructed to send him news for the newspapers for this ore aeomic process in particular, because this was the only right for West Australia—Mr. Goodman was largely interested in the Ore Atomic De<lb/>velopment Company; the rights for all the world; it was only the rights for West Australia that I was concerned in, and the result of the opera<lb/>tions there would influence the result of the process—the remarks that had been made at the meeting were treated with a great amount of curiosity in the colony, and scepticism sometimes—I was very anxious to demonstrate it—my corporation had nothing whatever to do with the opening of the Kalgoorlie extension—that was uppermost in my mind when I sent the cable, and knew the opening of the Kalgoorlie extension was looked forward to on the London market by everybody, and that it would be in the newspapers, and that Mr. Goodman would see it, and he would know that the Government on that occasion had been speaking about our company—cabling from Australia here costs 5s. 9d. a code word—"Opening Kalgoorlie extension" would be three words, and would cost three times 5s., 9d.; over 17s.—I have not said that those words had no meaning at all—I was practically repeating Sir Gerard Smith's re<lb/>marks; they had just come back from the openings and when they were up at the opening they said they were talking about the company; it was what the Government were talking about, and the amount of capital embarked in West Australia, and they compared our company with the,. mining companies, and they said too much was expected of West Aus<lb/>tralia from the number of mining companies brought out, and that it was a pleasure to see a trading company brought out—" A high compliment," etc, is perfectly true, it was not only promised, but it was extended; shortly after that I reminded one of the ministers of that promise, and he gave me the first order for 100 tons—"Profits must be many millions" were, His Excellency's own words; he said, "You have the colony before you," he asked what the capital was, and I said half a million, and he said, "You will make millions here"—that is a private cable to Goodman, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189904100142"/>
               <p>not to the office at all—I sent it because I knew Goodman would be very: glad that the Government had complimented us and promised us support, as a piece of private news to Mr. Goodman absolutely; T promised to keep him posted in everything that went on, nor was it used in any way—it was not sent for the newspapers at all; the newspapers would only apply to the ore atomic; these were my instructions, and I would have made a Very good thing of the ore atomic, I may say—I do not complain so much of Grant's conduct; I think I was very temperate in what I wrote—there was no reason on earth why Mr. Grant could not have duplicated copies of the correspondence between him and the company at home; and neither do I say there was—he pointed out to me the interpretation that could be put on the state<lb/>ment in the prospectus, and also the remarks in Goodman's speech—he told me he had some correspondence which had passed between him<lb/>self and Goodman of a private and unofficial nature, but he expressed no honest indignation on these statements at all, but what he did say was: "Unless I am paid my commission of £4,000 I will use these to enforce payment against Goodman"—these things were full of mis-statements according to his account—he expressed no honest indignation of these statements—there was a great deal that would have justified honest indig<lb/>nation from his point of view, according to his account, but I did not agree with him in the interpretation he put on the prospectus—25,175 ordinary shares of the syndicate and 2,910 founders' were put into my name—I simply had orders to make the entry in my name, and the shares would be held in reserve—I believe that is the custom—Mr. Goodman, who araanged the option with the brokers, Messrs' Hazeltine, gave me those orders—every now and then a batch would come in from the brokers, Messrs. Hazeltine, accompanied with a cheque for so many calls which they had disposed of on the market, they had a call on the shares—no transfer passed, they were put into Hazel tine's name—I was holding these shares for them and they were acting for the syndicate; the syndi<lb/>cate had given them their option—that was not for Goodman, that was for the company—the company benefited by the price paid—very few of the shares which stood in my name in the way I have described were held really by me for Goodman, although nominally for the company; most of that large number were held in reserve to supply Messrs. Hazel tine's call whenever they thought proper to make it—I knew Goodman was buying very largely and selling very largely—I did not know that the shares standing in my name were being used to facilitate these operations, nor were they—you might say the capital of the syndicate was underwritten by Messrs. Hazeltine—when they wanted the shares delivered, they were delivered against their cheque, but in the mean-time they were simply held in reserve, as it were, on behalf of Messrs. Hazeltine—no name need have been used at all—Messrs. Hazeltine were the brokers of the com<lb/>pany—they were delivered on behalf of the company, and the money would go into the company's funds—I never knew that I hid any shares at all in the corporation—I never had any notice that any shares were put in my name—the allotment of the shares of the corporation took place after I left England—I never had a share either in the one company or the other.</p>

               <p>upon—I examined the body—on the left side of the neck I found a deep incised wound about 2 1/2 ins. in extent; the edges were jagged, the muscles of the neck were severed, the wind-pipe penetrated, and it had also severed the large arteries of the neck—on the face and forehead I found a number of small incised wounds ranging from 1/8th to 1/4 in. in depth, and about 1/4 in. long or less, not more—there were 12 on the forehead, and 8 on the face—there were 4 wounds on the right side of the eye penetrating the orbit—they were more than 1 in. deep, 4 of the 8 penetrated from above and below, 4 of them on the right side and 3 on the left penetrated the orbit; both eyeballs were penetrated, one by 4 and the other by 3 wounds—over the right jaw there was a Urge wound, and a recent infusion of blood—on the back of the right hand there were 10 small incised wounds about 1/4 in. to 1 in. in length—on the palm of the right hand 3 wounds, and on the palm of the left 4 wounds, and 4 on the back of the left hand—over the lefe shin there was a bruise and a graze, a bruise on the left knee, and several old ones on both legs—a bruise on the right arm, and some bruises on the left wrist—next day I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found that the main organs were healthy—in my opinion the cause of death was syncope, following from loss of blood from the wound in the neck—that one wound would have required considerable force—I think the head must have been drawn back, and the wound caused by the knife on the table; the tissues were on the stretch—I think the wounds in the face were caused first, because there was considerable infusion into the eyes, and if the wound in the neck had been caused first, in all probability she would have been dead before the wounds were inflicted—the wound in the neck would have caused death in about half a minute, the loss of blood was so great—I think the wounds in the hands were caused by her putting her hands over her face—all the wounds could have been caused by the knife found in the room.</p>

I am a marine store dealer, of 1, Golden's Place Kennington—about 9.40 a.m. on March 15th the prisoner came into my shop, and asked me if I would buy a shawl and a pair of boots of him—I gave him 6d. for them; these are them (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—the prisoner was sober; there was nothing about him to make me think he was under the influence of drink—he had a barrow outside—I purchased some water-cress and radishes of him; he went away then, wheeling the barrow.</p>

                  </hi> (7 E.R.) About 6.30 p.m. on March 16th T was in Neal Street, Long Acre—in consequence of instructions, I went to the Horse and Groom public-house, and in the back yard I saw the prisoner—the had his overcoat in his left hand and was examining his pockets with the right—he was alone—I asked him his name—he said, "Brown"—after looking at me a second he said, "Oh, my name is Andrews; I know what you want"—I told him I should take him into custody on sus<lb/>picion of murdering bis wife at Kennington—he made no reply then—on the way to the station he said, "I did it with the knife which I left on the table"—I took him to Bow Street Police-station, where Inspector Roberts was on duty; the prisoner there gave his name again as Frederick Andrews.</p>

About 5.30 p.m. on March 16th I was at Bow Street Police-station when the last witness brought in the prisoner—I said he was brought there for the murder of his wife, and would be handed over to the police of the L. division—as I was about to put him away I said to him, "Have you a knife or anything about you?—he said, "No, I used the b——knife, or she would have used it about me; I killed the b——cow, and I will hang like one man for her"—he was afterwards handed over to an Inspector of the L. divison.</p>

About 6 o'clock on March 16th I was at Bow Street Police-station in the cell corridor in charge of the prisoner—he made a voluntary statement to me, I took it down as he spoke—he said, "The knife, the son put it in the cupboard to kill me. I killed her after I poked her eyes out with the knife and cut her throat after. I 'chucked' some flock and a bed on her, and left the house wheeling a barrow along the road, selling on the way. The son is the cause of all of it; thieving and robbing her and blaming it all on to me. He drove me to do it by his own weapon, and if I had met him last night I would have killed him and felt comfortable."</p>

               <p>and told him anything further said might be used against him—he then said, "It is no use denying it"—I took him to Kennington Lane Station in a cab—on the way he said, "This is a bad position to be in. I done it in drink; I have been drinking heavily. I had better be hung and get out of it quiek"—he was charged, and when it was read over to him, he replied: "Quite right, quite right"—the cuffs of his white shirt were smearod with blood, and also the front of the shirt, there was a blood stain on the right cuff of the overcoat—they were recent stains.</p>
