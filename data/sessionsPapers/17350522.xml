My Wife came out and gave it him and the Seal was not broke. He and she roll'd some Straw round it and put it into an old Pair of Leather Saddle Bags. They roll'd more Straw round the Saddle Bags, and then they were put into a small Pack of Goods and corded up, and this Pack was put into the Waggon, towards the Fore-end. The Waggon was loaded about eleven at Night, and about twelve it set out for London, My Brother Thomas went with it, but I did not go my self - On the Monday sennight, my Son In-law, William Mountain (the Monmouth Carrier) came and told me that the Money was lost.

            . I packed up the Money in the Waggon, and set out with it for London about twelve on Sunday Night, and am sure the Money was never stir'd till we came to Town, which was on the Friday following. For though there might be Passengers in the Waggon, yet they could not come at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173505220003"/> the Pack where the Money was, because there was a Quantity of Boxes and other things loaded upon, and on each side of it. And where we lay on the Road a Man had so much a Night for watching. And when we came into the Inn-Yard (in Friday Street) I am sure nothing had been removed. I did not stay to see the Waggon unloaded, but being tired, I left that to the care of the Prisoner and his Porters; and not thinking of the Money, I went into the Tap-house where I staid two or three Hours. Then the Prisoner came to me, and asked me about a little Parcel which I had taken up by the way. I have searched the Bags, says he, and it is not there, for there is nothing but Straw in 'em. - Nothing but Straw in 'em.? says I, in great Surprise, for then I thought of the Money - Sure you must be mistaken. I went into the Ware-house and found the Bags lying under his Desk, I searched them but there was none of the Money. The Porters were all gone. But when they came again next Morning, they denyed that they knew any thing of the Money.

He said he had done all that he could, and more than any body was aware of: And that he had heard there was two Men and a Woman concern'd. I asked who they were. He said he could describe them, but did not think it proper; and that in a little time a Man would bring a Woman to Confession; and I should see some Person in Goal before the matter all came out.</p>

The Prisoner answered, If you expect to have your Money again, you ought not to speak of it in a publick Yard but in a private Room.

I am glad of that, says I, for I have got a Pad-lock on my Door, and therefore if any Rogues should hear of so much Money in the House, they'll think its in my Room, and so I may be knock'd on the Head. My Husband coming home to Dinner, Edad she calls him in and shews him this Gold; but he loves to have me keep at home, and so says he, What a-pox do ye do out of your own Room? I went out a Nursing, and when I came home again the Prisoner's Wife said to me Ah, pox o' your Pad-lock! the Money's all gone.</p>

They answer'd, there's a Man beating a Woman unmercifully. I did not see him beat her, but going farther I heard her say, Ye Villain! you would not beat a Man so. I went up to her, and he and she were a little apart, and he was a Hoing. She said he had knock'd her down with a Hoe and stamp'd upon her Groin, and threatned to cut her Cloaths to pieces and stamp her Guts out at her Mouth for going upon his Crop. Ye Villain, says I, how can you serve a Woman so? Hold your Tongue, says he, or I'll give you as much more. I can't say the Prisoner is the Man. The Woman came every Day after, to my House, except the Day she dyed which was on the Sunday following. On the Thursday she got a Warrant; when she came back her Eye was black and swelled; she said she was afraid he had broke something within her, and she should die the death of her Husband, who was kill'd by Fighting.</p>

She said, she did not know, but it was one whose Name was Will. Ruberry, and he had beat her with a Hoe and stampt upon her. The Prisoner said he had only whipt her. They went before Justice Vincent, where the matter was made up upon the Prisoners paying her six Shillings. On Sunday Noon the Beadle came and told me she was dead.</p>

I mist it immediately, and said, he has got my Watch. Thereupon Hoxson went to the end of Red-Lyon-Street and call'd for help. When I was down, Sutton beat me violently, and the Prisoner Godson step'd up, and said, Sir, you have dropt your Watch in the Scuffle, and so he gave it me again. Company coming up, a Brick-layer said, Ye Dogs, do you rob at this time o' Day? I'll run my Trowel in your Guts. One Man collar'd Sutton, and then I ran to call a Constable.</p>

He answered he would serve me the same, and so he and I had two or three Struggles. I was sorry Sutton fell in my way, because I had some knowledge of his Family.</p>

               <p>I and Godson, Stockton and Benyan, met about two in the Afternoon at Lloyd's, the Sun and Horshoe in Dyer's Street, and there agreed to go into the Fie'ds and rob. From Lloyd's we went to an opposite Brandy Shop, and thence to an infamous House the Two Fighting Cocks at the Brill, kept by Taylor alias Pritchard. Going thence we met with the Prosecutor: One of us (who was in a Black Cap) fell upon him: I took his Watch and put it into my Waistcoat Pocket; but People coming up, and the Watch String hanging out, I threw the Watch on the Ground. Godson took it up, and gave it to the Prosecutor, that the Prosecutor might not think he belonged to our Company.</p>

As I was coming back I met Sutton, and he asked me to drink, for I had some knowledge of him, having formerly done Work for some of his Family. We went to the Sun and Horshoe, where I found two more of his Acquaintance: We drank together there, and when we came out I was going towards Hound's Ditch, but by their persuasions I went with them to a House a-cross the Fields, I don't know the House for I was never there before. But I was in haste to go home, and so we came away, and had not gone far before we met the Prosecutor, with whom one of Sutton's Acquaintance (in a Black Cap; had some Words, upon which, Sutton stept up and said, Damn ye, will you fight. Presently the Prosecutor said he had lost his Watch, at hearing which, I was frighted and trembled; but seeing a Watch upon the Ground, I took it up and give it to the Prosecutor.</p>

            , unbolted the Door, and presently five Men rush'd in with ten Pistols, each of the Men having one in each Hand, I cannot say positively that the Prisoner was one of them, but there was a Man among them pretty much like him. They swore they'd kill me, if I did not give 'em my Money. They took out of my Pocket a Guinea, a six-and-thirty. Shilling Piece, and between ten and twenty Shillings in Silver. They broke the two Buttons off my Breeches and let them down. They took me up Stairs, and said they wanted more Money. They broke open a Door there, and took out two Guineas, ten Shillings, a Silver Cup with two Handles, four Gold Rings, and three Silver Spoons - they had taken another Silver Spoon below Stairs - still they wanted more, and swore they would kill me if I did not tell them where the rest of my Money was. My Breeches being down, they set my bare backside on the Fire. I was not burnt indeed, but sorely scalded. They took a Case Knife, and threatned to rip me up, and brought a Bill to chop my Legs off to make me confess. They carried me into a Back Room where the Maid was beating up Butter, they took the Kettle off the Fire with two Pails of Water in it, and throwing me down, they threw the Water all over me, but it happened not to be quite scalding hot. My Son had in the House between twenty and thirty Pounds which was all lost - They took my Sheets, Table Cloths, Napkins, and all the best Linnen I had - They broke my Head with their Pistols, so that the blood run down and matted my Hair, and swore that I should not live till Morning if I did not discover where my Money was - One of them had a Linnen Cloth over his Face, and they had pull'd up the Capes of their Coats - At their first coming in, they broke a Fowling Piece which they found in my Room, and before they went, they said they'd go and serve my son Joseph just as they had served me, and bid my Boy shew them the way to his House; but I having another Son who was not come home, they were afraid to venture after they had staid three Quarters of an Hour for his coming. They then tyed my Hands and Legs, and the Hands and Legs of my Man and Maid and Boy, and so leaving us lying upon our Backs, they lock'd the Door and went away - They took from my House in Money and Goods to the value of about sixty Pounds.</p>

             at the Black Horse Inn in the Broad Way, Westminster, where my Horse and Gregory's stood. The Prisoner told us he had worked at Edgware, and had shod this Farmer (the Prosecutor's) Horses, and that he was worth a good deal of Money, and it was by his Advice that we went thither. The Prisoner and I, and Rose went out first; Turpin and Fielder follow'd, and overtook us on the Road; we drank two or three Pots at the Bowl and Skettle on the Hill on this side Edgware. Thence we went to the Queen's Head at Stanmore, where we drank Beer, and eat Bacon and Eggs for Supper. We set out again between six and seven. I believe it wanted but a small matter of seven, and so rode into the Farmer (Lawrence's) Grounds, as I suppose they were, and tyed up our Horses within a Quarter of a Mile of his House. Hearing the Boy calling up the Sheep, we staid a little and then went forward, and Fielder jumpt over a sort of a half Door and seiz'd the Sheep-boy, and tyed his Hands, and bid him go to his Master's Door and knock, and answer to any Body that asked who was there. He knock'd, a servant Man open'd the Door; I and Rose and the Prisoner had two Pistols each, but I think that Turpin and Fielder had but one a-piece. We all rush'd in; we bound the Boy again (for we had unbound him) and then we bonnd the Man and the Maid. I stood over them, while the others carried up the Old Man to make him shew them the House. All the Money that I saw was three Guineas, two Half Crowns and eighteen Pence. The Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173505220011"/> came down to the Maid, and said, Damn Ye, shew me where your Master's Money is. She made him a Curtesy, and said, she did not know. But he made her go up Stairs with him: And when she came down, she cryed; I asked her if any body had beat her; she answered, No, But one of your Men has lain with me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she say by force?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I did not hear her say so. We put the Linnen in Sacks - the Plate I believe they put in their Pockets - and carried all to our Horses. We came home about eleven, and next Day we divided our Booty. Rose gave us fifteen Shillings for all the Linnen, and he likewise bought of us the two handled Silver Cup, three Gold Rings, three Silver Spoons. but I can't say now for how much; and Mrs. Rose made them off for him. The Prisoner, as we were going home, told us, I believe twenty times, that he had lain with the Maid in the Garret.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say by force?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. He said, he bolted the Garret Door, and laid a Pistol on the Bed while he lay with her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't deny that I was with them at the Prosecutor's House, but I had nothing that came from thence, for they were taken that Day sennight.</p>
               <p>Wheeler. He was with us when we divided the Money, and had his part, and perhaps more than I, for they cheated me in every respect; so that out of sixty Pounds, I had but four.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I ought to have had my share of whatever was taken - though I cannot say that any thing was taken, for I went no farther than just within the Door where I stood to watch.</p>
               <p>Court. But when they went away, Did you see no Sacks carried out?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Not to my knowledge.</p>

I did not see them take the Goods, for I and the Man and the Boy were tyed in the Parlor. But then the Prisoner came and said, I should go up Stairs with them. Wheeler went formost, and the Prisoner took me up after him into my Master's Room, and they said, they'd Rankshattle in that Room. Wheeler went to the Foot of the Garret Stairs and would go no farther; but the Prisoner swore that he would go up, and he forced me up with him into the Garret, and there he swore he would lie with me. I told him I was a young Girl, and knew nothing of the matter; but he bolted the Garret Door, and swore if I would not yield, he would kill me; and so he threw me on the Bed, and laid one Pistol upon the Bed, and another on a Chest just by, and forced me.</p>

            . Between one and two on Sunday Morning, the twenty seventh of April, the Watch called me up, and said, my House was broke open. I went into my Yard, and saw a Man standing there, but as soon as he perceiv'd the Light of the Lanthorn, he stept into a Ballast Lighter that was moor'd under the Crane. I found fifty two Sticks of Logwood lying in the Yard close to the Water Side. The two Prisoners were both found in the Lighter, and pretended they were driven thither by Stress of Weather, tho' there was no Wind stiring. They had left their Key in the Warehouse Door. Before the Justice they denied that they were in the Yard; yet Joyner own'd that Key, and they both confest that they moor'd the Lighter there.</p>

            . About one in the Morning, it being just High Water, my Boat got a Shore by this Gentleman's Yard, and had like to have been over set. I saw this Ballast Lighter coming up with two Men in her, and suspected they had no good Design, and so I lay down in my Boat to watch them. Presently they moor'd the Lighter under the Crane and both came ashore, and whispered. Then they went towards the Warehouse, and I heard the Door open. I saw them bring out Logwood, and lay it by the Water Side. I believe they went seven or eight times in the same manner. It was a Moon-light Night, and tho' I could not then distinguish their Faces because I was on the other Side of the Dock, yet I can swear that the Men that came out of the Lighter, were the same Men that opened the Warehouse Door, and brought out the Woods, for I could see very plainly that there was no other Person in the Yard; and they and no others<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173505220015"/> were taken in the Lighter. I went and call'd the Watch, and then the Prisoners jump'd off the Wharf into the Lighter, where they were both taken.</p>
               <p>Easton. Was there no other Lighter?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Yes; there was a Chalk Lighter.</p>

            . I was just come from Eriff, and went to the Watch House, when Lewis came and told us the Ware House was broke open. We went in my Boat, and I heard the Logwood rattle; but as soon as the Light came, I saw the Prisoners jump off the Wharf into the Lighter. Joyner crept under the Foresail, and Easton laid down on the Windless, both pretending to be asleep. I pulled the Foresail off Joyner, and he asked hastily what's the matter? what's the matter? - When they were before the Justice, Joyner own'd that the Key which was found in the Ware House Door, was the Key as locked his Oars.</p>
               <p>Joyner. We had no Oars at that time.</p>
               <p>Jones. May be so - But you said so for all that.</p>
               <p>J. Swainson. There were fifty two Pieces of Logwood, and one piece of Redwood, taken out of the Ware House, and left at the Edge of the Wharf. The Logwood weigh'd fifteen Hundred, one Quarter, and twenty one Pound, and was worth ten Shillings a Hundred.</p>

Her Maid Joice Hunt, (the other Prisoner) pick'd it up and gave it me again, and I put it to five Shillings more which I had in my Pocket. Then Pinchbeck bid her Maid shut the Door, and said, she'd see what the Old Bitch had got in her Pocket. With that she took me by the Throat, put her Hand in my Pocket, and took out thirteen Shillings and two Thimbles. Then she said, I'll see what the Old bitch has got in her Bosom. And not content with hunting in my Bosom as low as my Wake, she punch'd me, and Bruised me, and beat with in an Inch of my Life - I was shut up in the Parlor above an Hour.</p>

            . My Mother was missing above an Hour. When she came home, I said, Mother, where have you been? She burst out a crying, and said, she had been at Mrs. Pinchbecks, who had picked her Pocket of all her Money - I thought she would have died that Night; and for my part, I was six Months gone, and miscarried upon it.</p>
               <p>Pinchbeck. I have subsisted this Woman these fourteen Years, because she was a poor Widow, and I was willing to relieve the Widow and the Fatherless; I have lent at times twenty or thirty Pounds and never took a Farthing Interest.</p>
               <p>S. Wright. But you sold Wine and -</p>
               <p>Pinchbeck. I lent her thirty Shillings when she put her Boy 'Prentice to a Weaver in Bridewell, and when he came out of his Time, I lent her seven Pound to buy him a Loom. She was seven Years in paying me four Pound nine Shillings - I lent her thirty Shillings but last Christmas, and she beg'd me to make it up four Pound. And when she should have paid me, she was arrested by a Tally Man: Upon which her Son came and intruded on my Goodness for twenty Shillings more to help her out.</p>
               <p>After this, she offer'd me twenty seven Shillings towards the five Pound, and promis'd to pay me the rest Weekly, and accordingly, she was to have brought me nineteen Shillings on the Day she says I robb'd her. But she brought no more than thirteen Shillings which she put into my Hand; and as I was telling it, she said, Hold! I have given you too much, and so she catch'd it all out of my Hand again, and desired me to let her have a Crown of it. How can you say there's too much? Says I, when I ought to have eighteen Shillings. God D - ye, for a Bitch, says she, and catches up a Quart Pot, I'll split your Scull. But my Maid stepping between. I got no Mischief. This was on the eighth of March, and on the sixteenth, I arrested her, upon which, Lawyer Theobald put it into her Head<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173505220016"/> to prosecute me, and so on the nineteenth she got a Warrant against me.</p>

About ten at Night, as I went into the Parlor to fetch a Candlestick, I heard a little Noise, and looking, I saw the Prisoner lying on his Face on the Parlor Stairs, his Feet were four Steps from the bottom. He turned his face towards me, but as I had only a Candle and Candlestick in my Hand, and knowing the Street Door was fast, I seemed to take no notice of him, but went down into the Kitchen to fetch a Poker, and to call my Fellow Servants; but when we came up, the Man was gone. The Door being still locked and chain'd, we went into the Dining Room up one pair of Stairs fronting the Street: The Sashes of this Room were then all three drawn up. But there was but one up, and the other two were shut down two or three Hours before I saw the Prisoner. We concluded he was got out that way, and so we called Thieves! and some body said, Here's a Man at the Door, come and see if this is he. I went down, and found it was the same Person.</p>

               <p>Daniel Owen. I am a Watch Man by St Paul's. My Master Mr. Atkins, the Constable, charged me with the Prisoner, by the King's Arms Tavern. She run as far as the Paul's Head. and fell down, and then I took her up and carried her to the Compter: and as I was putting her in at the Compter Gate. she turned about and gave me two hearty Knocks, and made my Nose bleed - But I believe she was in Liquor, or else she would not have served me so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Fellow laid hold of me, and swore he'd carry me to the Compter; I asked him for what? he said he had Orders for it, and that was enough. Well then, says I, let me go quietly. D - Ye for B - , says he, I ll lug ye along as I think fit. You dirty Dog, says I, what do ye mean by that? I'll go as I please - Why how now ye F -? Do you resist Authority? I am the King's Servant - You the King's Servant, ye Scrub Rascal? - Then he took me a Knock. I told him he had no business to strike me. He said he would if he pleas'd. I assured him I should take the liberty of striking again, for all his Authority, and so I did. But what harm did I do him? Let him shew his Marks, if he has any.</p>

The Prisoner said Dame, what do you sell? Butter, Sir, says I, and I have but two Pound left, and you shall have it for sixteen Pence - I'll have it says he, and carry it to my Sister; but can you change half a Guinea. I said, Yes. I took out 9 s. 6 d. Then he said to his Friend, Do you pay for it, and then I need not change; the other Man came and took five Shillings and six Pence out of my Lap - Then the Prisoner gave me this Shilling for the Butter. I had received just such a Shilling at Hampstead for Eggs, and had taken particular notice of it. for I doubted the Goodness of it, and I thought this Shilling to be the same; and I was confirmed in it by missing the five and six Pence.</p>

            , a Brandy Merchant in Goswell Street, near Old Street. On Easter Thursday my Master sent me on an Errand into Bishop's-Gate Street. I met the Prisoner there and asked him for the Sign of the Helmet. He took me round the Wastes, and tickled me, and said, he was going that way, and would shew me. But he asked me if I would not drink first. I was very dry, and went with him to an Ale House, the backside of Bishops Gate Street. We sat in a Publick Room, he on one side of a Narrow Drinking Table, and I on the other. He put his Hand under the Table into my Breeches - The Maid happen'd to see what he was doing, and so he threw down his three Half Pence for a Pint of Beer, and bid me come along Then he said, he'd go into a Bye Alley: so I went with him thro' the Jew's Synagogue, into a Bye Alley, where he did as before, but a Man coming by discovered us, and then we run away again, and he wanted me to go to another place, but I told him I could not stay. As we were going along in my way home, he offer'd to give me a Pint of Wine, if I would not tell what he had done. I said I should have Anger for staying. In Bishop's Gate Church Yard, he bought me a Nosegay, and a Penny Custard. Coming to <placeName id="t17350522-38-crimeloc192">Bedlam</placeName>

There he took me into the House of Office, and pull'd down his own Breeches and mine, and - in his Mouth: Then he carried me into the Booth, to see the Wild Beasts. When we came out, he said, he hop'd he should see me often. I told him I lived at the end of Old Street. He came by my Master's Door several times afterwards and spoke to me. The last time was last Sunday, when he asked me where we should meet. I said at the New Church in Old Street. So he went, and I took three Lads with me, and went after him I soon found him, and he asked me to go into the Fields. We left the three Boys just by Sam Allen's, the Shepherd and Shepherdess, by the Pest-house Fields and went two or three Stones throw higher to some Hay Cocks by a Cow House; where he let down his own Breeches and mine, and put his Breech in my Lap; but a Boy came up and disturbed us, and then these three Lads came up. The Prisoner asked them if they had been catching Birds: They answered, No He bid me come along; they follow'd us into the Ivy House (an Ale House grown over with lvy) there we sat in an Arbour, and he call'd for a Pint of Ale and a Bun, and the three Lads call'd for a Pint. They went into the Yard to see the Birds, and he I suppose had some mistrust of 'em, for he paid and went out directly, and then run as hard as he could. I ran after him, and the three Lads after me. Coming to Hoxton a young Man asked what was the matter, we said there was a Sodomite. So the young Man catch'd him, and I went for a Constable, who carried him before Justice Chandler.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you inform these three Boys of what the Prisoner had done to?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Yes; and I carried  them with me on purpose to take him.</p>
               <p>Court. Are any of them here?</p>
               <p>Holloway. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the Maid at the Ale House here? or the Man at the lvy House?</p>
               <p>Holloway No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He told the Justice that he acquainted those Boys, with it, but when the Justice asked the Boys, they said they knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Holloway. I told the Boys that I took out with me; but not the Boys that run with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You spoke of none but the three Boys that came out with you, for you said, they follow'd us to the Ivy House.</p>
