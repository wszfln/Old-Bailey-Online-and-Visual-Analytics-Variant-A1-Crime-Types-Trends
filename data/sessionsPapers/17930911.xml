               <p>I live in the house of the other lady; I am no relation. On the 20th of August, Tuesday, Mrs. Sparrow came to me, and told me that on the Monday afternoon she had missed some tea spoons, as she had had some company; and she asked me to go to the prisoner's house, and ask her if we knew any thing about these spoons. On the Friday following we went to the prisoner's lodging, and after that to Mr. Wright's, in the Hambury; and they produced two spoons. That is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Sparrow. Why do you charge the woman with taking the rest of the property? - I went down to her house on Monday the day I missed them, the 19th, and before I missed them; I have missed the other things since I found the tea spoons. I cannot say any thing further about the other things. I believe them to be my spoons, the one I brought from Somersetshire, and is marked in my maiden name, the other is marked in my husband's mother and father-in-law's name; my name is in a cypher, the other is in initials. I have no doubt about them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Has this woman any children? - I do not know at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I worked for her, and I was distressed for some money, and she owed me some, and I said to her, madam, if you please I want a triffle of money; says she, I am rather short of cash, take these spoons and pledge them. I had pledged things for her before, and I went and pledged these spoons for her, for three shillings, and kept the money. At this time Mr. Sparrow was gone out of Town; my mistress gave me the spoons to pledge.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Sparrow. On your oath did you give her these spoons to pledge? - No, my lord; I never pawned a thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Pawnbroker. In what name were they pawned? - In the name of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110004"/>

               <p>Q. Did she give you the duplicates of the other articles? - None but two great coats. I thought it was not a proper time of night to let her go out. When she got up in the morning I desired her to empty her pocket, for I was doubtful that she had got other duplicates; she pulled out her things, and in a pocket book, which she pulled out of her pocket, I found near twenty-five or thirty duplicates, five of which referred to my own property, and according to these duplicates I went to examine at three different pawnbrokers, and found the things.</p>

               <p>I was not at home when my house was broke open; I did not lodge in that house at the time; there was a young man in the care of it; I did not lodge there for some months.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you a bankrupt? - I was at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. This was your dwelling house? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you was in possession of these things? - I was, and am still.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was not the messenger in possession? - He was always in possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Was He in possession under the commission of bankruptcy? - He was partly. But there was a bill of sale, and my brother bought these things in again, and gave them me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the rent of the house at this time? - The assignees.</p>
               <p>Q. What before this house was broke open? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the assignment made at that time? - It was not; but the sale was, and the goods were bought in for me.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the tenant of the house? - There was no other tenant but me; my brother was not tenant.</p>
               <p>Q. Under whose right was the man in possession? - He was my clerk.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any assignees at the time? - There was. The man that they sent was out of possession long before this. I was in possession, and I employed this man to keep possession for me; I was not in the house, and all that I know is that the house was broke open, and the things taken away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long had you been a bankrupt when this affair happened? - About two months.</p>
               <p>Q. How many examinations had you passed before the commissioners? - I had got my certificate signed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you mean to come and lodge in this house again? - I did; I am there at this time.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any other conversation with Hawkins besides this? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing said by him upon this business? - No, only urging his wife to tell where the bed was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise held out to any of these prisoners, to induce them to say any thing? - I believe Mrs. Hawkins was told if she would produce the things she should be admitted as an evidence, but she never confessed any thing in consequence of that.</p>
               <p>Knapp to Bryant. Can you swear to the bed by any particular mark? - No.</p>
               <p>Dawson. It is necessary for me to mention that Bryant has said that he did not believe it was the bed, and his brother, and this lad said the same before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110008"/>Court to Bryant. Did you ever say that? - Yes, I have said so; I believe it is not my bed; I am pretty sure it is not my bed; the shovel I believe is mine, it is very much like it.</p>

             said at the justice's, that he was there at the time the robbery was done; and then he said afterwards that it was done while he went to get a pint of beer for his supper.</p>
               <p>Court to Dennis. Did you ever say that it was done while you went to get a pint of beer for supper? - I went to get a pint of beer over the way, and when I came back all the things were in the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him bring the things out before you went for the pint of beer or after? - I went for my beer before I see them bring them out, and when I was coming back I tumbled over the bed.</p>
               <p>Court. You said just now that you saw the prisoner Young bring the bed out of the house, and you saw Bocock bring out a shovel and an iron hammer? - No, sir, I said, I saw them bring them on the wharf.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Donaldson live in the house? - No. After she had knocked at the door I came down, unlocked the door and left her in; I had left my child behind me, up stairs, on the second floor where I was at work, my child cried, I asked her to sit down; she sat down; and I went up to the child, I brought the child down, she was in the room then, she went away soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after? - I cannot rightly tell; not long: she was not gone long before I missed my husband's watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that watch before? - In the morning, at eight o'clock. It was hanging on a nail when she came into the room, I saw it when she came into the room, I saw it when I went down stairs to open the door for her. As soon as she was gone I missed it, and followed her immediately, she was sitting on a chair at her own door: I went to her at her own door, and called her in backward to her own room, and asked her if she took my husband's watch to frighten me? she said she had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What were her words? - She said she had not, she would not do such a thing for the World. on that she came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110009"/>to my room with me, and asked me to see if I had not mislaid it or something, and she desired me to go with her to a fortune teller, and she would give him half a crown herself if he would tell where the watch was; I went with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where to? - I cannot tell She brought me to some old man, I believe it was at Salt Petre Bank; he said he could not tell any thing, it was past sun set; we came home again; I went and told Mr. Whiteway of it, the runner, and he came down, and spoke to her about it, to see if she could find it; so she said she could not; and the next day she was brought before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever search her? - No, I never did. The watch has never been seen since.</p>

I went that evening and saw the prisoner near twelve o'clock, between eleven and twelve o'clock, at his lodgings very much intoxicated, he was so much intoxicated I believe he hardly knew what he did; he had more than two hundred pounds about him, and he desired me to take the two hundred pounds and give him what belonged to him; he had changed one of them, and he had the twenty guineas in cash, and the rest in silver; the Bow-street officer took the notes. I attended before the magistrate the next morning.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My lord and gentleman of the jury, on the 29th of July last, after I had been at dinner I drank more than I do in common. It is very true I came about three o'clock to Mr. Lewis's chambers, and I saw these notes on Mr. Vizard's desk; I had occasion to go down stairs, I remember perfectly well it was a very warm day, and not knowing where to find the key of the chamber, in order to lock the door after me, I put these notes into my pocket for fear that any body should slip up in the interim; on which I went and had two or three glasses of brandy and water, and that threw up into my head, and this business was merely through intemperance, and not guilt. I went home finding myself intoxicated with liquor, thinking the next morning to have seen Mr. Lewis to have returned him this property. I had not any intention of going away, or otherwise other methods might have been pursued. I did not go to the office that afternoon as I was ashamed to face Mr. Lewis being so much in liquor. I believe this is the first offence that I have ever committed of the kind in my life time; I was never at the bar before. One favour I beg, is that as I have not the least doubt but Mr. Lewis has received letters from some people at Guildford, if they could be read it would be a particular indulgence; after that I submit myself to your lordship, and you gentlemen of the jury.</p>
               <p>Lewis. He was in my service a month, and I have heard an extreme good character of him, a gentleman, Mr. Sibhorpe, called on me who has known him twenty years.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner? - In ten minutes. As soon as he was gone I went and looked out of the parlour window, and I did not see any body, and I went to the door and I saw a little girl, and I asked her if she saw the prisoner? she said she had, and while I was at the door speaking to this little girl, I saw the prisoner come out of the door of another house, Mr. Osborne's; I was standing at this time at my own door about a hundred yards from Mrs. Osborne's door.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Burch, I am his butler, I know that these candlesticks were missing about five minutes after I left my master's house on the 10th of August, they were in my charge; I left the candlesticks in my own room about five minutes before I left the house, but I did not return till a quarter of an hour, and in that time they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the bar at all about the house? - I cannot say that I did. (Deposes to the candlesticks.) I know them by the number to be my master's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any search made on the candlesticks being missing? - Yes, search was made directly; this Oakley met the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there immediately a hue and cry made? - Yes, there was immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Oakley? - Yes, he was a country boy, and had the liberty of keeping at our house at the time, after the theft was discovered the house-keeper desired him to run after the property, I did not hear of it the first, because I was gone from the house at the time.</p>
               <p>Court to Oakley. You was at Mr. Burch's at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the candlesticks was missing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know it? - The house-keeper informed me, and she desired me to go after the man that had got the candlesticks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner about the house? - I met him on the iron steps, as I was going down the iron steps he was coming up; as soon as I went down the house-keeper desired me to follow him, and I did, but I never saw him again till I saw him in Hyde Park, there I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from your master's house? - I cannot say.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I work for Mr. Branham the patent locksmith, in Piccadilly, I went to my dinner at one o'clock, and was going through the Park, and I saw the prisoner attempting to get out of the gate, and I shut the gate and stopped him there, but he was too strong for me, and I was obliged to let him go till other assistance came, and I called out stop thief! and an officer drew his sword and stopped him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr. Burch's servant if he can swear to the property which I had under my coat.</p>
               <p>Oakley. I saw the bottom of one candlestick.</p>

               <p>Court. He says that first of all your hands were behind you, and afterwards he saw them before you and at liberty, and you was taken and he found the candlesticks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Which way did he find the candlesticks.</p>
               <p>Oakley. I found the candlesticks at the corner of an hedge, among some nettles in the Green Park.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that in the way from Mr. Burch's house to where the prisoner was taken? - It was.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you observe the candlesticks under the prisoner's coat at the time he came up the steps? - I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Be so good to enquire whether he had not some intelligence that the candlesticks was hid in the Park or not? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him whether he saw me hide them?</p>
               <p>Court. He has never said that he saw you hide them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Because there was a man at the time I was taken, he came up and he said he knew where the candlesticks were, and he took that lad that stands at the bar there, and shewed him where the candlesticks were.

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you miss it? - Instantly she run out of the chamber, and that gave me a suspicion. I felt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110017"/>and my money was gone.</p>

               <p>The prisoner broke first into a pig sty twice; he broke the boards down first, I found it so; and he owned it himself.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he live? - He lived at Pinner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose? - I lost a bit of bacon, and a penknife, out of the tea chest, and the value of half a pint of gin, and a bit of pudding. The tea chest stood on the dresser, the gin was in a bottle that stood on the dresser; I lost them the 13th of August, between ten and eleven, as near as I can guess, in the day; I went out to work between five and six, I saw them there then; I believe he took them between ten and eleven, because of a little girl who lived at the next door, and I asked her.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he took them? - Because he owned it, and I found the things on him in about an hour or a couple of hours, on the same day; I found on him the bacon and the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body in your hearing tell him to confess? - Says I,

Did you observe them talking together? - I don't know that I did; they were close together; I then observed Mackay close to Mr. Sharp; I then lost sight of them, because of a coach passing, directly as the coach passed, Wightman ran across the way, and I saw him with the handkerchief in his hand, the other got into the middle of the highway; Wightman he ran as hard as ever he could; I ran after Wightman, and as I ran I past Mackay; Mackay he saw me, he halloos out brush; I immediately ran after the prisoner Wightman; I overtook him about half up Chancery-lane; he threw the handkerchief from him, and it very near went down an area; but I just catched it; I have kept it ever since; when I had him by the collar I crossed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110019"/>over the way, and asked Mr. Sharp if he had lost an handkerchief? he said at first he did not know he had, and then he put his hand into his pocket, and he missed it, he said if it was his there was G. S. on it; there was G. S. on it; and I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wightman. I would be very much obliged to you if you would send me for a soldier or a sailor.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, in Gracechurch-street; I produce a watch which the prisoner at the bar brought on Wednesday August the 14th, between twelve and one o'clock at noon; I had never seen the prisoner before; I am sure he is the man; he was with me a quarter of an hour; when he brought me the watch I asked him what he wanted to do with it? he said, to sell it; I then asked him what he asked for it? he said, five pounds; I asked him whose property it was? he said it was his own; I then enquired where he got it; he said that his uncle gave it him, or left it him, I don't know which; but that he was going abroad and should have no use for it, and therefore he would sell it; I told him I did not believe it was his own property, and should stop it and him; I called a constable and charged him with him, and took him before the Lord Mayor; he persisted in the same story; I have the watch here; it is a watch inside case gold and outside case base metal; I was at Windsor the week before, and I went into the watch maker's house that had the watch to repair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make observation enough of the watch to know it again? - I did, immediately as I saw it I said it was the watch I saw before at Windsor.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see it at Windsor? - I went in to ask the widow how she did, and as the watch was hanging I took the watch out of the window, and opened it and looked at it, it was at a person's whose name is Wynn, she is here; this was the week before.</p>
               <p>Q. What is there remarkable about this watch that you knew it again? - I knew it by the outside case, and I knew the maker's name.</p>

               <p>I am a lighterman. Thursday the 1st day of August my business called me to take two craft over the water at eleven o'clock at night, I had got them over the water, and was driving down with them, and I heard a noise of iron grappling. I had two crafts and a boat with me at the same time, I was the width of the pile from the stairs of Mr. Crawshaw's Dock, about ten yards, which I supposed somebody was moving it in the craft of Mr. Crawshaw's Wharf; I called out to one Bensley who happened to be the constable of the night; Bensley is here, I thought he might very possibly have stepped in the craft half a minute or two, I heard a boat row away from the craft, and heard Mr. Mason say something to the man but could not tell what distinctly.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were in that boat that rowed away from the craft? - I did not perceive only one; I dropped my barge down, I asked another, and we followed the man that went off with the boat, and overtook him some little distance from London Bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of the boat or man in the course of this business? - Yes, I lost sight of the boat, we rowed along side of him, and in bringing him back he wished that we would let him go on shore, and let him throw the iron overboard.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man you rowed along side of? - The prisoner at the bar. He said we might dispose of his boat as we thought proper; we brought him up to Paul's Wharf stairs, we left the iron in charge of Mr. Crawshaw's watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of iron did you find in the boat? - Seven iron pigs and two pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make observation enough of that iron to swear it is the same if you was to see it in court? - No, I did not, the prisoner was given in charge of the constable of the night with the iron.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing that happened at that time yourself, or do you only speak to the property? - I was called up about a quarter past eleven, and heard that they had taken this Mears, with some iron, and I told them to take him to the watch-house; I was not out of my room. I lifted up the sash, I was three parts undressed, going to bed, I did not see him at all, it was very dark, I saw the iron in the morning, soon after six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether any iron was missing? - It was impossible to know out of about forty ton, I ordered our porter to take them into the warehouse and have them weighed, the pig iron found corresponded with the iron that was in the Joseph barge that very night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this iron? - It was left with the watchman, on the public stairs, down on the Causeway. I examined the iron and found the mark, Donnington, on five whole pigs, and one piece and found the mark Ketley on two whole pigs, and one piece. The Joseph barge is the property of

               <p>I keep the house where this robbery is supposed to be committed, it is a publick lodging house, the mother of the prisoner at the bar rents an apartment of me, and the prosecutor is a kind of a lodger of her's. On Sunday week last there was a rumour that the prosecutor had lost seven guineas out of a box that was locked; I would wish to remark that at the same time there was another box of the prosecutor's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110024"/>on the premises which stood open always unlocked, in which was contained a number of articles of wearing apparel, besides a watch, every article of which was safe, not the least thing missing. Accordingly there was nobody could give an account how this money went, or when it went, nobody could be suspected, but the mother of the prisoner at the bar, because she had a key that opened the box; nothing more transpired than on the Thursday following I was standing at my door, and the child, the prisoner at the bar, came home from Bartholomew fair, she had got a parcel of toys in her pin before, she told me what she had got, I desired her to let me look at them, I said there was a great many more than she could come by as she ought; I immediately took her in doors, and began to take her to task, how she came by these toys, she first told me that she got them by a whirligig thing; while I was interrogating her about the toys the prosecutrix came up into my apartment, she cries directly that these toys were purchased with her money.</p>

               <p>Court. And you told the child she had better tell the whole? - Certainly. Then the prosecutrix seemed dissatisfied and she insisted on the prisoner being charged with the watch. And I must say that where promises failed there were threats used to get her to confess.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him throw the coat? - Yes, and I asked him how he came by it, he made me some very frivolous answers, I cannot say what he said, he was rather frightened at the time. I saw him throw the coat from his arm.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew where his wife was at that time? - No, I did not I searched him and found nothing at all on him, I went up into his room, and found nothing there that could lead to any discovery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his wife there? - No, from thence I was going to Marlborough-street, the magistrate was going, from the office; I let him go home with his chairs then, and then I took him to the watch-house for that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he an opportunity of going up stairs in that time? - No, after I had left him in the watch-house, Mr. Wilson was afraid he should never see his spoons any more, I told him I would call at the house and see if we could see his wife, accordingly we went and knocked at the door, twice or thrice, and we saw the prisoner's wife come out of the shop door, and going across Tottenham-court-road; seeing a woman and thinking it was Mrs. Hayes, I called to her, says I, Mrs. Hayes, I want to speak to you, we went into the passage, says she what do you want with me, I told her if she had no objection I wished to go up and look into her room; she asked me what I had done with her husband, I told her that he was in the watch-house, we went up stairs, as soon as ever we entered the room the window being up, the under sash being up, she put her hand in her apron, which was thrown over her arm, she took these two spoons from her apron, and she threw them out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110031"/>of the window, she then said now what do you want with me? I called to an officer that was on the stairs, and told him to take care of this woman; I could see where one of the spoons were and stood in the room, I gave the woman into the constables custody, I went down, and by the help of a ladder, I got over a small building that was in the yard over some tiles. I found these two table spoons which I saw her throw out of the window, I took them, and kept them ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner's wife at all at your house? - Yes, she was, she came to the stairs, but was never in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up and down stairs, so you cannot say? - I was not up the stairs while she was in the house, she only came to call him to fetch this load.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Wilson asked me if I had a bed key, I told him no, and I went out to get one.</p>
               <p>Court to Wilson. What has his character been? - I know very little of his character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I could not get a bed key, Mr. Wilson got a bed key before me; when I came in I went up and assisted him to put up a bedstead, with that I had orders to go down to Mr. Parker's, the pawnbroker, in Fleet-street, to carry some chairs to Margaret-street, so with that when I came by my own door, Mr. Cole told me that they had a warrant for me.</p>
               <p>Court to Constable. What is his character? - I never heard any thing amiss of him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw any thing of the spoons, nor nothing, no more if I was to die for them this very moment.</p>
               <p>Court to Cole. Did he go with you readily? - He did.</p>

I was robbed of half a guinea, I don't know the day of the month nor day of the week particularly, it was about three o'clock in the morning; I light on a friend at the sign of the Feathers, a man that came out of the country, an uncle.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are these Feathers? - In Westminster. At eleven o'clock I was getting into the street and wanted a bed, and this young woman said that she could help me to one; I was at the Feathers about ten o'clock at night, I left him about a quarter after ten, after that I went to the Barracks, I was too late, and then I went to search for a bed; I could not get in at the Barracks, I was locked out, I met with this girl, and she said she could help me to a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet her? - I don't know, I was a stranger to the town then, it was eleven o'clock. I went with her to her home, to her lodging, it was across the sign of the Bell, in High-street; I gave her six-pence; I asked her what she must have for the bed? she said a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110032"/>shilling; I said I would gave her sixpence, which I gave her, and went to bed; I had this other young fellow, another soldier with me; I was in bed an hour and a half, then the girl came up stairs and she got my breeches up, and I asked her what she did with them? they were put by the bed side, I was undressed in bed; I called after her; she left the place, and took the half guinea; the half guinea was in gold, I had no other money in my breeches besides that; then she ran down stairs, and said she would come back with the change for it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen your half guinea last before this? - I saw it when I got into bed, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking with your uncle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a new half guinea or an old one? - It was a new half guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a spade half guinea? - I did not take particular notice, only the mark on the edge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring back the change? - No. The next morning I saw her in the public house, about seven o'clock, the sign of the Bell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that the house you slept at? - No, it was the other side where we slept opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the woman you saw at the Bell, was the same woman that recommended the lodging to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the half guinea since? - But I never had it; I see it in the constable's hands the next day but one after I was robbed; I could not swear to it, it was like mine; when I laid it on her she denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not take this woman to bed to you at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no connection of any kind? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Elliott, did not you ask me to go down for a pint of gin? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give me the half guinea out of your own hand to get change? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>I am a soldier; I was with this young man at his uncle's; we left his uncle about eleven o'clock, we went to the Barrack, and we were locked out, they are at the top of St. James's-park; we walked about a good while before we could find any thing likely for a lodging, at last we went into a public house, in a street in Westminster, to ask the landlord if he could tell us where to get one, and this woman we went with her; she said she would find us a good bed for a shilling; the young man said he would give her six-pence; we went into the room, and got into bed, and she left the room; after we had been in about half an hour she came into the room, and took this young man's breeches up and put her hand into his pocket, and took something out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take the half guinea? - No, I did not see her take any thing out. As she was a going out of the room, this young man hallooed out to her to leave the half guinea, that she had no business with it; she went down stairs with it, and said she would go and get silver for it, but did not return with the silver, and we got up, then I went to my duty, and left the young man to look after the half guinea; I returned again there in about an hour, and he had found the woman quite in liquor in the public house opposite where we had the bed, and he desired her to give him the half guinea; she said she had none; after that she said that he gave it to her to go and get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110033"/>change. The young man finding that his half guinea was nearly gone promised her something if she would give him the rest; and she replied that she would not; the young man after that proferred to let her off stealing the half guinea if she would pay a quart of gin; she said she would not; he told her he would send the constable and take her up; she told him he might fetch one, and I went for one, and the constable came and took her to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the half guinea in the hands of the constable, that he has been talking about? - It is the half guinea produced that she paid for the liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he had a half guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know whether you did not see him give me the half guinea to get change? - I did not; I saw him give her six-pence before we got to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give her the half guinea when she came in afterwards? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of you any connection with this woman? - Not while I was there.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the Bell; the woman lodges almost opposite my house; this woman came in about six o'clock, when the constable took her out of my house; I says to her, Bet, what might you want? she makes answer, nothing; I said to her, you had better go to bed, you are in liquor; she sat down in my tap room near seven o'clock; the soldier came in and says, damn you, you bitch, where is my money?</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you that morning any half guinea? - No. By and by, when the soldier could not get the half guinea, he says to her, give me the change; he says give me three half crowns, and if you cannot give me three give me two, and so he came to a quart of gin; that is all I know.</p>

I paused a little and then I said I would for a shilling; they said they would give me six-pence; we agreed for a shilling; when I came up stairs they gave me half a guinea to change, to get some gin; the soldier gave me one six-pence, and pulled off his waistcoat and shirt, and laid it on the chair, and wanted me to take them till he gave me the other six-pence; he got into bed and set up in the bed naked as he was, and gave me the half guinea, and I went down and got the gin, and I came in about six o'clock in the morning and gave him the change, and went out again, and when he came to ask for the change I had but two-pence in my pocket; the half guinea he gave me, and that was the way the change went; he told me if I would give him three half crowns he would let me go, and then he came to five shillings and then to a quart of gin. But the next day, when I came to him, I wanted to give him five shillings, but the other would not let him take it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this matter of your own knowledge, or who does? - I know nothing of the matter myself, I know them to be my daughter's.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house were they? - I believe in her bed chamber; this studd is my own, I lost it about two months since, a week after my daughter set off for Scotland, I wore it myself, I see it at the end of July, or the beginning of August, I lost it from upon my table in my closet.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the prisoner was apprehended, that you saw the stud? - I never had any suspicions of the man, I had him about six months with me.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an answer? - About eight days? he took papers besides these things, and the lock was broke, and the prisoner menaced me to assassinate me.</p>

On the 8th of August one Mrs. Berry sent her servant to me, and wished me to give her change for a five pound bank note; I directly went to my money which was the nearest, to give the change, and I had laid down the four guineas in gold in part of the change for the note, and was telling out the silver; I said to my daughter, inspect the silver, I am not clear it is all good; the child inspected the silver, and found one dubious; just at that juncture the man came into the shop, this was between eight and nine at night, and my daughter said this shilling looks dubious; the man asked for some stockings; I had some suspicion of him from his appearance; I changed the shilling, and he took the whole in a handkerchief that lay on the counter, and swept it all up into the handkerchief just at that instant as I changed the shilling; there was four guineas, and six and thirty shillings in silver; he jumped out of the shop immediately; my son was shutting up the shop and he pursued him; I thought at first it was no more than that, but I have recollected since that it must be near eight pounds.</p>

               <p>About a quarter past eight the 8th of August last, I was shutting up the shop, I saw the prisoner jump out of the shop, I pursued him, and I was not two yards from him till he was brought back; he ran about sixty yards; he was searched by the constable, but the money was not found on him. A man came up to him about sixty yards off, which I thought would assist me in taking him, but I was mistaken; but if he had an accomplice it is no wonder the money was not found.</p>

I bought them of the prisoner, I knew him for two years or better, when I lived up in Queen Ann-street, I kept a pawnbroker's shop there; I always looked on him as a young gentleman that spent his property on women of the town, and that so he came to this; I always knew him by the name of Farmer; he first of all came to know if I would buy any tickets of plate that was in pledge; I told him I would not buy the tickets, but I would buy the plate if he would take it out; my reason was, because sometimes things were pledged for more than we could buy them for; he brought them, and I bought them of him, I gave him five shillings an ounce; here is above twenty ounces, I bought them at different times; I believe they were all in pledge, and he took them out, and brought them to me at different times.</p>

             in Lambeth-street, Whitechapel, about a quarter of a mile from Morphew's house, I met him there with a bundle and another young man with him, coming the way from the house that had been robbed, I stopped him, seeing him have a bundle under his arm, asked him what he had got? he said he had a jacket, I felt of it, I told him it was no jacket, Sir, says he, you may depend upon it, it is, if you will take my word, I told him I was an officer and I insisted on seeing it; he said, I might depend upon it, it was one of his own killing jackets; he is a <rs id="t17930911-39-deflabel214" type="occupation">butcher</rs>

Says he, if you will step to the other side of the road I will tell you the truth, it is a woman's petticoat, and I hope you will not hurt me; which I opened and found it was a stuff petticoat, I took him into custody and at half past ten had him before Mr. Wickham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him to see if there were any other things about him? - I did not, I had not that knowledge about me at that present time, being only a young officer. This petticoat was tied up in a silk handkerchief which was marked E. M on it. When he was up to Mr. Wickham's, he was committed to the house of correction, he came up again on Thursday and was acquitted, because nobody came up, and on Saturday Mrs. Morphew came up in consequence of an advertisement.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This man is a working Butcher? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. He worked for Mr. Williams? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He was discharged on Thursday, and you know that then he went to his master's? - I met him in St. Catherine's in the same dress he is now after he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him at his Master's on Saturday? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in his working dress then? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. However he was at his master's the two days after he was discharged? - He was.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Morphew. The petticoat is mine; I know it by the particular mark about it. I had a pair of velveteen breeches and a pocket taken, which were returned out of a neighbour's yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming along the morning I was taken up and a man saw me pick the petticoat up, and he asked me what I had got? and I told him, I don't know, the man is here now that see me pick it up.</p>

             the younger and myself. From the very frequent and continual loss, and from the particular times that money had been stolen, we strongly suspected the prisoner at the bar, he was a <rs id="t17930911-40-deflabel221" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you do it yourself? - I saw it done, it was placed in the drawer from whence the money had frequently been stolen. It was a drawer without a lock, it was in the shop, next drawer to the till.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When did you make these marks? - I made them three hours before they were stole, I made the mark the time as I put the money in the drawer, I marked one, and there were marks on the others and I took down the marks; I marked a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take down these marks with a view of observing the shillings again? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you may read your paper? - There are three round o's on one shilling, I made them with my penknife. The money remained there that evening so marked; at half past six o'clock the 7th of August the next morning, I sent for the constable, we had the prisoner searched; the money was found on him, the very identical money with some other money; it was found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. In his Waistcoat or breeches? - I really don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it taken from him? - I did. The money was given to the constable immediately and sealed up; he was taken before the Lord Mayor, and the Lord Mayor granted us a warrant; and in his box there was ninety-four guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place this box was in your house? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The place where the prisoner dwelt? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. There are no other persons interested in the business except those four you mentioned? - There is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other person who derives any profit from the business of this house? - Clearly not.</p>
               <p>Q. No person whose name is not given to the world? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any foreman who is paid out of the profit in proportion to these profits? - No, none.</p>
               <p>Q. This man lived with you as a porter for nine years; Was he ever turned away? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had been nine years in your house and never once turned away. Had it happened that there had been any difference of opinion between you and this man some time before this matter took place? - Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before that this quarrel happened between you? - I believe it might be about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. That quarrel I believe was known to the persons in the shop? - Clearly so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110051"/>Q. And I suppose among the persons in the shop it was likewise known to those who marked that money which was put by in this drawer? - Certainly it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray will you be so good as to tell what were the names of the persons who assisted in this operation of marking the money and putting it into this drawer? - Mr. Nellum and Mr. Liddle.</p>
               <p>Q. This quarrel got to some height? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. This money was not put in the till? it was put in a drawer where money was not expected to be put? - It used to be frequently put there; the only reason it was put in that drawer was, when the foreman or person who took it, had not the key of the till.</p>
               <p>Q. The till I take it for granted was locked? - It ought to be.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have a person of the name of Sale in your employment? - We have at this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. This person had on more occasions than one been the means of restoring bank notes which had been by the carelessness or negligence of Mr. Sale been found on the floor? - I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say on the 6th of August this money was found there; who was with you at the time? - The constable.</p>
               <p>Q. No one else? - Mr. Sale was in the counting house at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the other servants access to this drawer? - All the servants, except the house maid who was up stairs about her business, had access to this drawer.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this money found on him in the counting house? - He was searched in the counting house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This man after six o'clock had the liberty of going out to get his supper? - He had not, he had after eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence he had the means of carrying any thing away, if he had a dishonest intention. I would ask you this question, has it not been said that if it had not been for this quarrel this prosecution would not have been carried on to this length; has not this been said in your hearing, and in your house? - Upon my honour I never heard it, I am confident it never was said so; I abominate such conduct.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you any way related to the prisoner? - No, I never saw him only at the public house, believe him to be an injured man, upon my word.</p>
               <p>Court to Jacques. How much was it he offered it to you for? - He said the pawnbroker would make it fifty shillings provided the difference was paid; and I was to give fifty shillings and to keep it; on payment of the fifty shillings I was to have the watch and to keep it.</p>

I had sent the prisoner up to bed before I went with my maid and myself; the prisoner was a boy for fetching in pots, and drawing beer; I sent him to bed about a quarter after ten; I went afterwards down in my cellar to look at my cellar, and I heard somebody walk over the tap room, the maid was with me in the cellar, and she said she believed it was the boy come down, and gone into the bar; I came up immediately into the tap room, I was in the dark, I had no candle; I met the boy coming out of the bar, he had no light, and I had not the candle with me, my maid had the candle, we had no light till I called her up with the candle, my maid came up immediately. I asked him then what he came doing in my bar? he said he had not been in. I asked him what was his business down stairs? he said somebody had knocked at the door; I told him that was no reason that he should come down, because he knew both the maid and I were up; I had not the courage to search him; my husband<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110064"/>turned him out of doors when I told him, and he searched his clothes after he was gone; he turned him out the next morning about six o'clock, before I was up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were his clothes? - In the room where he slept; I brought the coat down, and I found it very heavy, and I opened it before my maid servant, and my husband; I found in it about four shillings and three halfpence, in halfpence and farthings, and one shilling and sixpence in silver, I think it was eighty four halfpence and twenty-five farthings, as near as I can guess, they were all together in his coat pocket; for about two days we could not tell where to find him; I cannot swear to the money, but there is one piece my maid can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that you lost any money? - My drawer was shut when I went down into the cellar, and when I came back the drawer was half open.</p>

             if she would not tell me where the goods were I should take her on suspicion, and if she did, I said, I would not hurt her; in consequence of that I found my property; she put on her bonnet and cloak directly, and took me and another young man up into a field, and she shewed us the tea chest and the watch, and this case under a sir bush, it was very visible, you might have seen it in the open road almost within twenty yards; we brought that home, she took us into the lodgings, and on the bed's head she said there was a tea spoon and tea tongs.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with regard to your house you was the last person that went to bed, you was not the first person that went out in the morning? - No, it was the soldier that went out first in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any violence done to your house at all? - No, none at all, the sash window was thrown open that was all, the room was on the ground floor. There appeared to be no violence done to any part of the house, the street door was fastened with a chain that went across, that chain was undone but no violence, the chain was unhooked.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light when this soldier came up to you? - Yes, it was quite light, it was early in July the sun was rose; the soldier is not here, he is with his regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any idea how the people got into the house? - All that I know is, that the window was down when I went to bed, and was open when I got up in the morning; the window was not fastened only pulled down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a mahogany watch stand lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that? - This watch was in this stand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the watch a ribbon and key? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there nine hundred and sixty halfpence in the tea chest? - I never particularly counted them; I suppose there were that number or more.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of the watch? - It is not of great worth, it was my grandfather's, it is not worth much, it never goes true, if I was to sell it I would sell it for half a guinea, but I do not want to sell it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the tea chest? - It is a mahogany one, very small, two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the price of the tea spoon? - I would sell it for six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of the tea tongs? - I think they are worth five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the two prisoners live together, cohabit together? - Not to my knowledge, I have often seen them walking together, he used to come to her to my house when she was at work for my lodgers, she washed for them.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you last seen the soldier in your house? how long before this robbery? - I cannot recollect, it may be a week, or more. As to the woman I was told she had been there the day the robbery was committed, I did not see her there. As to the other articles they are all in the hands of the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This man is a soldier. Do you know that that part of his company that were quartered at Kensington, were obliged to be out some miles from Kensington at the night the robbery was committed? - He was quartered at the Robin Hood, about three miles from my house;</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore his quarters were not at Kensington at that night? - I found the billet was changed that very day.</p>

               <p>Q. Which some people sell thirty shillings for a guinea? - I here are not many good halfpence going.</p>
               <p>Q. On the contrary you hardly ever meet with a good halfpenny in the country? - I should be very sorry not to do it sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that though there may be forty shillings of halfpence, they may not be worth twenty shillings; I believe you first of all took James, and then you discharged him? - I took the girl in the fact.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you mean? - When she told me where the things were I mean. I stopped James for some time in the house, and I had the curiosity to search him, I felt about his clothes, and I found nothing, and I let him go about his business.</p>

               <p>I belong to Mr. Jennings; I was going over Kensington Bridge the 7th of July last, on Sunday morning, between five and six o'clock, and I met Mr. Hanson, and he told me he had been robbed, and he suspected some persons, and being clerk to a justice I made out an information, and got a search warrant signed, and got a constable, and went to this woman's lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get to this lodging? - I believe it was after six o'clock; the constable searched and did not find any thing; the prosecutor told the girl that he was sure that she had got the property, if she would tell where it was she should not be hurt, and she went with him, and it was found; she took us into a garden and shewed him the silver watch, and I picked up this watch at the gate, and the tea chest; that is all I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing about the bed? - The prosecutor asked where the spoons and sugar tongs were; and she told, and we went back and found them about the bed; when I came back the soldier was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not attempt to detain him? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the soldier to be taken up afterwards if you let him go? - I believe he was first taken into custody by command of his officer for being out of his quarter, and after that he was detained on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when he was taken up? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What the man is taken up for, is merely what you have heard? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the man, after Mr. Hanson had searched him a little, was suffered to go about his business? - He was. To the best of my knowledge the man went out of the house before the woman went to shew us where the things were.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hanson. How came you to take him up? - I never took him up; I never knew he was taken up till I was sent for up to the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Venner. Do you know by what means

             together, we searched the room round, and found nothing, we then came down stairs, and searched every part below, Hanson went to Hawkins, and told her if she would tell him where the things were he would not hurt them, so as he might get them. She then went up stairs, put her bonnet on, and said if we would follow her she would shew us where they were; she went up with us to Chapel-field, about a quarter of a mile from the house of the prosecutor, we went up that field, and we looked under some bushes before we came to it, we looked under a small sir, and there we found a small tea chest, she shewed us the tea chest, a watch stand, and watch; we then came back the other way, not the way we went; as we came along I asked her to inform us where the tea tongs and tea spoons were, she did not like at first, but afterwards she said they were at home, we then went down to her lodgings, and there we found them on the top of the tester of her bed. I have had the care of these things from that time to this. (Produced and deposed to by Hanson.)</p>

               <p>I am a constable of St. George's, Hanover-square. On the 6th of July I had an information of a pair of sheets being stole; I took him in our Work-house for that charge, and I found upon him these two spoons, not broke, two tea spoons; these broken spoons, and this caddy was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110070"/>brought after me, I don't know who gave them me, the nurse of the ward gave me part of them, it was in the evening when I took him up, for when I had taken him to Marlborough-street I was too late, I was obliged to bring him back again; I think it was our watch-house keeper gave them me.</p>


               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you say you took him in the workhouse, how came he there? - I cannot say, I believe he came there to drink tea.</p>
               <p>Court. Where were the spoons that you found? - In his pocket; these four tea spoons, two are swore to, and two are not.</p>
               <p>Q. In this watch-house, or workhouse, what account did he give of the two that were sworn to? - He said they were his own.</p>
               <p>Upton. They are my mistress's spoons, I can swear them to be my mistress's, I have cleaned them so many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any name on them? - No, one of the spoons is plain, the other is worked.</p>

               <p>My husband and I have known the prisoner many years, every body supposed that he was out of his mind, that was the general opinion of the state of his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us of any fact that Sunday before this happened? - Yes, he dined with us, he behaved in a very improper manner, putting victuals to his mouth, and then flinging it about; I said to my husband he never can be right in his mind, or he would not behave so; he said directly he had been in Bedlam, I never knew it before, and in the afternoon he came again with the constable's staff in his hand, and said he would take us all up, he did not say what for, my husband said he can never be right, or else he would not behave in that manner to a friend; in the afternoon when he came again there was a man there cutting my husband's hair, Mr. Lesley, and he behaved very improperly to him, he told him that he would take him, and kick him down stairs, and many other improper things.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason he assigned? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give no reason why he should kick Mr. Lesley down stairs? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing else? - No further than that he went into the street, and behaved just the same with the children, and grown people, with his staff in his hand; I did not hear what he said, because I was in my room, but I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then from his whole conduct, judge fairly that he was a madman at that time? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think so now on your oath? - I do, this was only the Sunday before this happened.</p>

On this we went a little aside, and we made a few remarks on the receipt, that it did not agree in any particular, not only the sum but the names; his answer was he knew it very well, and he had made it out himself; says I, the whole of it? yes, says he, the whole, and that he set down such names as came first to his mind; on this I desired him to go with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110073"/>me to the accountant, Mr. Edwards; we went accordingly to Mr. Edwards, and after relating the substance of the business for which I brought him, I left him there in order to go back and fetch Mrs. Harrison; when I went back to Mrs. Harrison she was looking at the transfer of the four hundred pounds; I took Mrs. Harrison to Mr. Edwards; Child was then there; the accountant had the receipt in his hand, and he questioned Mr. Child on the matter, and he repeated the same nearly as I have before said, and he said that Mrs. Harrison had lent him the two hundred pounds, for which she was to account to her, and Mrs. Harrison did not deny it; but on Mr. Edwards putting the question to her, she said her sister might have lent him money; and I think he said she had not; but I do not mean to be certain, I cannot be sure of that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he produce to you any instrument? - He then described two bills that evening, one on

               <p>Q. Did he afterwards produce to you that bill of exchange? - Not that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing further pass that evening? - As to the drawer he mentioned Mr. White as a West India merchant, at Bristol, and said that he had received it of him personally at Bristol; I asked him then to see the bill? he told me he had it not with him, but that he had left it with Mr. King for acceptance; he then asked me if I would give him the change out of the bill, deducting the account that he owed me for goods? I told him that I certainly would, if it was accepted by a reputable man, give him the exchange, deducting my account.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come to you afterwards with the bill? - The next evening, after the candles were light, the 29th of February; I then looked at the bill, and asked him respecting

               <p>Q. Did he represent him as living in a large house of his own? - I don't remember he gave any other description.

               <p>Q. Look at that bill. Did you ever see that before? - Yes, on the 29th of February 1792; this is the same bill that I have been speaking of.</p>

I asked him why it was on the back? because I never saw an acceptance in a place where I thought an indorsement ought to be; he then said he made the same objection to Mr. King when he received it of him; he represented that Mr. King damned him, and asked him what the devil of an acceptance he wished to have?</p>
               <p>Q. On that did you advance him any money? - Yes, I did, ten pounds, he represented that he had been distressed; I did not advance more, because I had made no enquiry after Mr. King; I took a receipt for the ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that receipt. - This is the receipt written by myself, and signed by Reading.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see him? - I did not see him till I served the warrant at the King's Bench ten or eleven months after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cause any enquiries to be made after him? - I did, and could not find him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he lodged? - He lodged at one place in Duke-street, Manchester-square, he told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the lodging? - Never, he told me so when he gave me the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiries there after him? - I had no opportunity till the wife of the prisoner, and Mrs. Sadler, the landlady of the house where they lodged, in Duke-street, Manchester-square, came down to our house to know whether I had a bill of that same description, of eighty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this happened? - On Friday the 2d of March.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the bill after you received it? - As soon as I received it I went to my friend Mr. Brownlow, of Fleet-street, and told him that I had taken a bill on

            , and whether he resided as addressed on the bill? this was on the evening of the 29th of January, not an hour after I had taken it; on the next day I did not hear any thing of my friend, Mr. Brownlow, who had the bill to make enquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of any information coming from any quarter make any enquiry after Reading? - I did, and found he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where? - At Duke-street, Manchester square, finding him and his wife had both absconded themselves, from thence, I conceived it to be a notorious transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cause any other enquiries to be made in the public papers, and advertisements? - Yes, I did, I went to the chamberlain of the City; I advertised his person, and description, and there is a copy of advertisement.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. What day was it Mrs. Sadler, and Mrs. Reading came to you? - On Friday the 2d of March, the same day that Mr. Brownlow returned the bill to me; I received the bill of Mr. Brownlow the same day after they had been to enquiry.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110076"/>Q. You had transactions with Mr. Reading before this? - Particularly two transactions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say he wanted some goods the day he came to you? - Not that I can recollect, he came only mentioning what he owed me before.</p>
               <p>Court. How much did he owe you before? - About nine pounds, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. When he came he told you where he lived himself, and where King lived? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. The receipt was read over to him when it was written? - It was.</p>

               <p>Q. He made no hesitation of signing the receipt? - No.</p>

               <p>In February, 1792, I was shopman to Dalby and Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when the prisoner at the bar came? - I cannot exactly say the day, it was the evening, the first time he came.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what application he made that evening to Mr. Dalby? - It was about a bill that he obtained of a person that owed him some money in Yorkshire; the prisoner said that he had just come out of the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce that bill? - He did not the first evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe it? - He said the amount of it was eighty pounds, he said it was drawn on King, I am sure he said King.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he represent to you who King was, or where he lived? - He said he lived in Berkeley-street, a man of opulence; he represented that the second evening, not the first.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect after his coming the first evening, what application he made, with respect to that bill? - He wished to have it discounted, Mr. Dalby said if he would bring the bill for him to examined, he would have no objection to discount it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Dalby to make any deduction out of it? - Yes, he was to pay Mr. Dalby what he owed him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come again? - He came the next night.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first day he came? - I think it was the 28th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it? - That I cannot say exactly, he came the next night and brought the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Dalby discount it? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason he did not? - He wished to make some enquiries, I heard him say so, he advanced the sum of ten pounds on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing the second night about the accepter? - Mr. Dalby objected to the mode of acceptance, because it was accepted on the back of the bill, Mr. Reading said that he made the same objections to this King, and he said that King swore at him and asked him what he would have?</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Dalby advanced him the ten pounds on the bill what became of the bill? - He took the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Reading give any acknowldgment for the ten pounds? - Yes, a receipt was given.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him describe who Mr. King was that night? - He represented him to be a man of opulence; I think he said, he was one that kept his carriage, and that a footman came to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe the house? - I think he said something about a large white house, I don't recollect he said any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110077"/>thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether he stated him to be the only person that lived in the house? - I cannot speak to that, I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have lived in the service of Messrs. Dalby and Brown some time? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You of course know the firm of the house; do you recollect what the firm of the house was in February, 1792? -

               <p>Q. Perhaps you have known the prisoner at the bar some time? - I have seen him several times there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been accustomed to deal with Messrs. Brown and Dalby? - I recollect him buying one parcel of goods, and they were not paid for.</p>
               <p>Q. From his having been there several times, and dealing there once, I presume there was a considerable confidence placed in the prisoner at the bar? - I don't know that there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Dunbar, the way in which the prisoner at the bar came was in your hearing the first night, I suppose there were several present in the shop at the time, who must have heard all the conversation that passed between the prisoner and Mr. Dalby? - I cannot speak to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the prisoner talked in such away as to prevent any one else from hearing what he said? - He was in the parlour with Mr. Dalby.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not whisper, or else you would not have heard him? he said he had got such a bill, and he wanted somebody to discount it? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And he said he would bring the bill the next night, provided Mr. Dalby would do so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he came the next night? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He always spoke of a Mr. King, living in Berkeley-street he spoke of that himself? - He did, of Squire King.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear say where the bill was drawn from? - I think it was from Bristol, and the drawer was named White.</p>
               <p>Q. And that appears on the face of the bill to be truth? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bill now, and see whether it appears so? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. It does appear to be a genuine true bill, both as to the bill being drawn itself, and as to the acceptance? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that during all the conversation you heard that he ever hesitated giving any account of this bill or of the acceptance? - I don't know that Mr. Dalby asked him any particular questions any further about this King.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether he did not give answers without hesitating in the least to the questions that were put to him? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. The second time he came he trusted the bill with Mr. Dalby? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He got a receipt for it? - He got a receipt for the ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not write the body of the receipt himself? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it read to him? - I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. So when the receipt was tendered to him having been made out by Mr. Dalby himself he made no scruple of putting his name to it, and left the bill with Mr. Dalby? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, how soon did you hear of the prisoner at the bar afterwards? - About a twelve month.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you heard that this unfortunate man has been in the King's Bench prison? - I have heard that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard that very soon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110078"/>after this matter took place, he went down to Bristol? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard that he was arrested at Bristol? - I have.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he go away public or without your knowledge? - I did not know that he was going to leave me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiries after a Mr. King? - I did in Berkeley-street, Manchester-square, in the upper and lower, all through up to Edgeware-road.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. The prisoner at the bar had lodged with you as a lodger of your's in Duke-street, Manchester-square, so that if he said he lodged with you he spoke truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110079"/>Mr. Bailey. He came to you in January 1792; Did he continue with you uninterupted till March? - I don't know that he was out above one night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So you made some enquiries about this Mr. King? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiries after the prisoner at the bar? - No, it was after Mr. King.</p>
               <p>Q. This man had not quite lived with you three months; did you agree with him weekly or monthly? - He was to pay me weekly.</p>


               <p>Q. Had he paid you for the lodgings? - He had not.</p>
               <p>Q. So that induced you to make that enquiry; you have had lodgers before, you have known them go away and come back again? - Yes, but they always settled with me.</p>
               <p>Q. This man did not, and therefore you come and state what you have stated. With respect to Mr. King, did you try one side of the way? - Yes, of upper and lower Berkeley-street, both of the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not another Berkeley-street in Portman-square? - I enquired on one side of the way down both the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiry on the other side? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bailey. For what reasons did you make these enquiries after Mr. King? - Because the prisoner had told me that he had business to do with a gentleman in the city concerning a note, and if that note had been properly honoured, and he had got cash, I was to have been paid the demand I had got on him.</p>

               <p>Q.

On the 23d or 24th of February, a bill came for acceptance to a Mr. King, in Upper Berkeley-street, I was dressing his hair; I knew a Mr. King, in Upper Berkeley-street, Portman-square, just by New Quebeck-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember while you was dressing him on the 23d or 24th of February, any thing particular that happened, that you took notice of that morning? - A person brought up a bill for acceptance, the word of the man servant was, that he brought up a note up stairs, which he said was for acceptance, and he said the person was waiting below; Mr. King asked his servant to hand him the pen and ink off the pembroke table that stood between the windows; this was as I was dressing him, he did hand him the pen and ink, he wrote, but I cannot say what, I did not see what he wrote.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had wrote this what became of the bill or note then? - He gave it to the servant again, I still continued dressing the gentleman's hair, in a minute or two afterwards the servant came up again with the bill, saying that the person was not satisfied perfectly with the acceptance, he ordered the gentleman up, the person that was shewn up was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110086"/>the prisoner at the bar, when he came up Mr. King asked him what reason he had to object to that acceptance, he said he did not doubt either his honour or his principle, but it was a mode of acceptance he never saw, on that he said, that was the mode he always accepted his bills, and when they came to him, he duly honoured them when due. He said, A. stood for acceptance, and King was his name; he should do no other to it. In the course of a day or two he asked me to get a private lodging, on which I introduced myself, as letting out lodgings; I lived in Prince's-street, Soho.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he went to your house, after you told him you could accommodate him? - Two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you dressed him in Berkeley-street? - Six or seven days, but not more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bill or note? - I cannot pretend to say nothing at all about it for what sum it was drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Mr. King stop in your lodgings? - Eleven days.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left your lodgings do you know what became of him? - I cannot tell no more than what he said himself, he said that he was going abroad to the West Indies.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round again to the prisoner at the bar, and see if you are certain that he is the man that came to Mr. King's house? - I am sure that he is the man; I have been to Newgate on Saturday to satisfy myself about the identity of his person, I went for that purpose, and for that alone, the remark I made of him was, that he had a particular scar on his right eye, and that I thought he was an Irishman.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray when was you first applied to come here? - Last Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Last Saturday morning was the first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110087"/>time you was applied to come here, no application was made to you to come here before last September sessions? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came to you? - The wife of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure the prisoner brought the bill? - I saw him come up; the servant brought the bill, and he took it down again. This King went by the name of Nugent at my house, he was asked for frequently under that name. Likewise after he had been there two or three days, I asked, says I, here is a gentleman enquires for a person of the name of Nugent; says he, let him up.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you went to a house in Berkeley-street, was it the left hand or the right hand side of the way? - The right hand side of Portman-square from here.</p>

               <p>Q. How many windows in front? - Three.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was the house? - A brick house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the owner of the house? - Who was the occupier of the house I cannot say; I was not at all acquainted with the house; I was recommended by a captain O'Brian, to this King.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a very large handsome house? - It was three stories high and three windows in front.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in the house where you now live? - Seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you brought up a hair dresser? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you constantly followed that occupation? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever follow any other? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never was a bailiff's follower, and arrested people? - O! Yes, I have been.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I desire to know what you meant by just now saying that you never followed any other occupation than an hair dresser? - I did not know what you meant by occupation.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell me whether you have been a bailiff's follower? - I went along with Mr. Griffin and Taylor, he lives in Tavistock-street, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been employed as a bailiff's follower? - I have been with them, as an hair dresser could get into an house when other people could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been with them when they arrested any body? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How often? - Not a great number of times; six or seven times very likely.</p>
               <p>Q. On you oath not more? - I cannot pretend to say, more or less.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have you not been with one or the other twenty times? - I might; it is a long time ago, and long times between the times, so that I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you first with any body as a bailiff's follower? - Last December.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was you with then? - Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. You never was with any bailiff before? - No, nor since.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been with Taylor or Griffin since that time? - I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not you have been with them thirty times? - No, not thirty times.</p>
               <p>Q. Might you have been with them twenty times? - It might have been twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say it was between six and seven then? - Because there has been so long a distance between the times that I cannot recollect: I never took a thought.</p>
               <p>Q. Never took a thought how often you had been with bailiffs, but you have with the note? - The dispute that arose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110088"/>between Mr. King and Mr. Reading made me remember that.</p>
               <p>Q. A dispute! No other dispute than what you have mentioned, was there? - No other.</p>
               <p>Q. You was present when the bill was brought? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he write once or twice, or three times? - Once to the best of my recollection; I saw him write no more.</p>
               <p>Q. He wrote but once then; with the same pen and the same ink? - With the same pen and the same ink, and the servant reached it to his hand.</p>

               <p>I live with my mother, in Upper Berkeley-street, Portman-square; I have known the prisoner about eight years; I never heard any thing to his disadvantage till now.</p>
               <p>Q. What line has he been in during these last eight years? - I thought he was a <rs id="t17930911-52-deflabel278" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

He has called since; the last time he called he said he was married, and had married a person of some property; I think it is two years next February the last time I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time in February? - I do not. I went to his house and dined with him, it was in Bolsover-street, Cavendish-square, he had a house in there, I was at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade did he carry on? - He told me that he was going to deal in hops and different things, that he had a great many friends that would assist him, and that he was going into business for himself.</p>


               <p>Q. Was it a pretty good house? - I believe it was a small house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his being acquainted with any body else in your street? - I never heard him speak of any, nor I don't know that he knew any except me and my mother, and my father when he was alive. A person came in the name of Nugent, much about this time two years, it was the latter part of the summer, an elderly gentleman came by the name of Nugent, he wanted lodgings; we let him the lodgings; he refused to give his character he said, when my mother asked him for his character, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110089"/>said, why should we suspect him, he said, I don't like to be troublesome to my friends; I will pay you every week. He came in on that account, because he was to pay every week for his lodgings, we agreed; he said he should order every thing in; but when he had been there about a fortnight, and we had lost just before that a piece of cloth, I found a duplicate, a pawnbroker's ticket, in the house, in his apartment, and I was curious enough to go to the pawnbroker to know what it was about; the pawnbroker asked me if I had found it? I told him I had found it in my house; the pawnbroker said he had orders to stop it; I told him he might stop it if he pleased; I asked him what it was upon? he said it was a man's coat; I asked him the person; he described him exactly, and there was on the duplicate,

So I think this gentleman went by the name of Nugent and King.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Mac Ginnis I was going through St. Paul's Church-yard, just by posts I immediately heard the voice saying, there is a young man has picked the gentleman's pocket. I immediately turned round and somebody took hold of me directly; I asked them did I look like any such person? I worked hard for my living; say he, I am authorized so to do by a gentleman; says I, what gentleman? says he, that man; pointing to that gentleman, Mr. Lewis; sir, says I did you give charge of me for robbing any body? it is a false accusation; they immediately took me up to Guildhall before a magistrate and found nothing at all about me; they immediately searched the young man that was with me, and they found three or four handkerchiefs about him, and they committed me immediately, without giving me an opportunity of saying a word.</p>

            , and I asked him if he had been down stairs? he said no, he had not been down. I could see no light, and I went to bed again and told my wife I thought it was the rats; she was heavy with child, so with that I got into bed and told her to compose herself and go to sleep, and I almost got to sleep, and she said, Jim, get up for I cannot sleep; with that I heard a chair fall down and shoes on it, which made a great noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did you hear that there were thieves in the shop? - I jumped up immediately to the window and called watch, and while I was opening the window I heard the door bang, the outward street door, I called watch as loud as possible for the space of a minute, there was no assistance came, but the lamplighter was going by with his lighted torch, and I asked him for a light, and he told me my door was broke open, and I went down stairs and found my door wide open and my shop stripped.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much you lost? - Yes, a great many things; here are some things found which are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't know of your own knowledge who it was that did this? - I never saw any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to bed was your property safe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And your things are here you say in court? - Yes, part of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When the lamplighter was going by I take it for granted if any man had been there you could have distinguished the features of his face, even without a light? - No, I could not, it rained very fast, I was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. But perhaps the day might have been so far advanced as you might see a man's face that was at my distance from you? - No, I could not.</p>

I went to two other rooms which they had taken of Mr. Maplebank, there was a pair of shoes and a tea chest in the drawers which were in one of the two rooms which the prisoner Ferns said he had taken of Mr. Maplebank.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the rooms locked? - Yes, they were, Mr. Maplebank had one key, I could not tell who has the other.</p>

               <p>Q. When you apprehended him what did he say? - He said very little to me, his chief discourse was to Mr. Perry.</p>


               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Pray what are you? - I was an officer at Marlborough-street at that time</p>
               <p>Q. You have not been discharged for misconduct from Marlborough-street office? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Maccoul? - Mr. Maccoul was a builder, and Ferns was one of his labourers, I was told so, I believe he has worked for him this fourteen years; It was a woman that was stopped with the shoes, of the name of Pope.</p>
               <p>Q. That led you to Ferns house? - It did.</p>

               <p>I am a plumber; I do the plumbing business at the brewhouse for Mr. Sharp. On the 28th of August, in the morning, I was sent for to examine the lead that was found; I saw the lead at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that lead? - I went to the brewhouse of Mr. Sharp, and surveyed the upper part of the brewhouse, and I found there was some lead took off on Tuesday morning, and among it there was one gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry the lead to Mr. Sharp's? - Not that day, but the day following I did, that was on Thursday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find the lead there corresponded at all with the lead wanting on the brewery? - There was a piece of lead missing, and had been took out from the upper part of the gutter, and this lead that we took answered to that place as to length and breadth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear newly cut? - It was not cut at all; it was a new piece.</p>

               <p>- LAWRENCE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a taylor, in Petty France, it is called York-street now. On Sunday evening about seven o'clock the 4th of August, my wife had a very bad state of health, and was very ill that day particularly, about seven o'clock she wished to be at the door for the sake of a little air, and this man came in, and he said to me, would I purchase this black coat? I I told him it was a thing I did not wish to have any thing to do with buying of a Sunday; so I asked him what he asked for it? he said he was a recruit, and rather being short of money he asked four shillings and six-pence or five shillings I cannot be certain which; I told him the most I could give him was three shillings as it was pieced under both the arms. I hung it out on Monday morning between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. You see there is nothing thrives that is bought of a Sunday? - Soon after it was hung out, there was a jew that came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110096"/>in, and asked me what I would let him have that black coat for? and after that the prosecutor came to the door and found the coat; by eight o'clock in the morning the constable came with him; I delivered it immediately. The old man that says he owns the coat, has had it ever since, by the magistrate's order, in his care; I never saw it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that man, was he in a soldier's dress? - The same; he is the man, I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you pick him out? - I went to the Bird Cage-walk on Monday in the afternoon, about the middle of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he with you altogether? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you recollect him by, his voice, figure, or what? - He has got an amazing sight of warts on one hand, which I took particular notice of, and I gave the same description before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you pick him out of? - I cannot say how many there might be particular, there might be more than twenty exercising at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you when you picked him out? - I did not pick him out while he was exercising, I waited till they were done. This <rs id="t17930911-57-deflabel308" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you know him to be the man before you saw the prosecutor? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the coat again? - I should by the piecing under the arm; but at the same time I have seen it so triffling a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the constable here? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you very sure that the coat you gave to the old man, was the coat you received from the prisoner? - It was the same coat; I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Elliott. Produce the coat.</p>
               <p>Lawrence. I know it by the piecing under the arms.</p>

               <p>Q. From the number of your stock, and from the state of these things in your stock, you did not know that any were missing, therefore whether any servant had disposed of these brushes it is impossible for you to tell? - It is so.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of St. George's, Hanover-square. Mr. Robinson who was the master of the prisoner, came to me on Tuesday with a search warrant. to search the apartment of the prisoner, at the biscuit baker's, the upper end of Oxford-road, Mr. Cary's; the search warrant was for a cravet; we went and did not find it, and in searching the box I found sixteen brushes, which Mr. Wilson termed horse brushes, but some were differently covered have them here, I have kept them ever since (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. At the time you took these brushes, did any thing pass between you and Mr. Wilson, and the prisoner? - The prisoner was not present.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were the prisoner's lodging? - Because I went to to Mrs. Cary's, and she took me up, and he went home, and he confessed it was his box that contained the things where the brushes were; I broke his boxes open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing about them at any time? - Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where was this said that he said about the box? - It was said in the apartment at Marlborough-street office, not while he was present before the the justice, or before the justice's clerk, he said, did you open the other box, because there is money in it? says I, I opened both the boxes; says he, it is my box.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he spoke as easy as if I was to ask you whether the shirt on your back is your own, and you would say yes?</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Can you ascertain at all whether there was any brushes missing in your house? - No, not at all.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. It is mine, I know it by some iron moles in the front of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner.

               <p>Prisoner. These things were left in my care to wash, and I thought I would make some money of them till I was paid; I was ten weeks without money.</p>

When I found these things in her pocket, I took her before the magistrate in Hatton-garden; the other woman was bailed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys The other woman was bailed, was she? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why she was the person that came into the shop with the prisoner? - Yes, they came together.</p>

               <p>Q. Every question that was put was put by Longman? - Yes; and the other asked her opinion respecting it.</p>

               <p>Q. To any other person then you might have sold this quantity of muslin that is stated in the indictment before this happened, before the prisoner came into the shop, in the course of that day? Don't you understand what I mean? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had a great deal of muslin in your shop in the course of that day for sale; you say you don't know what quantity might have been sold in the course of that day; therefore whether the quantity stated in the indictment might be sold or no, you don't know? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen the bank note since? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was you in Whitechapel? - After five o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part about you was the note? - In my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the money in the same pocket? - I had the money in my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know exactly the time you lost it? - A little after five.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean you missed it then? - I had no more of it in my hand after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discover that you missed it as soon as it was gone? - Whitechapel was all in an uproar, and I looked every where for it in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that uproar made on the discovery that the note was gone? - I bought myself a halfpennyworth of currants in Whitechapel, and then I missed the note, and I took some people up, and took them up before the justice, and these people were discharged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp Did you know the prisoner at the bar before this transaction? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him during any time that this business took place? - No, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the bank note was in the breeches pocket? - Yes, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the five pounds in cash and the bank note were not in the same pocket? - The five pounds and bank note were in my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. You said before that the money was in your coat pocket? - The copper laid in the coat pocket, but the five pounds in cash was in my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did not you charge the person of whom you bought these currants with taking this bank note? - I see a paper lay on the ground, and I thought that was the paper where the bank note did lay in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bank note in a paper? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the justice that you saw one of these men draw the paper with his feet? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar was not one of these three? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110102"/>Q. Did not the justice tell the prisoner at the bar, in your presence, that if he could get bails he would bail him for the offence? - I don't understand english, and I don't know what he spoke.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how the bank note got out of your pocket you don't know? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. But you see one of these three men kick it with his foot? - I saw a paper laying on the ground, and I saw some man kicking that paper with his foot, I went from there, and remembering that my bank note was in a paper, I went back and took the men up.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the paper of the same size, colour and sort of paper as you had in your pocket? - I cannot know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be the same paper? - It was not in my thoughts; I did not mind it; if I had been sure I would have picked it up directly.</p>
               <p>Q. If you did not believe it to be the same paper, why did you stop the man that kicked the paper? - At first I did not miss it at all, and so I did not take any notice of the paper that lay on the ground then, when I went from there and missed the note, and thought of the man that moved the paper, I went back and took the man up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the paper there when you came back? - It was not, I saw the paper kicked on the ground before I came back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you ever take up this paper to see whether it contained the bank note or not? - I never took nothing up.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether it contained a bank note or no you don't know. He charged these three men with taking the bank note and had them before the justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Were not these men, one of which kicked the paper, immediately taken before the magistrate? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they searched? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any bank note found on them? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the man who kicked the paper searched? - He was.</p>

               <p>I know the prosecutor, Cohen, I see him on Friday about a month ago, the 16th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. On what account did Cohen come here? - He came twice that day, he came both times that day about a manuscript copy of our law, which I purchased of him, written with his own hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you give him? - I paid him twenty-four pounds I paid him a twenty pound bank note, and the rest in gold and silver to make up the money, I think it was three pounds, thirteen shillings and six-pence in gold, and the rest in silver to make up the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number of the twenty pound bank note you gave? - 839.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know the number of that note? - I had just received that note and another note of the banker's for a draft; I did not book that note, but, I have a great recollection; I am author of the Lingua Sacra; I will tell you the truth, when the man came back and told me that he had lost the note I was as positive as a man can be of a note that he had not booked; I have no doubt but that is the note. I paid Mr. Cohen the note a few minutes after five, by no means did it exceed ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the date of the note? - The date is the 11th of July, 1792.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner at the bar? - On Saturday evening about nine o'clock, the prosecutor called on me, and said that he thought he had found the note, and I went to the prisoner's house in Shoemaker-row; I then, as soon I saw the prisoner told him, I am come about a little business, about a bank note which you had yesterday, which you said you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110103"/>found; he immediately flew at me as a lion in a rage; says he, I found no bank note, I know nothing about a bank note; sir, says I, I don't come here to be abused, I came here to ask a civil question. Pray, sir, says I, was not you yesterday at Mr. Goldsmid's with a bank note? Yes, says he, I was, but it was none of your's; pray, sir, whose was it then? a man gave it me; says he; but did not you tell Mr. Goldsmid that you found it? I did say so, says he, but it was no such thing; I told him I was very sorry to see that he was a very bad man, as he had said that he had found it, and now pretend to deny it; now, says I, how came you by that note? says he, a man gave it me to get cash for him; very good sir, says I, who is the man? says he, I don't know the man; why, says I, that appears very impossible that a man should give you a twenty pounds bank note to get cash for it, and you not know him, nor he you; then he began to be very abusive, and told me to get out, I told him I would get out as fast as I could, but I would take care to bring him to justice for it; in consequence of which I took coach to go home, and called on justice Wickham, and told him the case; he granted me a warrant, and in consequence of the warrant the prisoner was taken the next day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you go with the warrant to the prisoner's house? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was found at home? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. On the day in the indictment did you see the prisoner at the bar? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. On what occasion did he call on you? - He called on me with a bank note, and I took particular notice of the number, it was about four weeks ago, and produced a bank note, and said that he had found a bank note, and wished to know whether it was a real bank note or a forged one.</p>
               <p>Jury. What time? - On Friday about six in the afternoon; I took particular notice of the number on it, 839, the date I cannot swear to; I told him there was but one thing I could advise him to do, and that was to take it along with me to the Bank, and shew it to Mr. Newland, and get the greatest reward he could for it; I told him I would have nothing to do with it in any other way; his reply was, that he could not give an answer to that, he would consult his sons; and I heard no more of the business from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in point of fact he did not come to you on Monday as you advised him? - I did not see any more of him till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understand that the prisoner at the bar possessed of a twenty pound bank note, came to you, as a person that knew the value of it, and to know whether it was a good one or not, and he shewed you the bank note? - He did, and I advised him to take it to Mr. Newland, and get as great a reward for it as he could.</p>

               <p>Q. You have known the prisoner at the bar before this time? - I have known him several years as a poor man coming for charity, but as for his general character I don't know it, I never knew any harm or good.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the prisoner? - He is a jew.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how old he is? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen to Levy. Was you before the magistrate when De Frize was examined? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any paper signed by De Frize? - Yes</p>
               <p>Q. And by the magistrate? - I cannot say that I did see the magistrate sign it.</p>

Jumping out I fell down on my hands and knees, and they were then going off, and Mr. Henley, who was with me in the chaise, called to me, and said, I had better<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110107"/>come into the chaise, I got into the chaise we drove on, in about two minutes, from between two to three minutes they brought the prisoner at the bar up to the Castle, the men who took him brought him; I said to him when he came up, where is that gentleman's watch, and my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice enough of the prisoner at the time of the robbery to recollect him again when he was brought to you? - I cannot say that I did; I can-swear to his person positively. He said the man that took the watch had thrown it into the road, but if it was lost his mother would make it good. I cannot say that this was the man that took my money; he said if we would take a lanthorn and candle, and go back we should find it; and we immediately searched his pockets and found a pistol loaded, which answers to the same pistol that was held to my head; I took particular notice of it, it was cocked; the moment that he put it to my head I looked at it, it was an iron pistol or a steel one. We brought him to Hounslow.</p>

I have no witnesses, because I thought of putting off my trial till next Sessions.

               <p>Q. What did he say to you or do? - He said how do you do Mr. Hunsley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - Not to my knowledge. I said, you have got the advantage of me; he said he had got a gentleman in town that had six daughters, and they must have some of my fruit by all means; I told him I had none of them to spare, I had agreed with one man for all I had, and I would shew him where the man lived, and he might have them twice a day if he pleased; and I went to shew him the shop where I served with the fruit.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you went? - I forget the street's name, it was just at this lower side of Mary-le-bone, I went to the shop with him, and he said very well, and we went into an alehouse and had a pint of ale.</p>
               <p>Q. What street was it? - I don't know the street, the house was just by the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name of the man that kept the house? - We had but one pint of beer there, and just as we got the pint of beer Linton came in too, and he would drink with us; Brown asked Linton what he was? he said he was come up to London to receive his fortune, as he had an aunt dead; Brown says to him, how much is your fortune? O, says he, three hundred pounds, to the best of my remembrance, so says he, if ever a one of you will shew me fifty pounds I will give you ten guineas; Linton said so to Brown, and I, says I, I have no money to signify; and I went to a man that I knew, and I borrowed the sum of the notes, forty-five pounds, of

               <p>Q. Do you know what notes they were? - No, I am no Scholar; I know them to be four bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what sum where these four notes? - Two ten pound notes, a twenty pound, and a five pound. So in going back, covetous to win the money, thinking I was never master of so big a sum, Brown meets me; as soon as Brown met me Linton came, and they took me up to Jacobs's house, I don't know the street's name, and we went in there, it was a public house, and had a shilling worth of brandy and water; Linton said if we could shew fifty pounds a piece he would give us ten guineas a piece; I produced this sum that I had borrowed, I produced forty five pounds in notes and five guineas besides; I laid it down on the table, the forty five pound in notes and and the five guineas; I laid down the notes, and I think the same money, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay down all the notes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any money besides that you laid down, besides these bank notes? - I had some money out.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you lay down? - I believe a couple of guineas. Linton said his lawyer told him he was a fool, and could not write his A, B, C. Brown says, let us see if you can write A, B, C. He writ it down A, B, C. Says Linton, I have writ it, where is all your money? Brown says he had given his Polly some to buy her some clothes; and where is your rest? says he, my Polly's aunt has got it and locked it up. There was a letter or two that Brown made and put a pot over it, and so he was to guess; Linton laid a guinea with me that he guessed the letter that was under the pot, and he did not guess it, and so I had the guinea, I took the guinea when I had won it. Then another guinea was laid, and I won it, then Brown took up the money and the notes, forty five pounds the whole sum.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take up any money that you laid down? - I cannot tell how much he took up, but there was but one guinea of mine, and he took that with him; when he had taken it up they both went away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110110"/>I followed them out, and said stop them! they are rogues and thieves; and they were stopped immediately, and brought back, and gave me every penny of my money again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then you went away after you had got your money? - I did; and the people followed and stopped me and said I should come back; I had got nothing but my own money, and Linton gave me a guinea more.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you won a guinea, what did you do with that? - I put it down again, they gave me a guinea over, they said that was to bear my charges, I was going home, but Scott and the other man followed me as far as the gravel pits, and fetched me back again.</p>
               <p>Q. You applied to Scott to get some money of these people? - I mentioned to Scott that I had won nine guineas of them, and desired him to go back and get it of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you won these nine guineas? - In shewing the fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Mr. Clay, the person of whom you borrowed this money, that it was all a gambling transaction between you and these men? - To be sure it was.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you went before the magistrate the 10th of July? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And there these men were committed as rogues and vagabonds. Now afterwards you went before the magistrate again? - I had some things coming to town, and I begged leave to go and come to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. First of all they were committed as rogues and vagabonds? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. This Mr. Scott has told you that he will pay you the expences of this prosecution? - He said I should be paid, the justice said so.</p>
               <p>Court. And so you shall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did not Mr. Scott tell you that if you preferred an indictment against these people for felony, that he would pay you? - I cannot be sure whether he did or not. The justice told me I should be paid my charges; I paid ten shillings when I filed the bill.</p>
               <p>Court. After the men were taken up in the street, who was it said they had only been gambling? - I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Q. You can tell us whether somebody or other did not talk about their having been gambling? - They both of them declared, both Brown and Linton, that they and the old man had been gambling, and the old man said they had not, and the old man, as soon he came into the room swore that he would not take the money but he would prosecute them; the two prisoners at the bar desired that Mr. Jacobs might take up the notes, and he delivered them to the old man, and the old man kept them when Mr. Jacob's told them they were very good notes.</p>

               <p>I lent Mr. Hunsley the bank notes on Wednesday the 10th of July, one twenty pounds, two ten pounds, and one five pounds, I have got them here; I lent them him very near twelve o'clock; I see him again about an hour or rather more,</p>
               <p>Q. On what occasion did you see him again? - He brought me the notes back again, he said he had gained twelve guineas by them. (The bank notes read by the clerk of the court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This man had the notes of you in the morning, and he returned them in about an hour? - Or an hour and a quarter, and he said that he had got twelve guineas by my lending him these notes, and that he had got two in possession, and the ten he was to receive.</p>
               <p>Court to Hunsley. Did you tell Mr. Clay that you had got two guineas, and the other ten you was to receive? - I had got one, and I was to have had the other ten if I had had fair to have had it.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he represent it? - I understood that Mr. Hunsley had been robbed of some money; I immediately ran up to him, and he produced these bank notes, and says he, are you sure that they are good? I said they are good, I told him they were so good that I would give him cash for one or all; I said now tell me what is the matter; says he, only some gentlemen have been a joking with me, and I have won ten guineas, I have got one and my own money, and if you had been with me Mr. Tribble I should have had the other nine; I have seen him repeatedly since and he has told me the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever acquainted with either of the prisoners? - I am a friend of Hunsley's; this is the account he gave me of the transaction.</p>

Mr. Scott came after the old man for to make him go back, and Mr. Hunsley says to Mr. Scott, the butcher, they owe me nine guineas more, do you run back and get that; Mr. Scot immediately ran back, and then he came and he said to a constable there, that is the man that has been robbed; says the constable, you must go back to give charge of the people, and then we went back and had a drop of brandy; and that is all that I know about it.</p>

               <p>Elliot. I never see him to the bed of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Fenn. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave any person in his house to sell goods in his absence? - Yes, but nobody was in the shop, the person was down in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was near his shop, nor did I know where his shop was, I presume it might be handed off, but by another person; at the time he saw me take this tea chest no man called out, nor did Frazier come up, it was that man, the constable, came up. At the same time I had bought this tea caddy, and paid three shillings and six-pence for it, I met a man and he said he was going abroad on that very day following, and I knew there were some people going abroad the next day; and when the black came before the justice, he said it was a man in a green coat.</p>
               <p>Court to Frazier. Did you say before the justice that it was a man in a green coat? - I said it was a man in a green coat, and he had on a green coat, he has not got on the coat that he had on when I attacked him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That black has forsworn against me, ask him if he is a christian.</p>
               <p>Frazier. I was born in a christian country, and I believe was made one, as my friends told me.</p>

I had long suspected Scott of being dishonest, of stealing casks, in consequence of the suspicion I went to his premises on Saturday, the 31st of August, I found a large quantity of our casks, they were of different sizes, I saw six kilderkins there, they have the mark of Kirkman on them, the property of the gentlemen carrying on the brewhouse now; the names are mentioned in the indictment, when I found the casks, some were empty, and some were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that beer, the beer from your house? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt they are the property of that firm? - I am perfectly satisfied that they are the property of the firm.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he dealt at the brewhouse for beer lately? - Not lately,</p>
               <p>Q. Is any of the beer found in those casks, beer that come from your brewhouse? - I think not, if it was it was not by the knowledge of the proprietors, I never see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any knowledge at all in the manner in which such property could be taken from the brewhouse? - Either from the brewhouse or from the drays in the street; I believe they were taken from the drays, I found abundance of casks on the man's premises with the names chopt out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. They were found on this man's premises, I believe any body going by might see them? - Some were concealed and some were not, they were piled up.</p>
               <p>Q Do not you pile up your own casks? - When they are washed we pile them up.</p>
               <p>Q. This man dealt with you after he left your service on to the 23d of April? - I cannot say, he dealt with us so long as we chose to serve him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that? - I really don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know it was down to the end of April last?</p>
               <p>Court. Might not these be casks not returned? - We never sold him any beer in casks of this sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How do you know that? - I know from the mode of booking the casks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you superintend the booking of your own casks; - Sometimes I do, and sometimes I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to say that no agent in your house has delivered him casks of this size, might they not be out to people his customers, and afterwards returned, if you had made the enquiry?</p>
               <p>Court. Pray did you ever miss these casks? - No, surely I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you swear to these identical casks being on your premises since April? - No, I cannot.</p>

He said he had no objection to his own box, but his box was not at his lodgings, it was in a person's hands in Moorfields; I asked him how it came there, he said when he was in custody by the officers of Whitechapel for a child this woman swore to him, he was running off with his box, and seeing this person that he knew, he desired him to take it into his possession; I went with him to Moorfields with the officer, he did not know where the man lived that had the box, he said he had lived with Langford, a customer of ours, but he had left him. I desired he would leave me the key, and that he would go with the officer the while, he said he had not got the key, I said it is very odd, you should leave your box and key at a strange man's, I then sent him home, then I and the officer went to his apartments for to search this Curran's box, for she had her box, but before I went to Catharine wheel-alley I went to Mr. Windsor's, the pawnbroker's, and while I was there, in comes the woman prisoner at the bar, with two blankets to pawn; I had been with Curran that morning to see what I could find out, and whether this letter came from her; the young man came out of the warehouse, and said here is the woman that has pawned these cotton counterpanes in the shop now; she was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what the pawnbroker said, said in her presence? - Yes, it was by Mr. Windsor's man, I don't know his name; she was rather alarmed at seeing me, I asked her how she came by them blankets, particularly one which I owned? she said she bought it, I asked her what she gave for it? she could not tell me that, at last she said it was given to her, she said one Mrs. Cavenor had given it her, I asked her where that woman lived? she said she kept a public house in Whitechapel; I had this woman sent for, and when she came she denied it, and the prisoner said nothing, the woman upbraided her as a very wicked woman; now says I, tell me some other story, this will not do, she then said that she bought it, but she would not tell me where, nor she could not tell me what she gave for it; I then went up to her apartments with her and the officer, and searched her box, but did not find any thing in it, there was another box under it, but that I could not open because I had not the key, and she said Maxey had it, I brought her back to the pawnbroker's, and after taking her before a magistrate she owned to pawning a blanket and a cotton counterpane at another place, then I came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110116"/>back from her apartment to Maxey and asked him for the key of that box, for I thought I should find it out; he said he had no key; I said you have two keys. I collared him and endeavoured to get it out of his pocket, he had got a coarse apron on, he took every thing out of his pocket and rushed them into his breeches, and endeavoured to get out of my possession; Mr. Windsor's man assisted me, and I was obliged to take up the poker and threaten to knock him down if he did not deliver the key, at last I sent for a warrant, and we took the key by force; the first thing we did we went to the apartment and opened the box; the first thing we found was a pair of buckles of mine, and several small pen knives which I will not swear to, though I know them to be mine; from there I went to Smock-alley, Widegate-street, leading from Bishopsgate-street to Spitalfields, and there we found another box, the man brought a box on his head to Mr. Windsor's; I took the buckles, they are here, they are mine, we then took him to another pawnbroker; before I found it out in my own house I persuaded him very much to confess, but I told him if I found it out of my own accord I would prosecute him; there was three cotton counterpanes which I can only swear to the manufacturer's mark, because they have had the policy to take off our paper which had the shop mark on.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the parish you live in? - In the parish of Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it in the parish of St. Botolph without Aldgate? - I don't know. There were four guineas taken out of the box; I saw it in my husband's box, in the one pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your lodging room? - Yes. I did not lodge in it, but other lodgers did. The box stood between a lodging bed and the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the box been locked? - Yes. I saw these four guineas the day before I missed them, between eight and nine the next day; there was four guineas, and four shillings worth of halfpence all but a penny, and five shillings and six-pence in silver, a silk handkerchief cost me five shillings and nine-pence, which I did not miss at the time he was before the justice, and my husband's silver watch was taken. I asked this man about them, which I thought there was nobody else to take them but him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the house at the time? - He was. When I asked him the next morning, he denied them, that he knew nothing about them. I said that he must know about them, both he and his wife, and I bolted the door on them to keep them in doors till my husband came in at twelve o'clock, because there was nobody in the house but them, his child and me, and then I whipped out to send somebody for my husband, who was at work at the Rotation office, and when I came back I saw him helping his wife over the wall, out of my yard into Mr. Shoebard's yard, a publican. They took the bolt off the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get out? - They unbolted the door; there are two doors; I went out at the front door and they at the back door. Then he asked me did I see his wife; I said I see him helping her over the wall: he ran out of the street from me; and I ran after him, and cried stop thief! and other people catched him for me, who, I don't know; he delivered some of the money to me, a little after he was catched, at the Crooked Billet, that was where I saw him, because he was in dread, and he said he would give me the money so as I would let him go, he delivered me one guinea and two half guineas in gold, and two shillings and one penny; he had the things released with the rest of the money, and then he went and pawned them again for three half guineas and a half crown, and gave me that. The watch was laid on the chamber window, in the one pair of stairs; when I pursued after him, I did not find the watch on him, it was laid on the chamber window; the watch which was in the box was in the one pair of stairs chamber window, where the box was, that was where I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the handkerchief? - I found the gown piece, which he released himself from pawn; he had a bundle at the Three Crowns, nigh the Mansion House, and my cotton was in that bundle; I heard him say so, that he sent it there; he gave me my gown piece out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110118"/>of that bundle; it was six yards of printed cotton, it cost me half a crown a yard, it is worth fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a woman that used to come to see me that gave me these four guineas.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>There was an irruption in the street, and this man happened to be running, and I took the man in the minories; he was running; I stopped the man, and he told me that he would go along with me; he saw the woman, and on seeing the woman he denied that he had any of her property; in the course of their speaking some time he delivered two guineas to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to deliver her two guineas? - I don't know. Some words happened between them; I went to send for an officer, and one of the neighbours went for an officer, and they would not give the charge to this officer; they went from thence to where the man had his clothes; I went to the place with them, it was not an hundred yards from the Minories, in the City, and out of that bundle of clothes he gave the gown piece belonging to this woman, I saw him; then he declared that he had no more property of her's; he proffered to pawn all his clothes if there was any thing amiss respecting him; then he pawned his clothes, and told the woman he would make her recompence, and a gold ring that did not belong to him, belonging to a cousin or sister; he paid her four guineas all but three shillings and five-pence; and then she owned that was all right except the three shillings and five-pence; Then her husband went for an officer, (the gentleman is present) and took him before a justice, and there the woman swore the watch against him; and the watch was in her husband's possession at the same time, and her husband and herself declared the watch was on the window, in their own house.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Terry. Was the printed cotton in the box? - The printed cotton was pawned at Mrs. Morris's. I lent him the printed cotton to pawn before that, and he would not give me the money, so I asked him for the duplicate, and he took the duplicate out of the box, and released the gown piece from pawn, and had it in his bundle.</p>

               <p>Q. What you went out into the yard? - I went out into the yard; he came out of a little washhouse, joining to the house, in the yard; I went in doors and gave the alarm for the watch to be called, and he was taken immediately.</p>

I immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110120"/>ran across a bridge, which leads to a brook, and I saw the prisoner come out of the brook, run across a foot path that leads into the road; I called on him to stop, or else I would fire on him; he ran the space of five or six hundred yards before I took him, in that time I catched hold of him, and brought him back to the watch-house; the lady came into the watch-house soon after, within the space of a few minutes, she said he was the man that was in the watch-house, before his face; I searched him; he had no stockings on, he had his stockings in his pocket; I found nothing on him but a screw driver and a pair of clasps, and his knife.

               <p>Prisoner. On the 24th of July I was in Whitechapel, these tools we always have about us; and I saw an acquaintance of mine; he asked me if I was out of service? I told him I was; says he, if you will go along with me I will recommend you, my master wants a man to drive the Woodford stage. I went with with the man and I stayed there till past ten o'clock, and then I came away; I came as far as Hackney, and then I took my stockings off, and was washing my feet, and the while I heard something plunge into the water; I took up my stockings, knowing that Hackney parish was a very strict place, and I went on; and the gentleman overtook me, and brought me to the watch-house</p>

I was in a little house which I was building, and this man was working in the house, and could earn twenty two shillings and two-pence per week. I observed him going from the end of my yard where I had lost a considerable quantity of wool; I watched him from that part, and then I lost sight of him while he was gone into the shed; as he come back I stopped him with something in an apron; I asked him what he had got there? he said, only a few chips; I then took the apron from him, and opened the corner of it, and saw it was pewter pots; I called my servant immediately to prevent him getting away, and called for a constable, and gave charge of him; there was one quart pot bruised quite flat up, one pint pot seemed bruised entirely up, the other had a piece cut out with a chissel, where the name had been; I put the piece to it, and it quite fitted that part.

               <p>Prisoner. Did not I tell you that I found them in the cellar, and was taking them to the publican to own them? - Before I gave charge of you, you said they were chips, and afterwards you said you was going to carry them home.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you say that the pots you saw in the hands of Mr. Burder, were the same you took from that man? - Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110122"/>they were kept in my yard till Mr. Burder came, and then they were given to him; they were given after that to the constable.</p>
               <p>Court to Burder. How do you know they are your pots? - By a private mark which was made on all the pots I took of Mr. Grimsby.</p>
               <p>Q Had you ever sold any of these pots with this private mark? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q Did you miss any pots that day? - I did not that day. I lost four or five dozen in the course of a month.</p>

I was at work at Alderman Staines house this day; when I had done work there I carried in my tools, and I found these pots under the stairs; when I first worked there I was told the alderman was a very strict man, and therefore when he first met me I said they were chips, but when he was taking them out of my apron I said they were pots, and I was going to carry them home to the Jacob's Wells.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he paid for that he bought? - I had not taken his money up, it lay on the counter; I returned it to him again and he returned me the ribbon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Had you finished the dealing when Mr. Bothroyd came in? - We had.</p>
               <p>Q. He had taken up several pieces in the time? - He had.</p>

I take the ribbons; says he, what do you mean by it? why says I, I mean what I say; you have two pieces of ribbon, that I say; he then shuffled, and in shuffling got his hand into his pocket, and took out the pink piece of ribbon which he threw into the drawer; immediately after he put his hand into his pocket, and took out the black piece, which it came unrolled in taking of it out, and in throwing of it on the counter Mrs. Gaywood laid hold of it, and said it was her property. The pink ribbon was thrown into the drawer.</p>

On the 7th of March last I met the prisoner at the King's Arms coffee house, over Blackfriars-bridge, where I usually at that time dined, we dined together, and in conversation at dinner, or after dinner, he said he had served his clerkship to a gentleman at Ludlow, in Shropshire, and that the name was Kinnersley and that he had been sent by his father to London to get into an attorney's office for improvement,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110125"/>and that he had been recommended to Messrs Kinnersley and Long, at Symonds-inn, Chancery-lane, that he had been there but they had no vacancy; he said his father meant to give fifty pounds with him to be at an attorney's office a year or two; he then asked if I wanted such a person, or if I knew any gentleman that did? I asked him who he knew in town to give him a character? he said he knew Alderman Harley, and Alderman Harley knew him, and his family very well, and Mr. Knight, the member of parliament, knew him, and he said the lady of that house knew him, who, when I enquired, she said that he had been there about a twelve month before with his father, and she gave me a very favourable account of the young man and his family. On this I asked him to drink tea with me; he did; and he asked if he might come the next day? I said by all means; he came on the 8th and continued till the Thursday following, the 14th. On the 14th I had the balance of account, in a case that I had, to send into the country, the sum of one hundred and fifty-five pounds, six shillings and two-pence. On the 14th, in the morning, I went and looked into my drawer, and I had two hundred pounds, I went to my drawer I looked at my money, because I had to make the former payment either that day or the next.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the money there in bank notes or in cash? - In bank notes; there were two fiftys, two twenty fives, one twenty, and three tens.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner was in the chamber at the time you looked into this drawer? - That same morning he was not in the chambers, but the day before I had been putting a bank note in the drawer, and the prisoner was warming himself by the office fire, and he was looking at me at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was about what? - At these bank notes. On the 14th I left the chambers in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you left the prisoner in the chambers? - I am sure I left him in the chambers that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you leave him in the chambers? - In the morning about ten or a little after.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other clerk at that time? - My other clerk was with me; there was nobody left in the chambers but the prisoner; I took the other clerk with me, and just before I went I saw the bank notes in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again, after you left your chamber in the morning? - He asked what time I should be at home? and my clerk said between six and seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again that day? - Yes, I did. I went to the same coffee house where I used to dine between two and three.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you returned to your chamber in this interval? - I had not. The prisoner was at the coffee room at dinner? says I, dinner so soon? he usually used to go with me to dinner at three o'clock; so I sat down and dined with him; after dinner he asked me if I had been at the the chambers? I said, no; why has any body been there? he said nobody but Mr. Knight, the member of parliament, whom he said stayed with him above half an hour; I said directly, I wished to have been at home, because I wanted to see Mr. Knight, because he referred me to Mr. Knight for his character, and it would have saved me the trouble of going to Whitehall; he said that Mr. Knight had asked him to drink tea with him that afternoon, and could he go? I said by all means; I asked him what time he intended to go? he said Mr. Knight told him to be at his house at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110126"/>five o'clock; I said, five o'clock, that is too early for a gentleman. He called for a glass of brandy and water, in the mean time a gentleman came into the coffee house to speak to me, and just as the brandy and water was brought he disappeared; I did not see him after; he never returned to the chambers that I could learn; I never see him again till the 12th of July, and that merely accidental.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this conversation was it you returned to your chambers? - I drank tea at my chambers; I returned about six; I found my chambers locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of violence about your chambers? - No, not that night; I perceived nothing that night that led me to any suspicion; I had this one hundred and twenty-five pounds to send into the country in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the drawer where these notes were, the evening you returned from the coffee house? - No, I did not; it was the next morning, the Friday between ten and eleven o'clock. I slept in the chambers that night.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find the drawer? - I went to the drawer, drew it out, and went to a memorandum book which I replaced these bank notes in, within its leaves; this book was there, and the notes out of the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that lead you to make any observation on the drawer itself? - I pulled out the drawer, I found it had been wrenched open by some instrument or other, as if they had got under the table and wrenched it under.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this drawer separate by itself, and no drawer under it? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. So any person might have applied an instrument to the bottom of that drawer, and it appeared to have been wrenched? - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have not been able to trace any of the notes? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. After he had applied for you to take him he told you it was necessary for him to write to his father, to have his consent, and that before he compleated this agreement with you he was to receive his father's answer's? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were together you lived together? - We did; we dined together.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the landlady of the King's Arms coffee house was a near relation of your's? - Yes, she is.</p>
               <p>Q. It was to her you applied for his character, and she satisfied you? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 14th, after the time, he went back to your sister's house where you always dined, and there he dined? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it might appear that he wanted to meet you? - To be sure one might think so, that he went to meet me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he told you that Mr. Knight had asked him to visit him that night, did not you say then, you had better make haste, for it is time to set off? - It may have been so, but I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he finished his dinner, and called for a glass of brandy and water, and when he went away you was otherwise engaged with some body else? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you are aware of it; do you know that on the morning of the 15th, he really did receive a letter from his father forbidding him to enter into the engagement with you? - I do not know it, it may be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he the only person that had access to your chambers? - The laundress always has a key.</p>
               <p>Q. And how is that key disposed of when the laundress does not want to come to the house? - Left at the porter's lodge; but the porter would be very particular whom he gave the key to.</p>

               <p>I am a woollen draper and man's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110127"/>mercer, Charing-cross. I saw the prisoner at the bar; I cannot exactly say the day of the month; I have an entry in my book of an article he had the 23d of March, it was between the 12th and the 23d, I cannot speak nearer than that; it was between the hours of nine and ten o'clock at night; the shop was shut up; I was up stairs, and he came with another person, whom he called his servant; he immediately called me by my name, and he says, you recollect me, I had something of you when I was at the Golden Cross sometime ago; I did then recollect him; I took him into the back shop, and he told me that he wanted half a dozen waistcoats if I had them ready made, and a coat or two he wanted; I told him I had not got the articles ready made, but I could make them for him at a very short notice; he seemed to be very urging if I had any thing of the kind, as he meant to go abroad immediately; he informed me that he had seen an advertisement for one that wanted a companion who was going abroad; he said that he had seen that advertisement in some news paper that he could not recollect, and asked me if I could tell him? I told him I did not recollect any reference; there happened to be a waistcoat ready made for a gentleman that I thought would about fit him, and he had that waistcoat and a pair of drawers; he took his pocket book out of his pocket, and out of that pocket book he took a quantity of bank notes, and offered to pay me if I would give him change.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the notes? - I could not distinguish any of the bank notes. On his offering to pay me for them, I told him it was no consequence, as he had things before I was not afraid to trust him, or words to that effect; he agreed to call the next morning to look out the goods that he wanted, and he gave me his address, that he lodged at the King's Arms, Blackfriars-road; I expected him the next day, but I did not see him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Are you sure that he is the man? - I have no doubt at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not seen him since March? - Not till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. How often had you seen him at your house? - To the best of my recollection he called once or twice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. If I understand you right, you had some difficulty in recollecting him, if he had not told you he was the person that came before? - I had a deal of conversation with him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not appear to you extraordinary that that man should resort to you to know about a person for travelling? - It did not.</p>
               <p>Q. At this night, you knew from him, that he lodged at the King's Arms coffee house? - Or else I should not have known were to have applied.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated it to have been on the 12th or 23d, will you take on you to say upon your oath that it was before the 14th? Will you venture on your recollection to say that this time when he called and produced the bank notes was not before the 14th? - When I called to enquire for him at the King's Arms coffee house, they told me that he had robbed his master.</p>

               <p>Q. On your oath was it not before the 14th? - It might be, I will not be sure.</p>
               <p>Court to Marshall. Was this King's Arms the same coffee house that you dined at? - The same coffee house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you look to see that the buckles were missing? - I did not. I went down to the pawnbroker's, near St Martin's Church, and there I found a pair of buckles which I believe to be mine; the boy was apprehended, and carried to the watch-house, and I went to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass to promise him or threaten him? - There was no promise made, but I desired him to confess, and told him it would be better for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the knee buckles? - No further than I believe they are mine.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; I think he pawned these knee buckles the 12th of July, it it was Thursday, I am sure it was the prisoner, he had on a white jacket then.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him? - I see him the next day when he was committed. He offered to pawn them; he asked me four shillings for them, I saw he was a poor like boy, and I asked him who they belonged to? he said he had them of his father; I asked him where his father was? he said his father worked for Mr. Collins, the dustman, at Westminster; that gave me rather a suspicion, and I looked over the counter, and I saw these shoe buckles were in his pocket; I then put him in St. Martin's watch-house, and after eleven o'clock I got him to Bow street, and I cannot remember whether he confessed going along or at Bow-street. There were two boys together, but the other boy had only a pair of shirt buttons.</p>
               <p>Burrows. There was another boy at work with him in the house, and which boy stole the shoe buckles I don't know. (The buckles produced.)</p>
               <p>Burrows. I do not venture to swear to them; I believe they are mine.</p>

               <p>I live at Balfour, all in the same parish as Hatton. I was with the prisoner, and she said if Mr. Sidwell would go back with her to Hatton again, she would give him one guinea of the money again, and make the rest up in property; and Mr. Sidwell would not go.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this conversation? - She wanted to make it up with him; he said he would make it up if she would go and fetch him the money and things there, but he would not go to Hatton with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise her any thing to make her confess that? - Nothing at all; it was voluntary.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man said if I would give him some money he would make it up between this man and me? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the man's money; I never saw the man from the time that he went up stairs till the morning; he asked me to drink, I told him I would not drink; he asked me to go up stairs and have connection with him; I denied him; then he asked me to make him some gin and water; I told him I was not the landlady; he said he had lost money out of his pocket, and he would make me suffer, because I denied him that question.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. Mrs. Misslebroke acknowledged that she had one guinea of the money to Mr. Lane; so Mr. Lane sent her to prison too with

The prosecutor sent word to me that I need not care about it, for he would not appear against me; he came to me in prison and brought me victuals, and said that he would clear me if I would swear against the landlady, because she was a woman and had friends, and I had none; but as he had begun he must go through with it, he said it had cost him twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I went to the prison to her and gave her six-pence, and I said, why did you give Mrs. Misslebroke any part of the money? you have brought yourself into the trouble and you must go through with it.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. On your oath will you say that you was sober when you went to bed? - I was no ways to be called in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what sort of a house this was before you went in? - When I went in I thought they were very creditable people in the house, because they told me that Mr. and Mrs. Misslebroke were dead.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before this? - I knew him so far as this, that he was a <rs id="t17930911-78-deflabel430" type="occupation">plaisterer</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you carry him home? - No, I did not carry him home.</p>
               <p>Q. You agreed to go home together? - Yes. And I put off my pockets, and put them between the sacking and the bed; in my right hand pocket there were two half crowns, in my left hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110132"/>pocket there was a shilling. I went to bed, and about half after three o'clock he got out of bed, he went to bed with me, I heard him get up, and I heard him going out of the door, Thomas, said I, where are you going? no, says he, I am not going, only going backward; I thought to myself I am very afraid of your going backward, and I went to feel for my pockets, and I missed my pockets from under the place where I had put them, and before he got down stairs I went down stairs after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the pockets gone out of the room? - They were not, I missed them from the place where I put them; I followed him down stairs and I would not let him go out of doors till I asked him for my money; he said he had not the money, he had not a farthing about him, he said he never saw the money; hearing a dispute my landlady got up she struck a light and she opened the door, and hearing of that, she said, have not you got it in your shoes, and he opened his waistcoat, and there was nothing; I would not let him out, and the two patroles came to the door, I went up stairs to search my bed, in the mean time he let down his apron and they found the money; I did not see the patroles do that.</p>
               <p>Q. After you missed it how soon did you see your money? - In about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the two half crowns, and shilling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose hands? - In the patrole's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that money to be your's? - I don't know it for a certainty; I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when he denied having the money what did you say to it? - He said, I have money about me to be sure, and I took it, and hid it for fear she should rob me when I was gone to bed; and he said to the watchman, I insist on having it again, for it is my own money.</p>
               <p>Q. The patrole proves the taking of the money from him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Jones. I am a shoemaker, a master; I keep a shop in White Lyon-street. On Monday the 8th of July, a neighbour came to me, and desired me to go and see after a bullock that had strayed that way, and to disperse the mob; with that I went up and went round the street, past Mr. Potter's house, with that I went across the way to the lare, and the bullock was got up, locked up; when I got there, there was the mob, and I stopped to see what became of them, and this lad and some more went on to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110134"/>Angel, and then they turned back; and went up White Lion-street, and past my door; I followed the prisoner at the bar about fifty yards behind them; when he got to Mr. Potter's door he made a stand; with that I made a bit of an halt likewise, and he looked himself a little about across the way; there is a public house opposite, and I see him take up the handkerchiefs, a bundle however, which were laid in a sopha at Mr. Potter's door, where there were other articles put out at the door; after that he took the bundle, and he put it under his great coat, then he made off as quick as he could, and I after him, and I hallooed stop thief! then he turned the corner into Banner-street; I never lost sight of him till I took him; he dropped the property in Banner-street, about the middle of the street, I saw him drop it, but I did not stay to see him pick it up; the lad picked it up and brought it me while I had the prisoner in custody. (The property produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this you went round and took this man? - About four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court to Potter. When did you last see these at your door? - That day about three o'clock in the afternoon; it was then laying on the sopha before the door; I know them to be mine by my own mark, of my own hand writing, 2 s. 3 d. 2 s. 6 d. 2 s. 9 d. and 3 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was that day asked out to dinner at Cannonbury House, turning up White Lion street, I heard the cry of stop thief! with that I ran, and I was taken running, and Mr. Jones said that I was the person that took the property, which I am as innocent of as a child unborn.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On Friday the 16th of August, Mr. Duberley came down to the office at Bow-street, he wanted an officer, he suspected the porter had robbed him, to search his box; I went with him; he was seated in the room, and I asked if he had any objection to have his box searched? he replied, no. We went up into the garret, and we opened the box, found this piece of linen first, and in the box was found these two keys; these two keys being in the box, Mr. Duberley asked him where his box was he suspected he took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110135"/>it? after a little hesitation he said he would go where it was; this was a box belonging to his master; he went with him to his lodgings, where he used to lodge, at one Mr. Godfry's, Castle-court, Castle-street, Oxford-market, and when we went there we asked for the box, it was brought out, and all the other articles in the indictment was found in that box; the box is here. (The articles produced.)</p>
               <p>Madgewicke. Here are eight pair of shoes, four pair of them marked with a K. and 7. four of them with a W here is a remnant of fine scarlet that I cut off the piece myself, it was laid in the counting house, and I did not know which way it went; here are a pair of flannel drawers, I can swear to them by the particular lining; I believe all the things to be Mr. Duberley's.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you swear them to be your's? - I can, those that I took from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your name on them? - No, it is not; they have been at the office Hatton Garden ever since. I missed seven in all, and found these four; three are totally gone, which I suppose he took at first to go and get the money to pay for the beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had these candlesticks? - I have had them for seven years. One of the small ones, which I took out of his pocket, I think it is marked, pattern on the bottom; I can swear to them safely being my property.</p>

               <p>I keep a little clothes shop in King-street, Seven Dials; the prisoner brought the cloak to me about the 8th of July, about nine o'clock in the morning, or rather better; it was on a Monday, I knew her before, she had been at the shop buying trifling articles and I thought her a very decent well behaved woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her how she came by the cloak? - She said it was her own. I bought it of her for six shillings and six-pence, that was the full value; I think the trimmings are very much broke, the cloak is stained.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it found out you had it? - The officer was enquiring about it, I carried it up to the officer when I heard of it, and left it there.</p>

               <p>Q. What were you so drunk you don't recollect? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you about you when you went into the house? - Four pounds ten shillings. I paid a shilling for the house, and I gave the prisoner something to drink; I had four shillings and six-pence I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay for what you gave the prisoner to drink? - I don't know; I had four guineas and about two pennyworth of halfpence in my waistcoat pocket, I saw them when I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any silver? - Yes, when I went in I had four or five shillings, I cannot tell which, besides two very remarkable six-pences.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss your money? - In the morning about half after four o'clock, and the woman was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman in the room when you missed your money? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not sober enough to know whether she left the room? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any of this money been found? - The two six-pences she gave me out of her own pocket the next morning. When I awaked I got up, and went and searched the houses where I could find any body, and I went into a public house, called the Running Horse, and there I found the prisoner, the best part of a furlong from the lodgings; with that I saw her, and I said are you the person that took me to the lodgings last night? she said, yes; said I, what have you done with the money? then she said, she had got none; I told her she certainly had, and she had best give it up to me without any further ado; she said she had not got it, and the woman that keeps the public house said she knew better, that she had got it; that was in the presence of the prisoner, and the woman that kept the house told her if she had not got it then, she had given it to an old woman that she had been treating that morning; there was another girl also there, and she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110141"/>told her that she should be well rigged out in two or three days time; with that I saw a person there that I knew, and I slipt out for the officer; he came and searched her; before he came she gave me these two six-pences, and she said she had not any more but them, and the officer searched her, and he could not find any more about her; Mr. Sanders, the officer, has the six-pences.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you not to put these six-pences in the indictment?</p>

               <p>I am a silversmith, in Bond-street; I know the prisoner Seville, I have known him about four months.</p>
               <p>Q. On what occasion did you first know him? - Owing to an advertisement in the news paper, I took him into my service.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did he first enter into your service? - The 9th of April, and he quitted it on the 7th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity was he? - As a <rs id="t17930911-89-deflabel495" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>Q. As a porter, what did he do? - He opened and shut up the shop. My customers when they went out of town they sent their chests of plate to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. From the nature of his employment, was he or was he not in the habit of becoming acquainted with the manner of your house, and where this plate was deposited? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know where the plate was deposited? - He has assisted in carrying the chests of plate to the cellar, when they were brought in by my customers.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in consequence of carrying down these chests of plate into the cellar,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110143"/>he knew where the plate was deposited? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the situation of this cellar? - It is a strong cellar with a double door and plated with iron.</p>
               <p>Q. On the inside in what position was this cellar? - It opened into the back kitchen; there was but one window and that was strongly barred with iron; the iron barrs looked into my garden; I mean the iron barrs of the cellar where the things were deposited.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it level with the garden? - No, it was under the garden, and strongly barred withinside, only these bars remained just as they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to describe what was the situation of the other part of the cellar? - The cellar was square.</p>
               <p>Q. How many outside walls? - Only one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it towards the garden? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What does the other three communicate with? - One to the back kitchen, and another is the party wall between the two houses, and the other divides the scullery; between the cellar and scullery, within the cellar there is a door way, and a smaller cellar behind that.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you describe the situation of the wall which you mentioned to be towards the back kitchen; in what situation was that wall when you made the discovery? - In the wall between the scullery and cellar there was a small hole that conveyed a water pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was that hole that conveyed the water pipe? - About the size of the crown of a man's hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the situation of the wall surrounding this pipe? - It was bricked up; and when I received information that I had been robbed I went to that place, and found that the bricks had been removed out and replaced; I mean the bricks about the pipe; I opened the cellar door, and when I entered the cellar every thing appeared perfectly secure; but after searching the different chests I found two chests belonging to Mr. York broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you go any further tell me exactly where these chests stood? - They stood fronting the door, one of them, and the other above it, rather behind, close to the wall of the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. What had these chests been fastened with? - They were locked with padlocks.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the keys of them? - Mr. York or his servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the locks had been forced? - The locks had not, but the staples had been.</p>
               <p>Q. From this hole, where the pipe was introduced, you observed these bricks removed; what was the size of the hole? - About the size of one of those books.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it large enough for a man to get in at? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did this box stand from the hole? - The hole is a great deal higher than a man's head, seven feet high from the ground, and there appeared, on the side of the wall, evident marks of a person getting up through the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the place where this hole was stood these boxes? - About six feet; so that a person must have been in the cellar and got over other chests to have got to this.</p>
               <p>Q. By your description I take it for granted that these boxes stood without any other boxes on them? - There were no chests on the top of either of these of Mr. York's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they stand on the ground, or on other chests? - On other chests, one of them about three feet from the ground, and the other about five feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that that stood about five feet from the ground, I suppose it was necessary to get on something to open it? - On one of the other chests. These<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110144"/>two chests were covered with matting, so that a person might have gone into the cellar several times without observing they were broke open, as the matting was replaced again.</p>
               <p>Q. When you examined this hole, that you have described, did you observe any rubbish that were left in consequence of that? - There was an oven in the scullery, which a person had got open to get into this hole; on this oven I found mortar and rubbish, it evidently appeared that somebody had been on the top of the oven.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any instrument within the cellar, by which it might be supposed that this box was broke open by? - In searching the cellar at one corner I found this hatchet or cleaver; I remember seeing it some time before, it had been laying about in the kitchen some years I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell me the latest time you recollect seeing it in the cellar? - About six months ago; I am confident it was not in the cellar five months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to recollect, Mr. Hemming, when Mr. York's boxes were deposited there? - On the 10th of July I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you examined these boxes where part of the property was taken away, at which part of the cellar did you find the cleaver in? - I found it in the small cellar, near the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to mention some of the articles that were lost. - I had not a list of the contents of the chests.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This man, I think, you say was discharged from your service on the 7th of August? - He was.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray, sir, what day was it you first made this discovery, or went to the cellar? - He went away from me on the 7th, but I asked him to come on Friday the 9th to wait at table in the evening, to assist my servant; on that day I paid him his wages; he came about three o'clock in the afternoon to wait, and he did wait, and he slept there that night, and went away about ten o'clock on Saturday the tenth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then this man had two clear days to have gone any where out of your reach, and on your invitation he came on the third day? - He did; he went on the 7th and came again on the 9th to wait.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say this cellar communicated with the back kitchen; pray how many servants may you have employed in this business of your's? - I have two others besides the prisoner at the bar, who are engaged in the actual business, two more servants.</p>
               <p>Q. They had as much access to the cellar as the prisoner? - They had more access to the cellar than the prisoner had, because they had the keys.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe as this communicated with the back kitchen, the servant of the house likewise knew that was the deposit of the plate? - I presume if the maid servants knew it, the men servants knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants have you who are engaged in the business now? - Only two; I have only four servants in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have an uncle of the name of Hemmings? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he has some concern in the profits of the business? - He is not in partnership, he has been out of business some time. I had a cousin who was in the business since, whom I presume, you mean, but he has been out of business some time.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said you are certain that this cleaver was not in the cellar five months ago; how long it had been in the cellar of the five months you cannot tell; it may be in the cellar four months, but five months you are sure it was not; I take it for granted you know no better about the removal of the bricks how long ago this aperture was made in your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110145"/>cellar you cannot say? - I cannot say. I should suppose it has not been above five months ago, the very same cellar was attempted, the window was broke and one of the bars taken out; at that time there was but one chest in the cellar, and the cellar was cleared out, and strong bars put to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the cellar having been attempted at the outside of the house, your attention, which was to make that stronger, was drawn to quite a different part of the cellar than where this hole was made? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Hemmings, the window being repaired if the cleaver had been in the cellar then, you, or some of your people would have seen it? - Certainly, because the cellar was then cleared out.</p>

             is his real name, as he always told me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - These three years, it may be a little more, it is not less.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live yourself? - Before I was taken into custody I lived at Mr. Roach's, in Pall Mall, as a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner when he was in the service of Mr. Hemmings? Yes, I don't know the day that he went, but he told me two or three days before he went that he was to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you knew him when he was actually in Mr. Hemmings's employ? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any connection with him while he remained in that service? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you visit him there? - I went to see him sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Thornbury? - I knew him very well as an acquaintance of Mr. Seville.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Seville at any time, and you must tell when, say any thing about what he had done in the house of Mr. Hemmings? - The first thing that ever he told me was of a tea urn.</p>
               <p>Court. I would be glad if you would recollect the time? - He had been there about a month or six weeks, as nigh as I can guess, I cannot justly say to a week.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you? - He said that he had got a tea urn; I asked him afterwards how he got it? he said he got it by a hole in the wall where the plate was.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this all the words he said, because that is an unintelligible sort of language, and must be unintelligible to you? - He said he was looking for something one day, and he got into a hole of the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Into the hole of what wall? - Into the hole of the wall of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what house? - Mr. Hemmings.</p>
               <p>Q. When he told you he had got a tea urn, was that all he told you? - He said that he had got a tea urn.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the whole of the conversation? - It was at his master's house, Mr. Hemmings, and I asked him if he could not stop in his place without doing such things as these, for he would lose his place.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the beginning of the conversation? - The beginning of the conversation, before ever that he told me about the tea urn was, he said, that was he in my place he would never want money, he would rob my master of all the silks he could; I told him I I should not do any such thing; I told him I had done too much for him already.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it you had done for him before he went to Mr. Hemmings? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110146"/>He slept with me three nights, and the first night he slept with me he asked me if I had any money? I said, no; he said he had not money sufficient enough to to go to his place, and I told him I had no money; he said I was a damned fool, for if he lived where I did he never would want money; he asked me to get some silks; I asked him what he meant? He had none that first night, the night after he came again, and asked me to get some silks; to rob my master of some silks, that was his expression; on which he had two pieces the second night, and the third night he had the same; he took them out of the shop; I was a party in that.</p>
               <p>Q. After this what more past? - He went to Mr. Hemmings service; a few nights afterwards I went to Mr. Hemmings to see him, he told me he had sold the silks to the jew, that he mentioned that he should sell them to, and I asked him what he had got for them? and he never satisfied me, and I had two guineas in the whole from him at different times; I went after that, and he still was persuading of me to get some more silks. he told me I was a damned fool that I did not. Another time after that, about six weeks after that he went to Mr. Hemmings, he told me that he had got a tea urn.</p>
               <p>Q. How did this conversation begin? - He said that he meant to get something of his master before he had got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that his expression? - It was. After that I went again, and then he told me of this tea urn; I went one day, says I, Wright, how do you do? says he, I am very well; and he whispered to me and said that he had got some plate of his master's; I asked him what it was? and he told me that it was a tea urn; with that I told him if he could not stop in his place without robbing his master he had better go away from him; he told me I was a damned fool, did not I think that he knew what he was about? I asked him how he got it? he said he was looking for something one day and he found a hole in the wall, and the hole was not quite large enough, and he pulled a few bricks away to make it larger.</p>
               <p>Q. Now at that time, which was five or six weeks after he had been there, the story happened about this tea urn? - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. You went away at this time? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go again at any other time? - I did in about a week, it might be a little less, or a little more, I cannot say which; he said that he meant still to get some more; that was all that passed the second time as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What past after this? - I did not go any more for a fortnight after this; I told him that I did not like to come, because your master must find out this that you are doing of, and he will think that I have helped you off with it; and he said I was a damned fool; he was then saying that he wanted somebody just to take the plate off, as he should take it away, and I said don't mention that to me for I shall have no hand in it at all; then I did not go to him any more for a week; he then was telling me that he was going to put some money, twenty pounds, in the bank. About this time, it must be towards June or later, I cannot recollect the time, I cannot say the time, he said that he meant to put twenty pounds in the bank, and that he should not stop with his master but a very little while; no, says I, now you have robbed him of all you can you are going to leave him; he said, yes, did I think that he did not know what he was about? I told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110147"/>I did not know whether he did or not. Another time he was telling me, it was the day before he left his master, and there was a young man there, that was to succeed his place, he says to me, this is the young man, I don't know his name, that is to come to take my place; O, is it? says I, then I suppose you go away to night; no, he should not go away till the morning; he did expect to go away a week before that he did. I called the next day, in the afternoon about five o'clock, and I asked the shopman whether Wright was gone? and he told me no he was not gone.</p>
               <p>Court. How came that about? did you call him Wright at the shop? - I did sometimes; and he accused me with it, why I could not keep my own counsel, and said I was a damned fool for it. The shopman said that he was not gone, but he supposed that he would not be long, I might go down stairs; I did go down stairs, and I saw him in the pantry, and I said, John, I see you are not gone yet; no, says he, but I shall not be long first, and after a few minutes talk he went towards his box, and opened it, and shewed me a coffee pot; then he came towards the warehouse, and he unbuttoned his breeches, and shewed me a handful of spoons that were there in his breeches; they were silver spoons; if they were tea spoons they were very large spoons; I said to him, John, do not take any thing out of the house, but put them where you had them; he said no, did I think he was a damned fool and did not know what he was about? then I did not say any thing more to him about the plate at all; I stayed half an hour, and he called a coach; this was the very day that he went away, and the box was carried up, and put into the coach; the coffee pot was in the box, and he got into the coach and I wished him a good night; says he, what are you a going home? yes, says I, I am; no, says he, go along with me to Oxford-road; with his asking of me I did go, I got into the coach; a little way from Mr. Hemmings's,

             stopped the coachman and got into the coach; then Seville and me, and Thornbury were all in the coach, and we went to where Thornbury did live in Oxford road, No. 100, There we got out of the first coach, they went in, but I did not; they took Wright's box out and put it into another coach, which they called; they went into a house for a box, of Charles's, at his master's; then they got out, and got into the other coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Who discharged the first coach? - I don't know. Then the box that was brought out of Thornbury's master's was put into this second coach, and Wright's box was put into the same coach: I stayed in the first coach while they went into the lodgings, and we all got into the second coach; when we were all in they desired the coachman to to go to the French Horn.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired him? - One of them did, I don't know which it was. When they came there they desired the coachman to drive into the yard, and there the coach stood, and they got out of the coach, and the boxes were taken out, and I got out, and there we all went into a lower room at the French Horn.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the evening was this? - About eight as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Now then you three, and the two boxes are at the French Horn; what day was this? - It was of a Wednesday, but I don't know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you was in the room what passed? - I said I must go home; they said, stop a little while and you shall ride home, and I did stop for about a quarter of an hour; the coach was ordered to stop by the French Horn gate; then after stopping that half hour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110148"/>we all three got into the coach and left the boxes behind, and they desired the coachman to go to the Strand, just by Temple Bar, and when we got through Temple Bar they desired him to drive up to where they sold sticks and umbrellas.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the journey you all took together? - To the bottom of the Haymarket. Then Wright says, we are going to the Haymarket little Theatre, and if you will go back and shut up your shop, and do what you have to do and come back we will come down in an hour; I went home and did what I had to do at home; in about an hour after that I went to the little Theatre, and I saw them there again, and when they came out they called a coach and desired the coachman to drive to Brownlow-street, Drury-lane, and we went there, and then knocked at a private house door, as I thought it was, but I found it was a dancing room; we all three continued there till half after eleven; when we were coming away I said, I don't know what to do about going home, I am so late; says he, you shall go along with me and sleep at the French Horn, which I did, and the coach waited at the dancing room till we did go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever at the French Horn before? - Never in my life. When we arrived there they called for something to eat for their suppers, and then they went to bed; they all three slept there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Seville say any thing to you about the contents of the box? - No, nothing at all that evening; the next morning when we got up I said, I cannot tell what I shall say or do when I go home; says he, that don't matter what you say, never mind, damn it, leave your place; then they had breakfast, and they said they were going to Limehouse; after breakfast they called a coach, and the coach came into the yard, and this box that Thornbury took from his master in Oxford-road was put into the coach; the box that belonged to Wright was left behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you all three go into the coach with this box? - Yes, we did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you drive? - We ordered the coachman to drive to Ludgate-street, where they each one bought a pair of boots, and John a pair of boots and shoes; they then ordered the coachman to drive to Limehouse, which he did; I asked them when they were going what they had got in that box of Thornbury's? Charles said they had got pictures. Then when they got to this place at Limehouse, they took the box out and stopped half an hour or more, and I sat in the coach all the time, they took out the box and emptied it, and brought the empty box into the coach again; then when they returned from there they went out a little distance from that, where there was but just room enough for a coach to go, the name of the place I don't know, they stopped at some house which looked like a fireman's or waterman's, I don't know which, they both of them got out and took this box with them, and went up stairs, I stayed in the coach all the time, they stopped half an hour in that house; then this box was brought down again, and the coachman brought it to the coach, and I lifted up the box and found it was not very heavy; after they got into the coach they desired the coachman to drive them to the French Horn where he brought them from, which he did; as soon as they got into the coach I said to them, what is here in this box? and they both laughed and said they were oranges; odd sort of oranges, says I, I doubt; Wright said they were the best sort of oranges; they both said so, and coming home I asked them what they meant to do with themselves? they said they meant to go to Margate, and that they should want some servant, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110149"/>found they could never make a buck of me; if I would go with them they would give me a livery coat and a hat, and four guineas a month, for they should never make a buck of me; then we got to the French Horn and desired the coachman to drive into the yard, and the box was taken out, and we all got out, and the waiter carried the box up, and Wright, he said, now I will go and see for Moses, for he is waiting somewhere hard by; then he went down stairs; after he had been gone about ten minutes he came back and he said that he was just at the corner of the gate, but he would not come up the yard, and he said to Charles, we must take the plate between us to him, for he will not come up; they did, they opened the box that they took from Limehouse, and they took some kind of plate, there was a silver tankard, the silver tankard they bruised together; there were two pieces of a silver dish cut or broke, I did not see it done.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they take this away? - John and Charles took hold of this to pull it one way, and the other to pull the handle off the tankard; I stood still, and they said, you sit still and will not help us; I said, no, I will not; Wright said don't ask him any thing about it; they could not make any impression to pull it to pieces together, so Wright put it down under his feet and pressed it together; Charles took the largest piece of the silver dish, that had been broke or cut, and put in John's breeches and buttoned them up again, and then they put some in their pockets and other parts about them, and this tankard they put it into an handkerchief; then they took what they thought they could get off without being noticed, out of the house; there was this coffee pot left, which I saw at his master's then in the box, which they did not take, and there was some other little articles left; they asked me to take that; and I said no, I would not touch them, nor I did not; they left that behind; they put them into John's box, and they went down stairs, and I followed them a little way from the French Horn gate, there stood the jew, the same man as at the bar, Eleazar Lazarus, with a bag on his shoulder; when they all three got into the coach Wright says to me, you must not go in because the jew never saw you before, and as I would not take any thing; then I got up behind; then they drove to Whitechapel, I shewed the gentlemen the spot where they stopped, the place I don't know the name of; when they got there I got off from behind, and went the opposite side of the way to what they stopt; after they got out of the coach the jew came the same side I was of, but I don't know whether he saw me to know me or not, and he went into a house either by the corner of the street or a little way up the street; after the jew went away from them Wright held up his hand to me to come over to him and I did, and I saw no more of the jew for that moment.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up to Wright where was Thornbury? - Thornbury was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bundle? - The jew had the same bundle when he came out as he got into the coach with, and John and Charles had nothing about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear to be any thing in that bag as he past by you? - There was something in it before.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the coach to Wright and Thornbury, what they got into the coach with they had not about them, nor was it in the coach? - I did not look into the coach, they had it not about them.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the coach? - The coach then turned away; they discharged the coach.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110150"/>Q. What became of you, and Wright, and Thornbury? - We went to a public house just by, within a few yards of where they got out.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the coach had stood at no particular place, only for the jew to get out? - No, at no door at all; then they went to the public house, and Wright and the landlady's boy went out, and got some beef and ham; Wright was telling me that he expected the jew every moment; in twenty minutes or less the jew came into the house, but had no bag, he had nothing that I saw; Wright asked him to sit down, and he looked very hard at me, not knowing me nor seeing me before, and he sat down; Wright asked him to eat, but he did not, he drank a little, and stopped in the house about a quarter of an hour, and he says to Wright, I want to speak to you; then Wright got up, and the jew and they both went out, and Wright was gone about twenty minutes with the jew, leaving Thornbury and me in the public house; this was between one and two at noon, as near as I can say; then when Wright came back I said, what did the jew say about me, for he seems very much frightened at the sight of me? Wright told me that he told the jew that I was his brother; soon after that they called for the reckoning, and we came away, and coming home we called another coach, about half a mile from this public house, I don't know the name of the street; the jew did not come in any more after he went out with Wright, and we all three got into the coach, and desired the coachman to drive us to the French Horn again; then afterwards at the French Horn they dined and went up stairs, and opened the box, and took the plate that I would not take, and tied them up in a bundle; that was from the box that Wright had left; they then took it themselves, they told me they were going to take it to this same jew that they had taken the other to; he said he was going to take fourteen or fifteen guineas of him when he returned back with this plate that I would not take.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go to look after this jew? - They went out of the French Horn, and I went out with them; they took the plate in a bundle tied up in a handkerchief; before they left me they said if you can get some silks of your master to night do, and the jew will buy them, and we will all set off on Monday or Tuesday next for Margate; which I told him that I should not; I wished them a good night and went home to my master's house; I lost sight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more of them that day or night? - I did not see any more of them till the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been on that Saturday? - I had been after some business in the City and I called at the French Horn, and I asked if either of them young men were at home? I was told one was at home. I went up stairs, and Wright was then in custody of the beadle of the parish; I was coming away, and he said, young man, you seem to know this young man, and I have orders to stop him, and I must stop you too; and I was carried with him to Bow-street, and we were both examined there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of yourself who was the keeper of the house at Limehouse where you went? - No, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Dordy? - Yes, very well; I have known him this nine or ten years; he is a gentleman's servant; I knew him when he was an apprentice, and when he was a master, he was a master baker; I knew him when he lived near Bedford-square, I know him now,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110151"/>he lives with Mr. Appleton, No. 77, Hatton-garden went the next day to Dordy, after he had been with them on Friday, and I called on him to ask him how he did; and he was asking me when I saw Wright.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen Dordy near about the time that Wright had left his master? - A little after I did; the day after I had been at Limehouse and Whitechapel I went to his house, he was a servant to Mr. Appleton, and I went to Mr. Appleton's house where he was a servant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Pray where did you come from? - From Tothill Fields Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been there ever since you was at Bow-street? - I have been there some part of the time that I have been in custody, and some part of the time in Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. So that in short you have been a prisoner ever since the information of your's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I am very sorry that so much good advice as you gave this young man has been thrown away. So he came to see you at Mr. Roach's, you permitted him to sleep in the house, and the first use he made of that indulgence was that he persuaded you to rob your master? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You was quite shocked with that advice? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you declined all further acquaintance with the man? - I told him when he asked me that I should do no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your master? Kick him out of the house? or tell your master's servants? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell any body that he had given you that advice before you came to Bow-street? - I don't know that I did tell Dordy of it.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you kept this snug to yourself. On the second night he came to sleep with you, I suppose you told him as you are a man of this cast, I shall have no more acquaintance with you? - I did not tell him that.</p>
               <p>Q. You permitted him to come and sleep in your master's house the second night? - I did not ask him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell him you are not a fit man to keep me company? - I did not. I asked the house-keeper; I did not let him sleep without leave.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the house-keeper what he had told you the night before? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this robbery of your master's was committed the second night? - The second night he had two pieces; the first night he had none.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray who shewed him where the pieces of silk were? - He went along with me into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. He was the person that took the pieces? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are positive to; your conscience would not let you take them at all? - He took them out of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take them at all? - He took some and I took some.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How came you to tell us that he took the pieces, and you consented? - I said that he took them out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You never gave any information of this business to Mr. Hemmings, or to any of Mr. Hemmings's servants? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew it for the five months that he was there? - I knew it as he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Even on the very day in which he was going, this person shewed you some silver, and you assisted him to take his box out of the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You see it taken out? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you followed it into the coach? - I got into the coach after the box was in.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know a plainer definition of following a box into a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110152"/>coach? - He asked me to come in as I said I wanted to go home.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how often was you examined at Bow-street? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever examined at Bow-street or any other justice's office before? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do you recollect how many examinations you underwent? - There were several examinations, and I don't know how many there were.</p>
               <p>Q. You was examined the first time, did you tell any thing of this story on your first examination? - I don't know whether I did or did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you oath don't you know that you did? - I don't know; I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you reveal this circumstance on your first examination or no? - I don't know whether I did or did not.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was not your second examination finished before you gave any account of this business? - Finished!</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you gone through your first examination before you mentioned even a syllable of this against this man? - As near as I can tell I told them all I knew on the second examination; the first examination was late, and therefore they did not stand to hear but little what I had to say.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that all this happened when you was first examined; had not you got through the whole of your second examination before you gave an account of this business? There is something or other I have got hold of; this examination was put off you say; what about the robbery of your own master? - I don't know whether it was or was not; first of all the foreman came to me on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined relative to the robbery of your own master, when you was examined at Bow-street? - They did not ask me, but I told them.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was not the magistrate going to commit you for trial for robbing your own master, before you said any thing about this business? - They never asked me about my own master's affairs till I told them of this.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not then going to be committed for trial? - I was, but it was on Mr. Hemmings affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Then to save yourself you have discovered other people, to save yourself from being tried? - I accuse nobody but what is true; I knew I had not done any thing with the plate at all, and therefore I had a right to save myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you are not to be prosecuted for robbing your master? - I should not have done any such thing as this if I had not been over persuaded.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you are not to be prosecuted for robbing your own master? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know you are not to be prosecuted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so long before I could get it out of you? You cannot account for delaying your answer so long.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Do you remember what past at the time you was admitted to give evidence? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after being asked several questions you was told that you could not be believed, and you must be put to the bar with these two men? - I never heard any body say so as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you remember when you was asked whether the jew was the same person that got into the coach, did not you say that you did not know him at all, and to the best of your knowledge you never saw him before? - I said I had seen a man a great deal like him if that was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not say, that you could not swear that you had ever seen him before in your life? - I did not say that I could not swear; the justice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110153"/>asked me to look at the man; and I said that I had seen a man a great deal like him; he told me to look at him again; then I said that I did know him.</p>
               <p>Q. You then don't remember that he asked you three or four times before you said that you knew him?</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever tell them that you did not know them? - No, I never said so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Did you or did you not say that you never knew him? what was the first answer you gave? - I said that I had seen a man a great deal like him.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was it between the time that you had seen him on the occasion you have mentioned, and the time he was brought before the justice? - This was on Wednesday, and the Thursday week following I saw him before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at the justice's had you any doubt about him? - I had a right to look at the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You may think that you shall not be prosecuted; but if you do not make proper answers you may find yourself mistaken. When you saw him before the justice had you any doubt about him? I will have a direct answer, yes or no? - I thought I knew him; I had not much of a doubt; I had no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you have a doubt when you had seen him but a week before?</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Why did you tell the justice that you had seen a man a great deal like him? - Wright says to me at the bar, this was not the man, for he had never seen the man before in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. The question they put to you was whether you knew the man? you said that you had seen a man a great deal like him. I only ask you why you said so? - I could not be positive till I had looked at him; I had a right to look at him first, before I said it was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the second time you was examined? - It was the first time I saw the jew.</p>
               <p>Q. You stood as close to him at the time you gave this answer as the next man now that stands by you? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. You may be sure, Mr. Const, that no jury will convict a man on this evidence, except it be corroborated.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that young man at the bar? - That is one of them, and Fisk is the other, there was a third; I carried them to Ludgate-hill, and there they got out and they bought two pair of boots, and I went to Three Colt-street, Limehouse; I stopped at a house there about five doors down behind the church, as nigh as I can guess, and there the two brothers got out, and they ordered me to give them the box out; I carried it out and gave it them into the parlour, and I came out and minded my horses; the two brothers went into the house, they stayed in about three quarters of an hour, and they hallooed coachman to come and take the box in again, they ordered me to go down London-street, Ratcliff-cross, to turn on the left hand, and go to the bottom of the next street on the left hand; then I turned on the right, and went to the bottom of that; then I went to the left into Tiles Alley, to a fireman's, belonging to the Sun Fire office where I stopped; the same two young men got out, and they ordered me to take the box out again; I did so, and put it into the passage of that house, and they stayed in the house about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. After this quarter of an hour had past what happened then? - They called me again to take the box into the coach the second time, and they got into it again.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding to Mr. Hemming. Do you know any other articles that are lost? - Yes, a great many; all the things were not gone out, only the things in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Cope. When did you examine the plate? - When the robbery was made known.</p>
               <p>Q. How many candlesticks were missing? - Four of one sort, worth four pounds; four table spoons, worth three pounds; a silver tankard worth five pounds, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I came from a place called Bedford, in Norfolk; from there I went to counsellor Mingay's service, there I lived near three years; from there I went to alderman Macaulay's; from there to alderman Swain's lady; from there to Mr. Hemming's. In these different places I have given the greatest satisfaction.</p>

               <p>On the 27th of May last, I paid a bank note of the value of a hundred pounds, No. 8,594 to Mr. Chapman, in his counting house; the transaction took up some time, as I had considerable change to take, and when he had done I left the counting-house, and he left the bank note on the bridge of his desk and went out; the desk stands in the counting house, the counting house is a slip taken out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the desk stand so as any body might see the note in the street? - I should think so; it was about a yard and a half from the street; Mr. Chapman had taken down a tin box to give me the change, but whether he put the note there again I am not sure, he put it under a weight on the desk; I then left the desk, and he followed me out of the counting house, but I do not recollect whether he went with me to the street or not; I was returning home from the house of commons about four o'clock that same afternoon, and Mr. Chapman asked me if I could furnish him with the number of the note? I told him I could, and gave it him, No. 8,594.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. I understand it is this, on paying the bank note, you made that memorandum you have now about you? - No, I have only a copy of it.</p>

               <p>Q Did you receive a bank note of Mr. Fludyer on the 27th of May? - I did; as soon as I received the note I put it into a tin box, among a number of other notes, while I was giving Mr. Fludyer change I put this tin box with the notes on the ridge of the desk; when I had given him the change he went out and then the men came in, I don't know whether they were five or six, they engaged my attention by asking for many things which we did not deal in, and particularly engaged my attention, and stood close by the counter, and I believe it might take up about ten minutes when these men went out; and then I returned to the counting house, and looked at the tin box on the desk, and found it was empty of its contents, not the whole of its contents, but part of its contents, about seventeen hundred and twenty pounds; there was a bank note of a hundred pounds; there were bills and notes to the amount of seventeen hundred and twenty pounds; I sent some of my men out a little while, but I found that was of no consequence; I took my bill book down, and took the number of them all, and went away immediately to Bow-street, I have not traced the bank note as yet; I heard of it on the King's birth day; I then went to Bow-street, and I had no knowledge of the prisoner's person; this was between two and three o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of any suspicion of the prisoner at the bar or any body else, go any where with a constable? - I did.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110158"/>Q. Where? - I went to his lodgings in St Mary Axe; he was then in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you went to the prisoner's lodgings? - The 17th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were the prisoner's lodgings? - There was his wife there, and I asked his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear the prisoner say any thing about his lodgings? - I did not; I went there supposing it to be the prisoner's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. And what did you find there? - I went there, looking into his box I found two pieces of hessian cloth; it was in a box under a turn-up bedstead in these lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know to whom that hessian cloth belonged? - I did not know till I ordered the constable to take it home, when it was at home me and the constable compared it together with what I had at home, to see if they corresponded in the cutting and parting, they did exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you enabled to say, from the correspondence of these two pieces of hessian cloth found at these lodgings, that they were your property? - They fitted.</p>
               <p>Court. How long before this day had you seen the hessian cloth together? - I had not seen it in one piece a long time; I don't remember only cutting off eight yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen it in one piece? - Yes; I bought it myself; the piece was upwards of thirty yards, there has been at times cut off more than twenty yards, I never cut off any only eight yards when I bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity did you find at the prisoner's lodgings? - One piece containing about four yards, and the other about two yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they together? - They were in the box together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they seem to tally one with the other? - They did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The piece you found in the prisoner's room is the width of your piece? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is the general width that cloth runs? how many pieces of this had been cut off by your foreman, or by your porters for your use you cannot say? - The foreman is here.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any other reason to say that it is part of that piece than, because it is particularly of the same width? - I have no other reason.</p>
               <p>Q Then all that you can say is that it was of the same width as that you have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was there any other mark by which you knew the hessian cloth? - None but by the cutting off.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you know what warehouse this man was employed in, the bohea warehouse or congou warehouse? - I don't know there is any such distinction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search this man when he went in? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. He may carry in as much tea as he pleased, but they must not carry any out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any tea was lost that day? - I cannot say that.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110160"/>Q. What did you find on him? - I found a bulk between his legs; we said you have got something between your legs that does not belong to you; on this he took out this bag of tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you looked into that bag? - I have; it is congou tea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you know in point of fact whether there is a distinct warehouse for the congou? - No, congou, bohea and greens, are all in the same warehouse together in Fenchurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that tea was lost out of the chests? - It is impossible where there are so many thousand chests open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I shall give the matter just simply as it occurred, and begin with my coming to the warehouse. On the 6th of August I met with a man whom I knew perfectly well, whose name is Underwood; he entreated me much to go with him to drink some brandy and water; I told him I should be too late for the warehouse; he said he had known the time that I would not mind losing a day to go with him; I told him I was now married, and had left off all that sort of fun; you married? says he; yes, I am, says I; then says he, I will give you a portion of tea; he pulled out a bag, and it burst; I said I had got a bag which I usually put my breakfast in, and I put it into this bag, and went into the warehouse. I am in a very disagreeable circumstance; I have been swindled by two attornies out of six guineas, who ought to have subpoened my witnesses, but they have not; but I have those here who will give me a character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

My house was robbed the 2d of July between the hours of ten and two; I have been a widow these thirty years; I have no family nor servant; I left my house at ten o'clock, and was at home by two; when I went out I double locked all my doors, and locked all my drawers, but he had a key to let himself in, he was a lodger in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you entrusted him with the keys of your house? - Nothing but the key of the street door to let himself in with, because his wife said that he must have a street door key, but he had no other keys.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner the last time before your house was broke open? - I saw him the day after, and I saw him on the Sunday before the house was broke open, on Tuesday morning.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had been down to Gravesend along with a young man, and he took his money and he gave me a guinea and some silver; I came from the Gravesend boat, and going along I met that young man and he told me he would give me six-pence; I told him I would not oblige him for six-pence; so with that he gave me a shilling; he wanted me to have connection with him in the street; I told him I would not except he would go home with me; he said then he would be revenged, he called out watch; and said he was robbed; with that I was taken to the watch-house, and the constable of the night took one guinea and two shillings out of my mouth; he gave me the six-pence and the shilling for obliging him, but I would not oblige him in that place.</p>

I have been out of my mind but I was not out of my mind then, I was then as sensible as ever I was in my life; nor was I drunk, I durst not drink a drop of gin ever since my head has been bad.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How did this woman appear when she was brought to you? - She appeared to be sober, and said she was very sorry for what she had done, and if I would let her go she would never come that way again. About two years back I had a shop in Surry-road and she served me just in the same way, and I did not prosecute her then because of the evpence of going to the Guilford assizes.</p>

I knew she had got my money about her, because my purse dropped from her when the constable first took hold of her; it dropped from under her clothes on the flag pavement, but all the property was out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it whole or had it been cut? - It was just the same as I have it in my pocket at this present time, there was half a guinea and four shillings also on the flag stones, the watchman picked it up and gave it into my hand. I see my purse before in the evening about seven or eight o'clock; I had in it two guineas, half a guinea, five shillings and two six-pences; all that I ever recovered was half a guinea and four shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you swear to the money that was found? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the purse? - It is a canvas purse; I have had it seven years at least, it is greasy by my selling pickled salmon and putting the money backward and forward in it; I have no doubt in the least, I am positive this is the purse the money was in; after I had been in the watch-house the constable asked her if she had any charge against me? yes, she said, she had a charge against me for robbing her, so he said then there was charge for charge.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your prosession, what are you? - I am a <rs id="t17930911-103-viclabel573" type="occupation">fishmonger</rs>

               <p>Q. What was it she dropped? - Three shillings; I see nothing else drop, I saw some gold lay on the door way before she dropped the three shillings, the first thing I saw was the gold laying on the ground, it lay on the other side as near as I can guess about a quarter of a yard; then besides this gold, I saw three shillings drop from her, I asked her to give the rest of the money to the man, says she that is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110170"/>all the money I have got, that was all she said then, I took her prisoner to the watch-house and gave her to the officer of the night.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the beadles of St. Andrew's Holborn. I was the officer of the night, it was about half an hour after one the watchman brought that woman down, and then about five minutes after the man came in and charged her with robbing him of two guineas and a half, five shillings and two six-pences; accordingly when he made the charge the prisoner at the bar said you are a d - d scoundrel, and used such oaths as are not fit to be spoken of here, and says you have robbed me of seven shillings and six-pence, accordingly I said there is charge for charge. As Ruff was dry he gave a shilling to send for some drink; accordingly the beer came, says I, you must go to the compter as well as she, without you can send for any house-keeper I know, then he said he could not, therefore I thought proper, for the good of the community at large, to send him to the compter as well as she.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - Four or five years, I have seen her many times at the corner of different courts in the parish and made her go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she examined there? - She was, and there was only six-pence found on her.</p>
               <p>Q. So she gave a charge against this gentleman? - She did, as soon as he gave charge she gave charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober that evening? - Yes, I was quite sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have a perfect recollection of what passed? - I have.</p>


               <p>Q. Have you told us on your oath exactly all that passed? - Certainly, what I have said is truth.</p>
               <p>Q. And exactly in the manner you have described? - Yes, exactly,</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body has given a different account to what you have given they would swear false? - I am certain they cannot give a different account.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you mean to insist upon it that she instantly gave charge of him as he gave charge of her, and if any body has said different they have sworn false? - I have no further to say. When she found that she was going to the counter she downed on her knees and said, what I have said is all false against Mr. Ruff and I hope for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. It has been told, that after the man had made the charge, that you asked her if she had not a charge to make? is it true or false? - I might say so.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by telling me that it all passed as you said just now? as soon as the charge was made by him, did you say what charge have you to make against the gentleman? - I might say so, I cannot recollect my mind now; the watch-house was full of watchmen and patroles, I could not hear myself speak.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. I understood you to say that the officer said immediately as you gave the account of the story, have you no charge against him? - Them were the words he made use of.</p>
               <p>Court to Scott. Was this woman searched? - She was, and there was sixpence found on her, the prosecutor was present and there was several present.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I wished her to be searched in my presence, but they would not grant me the favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110171"/>Court to Prosecutor. Did you keep that money separate that was taken up? - No, I did not, as I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Court to Scott. Do you mean to swear that there was only six pence found? - Only six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what did you mean by not searching her in the presence of the prosecutor? - He said he searched her in the street and found a shilling in a private place.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never said the word that I searched her.</p>
               <p>Court to Buckley. When you was present at any time did that gentleman say that he had searched her in the street? - I did not hear him say that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present at the search? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Scott. Are you in office now? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I assure you that the court will recommend that you be turned out of office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down Holborn and this gentleman was standing at the door and another young woman along with him, directly as I came to the spot the other woman went away, and he catched hold of me, and I told him if he did not let me go I would charge the watch with him; and he said I had robbed him, and he called the watch and said that he had lost two guineas; he was very much in liquor, I was so pulled about that I lost six shillings; I had my witnesses here all day to day, and I did not think I should be tried to night so they are gone; they came as far as Woolwich.</p>
               <p>Court to Buckley. Did you see the purse at all? - Yes, I see it on the ground.</p>

               <p>I saw this prisoner at the bar on board a lighter; he was down the fore scuttle; it was about eight o'clock in the morning he was there some little time, he then came up with a great coat rolled up together, seeing the great coat rolled up in that manner I supposed that he had something that he should not have, the lighter was loaded with sugar; he put his great coat down and sat there for some little trifle of time and at last he came on shore, when he came on shore I stopped him and asked him what he had got there in his great coat? he told me he had got some scrapings. I told him if he had nothing but scrapings I had nothing to do with it, but I must be satisfied, accordingly I took the handkerchief from his great coat, and it proved to be clear sugar, he had seven pounds; I then took him to the compter; another person and I went on board the lighter about an hour after, and found an hogshead broke open and plundered, and we found an handkerchief containing a quarter of an hundred in a locker on board of the lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know to whom it belonged? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What name was there at the lighter? - The Brothers I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. The owner's name is always on the lighter? - I don't know that the name is on a key lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiries about who the lighter belonged to? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has this lighter property of different people on board? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the lightermen answerable for the property? - I understand it as such; we reckon it always as belonging to persons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110172"/>unknown until it has passed the King's beam.</p>
               <p>Q. If a lighter has any name on it is there any difficulty to find out the owner? - No, I don't say that it is, but that is not our business.</p>

               <p>I am a journeyman baker to Mr. Wright. I lost a wooden basket, seven quartern loaves and two three-penny loaves; on Thursday between four and five in the afternoon the 22d of August, I left my basket on a pitching block which projected out from an oil shop window, the corner of Mr. - 's gateway; I brought about twenty quarterns out, and a small basket and a large basket; in the mean time while I was gone to serve my customers with some bread which I carried in the small basket this large one was missing. I looked about for my basket, and I saw the man with the basket going down Whitechapel with it on his shoulder, nearly three hundred yards from where I left it; there were seven or eight, but I swore to seven quarterns and two threepenny in the Basket; I knew my basket again immediately, he said if it was mine I might take it; I knew the basket by carrying it so long a time, there was no name upon it, nor no mark, I had used it about three months, there were three loaves missing which he said he had taken to some butcher's, but he could not tell me where, I only found four quarterns and two three-penny in the basket, there were three quarterns gone nothing else, I knew the bread to be mine by making of it and baking of it; I had not observed any thing remarkable on it; from thence I took him home to my master's, and gave charge of him; I cannot say I ever see the prisoner before to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I gets my daily bread in the street, I sell fish. On the Thursday afternoon coming from my employment, I saw two three penny loaves laying in the kennel, a woman present went and took the two three-penny loaves out of the kennel and was wiping the bread, when the prisoner came up, and took the bread out of the woman's hand, and said I will take care of the bread; immediately the woman said he ought to be ashamed of himself to leave the bread rolling about the street, he made answer he had been over to a butcher's shop with a couple of quartern loaves, he borrowed a knife of me to trim the bread, and was going to tumble it into his basket, I told him it was not yet fit for sale, and I took and trimmed it for him, as soon as the bread was fit for sale, as I thought, he tumbled it into his basket, takes the basket up and said he was going to Mile End turnpike with it, in so doing I put my basket on my head and walked behind the man to the distance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110173"/>of between two or three hundred yards, he kept saying he was going to carry it to Mile End turnpike to one Thomas's, whom he said was very much intoxicated with liquor, and unable to take care of his bread; and he said that this Thomas had entrusted him to go and fetch the bread and basket to him; when he was overtaken with the basket by Fray, he he comes up and says halloo my friend, where are you a going with that, that is my property, by Jesus says he, if it is your property take it; I was present and he pitched the basket down, on which Fray said to him as you have carried it so far you may as well carry it a little farther take it up again, on which he did, and followed him to Mr. Wright's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Fray in the presence of the prisoner say to whom the bread belonged? - Fray claimed it as his property, or as his master's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not a man come up to me at the time and ask me to sell the bread, I said I would not sell any of it, but I would bring it to the man who entrusted me with it; this man came and asked me this question at the time I was cleaning the loaves. I am a stranger just come from the country; I accosted this man who had the basket, and I asked him if he could help me to a master, he told me he could if I would assist him to carry the basket.</p>

             fifteen pounds on account to pay to him, sometime in the month of April last.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next thing done by him when you had given him the fifteen pounds? - He brought back to me a receipt signed Howis, by which I supposed he had paid according to which I had given him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the particular directions you gave him at the time you put the fifteen pounds in his hands? - I ordered him to pay so much on account to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever paid money to Howis before? - I told him to pay to Mr. Howis fifteen pounds on account of the thirty, and this was the receipt he brought back.</p>
               <p>The receipt produced and read as follows:</p>
               <p>"Received April 16th, 1793, of the Hon - ble Gen - ll St. John, the sum of fifteen pounds on account for bills deliver'd for Self and Co.</p>
               <p>Howis."</p>
               <p>The first discovery I made of his not having paid the bills, was on the first of July, when I discovered he had not paid some other bills, I then went to Howis to enquire if he had been paid; I found he had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe during this time the man lived with you, you had some particular instances of his honesty? - I always looked upon him as an honest man till this occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether he did not deliver to you a purse of gold that very likely might have been lost?</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot go into that evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you know a man of the name of Kennedy that was in the habits of seeing the prisoner? - I never heard of such a man.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any demands on General St. John for the fifteen pounds for which the receipt was given and is the subject of the present prosecution? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. You was an oilman, and General St. John was a customer of your's? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Thomson was a butler of his? - He came to my house very often, perhaps once or twice a week during the time the gentleman was in town.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the receipt, is that your receipt? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive about that time any money at all of Thompson, as from General St. John? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that writing any way like your hand? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Does it resemble the hand writing of any of those persons who are employed in your trade? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the prisoner write? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name Kennelly who had been a servant to captain Chinnery? - I know two persons of the name of Kennedy.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. General St. John whom I had the pleasure to serve at that time, gave me thirty pounds and some other money to pay some bills; fifteen pounds I was to pay Mr. Howis oil man of Germain-street. Fifteen pounds on account of bills delivered to Mr. Barnett of the Haymarket; I believe this was on a Tuesday in April; and I had also to pay some other bills that were then due; there was a person named Kennelly called on me that morning; he was formerly servant to Mr. Chinnery; I had been in Bath different times along with that man, we had been three or four seasons successively together; this man being out of employ at this time, and as I was going out with different tradesmens bills, and as I wanted to go to several places, I asked him to go and pay two or three bills for me; the one was to Mr. Hall, and the other was to Mr. Howis; accordingly I had some business at the bottom of James-street, and an order down in Pallmall; I went from there to Mr. Barratt's, I paid fifteen pounds on account there at the same time I delivered that bill. This man comes to me at the bottom of the Hay-market, at the sign of the Swan; a person was present who see him deliver the bill to me as paid, and likewise he told me that he had paid sixteen shillings for half a dozen packs of cards, I did not suppose but that the sixteen shillings was paid for the cards, neither did I suppose but what that bill was paid, or certainly I should have made very particular enquiry, and got it settled. General St. John generally paid the yearly bills soon after Christmas; had I had the least suspicion that that bill had not been paid it would have been a great obstacle on my mind, very interesting indeed; for I did expect that the General would send for Mr. Barratt, Mr. Howis, and other tradesmen for to pay them. I honestly declare that I thought the bill was paid, neither did I know to the moment the charge was made against me. I must rely on your lordship, and the mercy of the jury. Had I the least probability that the bill had not been paid, I would never have suffered it to have gone so long and not to have paid it, for I really considered the General every day would have settled these bills, but I most assuredly knew nothing that the bill was not paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110178"/>Court to General St. John. When this matter broke out, did the prisoner at the bar set up that excuse that he has now mentioned? - No, he never told me a word of it at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The reason was, I was so flurried in my mind that I did not think of it till I saw the charge made against me as a commitment.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him an undeniable character.</p>

On the 20th of July, being Saturday evening, about ten o'clock I had occasion to go that way to Leadenhall; I was in the street, and going past Mrs. Beard's door, I saw the prisoner and another man reconnoitering the door way; it struck my recollection and gave me a suspicion that they had intent to rob the house; I watched them, I turned back and they were just behind me, I got a glimpse of them; I did not take any particular notice, least they should do me an injury; I crossed the way opposite to Mrs. Beard's house with an intent to alarm the family, that there were some suspicious people at the door, and to take care of their property; just as I got across the way I had not time to inform them before the prisoner and the other were at the door, I saw one man, I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or the other go into the shop while the other stood on the step, and fetch out some bed furniture; I did not know then what it might be; they walked away both together towards Lime-street; I directly ran across the way as they came from the door, and informed them that two men had robbed the shop, the shop was a being shut up, the door was open and the man was gone in for another shutter I believe; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110179"/>ran immediately after the prisoner, and they followed me, just as we got to the corner of Lime-street, they were just turned into Lime-street, one with the furniture under his arm; we went up to them to know what they did with that furniture; the one that had not the furniture parried several strokes at me by way of keeping me off, and they found they could not keep the furniture he dropt it on the ground, they made an attempt to get away, but I never quitted them, they tried by knocking us about; I never lost sight of them after they committed the robbery, I called out thieves, least we might not secure the prisoners; some people came running, and I took hold of one side of the prisoner, and another person of the other side and secured him, the other made his escape; he was among the people; had I any body with me that I could have consided in we could have took both; the furniture was picked up by somebody, it is in the possession of the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner out of your sight from the time you first saw him? - He was out of my sight after the furniture was stole, but not after the furniture was dropped. We brought him back to the house, and that is all I know of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - He said something to the purpose that he was not the man, but I cannot swear that he was the man that dropped the furniture, but he was one of the two men that had got the furniture.</p>

When was the first day you see Innis, did you on the 26th of July see Innis and Burn both of them? - I had orders to go to Bow Church-yard at five o'clock in the morning, as I was to bring a bundle from Burn; I did go on the 26th of July, and there I saw Innis and Burn; I was to have a bundle from Innis at five o'clock, but I had it not; but at half past five I had these cases both from Innis and Burn; I went at five and I had them at half after five.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any body near the cart? - I never see any body meddle with it; I ran down Ivy-lane, I enquired of the watchman if he see any body come along with a sliver laced hat, he said he had just seen two men come a pace; then I went on directly into Newgate-street, and I asked the watchman at the corner, and he said he saw two men with something under their arms, and I went on down further, and asked of a watchman and he said there were two men just gone into the market, and one of them had something under his arm, I asked him if he would go into the market with me? he said he would follow me, and before we got into the market we met the two men coming out, that he said were the men that went in, and I took the man that had the hat, myself, who is the prisoner that stands there, he was coming out of Newgate-market, I stopped the prisoner, I asked him if he had not got a hat belonging to me? he said no, I said if you have not got him you know where he is, with that the watchman that stood by said, I don't know what we can do in it; then my lord I should have let the man went, but he said I had better been in Paternoster-row than holding him by the collar, and that gave me a greater suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from your waggon? - This was in Rose-street, and my horses were down in Paternoster-row.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing about Pater-noster-row? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your hat? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Which way did they run? - They ran up to the top of Ivy-lane into Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of these men? - No, I did not, I know the prisoner, he was the person that had the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that, was it light enough? - Yes it was quite a moonshine morning, I saw the men.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw two men run up Ivy-lane into Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them afterwards, did you see them stopped by the waggoner? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man that was stopped by the waggoner was the same man that run by with the hat? - Yes, it was a very few minutes afterwards.</p>

I said I had not, and he brought this gentleman, and he said he had lost a hat, he said if I would tell him where it was he would let me go; I told him that I wanted to go about my business.

               <p>I am a city Constable. On Friday the 12th of July last I was in Smithfield, between six and seven in the evening, I saw a horse get his leg entangled with a hackney coach, there were several boxes in the coach; I ordered the coach door to be shut, and the boxes were secured; after that was done I saw the prisoner at the bar pick this here young man's pocket of a silk handkerchief; I immediately seized the prisoner and tapped the young man on the shoulder; I am positive I saw it taken out of his pocket. The prosecutor did not pretend there was a hole in his pocket then. He swore to it by several marks. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is hard to swear to an handkerchief after it has been out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any handkerchief in your pocket besides your own? - It was not my own handkerchief; I had an handkerchief of this kind in my pocket of one William Sibley's; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Newman. That is the handkerchief the prisoner took from him, and he swore to it at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going from Clerkenwell-green to Newgate street; I stopped to see this horse in Smithfield, and this gentleman laid hold of me, and said that I picked that young man's pocket of an handkerchief, and I never touched the handkerchief in my whole life; I have got people to my character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his character.</p>

I told him yes; says I, I have got no loaf left but a three-penny one; says he give me that; I goes behind the counter and gives it him; he asked me if I sold cabbages? I said, yes; he said, give me a cabbage, and I gave him a cabbage; he asked me what they came to? I told him the cabbage was three halfpence and the loaf was three-pence, four-pence halfpenny in all; he gave me half a crown; I thought by the feel of it in my hand it felt very light; I took up the candle to look at it, and I went to rub it, and as I went to rub it he gave me a blow on my breast, and said don't rub it I will change it for you; with that I asked him how he dare use me so? a woman came in and went between him and me, but what passed between them two I don't say; the woman went out again directly, I did not see what passed between them, but he kept the loaf under his arm and cabbage, but he began to ill use me very much with his tongue; so I sent for an officer and had him taken up as he did not give me the goods nor the money.</p>

               <p>On the 28th of July, Sunday, I happened, by mere accident, to go into this shop to buy some cucumbers, and while I was there buying some things, the prisoner at the bar came in, and bargained for a loaf and cabbage, and he offered a half crown as I suppose, and the woman offered to try it, and he refused to have it offered to be tried whether it was good or not, and he pushed his hand against her breast and said if she did not like it he would change it; a woman came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed? - She held up her apron in this manner, and he emptied some money out of his pocket, which appeared to me to be silver, and which I wondered at, because he looked like a poor man; with that Mr. Lowe came, and he went for the constable. It appeared to be money to me, it might be good money for what I know of, but she received it and went away with it.</p>

               <p>On the 28th of July I was the officer of the night at our watch-house. About ten o'clock in the evening a charge was brought to the watch house for an assault and uttering a bad half crown; I had the prisoner then in custody; having of him in custody I wished to know where he lived, I found out where he lived in a minute, I went to his house and I ordered one of our patroles to attend the house; another person resumed the name of his wife, and I secured one woman and I got admitted into the house, and he told me it was his house, and going into the house I found several pieces of money in a cupboard. (The half crown produced that he had of Mr. Lowe.)</p>

               <p>I have looked at the money, it is counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor sent for my wife and persuaded the poor thing to give her some money, a guinea and a half, and after she had taken it she said she would come and get me discharged by the alderman. I was very much in liquor when I went into her house, and if I had known I should have been tried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110191"/>I should have prepared for it; if you will stop half an hour I will send for witnesses. As to this cupboard where this money was found it was for the use of all the lodgers to put their bread in. Ask my prosecutor whether or no she was not going to bail me herself? - No, no such thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did he say he wanted the second for? - He spoke of it as part of them that he wanted before; he came within half an hour of the time that he said he would.</p>

               <p>Smith. They are Mr. Patrick's, I marked them myself, I gave them both to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, previous to my receiving the kettles of Mr. Patrick's man I had been lame almost for the space of three months, totally incapable of getting my bread, which had reduced me to a deal of distress and poverty, which was the total cause of my acting in such an atrocious manner; it being the first offence I beg for the mercy of the Court.</p>
