I did not miss the goods till next morning between nine and ten o'clock; the young person, my assistant, Elizabeth Johnson, missed her cloak, which could not be found; there were about thirty dozen of tapes upon the counter, and upon examining them I missed four dozen and a half; I had just marked them when the prisoners came in, and I knew that no other persons, but the prisoners, had been near that part of the shop; I then got a search-warrant, I went with an officer, and found the prisoner, Elizabeth Price, who said, her husband was behind the bed; where we found the prisoner, Slithe, and in a box, we found a part of the tapes; the officer found some duplicates in a tumbler, and upon taking down the tumbler, the officer found a duplicate of a cloak.</p>
               <p>Court. The cloak is not in this indictment.</p>
               <p>Patten. We then went to Deptford, where we found the remainder of the tapes, at the house of the elder woman, Mary Price; there were fourteen pieces, and the officer brought them to town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. There was another person, of the name of Nicholson, with them? - A. Yes; he was discharged by the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Slithe's house, the woman at once told you, my husband is behind the bed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They lived together as man and wife? - A. They were certainly in one apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the old lady's house, did she not tell you that you were extremely welcome to search all over the house? - A. That she certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you made a considerable search about the house without finding any thing? - A. At first we did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the old woman say, there is one room in the house that I have not been in since my poor husband's death, and you have not searched that room? - A. No; she said, to the officer, there is a room up stairs, but there has been nobody in it for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that the room in which you found the tapes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the old woman, herself, direct you to the room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found that she had lost her husband? - A. Yes; on the Monday as they came to our house on the Tuesday, I thought it a very shocking affair.</p>
               <p>Q. She paid you for all that she bargained for? - A. Yes; she bought a black bonnet and some black crape.</p>
               <p>Q.Articles which were necessary for mourning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That which she bought, I believe, exceeded in value what was taken from you? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not her daughter come in while you were in the house? - A. Yes; she said, she had had it from her sister Slithe, that she had given it to her; and the old woman said she knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q.In what state did you find the tapes at the old woman's? - A. In a paper which had my private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no private marks upon those you found at Slithe's? - A.No; the papers were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the old woman bear a good character in the neighbourhood? - A. I have heard quite the contrary this morning, from a man that lodged in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were there in the shop at the time? - A.There was the young person, Elizabeth Johnson, my wife, and my son.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street; On Wednesday the 13th of February, the prosecutor came to the office for a search-warrant; I went with him to No. 1, Rupert-square, I asked the woman that kept the house what room Slithe lived in; she directed me up one pair of stairs; I knocked at the door, and Mrs. Slithe let me in, or a little girl that was there, I am not certain which; I asked her if she had a husband; she said, yes, he was behind the bed, dressing himself; there was a screen placed round the bed to hide it; he came out from behind the screen, and I knew him; I told him I had a search-warrant; he said I was very welcome to search; I then went round the bed to search the bed, but found nothing there; I then looked under the foot of the bed, and saw a trunk there, I listed up the lid of the trunk, and there I saw some tape; the prosecutor looked at it, and said, that is part of the tape, (produces it): I then looked round the room, and in a tumbler I saw some duplicates, I took down the tumbler, and took out ten or twelve; I laid them down upon the table to see if any of them led to any thing that I wanted; one was for a cloak pawned for twelve shillings; when I laid them down, Slithe took up that duplicate, with some more of them, and looked over them; I desired him to give me that duplicate; he did not consent to that, but put it into his mouth, trying to swallow it; I put my hand to his throat, and he put it out again; then I took him into custody, and desired the prosecutor to bring his wife, which he did, and they were fully committed.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are the numbers of my tapes, but they have no marks upon them, they are too narrow to be marked; here are two dozen of No. 13, and three pieces of 139.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Griffiths.) When these tapes were found, did Slithe say where he had them from? - A. He said they were his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he had bought them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The wife told you at once where her husband was? - A. She certainly did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any person with a chest of tea that way? - A. No, I returned, and Samuel Mercer pointed out to me the chest of tea being put into a coach the other side of the way; I went over along with him, and the coach door was then shut; the prisoner at the bar was then standing by the coach door, I did not see any other man with him; he was going off, and I ran after him and caught him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you then open the coach door? - A. It might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay by the coach the whole time after you had caught him, till you saw the chest of tea? - A. No, I did not; I afterwards saw the chest in the coach, (the chest of tea produced); it is directed, S. Godfrey, Gedney; it was to go by the Lincoln waggon; it is the same chest that I had left in my cart; the prisoner said, what do you lay hold of me for; I told him he was the man that had got my chest of tea; he said, no, he only assisted in helping it into the coach.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What were you doing between the time that you had caught the prisoner, and the time you saw the chest of tea? - A. I was holding him till the constable came, and then I put him into the coach with the constable and the tea, and they went away in the coach together; I went after my horse and cart.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you at any time, and when, lose any carpeting? - A. Yes: On the 18th of January last, I was sitting in the accompting-house with Mr. Swift about a quarter before six o'clock in the evening, and happening to look towards the door, I saw a man with a piece of carpeting upon his shoulder, just going out of the door; I immediately ran out of the accompting-house, and followed him across the way; as soon as I had got up to him, I laid hold of the piece of carpeting, and he let it fall from his back, and ran away; I hesitated some time whether to follow him or take up the carpeting, but I took it up, and I immediately observed a man lay hold of his collar.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who was the man that laid hold of him? - A. Dowsett, the Bow-street officer; he secured the prisoner, and brought him over, and I the carpeting; we took a coach, and went with him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you seen that piece of carpeting that day in your shop? - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of it was there? - A. Twenty-eight yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of it? - A. It was valued at four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the shop was it at the time you saw it first? - A. When I saw it first, it was on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you form any distance how far it was from the door? - A. It was some distance from the door when I saw it in the morning, about twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the prisoner to the door when you first saw him with the carpeting on his back? - A. He was just going out of the door when I saw it first.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course you did not see him take the carpeting? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You only supposed that it was the prisoner? - A. It was the same person at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say, you were some distance from the house when the prisoner was stopped? - A. Just across the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons may you have employed in your shop? - A. At that time there was only me and Mr. Swift in the shop; it was almost dark.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this carpeting being stolen from these persons, the prosecutors? A. Yes, I do; about a quarter before six on the 18th of January, in the evening, I was passing by Mr. Hurley's shop, it was then dark, there was no light in the shop at all, I observed the door of the shop standing a little way open, and a man standing at the outside of the shop tapping at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the prisoner? - A. No, not the prisoner, another man; I went about ten yards from the door, and waited to see the event of it; I immediately saw the prisoner come out of the shop, and run directly across the way with the carpeting upon his back; I observed somebody pursue him out of the shop; the man that was standing at the shop window likewise followed; I crossed over the way before the prisoner could get across, and met him; Mr. Hurley seized the carpeting upon the man's back, and I immediately seized the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was the man? - A. I am confident of that; he scuffled, and attempted to get away, but I prevented him; the other man disappeared immediately that was standing at the window; then I took the prisoner to the shop, and afterwards to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You naturally had a suspicion that all was not right in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You then saw the prisoner come out of the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200007"/>Q.You were near enough to the shop to have prevented it? - A. I might have gone to the shop door, and have been apprehended the same as the man was.</p>
               <p>Q. But you could have prevented the man coming out if you had gone to the shop door? - A. I could, it was done momentary.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mr. Hurley). Q. Do you recollect in what state your shop door was, whether it was open or shut the last time you saw it? - A. There were two persons came in, but I am not certain who came in last; the door was shut, but I am not sure whether it was latched or not.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Spread-eagle-court, Grays-inn-lane, I follow the market, I sell rabbits; I was coming up Baldwin's-gardens the night this happened, it is next door to the Pea-hen; I saw a crowd of people, and a man laying down in the street, and four or five people hitting of him, and beating of him; I told a little girl she had better go for an officer; I did not know any of those people; I begged his life, and one of them said,"you b-h, does he belong to you?" No, says I, gentlemen, he does not belong to me at all; I knew the man that laid down; I told the girl, if she went down to the White-horse they would find a constable; but they all of them went into the Pea-hen again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (to Callaghan.) Q. You came from Ireland? - A. Yes, I did; the last place I was in, was at Newgrove.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that near Cork? - A. I must come through there to come to England.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you been taken up for any offence since you have been in London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How often have you been taken up? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The question is, have you been taken up since you have been in London? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. For what? - A. The same as for what happened the other night, for people beating me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200009"/>Q.Have you ever charged any other person with robbing you of twenty guineas? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The whole of it was this: you indicted some woman for robbing you of twenty guineas, and she was acquitted? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know there is reward of forty pounds for a person who convicts another of robbing him? - A. I have heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The girl was acquitted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever happen to he taken up for any offence which was alledged you had committed upon a woman? - A. I never heard of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing them at the time a charge of this description was made against you? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, if you think there is a ground to go any further, we will; but there does not appear a ground for charging this prisoner - It appears, this man had been a little noisy in his house, there was a little scuffle, and he threw him down; then, he says, another person came up, and took, according to the witness's account, four pounds three shillings out of his pocket. The whole evidence goes to shew, that the prisoner was doing that which he had a right to do, to turn a man of this description out of his house.</p>

               <p>Q. How many pair of shoes have you missed in the whole, speaking within compass? - A. I cannot say to the number.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any shoes since the prisoner was taken up, that were produced to you by Mr. Lane? - A. Yes. I got a search-warrant, to search the house of the prisoner, and went with the officer, when it was executed; I found there four pair and two odd shoes, in the drawer, they have my mark upon them, and one of the odd shoes had Mrs. Aberdeen wrote in it. The prisoner begged my pardon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise her any thing, or threaten her with any bad consequences, if she did not confess? - A. Not at all, no such words passed; she said, she would make me any restitution, if I would say no more about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. Q. What did you say to her before she begged your pardon? - A. I asked her, how she could do so, to rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell her it would be better for her? - A. No, she said it was from distress; I said, no, Mrs. Compton, it cannot be from distress, because you are a woman of property.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been missing shoes? - A. Upwards of three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner occasionally in your house, superintending the business? - A. Sometimes when we have been busy, she has been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not left her there, confidentially, in your absence? - A. I do not remember Mrs. Hale and I ever leaving the house both together.</p>

               <p>Q. You had an apprentice boy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you left her there to superintend that boy? - A. No farther than to see that he gave an answer, and to call us; I had confidence in the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a great many shoes in your shop? - A. We have between seven and eight hundred at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. The shoes that you found were of a common ordinary pattern, the same as you sell in your shop? - A. Yes, except the two odd shoes, one was a bespoke shoe, and the other a shop shoe.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you say but these shoes had been sold in you shop? - A. I cannot say about that, she has frequently taken out shoes to customers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did she always return those shoes? - A. Yes. An account is always taken of what are taken out, and we reckon them when they come back; if she sold a pair at any time, she brought them back and accounted for them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Q.Have you made any application, or sent to her, since she has been in jail? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are positive of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That four pair, you did not know were missing at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you say when the two odd ones were taken away? - A. I cannot exactly say, but I think it is about a twelvemonth ago; I saw them one day, and missed them the next.</p>
               <p>Q. Of the shoes that you found at the pawnbroker's, would you undertake to say you have not sold those shoes? - A. I cannot say that, if I have, it has been by retail.</p>
               <p>THOMAS-WINDSOR ALLEN sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Lane, pawnbroker, in Drury-lane:(Produces 62 pair of women's shoes); I bought them all of the prisoner, at two and seven-pence halfpenny a pair, sometimes five, and sometimes six pair at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you how she came by them? - A. No, I never asked her that question.</p>

There was some conversation between her and the prosecutor, she begged the prosecutor's pardon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Q. Did he say any thing to her before? - A. He did not. She said, she would make him any restitution. I then secured her.</p>

               <p>Hale.

               <p>Q. Now look at the shoes produced by the pawnbroker? - A. They have my private mark, and many of them have been altered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. Q. You sell a great number of shoes of the same kind in your shop? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>

             sworn. - I belong to the Public-office, at Shadwell: On Sunday morning, the 20th of January, we had notice that Harris's house had been robbed; we went and examined the premises, and found a dustman's ladder against a wall in the public-house yard adjoining Harris's premises, where we found the marks of feet; the adjoining premises had been robbed also; Harris described to us the sort of articles he had lost, in consequence of which we searched after the prisoner, and between eleven and twelve the same morning, Elbe and I saw him coming out of a public-house, the Bull's-head, Ratcliff-highway; he had upon him some of Mr. Harris's property, which I helped to strip off; a silk handkerchief from his neck, and a calico shirt; we took them from him; and on the Monday following, he was examined, and Mrs. Harris swore to the property, and he was committed. I asked him, in the presence of Elbe, the other officer, where he had got this shirt; first he said, he had paid two-pence for the washing of it that morning; I asked him who the washer-woman was; then he said, he had bought it of a man in Rosemary-lane; I asked him who the man was; and then he said, he had bought it in a shop in Rosemary-lane, but could not tell me the shop.</p>

The prisoner had worked for a dustman in the neighbourhood.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner? - A. No, he was an entire stranger to me; the first time I saw him was in my shop, I went towards the shop supposing him to be a customer, and the prisoner hurried out as fast as he could; I pursued him, and caught him at the next house to my own; I took him by the shoulder, and asked him what he had been after; he said, what did I mean; I asked him what he wanted in my shop; he said, he came there to enquire for Jack Cressy; I asked him how he could enquire without speaking to any one; upon that, my brother and I brought him back again to our house; I then missed the till with its contents; I sent for an officer, and he was taken to the watch-house, but nothing was found; there had been nobody in the shop to the best of my knowledge, from the time I had been in the shop, about five minutes before, till I saw him; I kept looking all the time; nobody else could have done it, in my opinion.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PUFF sworn. - I was going into Mr. Jarvis's shop, and saw the prisoner at the bar come out with the till in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner by sight before? - A. Yes, there was another man just by the door; he then went a little way from Mr. Jarvis's shop, and the till was exchanged from one to the other.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I helped my brother the next morning to take the till out of a pond just before my house; he was going to work in the morning, and saw it there, (produces the till): I can swear to this being my till.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The person I was enquiring after was John Cressy, who lived in that neighbourhood, and was well known to Mr. Jarvis to be a man of good character; I went into Mr. Jarvis's house to enquire, but seeing nobody in the shop, I turned out again with intent to enquire at the next door, when Mr. Jarvis laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t17990220-12-verdict63" type="verdictDescription">

             is my late wife's mother; she lived with me and my wife before my wife's death and since, to take care of my family and my property; I paid her no wages; at that time I kept a grocer's shop; I left her in care of the shop while I was on duty, and on the 4th of September she left my house, and left some duplicates on the chest in my sleeping-room; I examined the house, and found the property mentioned in the indictment gone; I missed the things the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. They might have been taken at different times? - A. Yes; in about two days, or thereabouts, I saw her again, and took her to Mr. Morritt's shop, a pawnbroker; the duplicates were some of them Mr. Wright's, and some Mr. Morritt's, where I found most of the wearing-apparel; I let her got then, because I had not the duplicates of all the property I missed.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you let her go, if you supposed she had robbed you? - A. I was in hopes of discovering the rest; I did not see her again till she was taken up, the 8th of this month; I went for an officer, and took her up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where to find her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then can you give any reason for letting her go the first time, if you did not know where to find her? - A. One of my neighbour's children told me where she was; she was taken before the Magistrates at Queen-square. (The property was produced).</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against the prisoner, Darking? - A. She lodged in one of my rooms, and some of the things were pledged by her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Darking entrusted with any of your things? - A. No further than the goods in her room.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner, Powell, in the parish workhouse, and I apprehended Dorking at her own lodgings, in the serjeant's house; I searched her, and found some duplicates upon her, (produces them); she gave them to me very freely, and said, she had them from Mary Powell.</p>
               <p>Powell's defence. I had this house to take care of; he had but thirteen shillings a week, and I had six shillings a week to pay out of it, and there was hardly any thing in the shop when my daughter died; they were obliged to pledge things to support the family; I have redeemed them, and pledged them backwards and forwards, it had cost me three shillings a week to pay interest; I thought I had as great a right to the property as him; there was nothing there that was of his buying.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Cutler). Q. You were married to the woman that is dead? - A. Yes, and these things were all bought after we were married, except two candlesticks.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the shovels that were brought back to your house the same that you had lost? - A. Yes, they were. When we had got some distance towards the Police-office, I saw the prisoner running back again towards my house, with a drawn knife in his hand; he had made a clear way as he passed the middle of the street, and I gave him way too.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of knife was it? - A. A small clasp knife. I then turned round and followed him; after running some distance, he turned up a passage, called Smith's-place, that was no thoroughfare; he came back again down a court, and brandishing his knife about, he cleared the place again to let himself out; he then ran down Wapping, towards the Police-office; he then turned up a place, called Russell's-buildings, and I saw a Mr. Calmer standing at his door with a hair broom in his hand; when he had gone past Mr. Calmer, I snatched the broom out of his hand, and knocked the prisoner down; at that time he had his knife drawn in his hand; I had caught hold of his left hand which had the knife in it, but could not get it from him; several other neighbours then came up, and what with holding him down by the hair of his head, and otherwise ill using him, after about ten minutes trouble, we got the knife from him, and secured him; I went to the Police-office, got some officers, and they took him to the Police-office.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the Bell, in Cecil-court: About a quarter before nine, I sent my boy out with a pint of beer; I went to the door, and observed a man in a sailor's dress at my window, who gave a hem to the prisoner at the bar, who was then in Mr. Crisp's shop; I immediately looked in at Mr. Crisp's shop, which is opposite to me, and saw the prisoner slide the bacon off the board down by his side; I heard him say to Mr. Crisp, if I like your bacon, I will call again; he then came out to the door, and this piece of bacon sell from him; I picked it up, and told Mr. Crisp of it; the prisoner then ran away; Crisp and I followed him and took him, about twelve yards from where he dropped the bacon; it is a narrow passage, and there was a great deal of snow upon the ground; he denied taking the bacon, but afterwards told me, if I would forgive him, he would tell me where it laid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him, it would be better for him to confess? - A. No; I told him he should go to the watch-house; he said, he had a sick father, and went down upon his knees to me, and begged I would set him at liberty; Mr. Crisp and I then took him down to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Crisp.) Had you such bacon as that in your shop? - A. Yes; I missed it immediately upon my neighbour's coming over to me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. It is not the bacon you cut the rasher off? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you liable to make it good, in case it should be stolen from you? - A. No doubt of that. The prisoner at the bar went through the passage into the yard, and took it; my wife went into the passage, and detected him with it under his coat; I was called, and when I came into the passage, I took hold of him likewise; he had the gown then, it was a pattern that I can swear to, for I never had a gown of the pattern in my life. I sent for an officer to take the prisoner in charge, and delivered the gown to him. He begged I would let him go, but I told him, I had been robbed so many times before, that I would not; I had been almost ruined, me and my family, by it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing in the course of the night? - A. Yes, I heard a garden-pot, that stood in the cellar-window, come down with a heavy found, about ten minutes after I had been in bed; I did not get up, I thought it had been my children above, I thought they had pushed the headboard out of the bed; I got up the next morning about eight o'clock, I then discovered that the door which comes out of the cellar into my room had been broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you fastened that door the night before? - A. With a bit of a slight bolt, and the staples were forced quite out. The first thing that I missed was my children's clothes, which they had worn before I put them to bed, some of them were up stairs, and some down upon a chair; my children slept in the two pair, and I in the one pair of stairs. The next thing that I missed was my victuals out of the cupboard, and the things mentioned in the indictment, as well as a great many others, Last Wednesday I was going down into Wapping, and happened to see a child belonging to the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200020"/>soner, he lived about a quarter of mile from me; the child had on a coat, a waistcoat, and a pair of trowsers, belonging to a dress of my children's; the coat and waistcoat belonged to one child, and the trowsers to another.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she give you any reason why she would not pawn it herself? - A.No, she said she was rather fatigued, and if I would take it she would pay me for taking it; I pawned it for three shillings; I gave the money to the prisoner immediately I came back, and the duplicate.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you pawn any thing else for her? - A. Yes, soon after that I pawned a gown.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after? - A. I cannot justly say the time, but it was in the course of the month she came and asked me if I would go and pawn a gown for four shillings; it was a stripe coootn gown; I asked Mr. Chandler four shillings for it; I took nothing else at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose name was that article pledged? - A.

               <p>SAMUEL HAMILTON sworn. - I am an officer: On the 1st of the present month I went to the prisoner's apartments, in John-street, New-road, near Lisson-green; I saw the prisoner lodging in a garret at No. 3; I told her my errand, and I searched her, the prosecutrix was with me, and I found a duplicate of a pair of gold ear-rings that referred me to Henshaw's, High-street, Mary-le-bonne, I think she said they were her own; I searched the room, and found two gowns, half a shawl, and some other small articles, which were claimed by the prosecutrix, and a cloak and a cap, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Henshaw's shop for the earrings? - A. I did not go myself; I caused him to appear at the office.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Henshaw). Do you know the person who pawned the ear-rings with you upon the 26th of January? - A. No; but this is the duplicate; it is in the name of Frances Robins.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutrix). Look at that sheet - do you know that sheet to be your's? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any letters upon it? - A. None at all, but it is my own, work, I bought it and made it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that part of the things left in your drawers? - A. Yes, it was one of the articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the tea-spoon, gown, and curtains? - A. I can swear those are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to the cradle-quilt and piece of cotton, are these articles your's? - A. That is a piece of cotton belonging to the gown I have on, and the cradle-quilt is also mine.(Hamilton, the officer, produced a gown and several other articles).</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix, These are all mine.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Look at the ear-rings - how do you know them to be the same? - A. By the make of them; I have had them these twelve months.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200026"/>Q. What is become of your brother, whom you left in charge of your apartments? - A. He lives in Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not bring him? - A. I had no orders.</p>
               <p>Prisoners defence. I was at the house of the prosecutrix three or four days with Mr. Clark, her brother, and he shewed me a paper, and said his sister had made every thing over to him, and in case he should be called on for rent, that he had toleration to sell every thing, and he asked me if I would go and pawn some things for him; I went and pawned a petticoat, and Mr. Clark, and his wife, pawned several things, to my knowledge; and the things I took to Mrs. Prince, I told her where they came from; and she said, she knew Mrs. Thomas very well indeed; I told her the circumstance that Mr. Clark had related to me concerning Mrs. Thomas making the goods over to him; and Mrs. Prince said, it was no matter if Mr. Clark did sell all the things, because his sister was such an infamous woman, and she deserved it. I never saw the drawers open; the ear-rings which that woman has sworn to are mine; I was with the Marchioness of Abercorn, as nurse to her ladyship, and I gave half-a-crown for them to Mary Stevens, one of the house-maids; I never could pawn them but for a shilling; I never was in the house one night, and I never took any thing out but when they were present; I have no more to say.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prosecutrix.) Q. Now tell us about this paper that the prisoner has talked of? - A.That never was any thing of consequence at all; I had offered them my rent four times over; I told my brother if any body trouble you I will make the goods over to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make over to your brother all those articles? - A. No, only a few things in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make over any of those things you have lost? - A. No.</p>

The Saturday before Mrs. Quinn died, I saw her walk down the court, about four o'clock, she appeared to be then very well, the same as usual, with a handkerchief tied round her head; I heard some words between them; she desired him to let her in; he replied, no, you vagabond w-e; and soon after somebody came to buy a rabbit or a sowl, and she got in with a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that customer a man or a woman? - A. I cannot rightly tell. A little after that, I heard something fall in his house, but what it was, I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear or see any scuffle between them before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the sound resemble? - A. Like some great noise, as if something fell down stairs; it appeared to me to be upon the stairs; a little after that, in about six or eight minutes, I heard the deceased groan very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, upon that, offer to go in? - A. No; I did not see her after that; she died about six o'clock.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Hemmings-court, nearly opposite the prisoner; I am a greengrocer: I went to the prisoner's house, about six o'clock on Saturday evening, before Mrs. Quinn died; I had heard of the groans of the deceased, and I went to the house, and found Mr. Quinn sitting by the fire. he appeared to be asleep.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he sober? - A. He was sober enough to give me a sensible answer, to all appearance; I asked him, how his wife did; and he told me, she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200028"/>was very poorly; I asked him, if I should make her a bason of tea and bring her over; he told me, that she never drank tea in the afternoon, and if I made it, she would not drink it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that was so, had you ever been used to drink tea with her of an afternoon? - A. No, never. As I stood at the bottom of the stairs, I heard her say, in a very low, faint voice, take me up, take me up; she appeared, from her voice, to be in a very low state. I asked him again, if I should make her some tea; and he said, no, she will be better by-and-by, I will not have her disturbed; and then I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not offer to go up? - A.No; as he said, he would not have her disturbed, I did not like to make free, and force myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she given to liquor? - A. I never saw her but when she was capable of her business.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see her at all disguised? - A. No. I have seen her out in the country with her husband, and I suspected her husband took her out for the recovery of her health, for she seemed to be in a very bad state of health.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Hemmings-court: The morning before Mrs. Quinn died, about ten o'clock in the forenoon, she sent a girl to beg the favour of me to send to enquire the price of some fowls, for Mr. Quinn had shut her out into the court, and she wanted to get in; I did sent, and she got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her again that day? - A. Yes, a little after eleven; she appeared then in her business, the same as at other times, she complained of a pain in her head, in consequence of the severity and coldness of the weather; the first time I saw her was between eleven and twelve, and then a neighbour had bought a rabbit, and said, come in, we will have a glass together, it is cold, and she had a glass. The Coroner sat upon the body, at my house, the Wednesday following; and this coat and bundle were left with me by Mrs. Quinn, the wife of the prisoner's brother, she is not here; but they were in possession of the officer before that.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Warren.) Had you the possession of this bundle? - A. No, Kennedy had; he is not here.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street: Having heard that the prisoner had absconded, the Magistrate granted his warrant to apprehend the prisoner; I then went to a house in Hemmings-court, to endeavour to find him, but could not hear of him; I went into the Black-horse public-house, kept by the last witness, and, in the back parlour, I saw the undertaker, and the prisoner's brother.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not tell us what they said? - A. I observed the undertaker's man, and the bags there, that was on the 8th; I made the best of my way from there to the undertaker's house -</p>
               <p>Q.Without waiting for them? - A. Yes. When I got to the house, I enquired of the woman there, if she had any knowledge of the prisoner, as to his being in that house; she said, she did not know, but she would go and see; she went up stairs, I followed, and in the back garret I observed the undertaker's man that I had before left at the Black-horse, appearing warm about the face, and rolling up a bed that laid in the room; I looked into that room, and saw no person but the woman and this man; I then seeing another door open, which led to the front garret, I looked in there, I saw nothing but a child sitting by the fire; but the woman who had answered me below, said, the man that you want, is in that room; glancing my eye to the curtains of a half tester bedstead, I saw the curtain move; I pulled it back, and found the prisoner squatted behind it against the wall; he was without his shoes; I then secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. You made the best of your way, you say, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200029"/>this undertaker's house - did you go the nearest way? - A. Not the very nearest way, I believe, but the difference could be but very triffling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the Coroner's Inquest? - A. No; the Coroner had then sat.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the body afterwards, did you not? - A. Yes; by the direction of the Magistrate I went to see the body, and had the coffin unscrewed</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any gentleman of the faculty with you? - A. Yes, a Mr. Hanbury, I believe an apothecary; and, I believe, he has something to do with Tothill-fields prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No; I observed a violent blow on the left jaw, nearly the size of the palm of my hand; another large blow under the right breast; on the left-hand and arm several lesser marks, which appeared as if the hand had been held up; and a discharge of blood from one of the nostrils.</p>
               <p>Q.Was this violent blow likely to occasion death? - A.Of that I am not a sufficient judge to guess; what there was appeared to be very violent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What you are pleased to call blows, are bruises? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How they came there you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Morris, I believe, opened the head, by the direction of the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MORRIS sworn. - I am a surgeon, in Great Marlborough-street: I examined the body of the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, from that examination, what was the cause of her death? - A. I found several marks of violence, but, I think, not such as to occasion death.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you particularly examine the head? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks about the head which were likely to occasion death? - A. No, except the mark upon the jaw, and that was a small bruise only, and nothing likely to occasion death; I am rather inclined to think it was occasioned by a fit of apoplexy.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I am aware of what Dr. Thornton will give as his opinion; but if there is a difference of opinion among medical men in that respect, and the surgeon who saw the body, and saw the bruises, says he did not think any of those bruises occasioned her death, whatever sense we may have of the bad behaviour of the prisoner in beating his wife, still, if that behaviour did not occasion her death, it is impossible for you to declare this man guilty of the murder. Under these circumstances, therefore, I think we cannot press this case against the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q.Was the door open? - A.It was a little open, just room enough to admit his arm, the swansdown laid upon the counter; I caried out, stop, he immediately snatched them off the counter, and ran off with them across the road towards the corner of Middle-row, I was not five yards behind him; he had ran about forty or fifty yards with five or six yards of swansdown hanging behind him; I saw him drop them; a gentleman of the name of Mason picked up the goods; I returned home with the goods, and Mr. Mason with me, the prisoner was pursued by another person; I saw the prisoner again in five or ten minutes, near the corner of Castle-street, in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say, that the man you saw carrying the swansdown was the prisoner? - A. No, I cannot; I can only say the prisoner is the man that was stopped; I delivered the swans-down to the officer, who has it in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us whether Mr. Quinby carried on business on his own account, or whether he had any partner? - A. He had no partner.</p>

               <p>- MASON sworn. - On Thursday evening, the 7th of February, about six o'clock, upon hearing the cry of stop thief, as I was going up Holborn, I perceived a man running with these articles under his arm, four or five yards of it was dragging upon the ground; he was running from Southampton-buildings towards Middle-row; I was running, my foot slipped, it being frosty, upon the curb, or I think I should have caught him; he instantly dropped the goods at my feet, and I picked them up; he ran on past the wheel of a hackney-coach; when I picked up the pieces, I took them to Mr. Quinby's shop, and, in the course of a few minutes, the prisoner was brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the prisoner is that man? - A. From his appearance at the moment of his being brought back I believed it to be the man;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200030"/>and I believe he is now; he had a black handkerchief round his neck, and a dark great coat on.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it then dark? - A. It was dark, and the shop was lighted up; an opposite neighbour informed me that a man had entered my shop, and taken three umbrellas; I was at that time in the parlour, gone for a candle; the man who came to inform me, and myself, immediately pursued the prisoner, and took him; he had two umbrellas in his arms, and one dropped at his feet at the time; we brought him back to my shop, and I sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the property you took from him was your's? - A. I am positive of it; I had them in my hand not two hours before, and had seen them within five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they were hanging up in your shop? - A. They were; as we were taking the prisoner to Bow-street, when we got to the top of Little Whitelion-street, Seven-dials, about a dozen fellows came upon us, and one of the party called out to the prisoner, d-n your eyes, why don't you kick; the prisoner at the bar immediately kicked the constable, and gave me a blow across my breast; and some of the party, at that time, knocked down the constable; I seeing the constable in that situation, continued holding him; I was then struck with a bludgeon, which cut my eye very much; I then received another blow upon my shoulder, which knocked me down, and the prisoner was rescued; after they had rescued the prisoner, they came to me a second time, and cut me across the head with a cutlass, or some sharp instrument, that my life was in great danger for some time, and made use of the expression, blast the b-r, I have done him; I was then taken to a surgeon's to be dressed; as soon as I could, I went to the different Police-offices; and having had him in my hands for forty minutes, I identified him as well as I could; I gave information to Mr. Blamite, at Hatton-garden, and in consequence of my information he was detected; they knew him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I wish to ask Mr. Newton, whether he did not find one of the umbrellas in the grocer's shop? - A. No; he had one under his arm, and the other was under his feet; he endeavoured to throw it down the area, but it did not go down.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN DUDLEY sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Davis, the linen-draper: As I was standing at my master's door I saw the prisoner run away from Mr. Newton's door, and I went after him, and stopped him; he had one umbrella under his arm, and the other was down by him; he had nothing with him when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Q.How far from the shop was it that you took him with the umbrellas? - A. About two hundred yards. (Produces the umbrellas).</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200031"/>Newton. These are my property, they have my initials upon them, they cost me two pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the shop-door open or shut? - A.Shut; I had just served a customer, and shut it after him, and left it so; it has a spring latch, and I am positive it was latched at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door in that sort of security as when you go to bed? - A. Yes, excepting that it was not bolted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Dudley.) Q. Was there not an umbrella found lying upon the grocer's steps? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Newton.) Q. You lost three? - A. Yes; the two that were found upon him, and the one that was upon the grocer's step; he was upon the step when we took him.</p>
               <p>CHARLES SCRANNECK sworn. - I am a parish constable; I was sent for on Friday the 19th, to take charge of the prisoner; as I was going down to Bow-street, Mr. Davis then had the umbrellas, who is not here; and when we got to the Seven-dials, a signal was given by some of the gang, I suppose, to strike; they immediately began to strike, and the man was rescued; the prisoner struck the first blow, and another man knocked me down, but who it was I cannot say; then he got off, but has been retaken.</p>

               <p>Q. As you came through the streets of London, did you observe any thing that drew your attention? - A. Yes, three persons standing together near St. Dunstan's church; two of them were like the two persons at the bar; one of them I know is the same; I did not see the face of the other; they were crossing the chaise, and when we went fast they went fast, when we went slow they went slow; when I got to my lodgings there was a great light, and I could distinctly see the face of Bamber; the chaise went past the door, I pulled down the window to call to the postillion, and while I was doing so, the prisoner came back very near the chaise, to my side, as if to hear what I said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what had become of the other two men? - A. No, I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. After you had got to your lodgings, did you see any more besides Bamber? - A. Yes, five or six of the same description.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Had you gone into your house when you heard the alarm? - A. Yes, I had just got up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any intelligence to Bow-street of what had happened? - A. Yes, and the next morning I was sent for to Bow-street, and there I saw two parts in three of the things I had lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. (For Groves). Q. It was nearly dark when this happened? - A. It was not dark.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Bamber. Q. I beg of the lady to look at me again, and see if you are positive I am the person? - A. I am sure he is the person.</p>

               <p>JANE KIDWELL sworn. - I was in the chaise with Mrs. Perfect; I saw three men crossing backwards and forwards as we came through Fleet-street, but could not distinguish the faces of any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you engaged when you first missed the trunk? - A. I was giving some parcels out of the chaise; I turned my head, and as I got out of the chaise, I missed the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the things the next morning at Bow-street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM EDWARDS sworn. - I am an officer:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200032"/>Between five and six o'clock in the evening, within a very short time after the robbery was committed, in consequence of an information, I and my brother officers went in quest of the trunk, to No. 7, Bowl-yard, St. Giles's; we had not been many minutes in the house, before the two prisoners came in; I seized Groves standing behind the door upon this bundle; immediately upon my seizing him, I took him by the collar, and stooped to lay hold of the bundle, and pulled it from under him, and he was very near being down, but I held him up, and he gave me a violent blow, which made my mouth and lip bleed, and loosened one of my teeth; immediately he had done that, he hoped and prayed I would not hurt him.</p>

               <p>Q. Before he made use of that expression, that he hoped you would not hurt him, bad you opened the bundle? - A. No, I had not; I did not know who it was till I brought him into the light, and then we discovered it to be the prisoner Groves; I did not take the other prisoner; Limbrick secured him; I locked up the bundle in a place in the house, and took the key with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was dark at this time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a lodging-house? - A. It is a house with lodgers in it.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no light in this place? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the lodgers in the house are? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nobody in the passage, except Groves? - A. I found only him.</p>
               <p>Q. But there were other persons found there? - A. Yes, Bamber was found there, but not by me.</p>
               <p>Q. You not knowing who he was, and he not knowing who you was, he gave you a tap in the face? - A. He gave me a punch in the mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search Groves when he was taken into custody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had gone into the house, you might have fell upon this bundle? - A. I should not have been found in such a house with a bundle.</p>

             sworn. - I went with Edwards to No. 7, Bowl-yard, upon an information that we had received, and after searching the house, I stood behind the street door; Bamber was the first that came in, and I took him in custody; I called out for assistance, and he was secured; I was then come out of the house, and stumbled over this bundle lying before the door in the kennel, just off the foot pavement. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to go out of the house? - A. To watch about the door, as we expected more in.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any other persons come? - A.Several more, and we took them into custody, the same as we did the two prisoners.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not see either of the two prisoners bring any thing in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, for any thing you know, it might have been brought in by one of the men who is discharged? - A. I cannot say; several people came in, but we had searched the passage before they came in, and there was nothing there then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search it yourself? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Will you undertake to swear that any of the articles in question were found in that house till after some other persons had come into the house, besides the two prisoners? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an officer of Bow-street; I went with my brother officers to this house in Bowl-yard, about a quarter past six; after we had been in the house about five minutes, I heard a scuffle in the passage, and one of the other officers called out for help; I then went and took Bamber out of the hands of Limbrick into the back parlour; I was then coming into the passage again; and I met Edwards and Groves, as he was bringing him into the passage; Edwards set him down in a chair, and then went into the passage for the bundle; we examined the bundle, and found, from the description that had been given, that they were part of the property that we were after; I searched Bamber, and found several little articles that did not belong to the lady.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not find any thing upon Groves? - A. No; but I can positively say that I was in the passage with a light, not a quarter of an hour before, and there was nothing in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not the first person that apprehended one of the prisoners? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, that person would be more likely to know who came in first? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Several persons had come in before the two prisoners? - A. No, only a man with a crane.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he might have taken the bundles there? - A. No, he was secured before; we searched the passage, and we put the crane up against the door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200033"/>where this bundle was found; it was an hour afterwards that the other people came in.(The two bundles were produced, and the property deposed to by Mrs. Perfect; the property was also deposed to by

               <p>Groves's defence. I was going by this place in Bowl-yard; there is a blacksmith's shop underneath; I had asked him in the day time to mend an old sender for me, and he desired me to call in the evening, which I did; and when I called in the evening, I was laid hold of by these gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Bamber's defence. I went into this shop, knowing it to be an iron shop, I wanted a key for a padlock; I knocked at the shop door two or three times; finding nobody answered, I went to the side door, and when I got into the passage, I met a parcel of men coming out; I stepped back, to let them come out, and they laid hold of me; I am innocent of it; I told the gentleman that laid hold of me, the same, that I was going to buy a key.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Limbrick). Did Bamber say he wanted to buy a key? - A. No such thing; he did not say any thing.</p>

             sworn. - I am a salesman in Whitechapel: On Saturday, the 2d of February, Mr. Siborne sent me a load of hay, between one and two; I went to the lad, and told him his hay was sold, and he must get his horses up, and he missed one of them; I went down the yard, and found the harness, but not the horse; I searched every where, and made enquiries, but to no purpose. On Sunday I went to the Ducking-pond, in Mile-end, there I saw Mr. Monk; he asked me if I had lost any thing; I said, I had lost a horse; he said, he thought so, for he had had two brought to him; she was not in the slaughter-house; I soon afterwards saw her in the stable, and Mr. Monk's man took her to Mr. Simmons's yard, in Whitechapel; I saw her taken there; her fore feet were white, and her near foot behind, and she had a lump under her belly, on the left side. I had seen the prisoner on the Tuesday and Thursday; he used to come up with farmers' teams.</p>
               <p>- MONK sworn. - I am a scavenger and horse-boiler; The prisoner brought me a horse the beginning of January last; he said, he lived servant with Mr. Brockhurst, of Hornchurch; he said, his master had two cast off horses to dispose of, and that he had desired him to call upon me, to know what price I gave for them; I told him, they were very low now, we did not give more than from eighteen to twenty-five shillings a piece for them. He called upon me again on the 2d of February, in the forenoon, about eleven or twelve o'clock; he wanted to know if the lad had not left a horse there; I live at the Ducking-pond, Mile-end; I told him, no; then he said, the stupid blockhead had gone with it all the way to Covent-garden market, and he must leave it as he comes back. In the afternoon, the prisoner returned, leading a mare in his hand; it was an old black mare with a long tail; it had a white foot behind, and white fore feet, and under its belly a lump; he wished me to settle with him directly, for his waggon was gone on a-head; I then paid him twenty-six shillings, and two shillings for himself; he was very particular in having a note back for his master; he said, it did not belong to his master, but to a widow, of the name of Robinson, at Hornchurch; the prisoner gave me his name as John Tower; I gave him this note which I hold in my hand; he said, he was going to call at the Artichoke, in Mileend; I went there with him; he wanted to know if he was not to have something to drink; and just before we got to the door, he said, I can only have a glass, and be off, for my waggon is gone on ahead; I said, no, we will have no drams, we will have something else; I then had an opportunity of speaking to Mr. Beck, who keeps the Artichoke; and, in consequence of what he said, I called the prisoner into a little back room, and told him, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200034"/>thought he had not come honestly by the mare, and I would have nothing to do with it; he said, I had no occasion to be afraid of that, it was Mrs. Tomkins's mare, and he drove Mrs. Robinson's mare; I told him, I doubted it, and he gave me the money back again, note and all, except the two shillings; he said, his master should call for the money; I stepped out to get Mr. Beck to assist me in apprehending the prisoner; and while I stepped on, the prisoner absconded; I looked about the yard and the premises, but could not find him; I heard that he had gone down the road at the rate of ten miles an hour; I made all the enquiry I could to find an owner. Mr. Parsons came to me on the Sunday, and I sent my lad with Mr. Parsons and the mare, and I have not seen her since. On the Monday, a man came to me and demanded the money, not the prisoner, I had him secured, and from him I learned where to find the prisoner; and he was taken up on Monday, the 4th of February, on the other side of Stratford. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOMES sworn. - On Monday evening, the 4th of February, I went with Monk and his brother, to Stratford, and apprehended the prisoner between six and seven in the evening; he confessed he had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made him any offer of favour, or threatened him? - A.Neither.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure the mare that I afterwards saw was mine.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Monk). What is the value of the horse? - A.If it was in market, I don't know that she would fetch above forty or fifty shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was from half past eleven till two, at the Neg's-head, and going home, I saw this horse, and a parcel of boys pelting it with snow-balls and stones, and some people said, it belonged to Mr. Monk; and I led it home to Mr. Monk's, and Mr. Monk desired me to take it over to the yard; and there I left her, and went about my business.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Your uncle, James Russel, is the agent? - A. He is property the agent; I reap no emolument, and I am not responsible; my name is in the power of attorney.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you ever see the prisoner at the bar? - A. I have seen him four times; The first time I saw him was on the 11th of January last; he called at my office, and represented himself to be an officer of the first battalion of Rothsay and Caithness Sencibles; this was about three o'clock in the afternoon; he told me, he had come to town to settle some matters relative to a deceased relation in India -</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask the gentleman, whether he does not recollect I was in a deranged state of mind at the time? - A. The prisoner did not appear to me to be so; he said, that he wanted some money; he had been some time in conversation with my uncle, previous to my coming into the office.</p>
               <p>Q.When he said, he wanted some money, what followed upon that? - A. We paid him a month's pay, as to ensign Sinclair; I understood, from my uncle, when I came into the office, that this was ensign Sinclair.</p>
               <p>Q. What sum did you pay him? - A.Seven pounds four shillings and eight-pence, by a draft on Messrs. Coutts and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, at that time, any receipt given you for that sum? - A. I had; I advanced it to ensign Sinclair, as a month's pay.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He gave a receipt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you, after that, see the prisoner again? - A. I saw him again on the 17th of the same month.</p>
               <p>Q.About what time? - A. From the hours of twelve to one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you? - A. He said, on the 17th, that some mistake had been made in the money that had been paid him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he explain what that was? - A. He remarked, that the pay-master had been in the habit of paying him more for a month's subsistence; I then recurred to the receipt, and made a calculation of the pay, and said, it was perfectly right, as ensign; he then said, he was lieutenant Benjamin Sinclair.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the former receipt signed,

            ? - A. Yes. I then apologized for the mistake, and said, we would pay him the difference.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.What did the difference amount to? - A. One pound, eleven shillings. He still said, he should want a few guineas more, as he was go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200035"/>ing to join the regiment in a few days; and the further sum of six pounds, six shilling and four-pence, was paid him, in addition to the money I had paid him before, that made altogether thirteen pounds eleven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you pay him the remaining money? - A. It was paid in cash. I then proposed to the prisoner, to cancel the former receipt, and give me a receipt for the whole sum; the prisoner assented, and I handed him the former receipt, which he tore, and threw into the fire; he then gave me the receipt which I now hold in my hand. (The receipt could not be read, on account of its bad writing).</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that the name of Robert Russel? - A. I signed it; the body of the receipt is in my hand-writing, the signature only is his.</p>
               <p>Court. It must be left to the Jury, it is bad writing. - Gentlemen, what he means, is, that he did belong to the Rothsay and Caithness sencibles.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How come you to give credit to this young man, when he came and told you, you had made a mistake? - A. After my uncle had granted the first sum, I had not a distant suspicion but that he was the person he represented himself to be, lieutenant

               <p>Court. Q. What book did you look into? - A. My ledger, as agent for that regiment; I then told him we must pay him the difference between lieutenant and ensign, which was a shilling a day; of course it was thirty one shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he paid that thirty-one shillings? - A. Yes; then he applied to me for six guineas more, as his business had detained him longer in town than he expected; and he wanted six guineas more, as he was going to his regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you comply with his request? - A. I certainly did, he gave such a good account of himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had he? - A. The two sums put together, made thirteen pounds eleven shillings; as he told me he was going to join his regiment, I had some commissions to officers abroad, and I requested him to take them to save postage; he undertook to deliver them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any receipt given for the money you paid him? - A.There was; first a receipt for one month's pay, as an ensign, that was on the 11th, and that receipt was cancelled, and we took a general receipt for the whole. (The receipt produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the receipt? - A.Certainly it is.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear it was not? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp objected that the witness ought not to be permitted to give evidence of that confession, but it was over-ruled by the Court.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Before the Justice what did the prisoner say - in the first place, was he advised or threatened? - A. No; the prisoner Macdonald was offered, if she would say, honestly, where the rest of the things were gone, she might be admitted an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200037"/>evidence, and she refused; but I heard nothing of the kind to Champness. Just as he was going from the bar, having told the Magistrate he had found those things in the street, he desired that the Magistrate would not accuse Macdonald, for she was innocent of every thing; he admitted that he had brought the property to her, and that he had found them in the street.</p>
               <p>Champness's defence. I did not say that Macdonald was innocent; I alluded to the woman that went to pledge the stockings, I said I had given her them to pawn. Both <rs id="t17990220-38-verdict205" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Was Mr. Elliot a customer at your shop? - A. He was not a customer; but we had sent the day before to Mr. Elliot soliciting his custom.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you delivered them to her for Mr. Elliot? - A. Yes; every time she came, she came in the same name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put them down in your book to Mr. Elliot? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there must be an end of it. - Gentlemen of the Jury. This appears to me to be a fraud, but certainly not a felony; she comes under false pretences, saying, that she comes from Mr. Elliot, whose custom he had solicited, and he enters them in his book to Mr. Elliot, and therefore the prisoners must be both acquitted; is Mr. Elliot here?</p>

             sworn. - I am a tin-plate worker, No. 18, Tottenham-court-road: On the 17th of January, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came into my shop; and asked me if I bought lead; I told him I did; he brought this piece to me, he said, it weighed eight pounds; I took his word, and gave him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200038"/>three halfpence per pound, which made one shilling; on the evening following he brought these two pieces; I had a suspicion of their being stolen; I asked him where he brought them from; he told me a young man gave them to him to sell for him; I asked him where the young man was; he informed me in Warren-street; I desired him to fetch the young man to me, and I would ask him a few questions concerning the metal, and he went out of the shop as I supposed to fetch the young man, but never returned till the 24th, when I asked him where the young man was, he told me the young man was gone away two shillings in his wife's debt for washing for him; I then asked the prisoner where he lived; he told me, by the waterside; I asked him his master's name, he would not inform me; I then had a suspicion that he had stolen the metal himself; I sent for an officer, and had him taken into custody; in going down to the office, the officer had questioned him where he lived, and he had informed him he lived with Mr. Braithwaite; when I found he worked with Mr. Braithwaite, the officer, myself, and Mr. Braithwaite, went to his wife's room, No. 8, Fitzroy-place, and examined it; we did not find any thing material, except three pint pots that were hid in a closet.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that, lead or solder? - A. I do not know; I have asked a great number of people who deal in metals, and they cannot tell; for my own part, I think it is lead.</p>
               <p>Q. That large piece is a pig, is it not? - A. Yes, and that gave me the suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that lead or solder? - A. I cannot say whether it is lead or any other metal.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street; I took the prisoner into custody, and as I took him down to the office, he told me he worked for Mr. Braithwaite; at first he told me he worked by the water-side; I had asked him if he did not work for Mr. Braithwaite, as I thought I had seen his face about that quarter, and he denied it; then he begged of me to go to his wife, and inform her where he was.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Braithwaite). Look at that lead? - A. The two small pieces I know nothing about, but the large piece I missed; it stood by four or five pieces of the same kind.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call it? - A. A pig of solder, or an ingot of solder, it does not signify which.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any particular mark upon it? - A. I knew it as I should the features of one person's face from another.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not all these pieces cast in the same mould? - A. They are cast in an open sand.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the common shape and figure of your pigs of solder? - A. They were of the same form, but the rest were all larger; I am certain this is the one I missed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there besides? - A. Four or five.</p>
               <p>Q. If you do not know whether it was four or five, how do you know you missed one? - A. I am not certain whether there were four or five that were along with these, but I can swear to this as being taken from my shop; the others were all of a size, and as big again as this.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were these cast? - A. At St. Alban's; I bought them about a week or eight days before of a plumber's son, whose father died a few weeks before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. We never went away from work till seven o'clock, and the gate was always shut, and a man at the gate to see who went in and out; it would have been impossible for me to have taken out such a piece.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The gate is never locked; I have sixty men, and they can go in and out without any body attending at the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are your partners? - A.

               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man that was stopped was the man you saw at the tail of the cart? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him? - A. No, except while he turned the corner; when he got to the tail of the cart, he said, what have you lost, have you lost any thing?</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the cart were the halfpence placed? - A. About a foot and a half from the tailboard.</p>
               <p>Q. And you knew that they contained halfpence before they were broke? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were sent to Mr. Jones's - What is Mr. Jones? - A. An oilman.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are you servant to? - A.Messrs. Bentley and Grace, turpentine manufacturers, at Chelsea; and we have an accompting-house at Essex-street.</p>
               <p>Q. So you were to go to Jones's for halfpence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received the halfpence, I take it they were ready to be delivered to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And were put up in parcels before you saw them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, whether they contained halfpence or not, you cannot tell? - A. I had a note with them that they contained 10l.</p>
               <p>Q. But you had not an opportunity of seeing that before you came from Jones's? - A. No, the 5l. that was opened was halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. From what my master says, and I myself saw two five shilling papers that were broke, they contained halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you? - A. Sitting in the middle of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the prisoner, standing upon the ground, have got at them? - A. No, not without springing up; but I saw him up upon the tail of the cart pulling the halfpence through.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not lose sight of him? - A.Not more than half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a great many people walking down the Strand? - A. But nobody in Devereux-court.</p>

             sworn. - I am an attorney: On the 15th of January, a little after six, I was going to our office in Essex-street, and, waiting for one of the clerks, I was going into the Temple, and heard a cry of stop thief; the prisoner ran against me, and I collared him; he begged of me to let him go; at that moment the carter came up, and told me the prisoner had attempted to rob his master's cart of some halfpence; the prisoner then said, sir, I have taken nothing, ask him if he has lost any thing; we then led him up to the cart, to the end of Devereux-court, opposite Twining's, and, through the rail of the tail-board, of his cart, there appeared to be a package of halfpence burst at one end; we then took him down to Bentley and Grace's house, in Essex-street; when I got him back from our own office, and put in the whole of the halfpence that I could find in the cart, we then went away with him; he wished to go up through the court, and I insisted upon his going through the public streets; at Somerset-house he remarked that there were some young men round him that he knew, upon which I grasped him tighter, and he immediately attempted to get from us; he threw himself down, attempting to pull me upon him; I let him go, instead of struggling with him, and we kept off the people that were wanting to get round, and some gentlemen, who came to my assistance, helped to convey him to Bow-street; among the people that surrounded us, he pointed out two or three that he knew, and I was apprehensive we should meet with some damage; after he was at Bow-street, I went down to Bentley and Grace's, where I found the halfpence tied up in the same manner as I had left them in the bag; I opened several of them with my knife, to see what they contained, and I found 1s. 11d. missing out of two packages; they were tied up in five shilling papers; he had an offer to go for a soldier, and we did not know that he was not gone till just the beginning of the Sessions; the masters would not prosecute, and they have left it upon this poor man to be at the expence of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Woolley). What are your master's names? - A. Thomas Bentley and Thomas Grace.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any other partners? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going into Garden-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200040"/>court, in the Temple, from the Magpie and Stump, in Butcher-row, through Devereux-court, and this gentleman stopped me, I was not near the cart.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. And that money goes into his till? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Out of 137l. suppose there was 37l. in cash? - A. He would enter it 137l. and carry out in his money-book 37l. and hand the notes over to another clerk.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how it came there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was your business to make the entry of the 18th of January? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Explain at what stage of any transaction it is that you make your entry in the ledger, supposing a customer comes to pay in 137l.? - A. I make my entry directly from the cash-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your entry was directly from the cashbook of 37l.? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. I think you said you thought it was not a figure of your making - are you more clear than you were at the Mansion-house? - A. I confess, when the question was first put to me at the Mansion-house, the ledger was opened immediately, without my weighing any of the circumstances attending it; the question was put to me, will you swear that is not your figure? I did not give a decisive answer; but having particularly observed this figure by a stronger light, I perceived a difference in the colour of the ink that it does not stand with the next figure, which is my own; and another circumstance is, that it is checked by two clerks the next morning; aided by all these circumstances, I think myself able to swear positively to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to say, that, in the hurry of business, you did not make that figure? - A. I say, I must be aided by all the circumstances that I have stated.</p>
               <p>Q. I call upon you to say, yes or no, before God, whether you made that figure? - A. I say positively, before God and man, that I did not make it.</p>
               <p>Q.At the Mansion-house, I understood you to say, it was impossible for any man to swear to a figure of 1? - A. I qualified it by the observations I have now made.</p>
               <p>Q. And, with these qualifications, you said, it was impossible for any man living to swear to a 1? - A. I said, at the Mansion-house, it was impossible for a man to be infallible.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, then, will you say, it is impossible to swear to a 1? - A. The circumstance I speak of is, its being checked by two clerks.</p>
               <p>Q.But you still believe it impossible for any man to swear to a I? - A. There are circumstances that are very strong indeed; this figure of I does not stand with the other figure.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.If I understand you right, when the book was first produced to you, you were very cautious, and said, it was possible for a man to make a mistake, you thought it was not your figure; but now having examined the book materially, what is your opinion? - A. That the posting has been altered.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen the I by itself, perhaps you could not have sworn to it? - A. I wish to be cautious.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you make your entry from? - A. From the received cash-book. (The received cashbook produced).</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. What is the entry in that book? - A.Thirty-seven pounds.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ESDAILE, Esq. sworn. Q. You have the note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.From whom did you get it? - A.From one of the other clerks, of the name of Trott. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Dr. Peers). Q. Is that the note that you sent by your young gentleman to Mr. Gilbert's? - A. Yes, I believe it to be the same; my name is at the back of it in my handwriting.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Beauchamp). Q. Look at that note? - A.This is the same note that I delivered to Mr. Gilbert.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Gilbert). Q. Is that the note that you received from the last witness, Beauchamp? - A. I am quite clear it is.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the note that you paid into the banker's, the same note that you received from your master? - A.Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Farthing). Q. Is that the note which Mr. Bazely gave to you at the clearing-house, and which was to take up his drafts drawn upon him? - A.Just so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. What became of those drafts? - A. I gave them to Mr. Bazely.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Then I will not press it.(Mr. Esdaile proved the firm of the house to be as stated in the indictment).</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. The case on the part of the prosecution being gone through, I feel a firm conviction, and contend with confidence, that nothing that has been proved in this case amounts to the crime of felony; I apprehend, upon the evidence that has been given before your Lordship, and the Jury, that this is neither more nor less, in the most harsh terms in which it can be expressed, than a breach of trust; that this money was paid is clear -</p>
               <p>Court. I am very willing to hear you, but, perhaps, it will be the wisest way to tell you, that the impression of my mind is to take the verdict of the Jury; as to the fact, and as to the law, which Mr. Fielding opened very fairly, I have been turning it in my mind since the trial has been going on, and I shall certainly reserve the case for the opinion of the Judges; if you can go further, I will certainly hear you with pleasure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Certainly not, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Knowing it to be a case of extreme importance to the City of London, that the line should be drawn, and drawn accurately, I think it will be much better than having my single opinion upon the subject, to leave it for the opinion of the Judges, whether they think this man's offence amounts to a felony, or whether it is only a misdemeanor.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of any information, did you go any where, and find any other property? - A. Yes; I missed a great deal of property; and then I went to Mr. Jones, in Rosemary-lane, a salesman; I found three waistcoats there, which I have had ever since, (produces them); after that, in consequence of an information I received from Mr. Leary's young man. I went to Mr. Leary's, and there were one hundred and thirty-five waistcoats produced to me, they are now in the possession of the City-Marshal; there were ten others which we are not certain of.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any doubt about those hundred and twenty-five being your's? - A.None in the world, they had all of them our marks; we then got a warrant, and took up the prisoner and another woman, of the name of Evans, who is the prisoner's sister, from the description I had from Mr. Leary's young man, (produces three waistcoats found at Jones's); they have our marks upon them.</p>
               <p>- HOLLIER sworn. - I am City-Marshal:(produces 125 waistcoats); I had them delivered into my custody at the Mansion-house; I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Varley. These are our waistcoats; we do not sell more than a dozen at a time of these sort of waistcoats in any part of the town, we send them principally to America.</p>

            . I had the letting of the house, and had a person in the house to take care of it. The prisoner called upon me on the 3d of December last, and said, he had seen a house, which I had to let, in Great Ormond-street; he asked me the rent; I told him, it was 60I. a year; he said, that was too much, as it was considerably out of repair; and he made the objection, that it was too near a baker's shop; he said, it would could cost him 100l. to repair it; but he said, if I would take 55I. a year, he would take it upon a lease for twenty one years, but he said, he must have immediate possession; that he would get workmen in it directly, to repair it, ready to receive his son, whom he expected from the East-Indies, he did not know how soon, and whom he had not seen these twenty years; he said, his son had married a black wife, and had children by her, which he very much lamented; but he said, if his son was happy, he should be soon reconciled to the colour; I agreed to take the 55I. a year for twenty-one years, and told him, that there should be an agreement drawn up; he pretended to be in a great hurry that evening, but I told him, I could soon write it out; and asked him his address; he told me, he lived at Tottenham-high-cross, that he had a house there, where he went every night to sleep; I drew up the agreement, which he was very much pleased at, as it would save him the expence of employing an attorney; he signed it, and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your agreement on a stamp? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he drest at that time? - A. He had silk breeches on, and a kind of snuff coloured coat, and a buff coloured waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he altogether the appearance of a respectable man? - A. Yes; I took him to be a man of considerable property. The next day, the 1st of January, he came into possession of the house; on the 4th of January, I sent a messenger to enquire after him, but could not get any intelligence; on the 9th of January, I went myself to Tottenham-high-cross, but could not find any such person; as I was returning home, I called at the first turnpike,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200047"/>and made enquiry there, but could not find him out.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you deliver him the possession? - A. No; Gray, another witness, who had the care of the house, did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart. Q. Were you present when the prisoner was taken into custody? - A. Yes, I was. Upon my return from Tottenham-high-cross, I sent three of my men with a second key, and upon their return, I went to Bow-street; that was on the 9th; in the evening, they got two officers, who went with me to Ormond-street; he was in the street, but seeing us, he did not attempt to go in; I said to the officers, this is the person that has taken the house, and they immediately secured him; I asked him, where the keys of the house were; he said, he had left them behind him. We took him into the baker's shop, searched him, and found the keys upon him; two of my men then went into the house to examine it, Thomas Ash and

               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Upon the oath you have taken, is not the coat that I have on now, the very coat that I came to you in that evening? - A. I do not think it is; he had a great coat on.</p>

               <p>PETER GRAY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Manton put me in possession of this house in Ormond street; I quitted possession on the 31st of December in the evening; Mr. Manton told me, in the front shop, that he had let the house to that gentleman, the prisoner was then with Mr. Manton; Mr. Manton asked me if I could leave it the next day; I told him I did not know that I could; however, the next day I went and got a lodging, and, in returning to Ormond-street with a carter, I met the prisoner; I told him I was going to leave the house, and he told me, I declare you have been very expeditious; I left the key at Mr. Clarke's a baker, the next door, at the express desire of the prisoner.</p>

In the kitchen and wash-house; Mr. Manton sent me down with a padlock to fasten up the house, Ash and Whitelamb went with me; I opened the door, Mr. Manton had delivered me a second key, which he had not given up; Ash went to light a candle, it was dark; I staid in the hall about two minutes, and the prisoner came out of the back kitchen into the hall; I apologized for coming to him, that it was Mr. Manton's order; he went to take hold of the key that I had in my hand, and said, he was glad that I had come, because I put him in possession of the second key; I told him I came to the house in consequence of his not being found at Tottenham-high-cross, where he had given his address; he took the key, and put his hand gently to my shoulder, as if to push me out, and I went out; Ash and Whitelamb were standing at the door, and then he shut the door and shut us out; there is one thing which I omitted, which is, that he said he had got some chairs into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any chairs in the house? - A. No, I could find none.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of your companions say any thing to him? - A. Yes, as near as I can recollect, Ash told him Mr. Manton wished for his address.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after he shut the door? - A. After he came out along with us, Ash told him Mr. Manton wanted to see him, as he wished to have the lease made out; he said, he should very likely wait on Mr. Manton that night; Ash told him, Mr. Manton wanted his address; he said, he lived at Tottenham-high-cross; he asked him, where; he replied, at the further end; he asked him what he should say to Mr. Manton, as he wanted to make out the lease, whether he was a gentleman or a tradesman; he answered, neither; the prisoner then walked away towards Lamb's-conduit-street, and Ash and me stopped a few minutes, while Whitelamb went about some other business; in the course of our stopping, he returned again; Mr. Ash then stopped him, and said, in case he should not wait upon Mr. Manton, could he see him to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go the next day with the officers? - A. Yes; we went into the house, and found a piece of leaden pipe in the hall, that I am positive was not there when we went in first.</p>
               <p>Q. The same night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might that be? - A.About two feet, as near as I can guess, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see from what part of the house that had been taken? - A. From the back kitchen; I was there when the officers fitted it; I am positive it was cut off with a saw, it had the appearance of being fresh cut; in the wash-house the sink was ripped off the wood work, and entirely taken away; two sash weights were gone from one of the stair-case windows; there were fifteen door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200048"/>locks in the house that had been taken off; I went into every room in the house; I suppose there were about two hundred pounds weight of lead removed, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was secured, did you observe his hands? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. As near as you can state, what was my dress at the time I took the house? - A. I did not take any particular notice of his dress; he seemed to me to have his hair frizzed out at the sides.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you hear him represent himself to Mr. Manton as a gentleman of fortune? - A. It did not occur in the front shop, while I was there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.When the officers came, did you not see a pistol in the hand of Mr. Manton? - A. I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not see the officers box me in the face, and knock me down? - A. I did see the officers strike you, and I held their arms.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he make any resistance? - A. None that I saw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not many locks in the house that wanted keys? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them were brass locks? - A.Three.</p>
               <p>Q. And how many handles were deficient? - A. None, to my knowledge; it might be so, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ASH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Hart. I was in company with the last witness on the 9th of January; I know no more than he does.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHITELAMB sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am servant to Mr. Manton; I went with the two last witnesses to Ormond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any lead removed from the place where it stood? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the hands of the prisoner? - A. Yes, I observed a rag round one of his fingers, and bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any appearance of blood upon any part of the lead? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a poor, weak man, unacquainted with the law touching the situation. I now stand in; I have always understood, from the earliest of my manhood, that if I entered into a contract between a lettor and a lettee, I thought that, after an agreement for twenty-one years to repair a house, or lay out any sum that I liked upon it, while the rent was paid, it was as a complete freehold. This I ever understood to be the law of this country, and if I am wrong, I am very sorry for it. As to my representing myself as living at Tottenham-high-cross, suffer me to observe, I have a wife, the daughter of a merchant in the City of London, who has resided upwards of twenty years in Church-street, Stoke Newington, at a Mr. Field's; I always was taught to consider that as my home. Mr. Manton did not ask me my name or place of abode till he had wrote six lines, and as my wife lived there, and was going to live at Tottenham-high-cross, that was the direction I gave. I have been a character well known in the world, and have carried on a great business; Mr. Manton did not ask any reference; had he said, you are a stranger to me, I must request a reference, I would have referred him to Mr. Long and Mr. Hall, two gentlemen in Finsbury-square, who pay my wife her annuity quarterly. As Mr. Manton waved any enquiry touching a reference, I conceived myself in a state of safety in doing what I did, putting Tottenham-high-cross, as it was to be the residence of my wife, and will be at Lady-day. If I have committed a fraud, it has not been intentional; the work-people were going to be put into the house when they took me; what I was employed in was measuring the height and extent of the rooms, which I meant to have painted and put in order. It is very true I told Mr. Manton I had an only son that had been at Bengal above twenty years ago, and who is now safe arrived at Lisbon; he wrote to me, wishing I would provide for him a reception in London, and I thought that a house of 55l. a year would do very well for him who was so well able to pay it, as I am told. Mr. Manton has been pleased to represent me as a gentleman; it has all arisen from Mr. Manton's own want of caution; he never asked a reference, which, if he had, I would have given him. I considered it as exceedingly ridiculous in me to make any further scruple of accepting the premises, as he seemed so remarkable slack in asking a reference; my dress was the same, and I believe, the whole would not fetch half-a-crown. This is the first time I have erred upon such a ground. I am sorry if I have intruded upon your Lordship's humanity in hearing me so long; but I conceive it must be proved by some witness, that I was seen aiding or abetting in carrying away the articles charged in the indictment to the satisfaction of your Lordship and those twelve independent gentlemen who are to decide upon my deliverance. My Lord, I take it by virture of such an indenture as is contained in the articles of lease between landlord and tenant, if this is to be called a felony, it would stretch the very vitals of the constitution. If, instead of three windows, I had chose to have made them all into one bow-window, I conceive I had a right to do it. I have seen a great deal of the world, and have done business for the nobility and some of the first families in England, Scotland, and Ireland.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Have you any witnesses?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no witnesses but God and the truth to support me. GUILTY (Aged 67.)</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the people belonging to Bow-street: On the 21st of last month the prisoner was brought to Bow-street, I was sent for to the office; I searched him, and found several things upon him that does not at all belong to this business, but in particular I found this key, (producing a small key); upon finding that key, Mr. Addington asked him where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. What Mr. Addington asked, and the answer he made, was taken down in writing, was it not? - A. I do not know; he refused to tell Mr. Addington where he lived; I said to Mr. Addington, I knew where he lived, and I went to a house in Oxford-road where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know the room he lodged in? - A. From the enquiries I made.</p>
               <p>Q. But you must not tell us what that enquiry was? - A. I went into the garret, and found in a box which this key opened, this tooth-pick case, this pistol-bag with bullets, a bullet-mould, and this lancet-case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys Q. This was on the 21st of January? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.That is eleven days from the 10th of January? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.This is the key with which you opened the box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many thousand bureaus and boxes do you suppose that key would open? - A. I believe it is an uncommon good key of the sort.</p>
               <p>Q. How many thousands of bureaus and boxes would that open? - A. I do not think it a common key at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood the prisoner lodged in that house - how lately did you know him to lodge there last? - A. Before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known him to have lodged there within these three months? - A. No, nor I do not know that I ever did see him there, but I have had very good information.</p>

               <p>Q.And mean to say, upon your oath, that you never heard in this Court, that what you have been informed is not evidence? - A. I have heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that that man lodged in that house of your own knowledge? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then how dared you to give evidence of such information? - A.How was I to have known it was his room, if I had not had information.</p>

               <p>Q.For what is this man indicted? - A. For a highway robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a reward upon conviction for a high-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200050"/>robbery, of forty pounds, aye or no? - A. There is.</p>
               <p>Q. And you, knowing there is a reward of forty pounds, offer to give evidence of information? - A. How was I to get up stairs into the room, without telling how I came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard the Judge upon that Bench say, that you are not to give evidence of information? - A. I may have heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how dared you to swear that they were his lodgings? - A. I have not sworn it that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear then that he lodged there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you not know, that if that man is convicted, you are entitled to forty pounds, or a share of forty pounds? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You are not subpoenaed? - A. No, I came in merely to gratify my curiosity; I have in my time made a great many little locks myself, and have had occasion to go to the White-lion, in Foster-lane, where they keep an assortment of all kind of keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the key produced by the witness a common key? - A. It is the commonest of all but one, and they only differ in size.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she near that part of the counter where these shirts lay? - A. Yes, close to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have seen her do something that should induce you to suspect her in particular? - A. I saw my boy move some trowsers from before her; she placed her child upon the counter close to the shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her make use of her hands at all? - A. No; when she came back, she said, she did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200051"/>not take them; that a girl about fourteen years of age, who was with her, took them; but there was nobody at all with her, except a little child in arms.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any reason to suspect her? - A. I did not much like her appearance, she looked like a girl of the town; there were some trowsers on the counter, and she leaned her elbow upon them, and I thought she was going to take them, and I took them away; she said directly, take care, or else they will fall.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe her do any thing? - A. No; my master then desired me to go out and see if I could see her; I went up to her, and told her my master can serve you now with the bit of cotton you wanted; and I saw the shirts under her arm, with her gown over them; I caught hold of her, and she said, here are two shirts the child brought away under her petticoats, and I did not know it; she having a child in one arm, and the shirts in the other; she did not make any resistance, but let me take them from her; my master then came and took hold of her, and I took the shirts back to the shop, and gave them to my master.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Living) What is the value of these shirts? - A. They cost me twelve shillings and sixpence each; they are here, in custody of the officer, I delivered them to him; we number all the shirts as they come in, and these are both No. 20, I described them when they were brought back before I looked at them, they were marked with my private mark, D. E. h.(The constable produced the property, which was deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the constables of the parish of St. Giles's in the Fields: On the 11th of January at night, about half past eleven o'clock, I received some information from Mr. Dignam, desiring me to go to a house in Orange-court, Great Wild-street; accordingly, about one o'clock, when the patrols came into the watch-house, I took them with me; I heard some people talking, I went into the parlour upon the ground-floor, and there were two young men, and four women, they were disputing about some handkerchiefs, and I desired them to give the handkerchiefs to me; they one and all said there were no handkerchiefs there, they had none; I then proceeded to search, and the first I searched was the prisoner at the bar; I searched his pockets, and all round him, but could find nothing, he kept his hand down to his breeches; I then asked him what he had got there; he said, nothing; I insisted upon seeing, and one corner of this blue handkerchief I pulled out of his breeches; I asked him how that came there; and he said he was injured; our patrol then said, their might be more, and I saw him pull out four more handkerchiefs; he accounted for the whole in this way, that coming down Orange-court to this house, he picked them up; I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have never made any attempt to find out the owners? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they may not be stolen that you know? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>PHILIP DIGNAM sworn. - On the 11th of January, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was going for a nurse to attend my wife, and in going through Orange-court, I heard some conversation in this house; the street-door and parlour-door being open, I could see the prisoner, Simmons, taking up handkerchiefs one by one from some person by the fire-side, putting them about her neck; this silk handkerchief, she said, would bring three bobs, and a white one, she said, would fetch a bob; then she handed that back, and received another; she did say, what she thought they would fetch, to some person by the fire-side; they thought they would not fetch so much; the prisoner said, she knew better, for she had popped many hundreds. I could discern, from the conversation, that they were not honestly come by; I heard the voices of two men, one said, I could have had many more, if you would have stood by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the person of Williams? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. The meaning of the word, pop, is pawn, is it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY PENDEGRASS sworn. - I am a patrol: I went with Mr. Brookes to this house in Orange-court, the door was shut; we called, and they made answer, they would not open the door; I went to the window, and pushed it up, and 
               <persName id="t17990220-52-person447">

             the curtain on one side; I saw the prisoner Simmons make her escape to a back room, the door had been wrenched off the hinges, she slapped down the door; and the prisoner Williams and another man were by the fire; she slapped the door down upon them both; Williams got up and shoved the door upright against the same place again; then another woman opened the door and let us in; as soon as I went into the back room, I saw Simmons upon the bed, pretending to be asleep with a sick woman; I asked her, if she was asleep, and she said, she was, and had nothing to do with the affair; she was brought out and examined by one of the patrols, but nothing was found upon her; then Mr. Brookes wished to have Williams searched; after searching his pockets, he clapped his hand upon his right thigh, he said, he had a pocket handkerchief there to keep himself clean; I said, let us see what sort of a handkerchief you have got there; he was unwilling; He had hold of the corner of this handkerchief, and pulled part of it, and Mr. Brookes pulled the rest out; I said, I see you have left something behind; and I then put my hand down in his breeches, and he prayed me not; I put my hand down, and pulled four handkerchiefs out of his breeches all together; then he said, he had found them in the court; he did not give any reason for their being so concealed; Mr. Brookes has had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Williams's defence. A few days before this, I happened to see this young woman in Drury-lane, I asked her where she lived, and she said, No. 8, Orange-court; and the same night I was rather in liquor, and happened to go down the court to see the young woman, and kicked a bit of a bundle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200053"/>before me, tied up in brown paper; another young woman happening to go in, saw me pick it up; she cried halves; and upon going in to examine the bundle, I found the above property, and I put them into my breeches, because I would not lose them out of my pockets.</p>
               <p>Simmons's defence. I did not know the young man, nor had not the property in my hands; I had been up stairs, and coming down, I heard them talking about the property, but I never had them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Williams called three witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the patrol belonging to Bow-street: On Wednesday evening, the 23d of January, I and some of my brother officers went to a house in Bowl-yard, St. Giles's, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; we went, in consequence of an information coming to the office, of a trunk, which belonged to Dr. Perfect; my brother officers went into the back parlour, I stopped in the passage, and the prisoner, and another man who made his escape, came in; the other man came in first, and the prisoner behind him, with this crane upon his left shoulder; the man who made his escape, accosted me, and asked me what I did in the passage; I told him not to stop there, but to come along up stairs with me; the prisoner was behind him; I immediately ran up to my brother officers, and desired them to come down, for there was some property come in; the prisoner at the bar and the other man followed me as far as the foot of the stairs; my brother officers came down stairs, and the crane was then standing against the bannisters of the stairs, and they were going out of the passage, when I secured the prisoner; I turned him into the passage to the other officers, and the other made his escape; I saw the crane upon his shoulder, it is a copper crane. (The crane was deposed to by Swanscoat and Hemmings).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is an envious piece of business of Crocker's; he has known me a great many years; a few years ago, he licked my brother; and he told me, he would lick e'er a one of the family; I licked him at the corner of Goodge-street, and he told me then, that if ever I should get into his hands, I should never get out any more. Another time, he met me with a bundle, and made me put it down and untie it, and said, he supposed I had got sugar or coffee.</p>
               <p>Crocker. I have not known him till within this year and a half; I have known his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever have any quarrel with him at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever threaten him, as he has described? - A. No, I never did, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was before a Magistrate in my life, till he took me up, and that he did once before this. He has been a terror to my life ever since I have been from the East-Indies.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us what you first observed? - A.After fastening the gate, I waited within side of the field by the side of the lane, for three parts of an hour, we then heard a noise of horses coming, which we supposed to be the smugglers; the first that came up, was John Skinner, a smuggler, who lives in the town of Helston, he was riding on a horse, but nothing with him; I heard the others coming, and the officers were placed to cut off their retreat; I told them, what they had got, they had better give up peaceably; and he called me by my name, and said, is that Mr. Mitchell; I told him, it was; by this time, the prisoner at the bar and Pascow rode by and passed me at full gallop, with two ankers of liquor under each of them, slung over the horses, with cords, in the usual way in which smugglers carry their liquors.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Pascow a Helston man? - A. Yes, I knew him, but not so well as Barnard; I turned round, and went towards the gate to stop the horses; upon my attempting to seize them, they instantly struck at me a number of blows with large sticks; I had one blow over my eye, that I thought I had lost the sight of my eye; I was under the doctor's hands a long time; and another across the nose; there were a great many other blows, but no blood brought.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get the blows on your arms? - A. By defending my head; I lost a great deal of blood; the wound on my eye was a very deep one. Pascow's stick appeared to be four feet and a half long, and a large head to it; after he had got over the gate, he took both hands and struck me repeatedly, and if the other officers had not come up, they must have got through the gate, I could not have prevented it a moment.</p>
               <p>Q.The men that were striking you, were Pascow and Barnard? - A. Yes, they struck, both of them, as fast as they could. On the Christmas day I was as ill as ever I was in my life. When Parnell came up, I fell back to recover himself; I had had enough for any man; and after I had recovered myself, I returned; we secured three horses laden; a boy had been riding one of them, and he had jumped off, and ran away; the other two horses were rode by Barnard and Pascow, they were loaded with two casks each, one of brandy, and one of geneva; they were seven-gallon casks; Parnell caught Barnard by the collar, secured him, and took him to Helston; the others ran off; indeed, I had three loaded pistols about me, but I was loth to make use of them; if I had, I think, as we were so close, it must have taken the life of one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Barnard got hurt? - A. I believe he did, in his head.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you draw the pistols at all? - A. Not till after we had got to the end of Helston town, when I was apprehensive of a rescue.</p>
               <p>Q. When Barnard was secured, did he say any thing? - A. When I remonstrated with him for having used me so ill, he said, he was very sorry for it, and begged we would let him go; and he said, if he had known they were Helston officers, he would not have hurt them; but he thought they were Penryn officers, otherwise they should not have acted in the manner they did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. Q.Both of you lived in the same town? - A. In the same street.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very well known there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from London is Helston? - A. About 270 miles, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a poor man, I believe? - A. Yes. He has been detected three times in a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. I believe he works in the mines? - A.Occasionally.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am an officer; and came up to the assistance of Mitchell.</p>
               <p>Q. When Skinner first came up to the gate, where were you? - A. I was back about 200 yards from the gate, as they passed by.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Barnard before? - A. I have seen him before, but had no knowledge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner were Barnard and the others treating Mitchell? - A.Beating him with sticks, to the best of my knowledge. Barnard's stick was three feet long, and Pascow's was longer, with a large head to it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you observed them striking at Mitchell, what did you do? - A. I got forward as fast as I could, and Barnard being nearest to me, striking Mitchell, I struck at him, and seized him by the collar immediately.</p>
               <p>Q.When you seized him by the collar, did he continue to strike? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200055"/>Q. Did any thing happen to you while you were in that situation with him? - A. As I held him by the collar, Pascow was near him; I cannot say whether he was on this side the gate or the other, I believe he got over, and after he was over, he did all he could to strike Mr. Mitchell; he struck him several times after he was over the gate.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you receive any blows from any body? - A. I do not remember that I received any; I asked the officers if they knew them, and one of the officers said, he knew them both, Barnard and Pascow; at that time I received a cut across the the back of the hand, by which of these men I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a cut was it, and with what instrument was it inflicted? - A. It appeared to me to be cut with a very sharp instrument; I have lost the use of my hand ever since; it cut the tendons of my fingers.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you lost the use of your hand? - A. I hope I shall have the use of it again.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was Mitchell at that time? - A.Securing the horses and examining the goods; Mr. Mitchell was very ill for some time, as he was beat so; Bunney came up the instant after me; I had fire-arms about me, but did not use them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you believe that that cut was with a knife or a cutlass? - A. A. curious knife was found near the place the next morning by a farmer; he shewed it to a smuggler, and he got it away.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You do not know which of them cut you? - A. I cannot say, but I am of opinion it was Pascow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. Q. After you had collared Barnard, he did not resist? - A. Not with his stick.</p>
               <p>Q.Pascow was the man whom you believed to have cut you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN BUNNEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I was present with the last witness, Mitchell, and Parnell; I saw two men on horseback striking at something, but I did not know what; and before I could get up to Mitchell and Parnell, they had got off their horses; the first person I saw was Mitchell; I saw Barnard strike him three times; before I could have the power to reach Pascow, he got over the gate; the gate being fastened, I thought I should be in immediate danger to get over after him, as I perceived he had a long stick in his hand, and a nob at the end of it. Just after I got up to the gate, I saw him with both hands strike Mr. Mitchell several times; when I saw him strike Mitchell in such a manner, I called to him by his name; I told him, if he did not desist, and go off immediately, I would fire at him: then I took a pistol out of my pocket, and put it towards him, and when he saw that, he made off immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not fire? - A. No, I did not make any use of it; I saw Parnell catch Barnard by the collar; but how he came by the wound I did not see.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. Q. Pascow was the most violent? - A. Yes, a great deal.(Mr. Pooley addressed the Jury on behalf of the defendant).</p>

               <p>Q. Who was in your company? - A. The mistress of the house and another woman.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no other sailor with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of night did this happen? - A.Between eleven and twelve at night; the door was shut, and some person knocked at the door; the woman asked, who is there; some person answered, it is me, do not you know me; and she opened the door, and called out to me, here comes a press-gang; then four men came in, dressed in sailor's clothes; one of them sat down, and said, he would be half-a-crown to half-a-crown of mine for something to drink; I said, I would be a shilling; I took out a shilling, and gave it to the woman; he put his hand in his pocket, but took out no money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the two prisoners? - A. The shortest of the two prisoners, Tate, is the man that sat down by me, and offered half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other prisoner one of the four men that came in? - A. Yes; the woman brought liquor in, and put it down; then I gave the woman another shilling; the liquor was brought in, and I got up to go to the door to go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the liquor was drank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take them to be a press-gang? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200056"/>No, I did not, because there was no officer with them; I did not like the look of them; the two prisoners followed me to the door, and took hold of me, one of each side, before I could shut the door after me.</p>
               <p>Q.How did they lay hold of you? - A.By the collar, and by the left arm; Irish Jack had hold of me on the right side by the collar; they told me they would take me on board a tender; the other two men followed me, and dragged me down the yard.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the two prisoners still hold of you? - A. Yes, they brought me against a shed, a boarded place; Tate then put his hand in my waistcoat pocket, and took out six or seven shillings, I am sure I had six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it from the pocket that you had taken the shilling to pay for the liquor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you taken notice of either of the shillings from any thing remarkable? - A. Yes, two of them; there was one with an M on it, scratched with an awl; the other was a crooked shilling, with R W stamped upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you observed these marks upon them before you lost them? - A. Yes, particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. So that from these marks you could have known these shillings again? - A. Yes; Tate then put his hand in my right hand side pocket, and took out a shut knife; Connoway had hold of me at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the other two men that came out any thing to do with it? - A. No, they had not; Tate said, here is a knife, perhaps he may cut our throats with it; Connoway then put his hand to my head, and put me up against the boards, while Tate struck me several times; they went away together.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of the other two men? - A. I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them before? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe enough of them to be sure the prisoners are the same persons? - A. I am sure they are the same persons.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this happened did you see either of them? - A. I saw two of them the same night, about a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to after they left you? - A. I went back to the house, and from the house I went into the street, and told the watchman that one of them was a tall man, of the name of Irish Jack.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know his name was Irish Jack? - A. I heard him called so in the house; I did not describe the person of the other; I saw the two prisoners again about ten minutes after they left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when they left you? - A. They were close by the watch-house, the watchman had hold of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since seen any money that you thought you had lost? - A. Yes, I described to the watchman in the watch-house the mark on the two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body shew you any shillings afterwards? - A. Yes, before the Magistrate, the next day; the next day I saw another of the men, one of the other two close by the place.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not here? - A. Yes, he is.</p>
               <p>Q.What is his name? - A.

Upon his producing the certificate, he said, he wanted his money; I told him, I should pay him nothing, but I should take care of the certificate, for, in my opinion, it was a forgery; he said, he would not go without his money; Mr. Haydon then said, it is impossible to be right, for I have received that money long since; the prisoner made no answer to that, but still insisted that he would be paid, before he left the house; Mr. Haydon said, he would send for a constable; I believe a constable was sent for, but they could not get one; he staid upwards of three hours, till we had done our business, and went out of the room, and then he followed us; I told him, he was in a bad plight, and he had better go about his business; he said, he would not go without the money, or I should give him his certificate back; one or other he would have. When we had done our business, Mr. Haydon went out of the room; this man followed, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the money, due to the real William Harper, been paid? - A. Yes; I had paid it all to Mr. Haydon long ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Haydon as a navy-agent? - A. Six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. What time in the afternoon was it, when I came into the office? - A. I think it was about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were in the office when I came in? - A. Myself and Mr. Haydon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nobody else there? - A. Not at the time when he first came in; there were two or three gentlemen came in during the time that he sat there.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did I leave the office? - A.Between five and six o'clock; after Mr. Haydon left the room, he followed me.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present when Mr. Maddocks was paying the prize-money of the Powerful? - A. I was, at the White-lion, Wych-street, about one o'clock, on Monday, the 28th of January; the prisoner came in, and said, I believe to Mr. Maddocks, I am not sure which he addressed, we were both together; he asked if we were paying the Powerful that day; he was answered, yes, and asked what demand he had; Mr. Maddocks asked for his certificate, upon which he produced a piece of paper, which I never looked at.</p>

            , of the Powerful. I told Mr. Maddocks, he was not the man. I then addressed the man myself, and told him, this is the second time that you have come in this way, and we must now secure you; he sat down then, and said, he would stay till he got his money; I said, I would send for a constable; he stopped several hours; several gentlemen spoke to him about it; he said, he was not to be frightened out of his money; I asked him, who was the purser of the ship; he said, Mr. Burke; he was asked, if he would swear to it, and he said, he would take his oath, that Mr. Burke was the purser at the time of the capture; a great deal of that conversation passed, till near about six o'clock, when I went away, and then the prisoner followed me, and said, he would stick by me till he had got his money. When I had got upon Ludgate-hill, he was laying hold of me; I told him to be quiet; and then he cried out, robbers, and said, I had robbed him; a great number of people came round, and I asked if they knew any constable; several constables and patrols came up; I desired the constable to take charge of him, and he desired the constable to take charge of me, for that I had robbed him; the constable asked him, how I had robbed him; the prisoner said, I had forged his will and power while he was at sea, and done him out of his money.</p>
               <p>Q. You were both of you confined? - A. Yes, and kept till morning, when we were taken before the Magistrate; the Magistrate asked him, what he had to say against me; he said, nothing, and I was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened before one of the Aldermen,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200059"/>I believe? - A. Yes, Alderman Staines; but the charge against him being in Middlesex, he was sent to Hatton-garden, to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told the prisoner, when you were with Mr. Maddocks, that you had received the prize-money for the real William Harper by virtue of a power? - A. Yes; somewhere about the month of October last, the prisoner came to my apartments before, and demanded the money, saying he was the real man; I told him then, you cannot come to personate little Harper, if you do, I will send for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the real Harper belonging to the Powerful? - A. Yes; I dare say I have been with him a hundred times.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he at all like the William Harper who is now trying? - A. No; he is a very little man.(The prisoner was a remarkable tall stout man).</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are positive this is not the right man? - A. I am very certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what this man said in the office at Hatton garden before Mr. Blamire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Who was in the office at the time I came in? - A. At the time he first came in I believe only Mr. Maddox and me; some other men or women might have been in, who came for money, I will not say positively.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Haydon.) Q.Will you tell us what the prisoner said when he was before the Magistrate, and what he did? - A.When the Magistrate questioned him whether he was the real man or not, he said, he was not, but was a relation of the real man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce any thing before the Magistrate? - A. The Magistrate asked him how he came to personate the man with that forged certificate; he said, he thought he should sooner get it that way than by a power of attorney that he had in his pocket from the real man; he had delivered up the power of attorney previously at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. That is executed by a mark? - A. Yes; I immediately said, it was a forgery, for the man can write extremely well; I have seen him write often, and have received letters from him; the Magistrate asked him how he came to lay hold of me in the street; and he said, he thought it would frighten me out of the money.</p>

Of late I had missed a great number of penny pieces at different times, from the top of a chest of drawers in my own bed-room; they were all piled up in shillingsworths. On Tuesday night, the 12th of this month, I was watching for the prisoner's coming up in the room adjoining, which my servant sleeps in; he came up stairs into his own room, and, after pulling off his shoes and stockings, he came into my room; his room is at one end of a passage, about four yards long, and my room is at the other end; his door is to the left, and mine to the right; he went in without any hesitation round the bed to the drawers where the penny pieces were; I had the door open a little way exactly behind him; he took one shillingsworth, and put it into his right hand pocket; he then took a second shillingsworth, and he was putting it into his pocket, I jumped out upon him; they were piled up in shillingsworths, there were twenty-six shillingsworths in a row, and the odd shillingsworth was at the end; I said, Charles, is it possible that it is you that have been robbing me; I should as soon have thought my own father would have robbed me as you; I then called my wife, and she came up; she then called up my servant,

On the 24th of January, in the night, or early in the morning of the 25th, the horse was gone; my servant called me up about six o'clock, as near as I can guess, and told me of it; I said, which horse is it; and he said, Prince; and that very day, the 25th, I found my horse in Smithfield, tied up to the rail; I looked at him, and said to a man, of the name of Duffield, who is here, what is this horse to fell; he said, yes; I said, what do you ask for him; he said, thirteen guineas; says I, I should like to see him go a little, is he a found one; he said, he did not know; I said, is he a good drawer; he answered me, yes; pray how long have you had him; he said, sir, I had him this morning; says I, it is my horse, pray how came you by him this morning; he said, it was not his horse, but he was a servant to Mr. Life; I said, where is Mr. Life; he said, he would fetch him, but I would not let him go without me; I went with him to Mr. Life, at the King's-head, in Smithfield; he called to his master, and said, master, this is a stolen horse we have got here, this gentleman owns it; I had told the man, it was stolen from me, and I would swear to him; Life said immediately, I changed for him this morning, and I gave the man three guineas and a half, and a poney; I said, that is nothing to me, for if you do not find the man, I will keep you and your man both in custody; I sent the horse to the Rose and Crown, in Smithfield; and going across Smithfield with Life's man, he saw the prisoner at the bar upon a poney; Life's man went up to him, and said, that was a stolen horse Mr. Life had of you; I said, get off the poney, for the horse that you have been changing for him, belonged to me; says I, how came you by this horse; why, says he, I bought it yesterday in the afternoon, about three o'clock, at Epping; I said, who did you by it of, at Epping; he said, he did not know; says I, pray what might you give for it; he said, five guineas and a half. I then sent from the Rose and Crown, for an officer from Hatton-garden, and he was taken away. I never saw the prisoner before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was your horse? - A. Yes, it was a bay gelding, about sixteen hands high.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was on your premises, on the 24th of January? - A. I am not sure, for I have another farm; and I cannot say that I had seen my horse for three or four days; my servant is here, who looked after the horses.</p>

               <p>Q. Are either of the other horses claimed? - A.No, only that one.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the horse that Stevens claimed, the same that your master bought of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell Mr. Stevens it was a good drawer? - A. Only from thoughts; he was chased in the shoulder, and looked like a good drawing-horse, only he was lame.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Stevens). Was your horse lame? - A. Yes; it is a little tender before, otherwise a very fine horse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The horse that I sold to Mr. Life, I bought at Epping on Thursday evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sitting then? - A. No, I was standing; when he had got me back, he put his hand into my waistcoat pocket, and took out my purse, containing three guineas and a half-guinea; he then handed it away to another person in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that other person? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. A man or a woman? - A. A man; he ran out of doors directly as soon as he saw a bustle; then I challenged the prisoner, and told him he had robbed me; I then went up to Serjeant Smith's house, and told him I had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you charge him with it? - A. Not then, because I was a stranger there; I went to his house, told him I had been robbed, and I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200063"/>him to go back with me; we went back to the same house, and I pointed him out the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was still there when you went back? - A. Yes; and then the serjeant went out and procured a watchman, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course your purse was not found upon him? - A. No; I saw him deliver it away with my own eyes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you, besides a wheelwright? - A. I belong to the Tower Hamlets; I am a recruit; I entered on the 2d or 3d of January.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were in the room? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there ten? - A. I cannot say; there might be eight, nine, or ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there were not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that you have indicted this man for a capital offence? - A. It is the laws of the land that does it, not me.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you had received your money on that day? - A. A part of it; I received four guineas, a seven shilling piece, and a shilling, about ten or eleven o'clock; I went to the Three Colts about nine at night.</p>
               <p>Q.How many public-houses had you been in before you got to the Three Colts? - A.Only one, the Artichoke, which was my lodgings; I staid there till it might be seven or eight o'clock at night, and, to the best of my knowledge, I was not in any company after twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were you in company with before twelve o'clock? - A. Two of my serjeants, and another person, I cannot tell his name.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a drop of drink there, had not you? - A. Yes, and something to eat too; we had a drop of brandy and water.</p>
               <p>Q. How many tumblers had you? - A. To the best of my knowledge only two.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did you not drink part of six tumblers of brandy and water at that house? - A. I am sure there was no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you pay there? - A. I paid six or seven shillings, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q.What had you for dinner? - A. A pot of beer and half a pound of mutton chops, but nobody eat but me.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had no more brandy and water among you than two tumblers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And three of you spent six or seven shillings? - A. No, they went away directly, it was my lodgings, and I owed 2s. 6d. for beer and victuals that I had had a day or two before, and I paid my serjeant ten or eleven shillings that I owed him; my liquor came to fourteen or fifteen pence among three of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you had no more liquor that day at the Artichoke? - A. I had no more than a third share of the two tumblers of brandy and water and a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. That you mean to swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Clarke? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he there? - A. I do not know, he was not with me; I saw him afterwards, but not at the time we had the liquor; he was in the tap-room when I had my dinner.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear he was not in the house at the time you were drinking the brandy and water? - A. I don't know where he was; he might be a mile off for any thing I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Sowers? - A. No; there were several persons came backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, at the Artichoke, that, after you had drank a pot of beer, you called out, that you would fight with any body? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I should tell you, but I see you are not to be frightened, that I have witnesses to prove all this - Where did you go to from the Artichoke? - A. I have no more to say at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to next? - A. To where I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go no where else first? - A. To the best of my knowledge, no where.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober? - A. Yes; I never went into any public-house but them two.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you did not play at cards with any other person but the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you played with the prisoner? - A. Yes, one Smith, he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you sat down to play with Smith, did you drink any thing at the Three Colts? - A. We had a pot of beer among six or seven of us, all drank that were in the house; there was only one person in the whole place that I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you play at? - A. All fours, for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you play more than one game with Smith? - A. I believe not; if I did, it was for a pint; I know I played for a pot of beer; but whether it was one game or two games for it, I don't know; then I played with Mr. Head, the prisoner at the bar, for a pint of beer, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you never drank any gin in your life? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not play for any gin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not with any body in that house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know what tosting up is, perhaps too? - A. Yes; Mr. Head and I tossed up for a quartern of gin.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200064"/>Q. You are sure it was not a half pint of gin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Who won the gin? - A. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank none yourself? - A. I did just take a drop, and that was all, for it was kept pretty well away from me: if there had been a gallon, it would have been gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not play with Head for any thing but a pint of beer? - A. Yes, for sixpence first, and the double acquits.</p>
               <p>Q.You first played for the beer, then toffed up for the gin, and then played for the shilling? - A. Yes, I believe it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you did not go double acquits for the gin afterwards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that shilling to be laid out in the purchase of gin? - A. No, it was for dry money to put in our pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink any gin after that, upon your oath? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor any more beer? - A. Yes; after I had apprehended him for robbing me, I took a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, after you had been robbed, you took a pint to drown the recollection of being robbed? - A. I was dry, and took a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you mean to swear positively, that you neither played for any more gin, or drank any more gin at that house on that day? - A. I believe I did not, to the best of my knowledge; I had no more, I think, I could take a safe oath of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take a safe oath of it? - A. To the best of my knowledge I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you mean to swear positively that he robbed you? - A. That I swear positively, because I saw him do it.</p>
               <p>Q.After the robbery, you did not attempt to secure the prisoner? - A. No, because they seemed to be all one side; they seemed to be all of a gang; they were all strangers to me, except one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to that one person to assist you in apprehending him? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, when the prisoner was had before the Magistrate, did not the constable of the night take his word for his appearance the next day? - A. No, he was out upon bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Who bailed him? - A.Serjeant Grant, of the Tower Hamlets.</p>
               <p>Q. And he made his appearance the next day? - A. He was brought there by the watchman.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What led you into this house? - A. I had a thing or two pawned, and I was going to get them out; and when I came to this house, I met a serjeant, and he asked me to go in and have a pint of beer; that was the only reason of my going in.</p>
               <p>Q. The proposal for play came from you? - A. They were at play, and I said, I would give either of them a game for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you were sober? - A. I was as sober as any man can be that ever was born of a woman.</p>

             sworn. - I am a soldier in the second regiment of Tower Hamlets: I came into the Three Colts about eight o'clock, I might have been there about three quarters of an hour when serjeant Wheeler and the prosecutor came in together; Cavill and he had a game at cards for one pint of beer; and then Cavill played with me two games for two pints of beer, and when he had done playing with me he played with the prisoner at the bar; they played about eight games for a pint of beer each game, and sixpence, and then there was a wrangle about a sixpence; the prisoner won the shilling, and it was to be left to all the company to decide it, and then Cavill put the shilling into his pocket; every one of the company said he had done wrong in putting it in his pocket, for he had lost the shilling; then Cavill and the prisoner went tossing for half pint of gin, and then he tossed for another half pint, and then he tossed with a soldier belonging to the East London Militia for another half pint; there were three or four half pints, I will not be sure which; Cavill had put the shilling in his pocket, the company said, the prisoner ought to have his shilling, for he had won it, and then they had words; they took hold of one another's collar, and began to shake one another; the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200065"/>soner gave Cavill a shove against the box, and he reeled against the box, there was nobody in the box but themselves; there was a little fifer belonging to the regiment in the next box with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Cavill say that the prisoner had robbed him? - A. I heard him say that he had lost his money, and the prisoner had taken it, and then he went and fetched serjeant Smith; serjeant Wheeler was gone, he was very much in liquor indeed; Cavill pointed out the prisoner at the bar as the man that had done it, and then he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prosecutor his share of the gin? - A.There were four of them, and I believe he drank glass for glass with them, as far as I saw; I had one glass of it, and that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he his share of the beer? - A. Yes; there were eight or nine pints, and he had the pot to drink whenever he liked, as far as what I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober? - A. To say that he was sober I would not for the world; he was not so drunk but he knew what he was about; but he was not sober.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Were you sober yourself? - A. Yes, as sober as I am this minute.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When Cavill had fetched Smith, Cavill said, that is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard it stated here that he pointed to him but said nothing - are you sure he said, that is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that he had a game with Wheeler before he played with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he had his share of the beer and the gin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.There was a quarrel, and each laid hold of the other's collar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Should you not have seen, if the prisoner had put his hand into the prosecutor's waistcoat-pocket, if it had been so? - A. I think I should have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor reeled? - A. Yes; and said he had lost his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner hand the prosecutor's purse from his waistcoat-pocket to another person, and must you have seen it if he had? - A. I think I must.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you see any person go away at that particular time when he was reeling? - A. No; I saw no person go out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You are positive there were more than two games played by the prosecutor? - A. Yes; more than four.</p>
               <p>Q. That you say upon your oath? - A. Yes; I think eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, are you sure that the prosecutor had a share of all the liquor that was drank? - A. Yes; I think he had, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a soldier in the second regiment of Tower Hamlets, I lodge at the Artichoke public-house: On Saturday the 12th of January, the prosecutor came in, and serjeant Smith, and a grenadier and another went into a room where the prosecutor was, and I saw five or six shillingsworths of brandy and water go into the room where they were, I did not see them drink it; the prosecutor afterwards came into the tap-room, and called for a pot of beer, and drank the whole of it, and immediately caught hold of my collar, called me a b - r, and told me he was able to fight any man in the tap-room; after that, I went out and left him.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL ARROWSMITH sworn. - I am a weaver, in Wilmot-street, Bethnal-green: On the 12th of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, I happened to go into the Three Colts, the prisoner was there; and some time after that, the prosecutor came in with one serjeant Wheeler, he came in and they were playing at cards; the prosecutor said, he had as much right to play as anybody; upon that, he played with serjeant Wheeler a game or two at cards; after that, he played with one Smith, a young man, a soldier, two games or three; after that, he played five or six games with the prisoner, and then they got up from cards and tossed up for half-a-pint of gin; they had played for a pint of beer each game, I believe, and drank it between their two selves; they tossed up for three half pints of gin, and each drank their share of it; then they sat down to play at cards for another half pint of gin, which did not come in, because there was a scuffle about the shilling, the prisoner won the game, and the prosecutor took up the shilling, and went to the fire-side; the prisoner said, give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200066"/>me my shilling, for I have won it; the prosecutor said, I have won it; a dispute arose, and the prisoner put up his hands and took him by the collar; the prosecutor put his hands up just the same to him; they held one another for the space of a minute or two, and then the prosecutor dropped his hands, and said, I am robbed; the prisoner immediately dropped his, and said, of what?</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prosecutor said, he was robbed, before the prisoner had got his hands from his collar? - A. I am positive of it. When the prisoner said, of what, he said, of my purse, and three guineas and a half; then the prisoner sat down, and never stirred till the patrol and serjean took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the prisoner had taken a purse out of the waistcoat pocket of the prosecutor, were you near enough to have seen it? - A. Yes; there was nobody at all between us, and I am positive that not a soul went out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man had gone out of the house at that time, and if the prisoner had put his hand in his waistcoat pocket, you must have seen it? - A. Yes, I stood as close to the door as I am to this pillar.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you observe whether the prosecutor was drunk or sober? - A. He was drunk, I am positive, for when he went to the fire-place, he put his hands up to the mantle shelf to hold himself steady.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, I don't know that I need trouble you with any observations upon this Case, it rests upon that one man's evidence entirely, and you hear how materially he is contradicted. <rs id="t17990220-60-verdict317" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. How long after was it? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Two or three days? - A. No, it was not.</p>

               <p>Q. And the Justice sent you all about your business? - A. No, he did not; the Justice said, you had better go and make it up; he said, do you want to make a hundred pounds, or five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you live in Whitechapel parish - is it not at Saltpeter-bank where you and the gang live? - A. No; I live at No. 69, Rosemary-lane.</p>

Did you know that basket? - A.Yes, I am positive to the basket; I have carried the same basket for above a twelvemonth every day; I said to a young man, Smith has stole a basket of bread, for he was out of place yesterday, I am sure he has not got into place again already; I saw Skelton about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, and he told me he had lost his basket; I told him I had seen Smith with his basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly satisfied that the prisoner was the man you saw with the basket? - A. Yes, I have known him these nine years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that the basket you saw upon his shoulder was Mrs. Harris's basket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I deny the charge that is alledged against me.</p>

               <p>Q. Could any body have seen it that passed by accidentally? - A. No, it was covered over.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were the coals kept? - A. Behind the house, in a place very much exposed to the weather, and there was a great deal of snow among the coals; I got up in the morning and went to the top of the house, where I had the command of the yard, in order to watch; at nine o'clock the men went to breakfast, the prisoner remained in the shop till the last; about five minutes after the rest of the men were gone, I saw him come out of the shop, and go to the place where the copper was concealed; I saw him stoop down and take up something, but his back being turned towards me, I could not see what it was; he then went into the shop again, and I heard a noise, apparently like the found of the same copper, there was no other copper kept near the premises, I had other sheet-copper, but not in that part of the house; I saw him come out of the shop and come up the yard, and go out at the street-door, I desired one of the witnesses to watch him; there was afterwards found, upon the anvil where he had been working, coals and snow.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what he had been doing with it? - A. It was not rolled up in a compass small enough to put under his coat, and he had been beating it to flat it; I know the found of copper well, and I am sure it was the same.</p>

             sworn. - I am a brazier and ironmonger, I live with my brother: On Monday evening, previous to the discovery, the housekeeper sent one of our lads for some coals, and he brought a piece of copper to me; one of the gentlemen in Court went with me to weigh the copper, it weighed four pounds, it was then marked with my name, and a private mark, and put under the coals, where he had found it; the next morning, by my brother's desire, I concealed myself in the adjacent coal-hole about a quarter before six, and continued there till a quarter after nine, when I saw the prisoner take the same piece of copper from under the coals.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the copper so far hid that it could not have been seen? - A. Yes, it was covered with coals and snow; I saw him carry it into the smith's shop, he knocked it up, and put it under his coat.</p>

             down, he marked the copper, I marked it after him, and we sent him to conceal it where it was; when the prosecutor came home, we went to examine it, and returned it into the same place, and covered it with snow and coals; the prosecutor requested me to stay at his house that night, being a stranger to the prisoner, that I might follow him in the morning to discover where he disposed of this copper: about a quarter after nine the next morning, I saw the prisoner come up the yard, I followed him; he went through three alleys, and at the bottom of Upper Well-alley he went into an iron-shop; I crossed the way, and went into a house with a servant of mine, to watch his return; a few minutes after, the man came out of the house, it is a Jew that keeps the house; he crossed the way, two doors below where I was, to a baker's shop, I suppose to get change, to pay for this copper; he returned to the house, and in a few minutes afterwards the prisoner came out; I walked to the farther end of the passage that be might not suspect I was watching him; I saw no more of the prisoner, but returned to the prosecutor to inform him of what I had observed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the copper here? - A. No; the search-warrant was about five minutes too late, the man had made off with it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the man went out of the yard you did not see him take the copper at all? - A. No; what I waited to serve my friend for was, to get an opportunity of taking the receiver as well as the thief.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that every person who worked for the prosecutor were in the habit of going backwards and forwards to the place where the copper was concealed, and declaring his innocence of the charge.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury. From the indictment which has been stated, by my learned Friend, you perceive, that you are called upon to enquire of a robbery committed in the Mint, for which robbery the prisoner at the bar is indicted as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200072"/>the principal offender; the two persons who have just retired from the bar, are not at all involved in the consideration of the guilt of the person at present standing there, they not being looked upon in the present case as principal offenders, but only as accessaries after the fact.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, You will find, in the course of your enquiry here, that the robbery complained of is of as bold an aspect as has been heard of late. It happened on the 20th of December last that the offence was committed; it has been told you, by my learned Friend, that the property upon the present occasion is described in three different ways in this indictment, on account of the manner in which the different persons concerned became possessed of the property; it was necessary so to describe it, conformable to the custom that has prevailed. The Governor and Company of the Bank of England are interested, because the bullion which goes from the Bank to the Mint in order to be coined, goes there in ingots, is delivered over to the officers of the Mint, who have the custody therefore of it, and when it is complete in its coinage, it is returned back to the Bank; so that you perceive, the Governor and Company of the Bank of England have a property in the bullion; that being delivered to the officers of his Majesty's Mint, they, as officers, become likewise possessed of, and have the custody of it; and, upon the present occasion, those gentlemen, who are called moniers of the Mint, have an immediate custody of it from the stage that I shall presently describe to you; and the gentleman upon whom the robbery has been committed, Mr. Finch, being an immediate servant of their's, and having the immediate charge, custody, and possession of this property, the robbery being committed upon his person, and the property, which I have so described, taken from him, the offence is complete, And you being satisfied that it is the property, so far as it will be necessary to consider the property, of the moniers of the Mint, or he, as having the custody of it, that will constitute the offence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, It happened on the 20th of December, that the prisoner at the bar, who is a <rs id="t17990220-68-deflabel366" type="occupation">soldier in the third regiment of Guards</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t17990220-68-defend571 t17990220-68-deflabel366"/>, with another comrade of his, and two other men, I believe, belonging to the Guards, were employed in the press-room at the Mint; it being customary, in order to carry on the business of coining, to take the advantage of those men who are upon the spot, that they may come to turn what they call the fly. You, very probably know what that sort of instrument is, requiring a considerable degree of force to impress the likeness upon the coin; the gold being first cast, and then formed into blanks, it is delivered by a monier to this gentleman, Mr. Finch, in different bags, of different quantities, placed by him in a chest, where he sits and seeds the dies; and the impression being taken out, is put into another place: in this employ was Turball; on the morning of the 20th of December, his comrade, of the Guards, a man of the name of Daiton, was present; and it is the custom, in that office of the Mint, for the persons to go to their breakfast about nine o'clock; Mr. Finch being the immediate person superintending that business, dismissed them, as he thought, telling them that was the hour when they were to go to their refreshment; Dalton and Turnbull, and the other men, retired from the press-room for a little while; when the other two persons were gone, Turnbull and Dalton returned into the room; Turnbull advanced up to the spot where Mr. Finch was sitting, while Dalton kept the door; when he approached Mr. Finch, who had been sitting near the same place during the morning, Turnbull presented a pistol to him, and demanded the key of the chest; at first, Mr. Finch was not very much dismayed, he attempted, I believe, to seize the pistol, but not succeeding in that, the prisoner being a much more powerful man than himself; upon his recovering the pistol completely, he swore he would shoot him, unless he immediately delivered him the key; the key, I believe, was lying by him, and not immediately in his pocket: during this time, no assistance seemed to be offered by Dalton, and Mr. Finch began to waver, and was very considerably alarmed. I do not exactly know, he will describe himself, in what manner he behaved. There was another gentleman in the room, an elderly gentleman, of the name of Chambers, he seeing what was going on, made his advance to Turnbull, and interrogated him in this way: Are you mad, are you in your senses; what are you doing? upon which, Turnbull immediately forced him to retreat, I believe, forced him into a passage. Mr. Finch, when he saw that Turnbull had got possession of the key, he being upon his legs, was served in the same manner that Mr. Chambers was before; they were shoved into a passage, and there kept. When Turnbull had, therefore, the coast clear, and nobody to have offered the least sort of impediment, then he went to the chest and took away different bags; he had taken one bag out of this place before Mr. Finch had followed Mr. Chambers; then he took other bags away, I believe, to the amount, pretty nearly, of 2308 guineas. Here then, the offence seems complete. And with respect to the man who is now at the bar, you will have little more to enquire of, than the evidence relating to these facts. Here then the matter will first of all require the consideration of the learned Judge. I apprehend that no difficulty can, by any means, rise in the way of the most speedy determination. A robbery, as it is called in law, must be a taking from the person of another, by putting him in fear; but, as you very well know, I am sure many of you know, that the possession of a thing is not immediately limited to any definite space, but may, by construction, be carried farther or nearer; so it is with regard to personal possession, that is not confined to the actual limit of the body, but is co-extensive with the person's presence of the man; therefore, putting a personin fear, and taking from him that which is his property, and which he has the possession of in his sight, and in his presence, is certainly a taking from his person, and therefore will constitute a robbery. Why then, with respect to the crime itself in the outset, merely going upon these facts, it will be complete. This happened on the 20th: soon after the commission of this crime, Turnbull, with the property he had about him, made his escape; he happened to go one way, when Dalton went another; how it happened, it is not for me to guess, but so the fact appears; whether it arose from timidity, whether from alarm, or whether from honesty, it is impossible for me to say; he some how or other spread an alarm, and it was soon discovered. Soldiers, being necessarily about that place, came to the spot, and Mr. Franklin, the immediate superior of Mr. Finch, hearing some disturbance in the press-room, he went to the spot,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200073"/>where he did not find Mr. Finch, Mr. Finch and Chambers at that time being in the place where Turnbull had put them: Turnbull effected his escape for that morning; of course, upon the discovery that was made, every activity was put in force in order to discover the man; he was not heard of from that time till the 5th of January following, when he was apprehended at Dover. He had arrived at Dover in a vessel belonging to a man of the name of Rufford; but Rufford not being contented to carry him to the coast of France, where he wanted to go, he made what enquiry he could at Dover to effect that purpose there; first of all by a servant of Rufford, he was led to a man of the name of Ward; Ward happened to have in his possession at the very moment of his application a description of the person of Turnbull, and a description of the robbery at the Mint, and therefore he immediately made his application to another man of the name of Collison, a constable, and another person was likewise called in, three of them together, who, instead of enabling him to escape to France, took him into custody. Upon taking him into custody, and searching his person, 1000 and odd guineas were found about him, upon which occasion, without much reluctance, he acknowledged to Ward and to the other persons that were with him, that he was the man who had committed the robbery at the Mint; they then took him to a gentleman, the Town-clerk, I believe, of Dover, and he was sent to town.</p>

               <p>Here then, in the front of the case, will stand his confession, which will be complete evidence; but, upon the evidence of Mr. Finch, there will not remain the least doubt, that, without that confession, the evidence would be irresistible. Thus stands this most uncommon, this most andacious, this most intrepid robbery. At present, therefore, you will hear these circumstances from the evidence; and, I apprehend, no doubt can be entertained of the case, and it will be your duty to find him guilty.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, before now, some questions have arisen with respect to the parish in which this robbery was committed, that question, my Lord knows, is now perfectly at rest. Then, upon the present occasion, it is necessary for me to state to you what was the immediate situation of Mr. Finch: he is a young man, who is an apprentice to a monier; the moniers are described in the indictment by their names; they are,

            , John Nicholl, and Richard Franklin. These gentlemen, who go on in the employ of the Mint, are immediately the superintendants of the coinage; they take to themselves a set of young gentlemen, who are brought up to succeed to these places. In this situation Mr. Finch was then acting; so that he certainly was in custody of all these several bags that I have described. These, gentlemen the moniers, are responsible for the failure of the lowest species of weight after the bullion is delivered to them; so that they have, to every intent and purpose, that sort of custody upon which the depredation mentioned in the present instance is imputed.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any blanks delivered to you that morning? - A. I had eight journies of blanks delivered to me to coin.</p>
               <p>Q. What is a journey? - A. A bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much was contained in each? - A. Six hundred and sixty-eight blanks in each bag, to be made into guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom were they delivered to you? - A. By Mr. Franklin, one of the moniers.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you begin to work in the press-room? - A. About seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it is necessary to have four people to work the fly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the four people? - A. The prisoner, Turnbull; a man, who turns out to be Dalton, but I did not then know his name; and two of the Tower Hamlets militia.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your business? - A. To seed the fly.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, I believe, to put a blank between the two dies, that it may be stamped with the proper impression? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what end of the room do you sit? - A.Sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another. At the end where the fire is, there is a hole in the ground before the press, where I sit to feed the dies.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these eight bags of blanks at the time you were at work? - A. In the same room, at the other side of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did these people, who were managing the fly, stay in the room? - A.Till nearly nine o'clock, we always go to breakfast at that time; I told them all to go to breakfast; they all went out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a Mr. Chambers in the room at the time? - A. Yes, he is surveyor of the presses.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the nature of that business? - A.He takes care of the dies.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any charge of the blanks? - A. No, that was my charge.</p>
               <p>Q. After these people had left the room to breakfast, what happened? - A. In about a minute, or scarcely a minute, two of them returned; Turnbull came in first, and Dalton came in next, and shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Dalton remain within side of the room?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200074"/>- A. Yes; Turnbull then came up to me with a pistol, and said, give me the key, saying so once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the key? - A. It then laid before me, I had just taken it out of my pocket; I caught hold of the pistol, which Turnbull wrested from me in an instant: seeing the man at the door offer no assistance, I was so struck with fear, that I could not resist any farther; Turnbull then held the pistol to me again, saying, give me the key; he swore several times; I do not immediately recollect the oaths; he took the key up from off the press, where it laid before me, unlocked the chest, took out one bag, which he put within his coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see him do that? - A. I saw him do that, he put it within his coat; I do not know whether it was a pocket or bag, or what.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that which was contained in the bag he took? - A. Coined guineas.</p>
               <p>Q.What year had you been coining that morning? - A. The date of 1798; I offered to move out of the hole where I was sitting, when Turnbull said, if you offer to stir, I will shoot you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after he had taken possession of this one bag? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he come up to you at that time? - A. No, he only took a step towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards might the trunk be from you at that time? - A.Five or six yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after he had threatened you? - A. Mr. Chambers, who had been making breakfast, about four or five yards from Turnbull, came up with a poker in his hand, and said you are mad, man, what are you doing, consider what you are about; Turnbull put the pistol to Mr. Chambers's forehead, and shoved him into a passage; I then made for the door that goes out into the Mint.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that the door that Turnbull came in at? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was Dalton there then? - A. I did not see him there.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see him in the room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. If you had got out at that door, you could have given the alarm? - A. Yes, I could have got to the monier; Turnbull came up to me, and holding the pistol to my ear, said, go in there too, pointing to the passage where he had put Mr. Chambers; I went in, and he locked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you effected your deliverance? - A. We were let out in about five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you returned, what deficiency of money was there? - A. Four bags were gone, but part of one of the bags was spilt in the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were missing altogether? - A. I do not know exactly; Mr. Franklin weighed them.</p>
               <p>Q.Turnbull had been at work two hours? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he is the man? - A. I am certain he is the man, he had worked there several times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.What is Mr. Chambers? - A. A surveyor of the presses.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the charge of the money, in consequence of your being an apprentice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And only in the character of an apprentice? - A. Yes, I am apprentice to Mr. Franklin.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the moniers do not trust the money with any body? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the gold bullion sent from the Bank entrusted to you and your brethren, for the purpose of being coined? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you and your brethren responsible for all that bullion that is so sent? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom are you accountable? - A. To the Bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200075"/>Q. The last witness is your apprentice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the morning of the 20th of December, what you entrusted to his care? - A. I do. On the 20th, about seven o'clock in the morning, I delivered to Mr. Finch eight bags of guinea blanks, each bag containing 668 pieces, for the purpose of being coined. About nine o'clock there was an alarm, I was in the millroom; I went to the press-room, which is about seventy yards, I believe, or thereabouts, where Mr. Finch was employed; I opened the press-room door, but did not see either Mr. Finch or Mr. Chambers there, the two persons who ought to have been there: in consequence of some information, I saw them let out of a passage that goes out of the press-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the place where these bags were deposited? - A. I opened the chest, I think it was shut; I opened it, and saw three bags and part of another at the bottom of the chest, and the contents of another bag in a tray at the press, and the bag lying by it; I took them up to the mill-room, and weighed them; I found deficient 2308 guineas</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in the press-room that morning yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you had not seen the prisoner that morning? - A. No, I had not; I had seen him before, several times, coming to fetch the blanks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know whether the moniers are incorporated or not? - A. I believe we call ourselves so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you, or are you not, a corporation? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you undertake to say whether you are or not? - A. I can say we are not.</p>
               <p>Q. You received the gold from the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You receive gold from other corporate bodies, besides the Bank? - A. No, we do not; we received it from the Mint-office.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Bank send you a quantity of bullion, you are to return a certain quantity of guineas? - A. We return weight for weight.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, if they sent you 20lbs. weight of gold, you return them 20lbs. weight of guineas? - A.Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is the press-room in the Tower of London? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner Turnbull, do you know him? - A. I know him by sight. On the 5th of January, about eleven o'clock at night, or between eleven and twelve, he came to me, and wanted somebody in regard of carrying him out of this country.</p>
               <p>Q. He wanted a boat? - A. Yes, or any thing else. I suspected that he could not be any thing of any consequence, and I thought it might be Mr. Turnbull; I had a bill in my pocket at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to give you, if you could have got a boat? - A.Thirty pounds. I applied to Mr. Hills, and apprized him of the business, and he went and informed Mr. Collison.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Turnbull gone away from you after the first application? - A. Yes; he was to meet me again at my store-house, which he did; and Mr. Hills and Collison came to the store-house; we all met together, and they took him down to the guard-house, and examined him, to know whether he was the man or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Then what did they say to him, when they took him to the guard-house? - A. They desired to search him, to see if he had any fire-arms about him, and they found upon him 1010 guineas in a belt round his body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Turnbull say any thing about this money? - A. He said, there were 1000 all but two guineas; and when we came to count them, there were 1010.</p>

Yes, on the 6th of January, about one o'clock in the morning, in consequence of the information Ward gave me, I went to my brother officer, Collison, and then I went with him to Ward's store-house, there I saw the prisoner; I said to him, sir, are you ready? he said, yes, I am all ready, and spoke to one of the men to bring his trunk; and just as he got to the cill of the door, I collared him, and my partner took him round the body; I told him, he was my prisoner; we searched him, and he said, he had got a belt round his body, containing 1000 guineas all to two; (produces the belt); I counted them, and there were 1010. As he was coming up, he said, he thought he could save himself from death; that he would tell his concern, and he would have the money in a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he mean by his concern? - A.That he would impeach the persons that were concerned with him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is your press-room in the city of London? - A. It is, and has always been so accounted; there is the old wall remaining now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Is that wall eastward or westward of the press-room? - A. It runs in a direct line from north to south, so as to lead from the mill-room to the press-room.</p>

               <p>The arguments of Counsel will be given at the end of the next Session.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. What I have to say is merely to clear the innocent. On the 20th of December I was employed at the Mint by Mr. Finch to go and get some strong men to work in the press-room. I went into the barrack with Dalton, and asked who would work at the Mint; Dalton said, he would go; we went to work, we finished six journies, and after that Mr. Finch desired us to go to breakfast. Now it was a customary thing for one to stop, but he told us all to go; I was in hopes he would have said, one of you stop, and then I should have done the business by myself, the two Tower Hamlets men went first; I used to go to breakfast with Dalton: when I had got outside the door, I said, Dalton, you come in here; says he, what do you want; says I, don't mind, come here, I told him to follow me, and he came into the room; he said again, what do you want; and I said, I had left something, he knew nothing at all about this; I pulled out a pistol, and presented it to Mr. Finch, and demanded the key; Dalton said, several times, what are you at, and then he ran away and gave an alarm to the serjeant of the guard. There is another thing; I wish to say something more concerning other people. There were about four very respectable housekeepers in the City of London concerned; I immediately went to one of their houses, and there I stopped till the 29th of December, and got a suit of cloaths, one hundred pounds worth of Bank notes, and about a hundred old guineas. I, and another that was unsuspected, went and agreed to get a boat. I went away with my accomplices, who are unsuspected people, and are now housekeepers in London; they are unsuspected at this moment; I said to them, gentlemen, I am going on a shooting party, and shall he glad of your company; several said, they were engaged otherwise; and, at last I persuaded Bryce and Pollard to go with me; I had a gun in my hand; and upon my promising to pay all the expences, they agreed they would go with me. When we had got into Essex, I left them, and went on board a smack, I agreed for my passage to France; I gave them 98l. worth of notes. Says the captain, I had 100l. for taking a man over that had committed murder, of the name of Thomas; he said, he lived at Dunkirk, and desired me to call upon him. I believe it was the captain's inclination to take me to France, but he came to me and told me his men were not willing to go, but he would get somebody else to take me over; he said, he had got somebody to do it for 30l. and this rascally captain, after he had got the 98l. kept it.</p>

Yes; I then offered to move out of the hole where I was sitting to feed the dies, and Turnbull, stepping towards me, said, if you stir I will shoot you; Mr. Chambers was making breakfast at the fire-place.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did that bag contain? - A. Six hundred and sixty-eight coined guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. About what time did you deliver these bags to Mr. Finch? - A. About seven o'clock in the morning; and about nine, in consequence of an alarm, I went down from the mill-room to the press-room, and I missed Mr. Chambers and Mr. Finch; I saw one of the labourers unlock the door of the passage that leads from the press-room to another part of the Tower, and let them out of that passage; I took up the money, and found deficient two thousand three hundred and eight guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. What were you come to London for with Drake? - A. To take some gentlemen upon a party of pleasure; Drake and I came with a post-chaise from Stroud to Dartford, and then we took the stage to London; I went to Drake's house, and after I had been there about half a hour, Mr. Bryce came to me to Mr. Drake's house, the Bell, in Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. In the City of London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What pasted when you, Drake, and Bryce, were together? - A.Bryce said, captain, will you go up stairs, and drink a bottle of wine; I said to Bryce, who is to pay me for this voyage that I am going upon; Bryce said, captain, I will pay you one fifty pounds to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock; and when we all go on board, you shall have the other fifty pounds, Mr. Bryce told me, that a chaise should be ready the next afternoon at three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet any of the parties again the next day? - A. About seven o'clock the next morning, Saturday the 29th.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any appointment made to meet at Drake's? - A. No; I was there the next morning at nine o'clock, and Bryce came at ten; he gave me a forty pound, and a ten pound, Bank of England note, they were to go in the chaise at three o'clock; I went at three o'clock, and he said, the chaise would not be ready before six.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay at Drake's? - A. Not all the time; Bryce came to me about half past five, and said, the chaise is ready, captain, are you ready to go; then Bryce and I went to the Inn, and the chaise was ready in about five minutes time, and we got into two chaises; we found at the Inn, Pollard and Turnbull, and a person unknown to me, but I knew those three extremely well; Bryce, and the person unknown, went into the first chaise; Mr. Pollard, myself, and Turnbull, were in the hind chaise, and the other chaise kept the head of us all the way; we travelled, as near as I can tell, three or four and twenty miles before we shifted horses, both chaises stopped at the same place; we alighted and had a dish of tea, and, in about five minutes, we were in the chaise again; we were not five minutes out of one chaise before we were in the other; we drove on together about twelve miles further, I do not know the name of the place.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you arrive at the end of your journey? - A. Between two and three o'clock in the morning, I believe near three; it was on the Sunday morning, the people were gone to bed; we knocked at the door, and they turned out, and we had a glass of gin a piece; Bryce then asked the landlord if he could find us a guide to go over the marshes to Holly haven; the landlord said he would go himself, what would you please to give me; Bryce offered him seven shillings; the landlord said he would not go under half-a-guinea; and then he hired the countryman to carry their coats.</p>
               <p>Q. Who hired the countryman to carry their coats? - A. Bryce; he asked half a-crown, and he gave him four shillings.</p>

               <p>Q.It must have been cold weather - did you set out to walk across the marshes? - A. Yes, it was very cold; we got to Holly-haven a little before five o'clock in the morning, as near as I could guess, it was a long time before day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got there, who paid the landlord, and the man for carrying the coats? - A. Bryce.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might that be from where you got out of the chaise? - A. About six miles.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name of that place? - A. Richmond Sluice-house.</p>
               <p>Q. All parties were very sung there? - A. Yes, very comfortable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your boat there? - A. No; she did not come till three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to expect your boat would have been there? - A. Yes; I expected she would have been there, because Mr. Drake gave her orders to go round there before we came to town.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done in consequence of that? - A. Pollard and Bryce went out shooting at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all the party breakfast together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you all dine together? - A. Yes; all in one room.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200079"/>Q.Was any thing done to hasten the boat round? - A. Yes; Bryce went round himself to Gravesend, to see if the vessel had gone round.</p>
               <p>Q. Where about is Holly-haven? - A. Upon the Essex coast, just before you come to Lee.</p>
               <p>Q. How is that by Gravesend? - A. Nearer the Nore.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Bryce get from Holly-haven to Gravesend? - A. By one of the wherries.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come back before your boat arrived? - A. No; I never saw his face after till the other day.</p>
               <p>Q. You had received fifty pounds - did he give you any more? - A. No; he gave the other fifty pounds to Turnbull, in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say he gave it to him for? - A. He gave it to Turnbull to give to me when they should be on board the vessel, I thought they were all going on a party of pleasure; before Bryce went away, he borrowed of me a two pound note, least he should be short of cash; when my boat came, my people came on shore, and had a bottle of wine; just before six o'clock in the evening, my two men, my son, myself, and Mr. Turnbull went on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Pollard then? - A. He came down to the platform, and the gentleman unknown; they shook hands with Turnbull, and they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then none of them went upon this failing party but Turnbull? - A. No; I thought they were all going; I got under weigh, and lay at Sheerness, made fast, and continued there all the next day, Monday; it blowed very hard, and Turnbull was very sick.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was sick, I suppose he went on shore? - A. No; he said he was afraid of getting cold; and on Tuesday morning we set fail, and got to a place called Ramsgate.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Turnbull go on shore at Ramsgate? - A. No; he said he was afraid of catching cold; then we went on to Dover, we got there on Thursday about eleven o'clock in the morning; as soon as I got there, I hauled my boat up, and got on shore; then Turnbull said, captain, what house do you use; I said, the sign of the Gun; he said, captain, I will come to you there in half an hour, and he came there to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did he go by? - A. I never heard his name in my life till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened at Dover? - A. We had a very comfortable dinner, and plenty of liquor, and walked about the town.</p>
               <p>Q. What application did Turnbull make to you respecting the boat? - A. He asked me if I would put him into Dunkirk, or Calais, or Ostend; I told him there was a fair wind, but I could not without a proper pass for my people; he said, he would endeavour to get a pass; and he wrote a letter, desiring me to give it to Mr. Pollard, or put it in the post when I got home.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that letter again? - A. No; I can neither read nor write.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you about any thing he had left behind? - A. Yes; he said he had left seventeen hundred guineas in the hands of Mr. Pollard, in a trunk, or chest, I did not know which.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a fair wind for the other coast when he told you that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you find him in custody? - A. The next morning I heard that he was taken and I was applied to to know if I had got any property of his, and I gave the constables the letter I had of him, Mr. Hills and Mr. Collison.</p>
               <p>Q. The letter that you gave to the constables-was that the same you received from Turnbull? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the fifty pounds you received in London? - A. I put that, and the other fifty pounds, both into the hands of

               <p>Q. Which was the spokesman? - A. I cannot tell; they asked me if I would go with them, and said, they would satisfy me; I told them I would go; I asked them how they would be willing to satisfy me, and they said, three half-crowns.</p>

               <p>Q. It was the depth of winter, and you were called out of bed? - A. Yes, there was a great deal of snow upon the ground; they agreed to give me half-a-guinea; there was a man that they hired to carry a large portmantean and great coats; I shewed them the way to Holly-haven; they paid me and the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the two prisoners? - A. I think both these gentlemen were there.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am one of the moniers of the Mint; I received this parcel from Mr. Parker, which I have had in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Parker. This is the same parcel that I delivered to Mr. Atkinson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Did you find a 40l. note and a 10l. note amongst them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There has not been any thing written upon them since they have been in your possession? - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Bryce's defence. I had occasion to go down in a post-chaise at the time the witnesses spoke to; but as to aiding and abetting Turnbull out of the kingdom, I know nothing of it; I went to enquire for the stage to South-end, and not being able to get any I took a seat with them, and returned by Gravesend, having business to do there.</p>
               <p>Pollard's defence. I was there shooting two or three days, and doing business; the landlord there gave me an order for twenty dozen of porter; I had no business with Turnbull, nor did not know the man, or any thing at all about him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Pollard called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>For Bryce.</p>
               <p>- HULME sworn. - The prisoner, Bryce, keeps an ironmonger's shop; I have been very intimate with him six years; he bears a very good character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Is he a furnishing ironmonger? - A. He had ironmongery in his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he kept the shop of an ironmonger? - A. There were both old and new iron in his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to represent here, upon your oath, that he carried on the business of an ironmonger, as other ironmongers do in London? - A. I do not know any other.</p>
               <p>Q.What does his stock consist of? - A. Ironmongery, locks, and keys, and sundries.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live? - A. No. 64, Upper East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to translate sundries for us? - A. Such as gimblets, chissels, and many things.</p>
