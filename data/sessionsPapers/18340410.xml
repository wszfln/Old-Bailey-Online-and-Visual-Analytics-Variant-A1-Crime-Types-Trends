On the morning of the 29th of March I came down stairs early- I am the first person who is down in the morning, and always light the tap-room fire, as I have to provide early breakfast - I found the tap-room window open at twenty minutes before four o'clock - it was quite dark at that time - I could not by the light of day discern the features of a man - the tap-room window was wide open - it is eight or ten feet high from the ground, or it may be more - I then went into the bar, to the till - the till was left with about twenty farthings in it; and at a quarter past eleven o'clock the night before, when I went to bed, I saw 15s. or 16s. in copper money in it - Ann King was up last - the house was all fastened up at that time - the door the windows were closed - the prisoner had lived with me as servant, about a year and a quarter ago, in the same house - after leaving the bar, I found the back door open - it was unbolted - it was bolted at a quarter after eleven o'clock at night - the house appeared to have been entered at the tap-room window - I went to the Crown, St. Dunstan's-passage, in two or three hours, after hearing that the prisoner was there, and found him there - I looked through the door - I saw him sitting in the tap-room, drinking rum and milk - he was searched in my presence, and a watch found on him which has been claimed by my bar-maid, Ann King, and on the tap-room table, there was between 6s. and 7s. in copper, and some farthings.</p>

I was up last on the 28th of March - I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock - I went round and saw the doors fast, and the window was shut down - I did not examine to see if it was fast - I was at the till last - there was about 15s. or 16s. in copper, and a great many farthings among it - I had a metal watch which I left on the bar mantel-pieces - I do not know what it was worth - the window which was found open was shut overnight, as usual - I have since seen my watch in possession of Charlton, the officer - (looking at it) - I know this to be mine.</p>

            . Q. How do you know it? A. I am quite sure of it; I have had it in my possession a long time; the maker's name is Wicks - I saw it that night after the doors were fast - I left it on the mantelpiece; and I saw it there - I myself did not fasten the back door, but I held the lad a light, and saw him fasten it - the tap-room window is about ten feet from the ground - it opens into a court.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the bottom of it ten feet from the ground? A. Yes, where it slips down - the prisoner lived with Mr. Howard, since I have been there, for four or five months - I never saw anything wrong in him - I have not opened the watch since the officer had it - I knew the maker's name, before the officer produced it.</p>

            . I am a constable of Billingsgate ward - I apprehended the prisoner about nine o'clock in the morning of the 29th of March, at the Crown public-house, sitting before the tap-room fire - a parcel of coppers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100004"/>were before him in this dirty cloth, which laid on the table - here is 6s. 9 1/2d. in copper - I found the watch, which I have produced, in his right hand trowsers' pocket, and twenty-four farthings in the same pocket; and he gave me 4s. 6d. in silver from one of his pockets - he did not account for the possession of the property - he would not own to the coppers; and when I said I wanted the watch as well, he said he had not got it; but I searched and found it on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he knew nothing about the half-pence? A. Not the half-pence on the table - there was no other person in the room when I went in - he was sitting at the table before the fire - it was about nine o'clock in the morning - he had some rum and milk in a glass - the Crown is very near the prosecutor's - it is only a short street, and a few yards to the left from it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of a public-house is the Crown? A. I never heard anything about it - they do a good deal of business.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 29th of March, I was at Billingsgate Market - I put down my basket, and went to the water-closet which is for the public at the back of Mr. Howard's house, and on opening the door, I saw a watch and bundle lying on the seat - I stopped a quarter of an hour, thinking somebody had gone away in a hurry and forgot it - as nobody came, I took the watch up and put it in my fob-pocket - I looked at the bundle, and found it contained money - I saw it was halfpence - I took it in my hand, after waiting a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, as nobody came - I came down the passage, passed Mr. Howard's house, and took the bundle in my hand - I would not go to work any more that morning, thinking I might lose the watch, or get it broken - I went to the Crown to wait till the busy time of the market was over, thinking I might then hear who had lost anything. I called for some coffee - they had none, and I called for ale - I sat down and blew the fire by desire of the young woman, and then had some milk and rum - I sat there until eight o'clock - a milkman came - I told him if he would find milk, I would find rum - he said it was too soon to drink, and he left me; and it appears he went down to Mr. Howard, and told him I was drinking there, and offering to treat everybody who came in - in about half an hour Charlton and Howard came in and took me, with the watch in my pocket, and the halfpence on the table - he asked if the half-pence belonged to me - I said "No" - he took 4s. 6d. and a knife from me, and some farthings - they took me to the Mansion-house - Howard said it was a gold watch - the Lord Mayor examined it, and found it to be a metal one - I never heard anything about his being robbed, or I should have taken it to him.</p>
               <p>ANN KING re-examined. I do not think the prisoner ever saw the watch while he lived there - I had it at that time, and was in the habit of using it but very seldom - I brought it down on Good Friday to wind it up - I had not used it for a long time before.</p>
               <p>MR. HOWARD. He lived with me the last time about three months, and before that he lived with me about six months - I think his conduct was good the first time - there is a public privy at the Anchor, near me, for the benefit of the market - the Anchor was my house about twelve months ago - the prisoner has no father - his mother has been supporting him; not he supporting her - I am quite sure it was dark when I came down - I always come down at that time and light the gas - I am certain it was not light - I went to the door, and it was dark - it was not light enough to see the features of a man, I should say; but I did not take particular notice, being flurried - I am sure it was exactly twenty minutes to four o'clock - I can swear to that - I looked at the clock in the bar.(Robert Norman, the prisoner's uncle, gave him a good character.)</p>

               <p>JAMES ESSEX re-examined. I perceived nothing particular at all in him except that he appeared in a melancholy mood, quite dejected - he made no observation - he was taken immediately before the magistrate - I was present at the examination - he said nothing there, because he was immediately remanded - I cannot say whether he was in liquor - he appeared quite dejected - not violent or raving.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You said he said something to his two palls, what do you mean? A. Why, those he was in the habit of keeping company with, men equally as bad as himself, who assisted him as well - my husband is not here - I believe him to be at Manchester at this time - I saw him last, two years ago last March - he failed in business, took the benefit of the Act, and went to Manchaester to work at his business, and as soon as he is better off, I doubt not he will make us comfortable - I have not heard from him for two years last August - I have no doubt, as soon as he has provision for me and my children, we shall hear from him - there is a reason for his not writing - his letters are always good, and he is a good husband; but a friend wrote to threaten to send the parish-officers after him, if he did not support his family, and that is the reason I do not hear from him - I get my living by needle-work as a <rs id="t18340410-3-viclabel22" type="occupation">milliner</rs>

               <p>Q. Are not you a fortune-teller? A. I never get any money by that; if any person chooses to ask my advice, and chooses to give me any money, I take it; but am I to be knocked down for that? - I can tell a good many people's fortune without any cards, with half-an-hour's conversation with them - I never made any charge for it in my life - I never know the names of any persons who come to me for advice - I know

               <p>COURT. Q. Did anybody come in to fetch him out? A. Yes, one person - they called him by the name of Thomas Watkins - he called him out and said, "Thomas Watkins, I want to speak to you" - that was all that passed - three or four people did not come in - I only saw one - the person did not call him George.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to swear just now that it was half an hour? A. No. I said he went out at half-past eight o'clock - he stopped out about five minutes - what I said was, "It wanted five minutes of the half-hour" - I can read(looking at his deposition) - this name William Kingdom, is my writing - the prisoner was sitting down with three or four, but there was but one man came in, and called him out - I did not swear before the magistrate that three or four men came in and called him George, and he got up, and went out - I do not recollect whether my deposition was read over to me or not - they did not swear me at first - I swear there was but one man came and called him out, whose name is Clark - I only saw him called out once - that is my writing - I told the clerk that took the evidence that he had made a mistake in one place - I was not aware that he had not altered it when I signed it - when I came in at five minutes after eight o'clock, I drank part of my beer, and at half-past eight o'clock he went out, and he was not wanting more than five minutes - he did not leave the chair for more than five minutes - Mr. Smith is my master - he keeps a large drysalter's warehouse, at No. 5, Princes-street.</p>

             I am going on for thirteen years old - I am the son of the last witness - I know the prisoner - he was at my father's house on Thursday evening, the 6th of March - I saw him first about a quarter before seven o'clock - I attended backwards and forwards with beer - I saw him go away about five or ten minutes past ten o'clock - I did not see anything particular about him - I found him in the room when I went into the room - I never saw him away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You know, I suppose, that it is wicked to swear false? A. Yes - I cannot swear that he was not out of my father's house from the time I first saw him to when he went away at ten o'clock.</p>

            . I am a dyer, and live at No. 41, Booth-street, Brick-lane. On the 6th of March, I was at the Dyers' Arms - I have known the prisoner three or four years - he was there that night, sitting at the next table to me - I observed him first at eight o'clock - he left about five minutes after ten o'clock - he was very drunk, and shook hands with me at parting, and spilled some of my ale in doing so - I observed nothing particular about him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You cannot swear he was never out of the room from eight to ten o'clock? A. No; I think he went out once, about five minutes to nine; but I think I could swear he was not out more than five minutes during the whole time I was there - he was very drunk - I did not go till eight o'clock, and only had two pints of ale, I was not so very drunk - I was quite as sober as I am at the present moment.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN FOULSHAM, sen., re-examined. The Dyers' Arms is in Brick-lane, that is between two and three hundred yards from Carter-street, but I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about it - I am as innocent as you that sit there, my Lord - I am as innocent as a lamb.</p>
               <p>JAMES PARKER. I am a confectioner. I know the prosecutrix - I have had my fortune told by her - she said to me that I should be well paid for my trouble, if I would come and say, I heard the prisoner say he would have his revenge on her - she has told my fortune three or four times - I live next door to her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you keep a shop, or are you a servant? A. I make all my own goods - I have known the prosecutrix nearly twelve months - I am very intimate with her - the prisoner lives in the same court as I do - he used to work at an iron-founder's, in George-street - she called me in one day, when I was at my work, and said, if I was to come up and say Watkins said he would have his revenge, I should be well paid for my trouble - I answered, I heard him say no such thing, and would not come up and say it - this was about a week after the prisoner was taken - she did not mention at the time that he was the man who robbed her - it was after she had been robbed - I knew she had been robbed, from what she said herself - that was all that passed between us - I named this to my mother the very same day - it was after I was before the magistrate.</p>

            . I am single. I know nothing of the prosecutrix, only by her telling my fortune - she has told me my fortune three times, different things - I paid her 2d. for each fortune - I knew her to tell several others - I do not know whether she was paid for them - she asked 2d. for telling the fortune - I paid her before she told it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she demand 2d., or did you ask how much you had to pay? A. I asked her, and she said 2d.</p>
               <p>MARGARET McNIELL re-examined. This is my bag - the handkerchief and apron are mine - there is blood on them - they are covered with blood - I told Esther Bacon her fortune - they come to me frequently; but I never made any charge: I dare not - she never asked me what she was to pay - she never paid me beforehand - nobody pays beforehand - I cannot say whether she has paid me three, or four, or five times - she did pay me, but voluntarily.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How do you account for the blood being on the handkerchief and apron? A. I had them on - the blood was the consequence of the assault - that is not one-fourth or one-tenth part of it - the blood still comes out of my ear a little, and from the pain in my head I am not able to work.</p>
               <p>[The deposition of WILLIAM KINGDOM, being read, was as follows: "Last Thursday evening, at eight o'clock, I went to the Dyers' Arms, and called for some liquor - I saw the prisoner sitting at my left side - I had not sat there long before three or four men came and called out 'George' - he got up and left the house; I would swear for not four minutes - he came and sat down again, and was there until ten o'clock."]</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KINGDOM re-examined. Q. What was the mistake you say you pointed out in that deposition? A. What I have sworn here is the truth, and nothing else - when it was read over to me, they said, I had said he went out at half-past eight o'clock - I said, "He went out at half-past eight o'clock, and was not away five minutes" - they said, I said half an hour - he was sitting in company with a young man they call George.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Could the prisoner be out of the room half an hour without your knowing it? A. No, he could not, nor a quarter of an hour - he was not out above five minutes from eight to ten o'clock, for his chair remained as he had left it - he came back and threw himself down in it - nobody had occupied it - I was not in company with him: in fact, he was a stranger - I did not know his name before - he was very intoxicated, and his wife sat opposite him - I had a pint of beer and a pipe of tobacco; and I know the time could not be longer than that - I never knew his name except as Thomas; but he was quite a stranger to me - I swear he was not absent more than four or five minutes - I am still foreman to Mr. Smith - I have lived with him going on for two years.</p>

I lived in the same house with the prosecutrix, and was walking with her on the afternoon of the 17th, between six and seven o'clock, from Drury-lane into Orange-court - there was nobody with us - as we were passing on the left hand side of the way, Mrs. Slater came past on the left side of Mrs. Moriarty - Mrs. Moriarty cried to me, "Oh Mary, Mary, I am stabbed by that person," - I had not seen the prisoner do anything till Mrs. Moriarty cried out that she was stabbed by Mrs. Slater - she said it was by Mrs. Slater - I immediately ran to see where Mrs. Slater went, but could not observe at the time - I lost sight of her through the court - I am quite sure it was her - it was getting towards dusk - there was light enough to enable me to see distinctly who it was - I swear it was Mrs. Slater - she had been annoying Moriarty during the day, and me likewise, going in and out from her own residence - I cannot say what they had been quarrelling about - she had not a room in the house - she was visiting Mrs. Tew, who lodges in the same house - Mrs. Moriarty had not done anything to provoke her to give this blow during the time I was with her, I am sure - they did not exchange any words until the blow was given at that time - she bled, and was taken to the surgeon - I have not said she annoyed me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I warn you to be very careful of answering - on your oath, did you not say, "She was annoying Mrs. Moriarty during the day, and me likewise?" A. I did not - Mrs. Moriarty during the day was annoyed - I do not know that I have said, "She had been annoying Mrs. Moriarty and me likewise" - I did not say so.</p>

I am medical assistant to Mr. Bradford, of 216, Tottenham-court-road, and who keeps the shop at No. 131, Drury-lane, which I attend to - the prosecutrix was brought into the shop accompanied by two women, about five minutes before seven o'clock; her face was all covered over with blood - I asked her what was the matter with her- she said she had got a cut in the face. I examined her - there was a cut on her left temple, inflicted with some sharp instrument, it was an incised wound - I examined the wound - the woman seemed excited, and was talking a great deal - there was great hemorrhage from the wound, and great excitement - I told her if she talked so much, she must go to another shop - I examined the wound, and found it was cut in as far as the bone, and it was about an inch and a quarter in length - she lost a great deal of blood, and was in a very weak state; she could scarcely stand - she was greatly excited - I recommended her to go home and go to bed, and go to Bow-street next morning - she was sober - she appeared as if she had taken a little drink - she wanted to tell me the person who had done it, and mentioned the name of the prisoner - the wound was very near the temporal artery - I suppose it was cut within a quarter of an inch of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not mean to say there was danger from the wound? A. Not immediate danger - I certainly mean to say there was danger - I am not a surgeon - I am a member of Apothecaries'-hall - the prosecutrix was greatly excited, but perfectly sober - I told her to go home, but she would persist in going after her husband, who, she said, was at some public-house - I saw her afterwards between nine and ten o'clock, when there was a general row, in the same house, 131 Drury-lane - she had not gone to bed, she was dressed except her bonnet.</p>

A great number of persons - a great number of Irish people had come there assisting Tew's party, and there was a number of people on both sides - the prosecutrix got a stroke inflicted on her forehead in the second row by some blunt instrument - I saw the prisoner there then - she came to the door, and I met Rose, a policeman, and told him the prisoner was knocking at the door, as I was afraid of the mob - when the prisoner was knocking at the door, I asked her what she wanted - she appeared to be in liquor, and asked for Mrs. Moriarty - I told her to go and look for her, but I would not have the shop knocked about in that kind of way - I had not seen her exactly in the second row - I did not see her doing anything, nor did I see her at all in the row - came and knocked at the door repeatedly, and kicked at the shop door - the bell rang - I came out and said to the prisoner, "My good woman, what do you want?" - she was very tipsy, and another woman with her very drunk - I said, "What are you knocking at the door for?" - she said, "We want to get Mrs. Moriarty," and I think she said, she wanted to pitch into her.</p>

St. Mark is a district marked out for ecclesiastical purposes - it is a chapel in which divine service is performed according to the rites of the Church of England - in consequence of information which I received, I, in company with Mr. Milne, examined some property which was found by the officers - I examined the chapel on the morning on which the robbery had been committed overnight - I examined the window over the vestry-room; part of it was out; sufficient had been removed to admit the person of a man - I went into the chapel, which had been furnished with gas fittings - I missed some gas burners, and a great quantity of the gas fittings, brass fittings, and burners; and some gas lamps were removed, and the oil lamps of the reading desk and pulpit - the gas burners, lamps, and fittings had been fixed to the chapel - the altar cloth was gone - I did not examine respecting the wine - there was a box in the vestry-room secured by a lock, and I subsequently missed that lock - some Bibles and Prayer Books were taken belonging to the parishioners - the gas fittings, burners, alter cloth, and looking-glass, have since been shown to me by the officers - they are articles some of which were affixed to the chapel, and others which were there; in my opinion they are the same as I had seen in the chapel - I had seen them I think on the Sunday previous to the robbery; there was nothing missing then, that I am aware of; the furniture was complete to my knowledge then.</p>

            . I lived at No. 3, St. John's-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100011"/>street, on the 6th of March, but do not now. On the morning of the 5th of March, about half-past six o'clock, I was coming along by the corner of Jerusalem-passage to go to where I worked, at the Northumberland Arms, Clerkenwell-green - Jerusalem-passage is in Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell, about a quarter of a mile from St. Philip's Chapel - I saw eight or nine men conversing together at the corner of Aylesbury-street, and Jerusalem-passage, standing at the public-house at the corner - four of them had bundles, and one had a large copper - I saw the prisoner Richardson among them - I noticed him more distinctly than the rest, because he turned round - he had a bag on his shoulder, closed up at the neck - I could not observe what was in it, but as he jerked it on his shoulder it jumbled together, and I thought it was candlesticks, brass work - I did not see any of it - they went in a direction from St. Philip's Chapel towards Golden-lane - as Richardson passed by me, he said to me, "Halloo, cad, we have got a swag now, and if you like, you can come it on us, but what - you must expect afterwards."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice the person of any of the others? A. From the size and dress of James Coster - I could not properly swear to him, but a person of his size and dress was among them - when they went along, one of them hallooed out, "We are going to Fatty's, in Golden-lane" - Elmer went by the name of Fatty - I knew him before, and knew who they meant - some of them went on one side of the way, and some on the other - I watched them across St. John-square, and saw them proceeding from Albemarle-street, which is in a direction towards Golden-lane - I immediately ran up to the station-house, in Spa-fields, and informed them of what I had seen - Pryor and three other policemen accompanied me - I went with them to Golden-lane, and after stopping a few minutes at the corner of Play-house-yard, where Elmer lived, Richardson came along, and was about turning up the yard, but seeing the policeman standing there, he immediately walked along straight - he had then the same bag with him as he had before - I pointed him out to the police, and then proceeded to my work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Richardson. I want to know how he knew I had the same things in Golden-lane, as I had in Aylesbury-street? Witness. It was a bag like the other, and the bundle was the same size, and he carried it in the same position.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he both a bag and a bundle? A. No; I consider the bag was the bundle - it was a bag - I cannot swear to anybody but Richardson - it was half-past six o'clock in the morning when I met them - it was light at the time - it is a public street, and a great throughfare - but there was nobody passing much at the time - it is a very great thoroughfare in the daytime.</p>

             (policeman, G 226). On the 6th of March I took the witness, Samuel Hatton, into custody - he was taken to the office and afterwards discharged - on the 11th of March I was passing by where he lives, which is on my beat - I went into his house in Ray-street, at eleven o'clock at night - I was then in possession of the knife produced, and offered the knife to Hatton - he said it was not his - he gave me an account of what he had done with it - I had some conversation with him, and in consequence of that conversation I apprehended Thacker the following day, the 12th, at No. 1, Coppice-row, close by, at 10 o'clock in the morning - he was in bed - I told him I took him concerning robbing the church; and before he said anything to me, I told him the property had been found in Playhouse-yard - he said, "D-n that Old Fatty, if it had not been for him I should not have got into this" - I then took him to the station-house, and as we went along, in Bowling-green-lane, I said to him, "There was a note found in the church, do you know anything of it?" - he said,"I did not write it" - I said, "You cannot write, can you?" - he said, "I can write enough for that" - he said,"The old rascal has not paid us for it yet" - I said, "What, have you been down, since you carried the things down?" - he said, "Me and Dick have been down once." - On the morning of the robbery of the 5th of March, I was on Clerkenwell-green myself, about eight o'clock - I saw Thacker there drunk, and when I was in the yard, at Hatton-garden office, I told him I had seen him on Clerkenwell-green on the morning of the robbery, and said, "I did not know at that time that you had been doing what you have done," and told him he was drunk at the time - he said, "I know I was rather fresh by drinking too much wine at the church" - I accompanied the officers on the 12th of March to search the premises of Elmer - he was at home in his shop - he said he had been searched before, and he thought we were giving him a good deal of trouble - I had searched the house on the Wednesday previous, and found nothing - Findlay, Busain, and others, were with me on the 12th- Findlay said something to him - I cannot be positive what it was - Elmer expressed himself quite willing to be searched, and only complained of the number of men that came - we searched about the house for a long time without effect - at last we went into the cellar, which is enclosed from the street by a wall, which passes between the grating outside, and the shop window - the inside of the wall forms part of the enclosure of the cellar itself - I sounded the cellar walls with an iron rod, and when I came to the part between the grating and the shop window, it sounded hollow - I commenced opening the wall in front, it had been recently compoed over inside - I began to break the compo away - Findlay told me not to do so, but to look at the top - we looked at the top and found a quantity of dirt, which struck my attention - I pulled the dirt off the top, and found a lid, and there was a box or bin made with boards in the wall - we opened the lid, and there found the property which I produce, a looking-glass, altar-cloth, four Prayer Books, thermometer, Bibles, four oil lamps, two candlesticks, some ornamental brass work, and two bottles full of what appears to be wine - Elmer was in the cellar when we searched there, and went away directly we found these things - as soon as we found out this secret-place he went away directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I think you said he made no objection to your searching the place? A. None at all - he offered every facility - he desired his wife to bring down some instrument for the purpose of examining various places - he did not make any objection to my searching - he helped us going about the various places.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the instrument he sent for? A. The iron rod, which I sounded the wall with- he did not point out the secret place in the wall - on our finding it out he went away.</p>
               <p>Thacker. He says it was ten o'clock when he took me in bed - I wish to know whether it was sooner or later. -</p>

               <p>Witness. It was as near ten as possible - it did not strike a quarter after nine as we went up Bowling-green-lane - I was at breakfast at nine o'clock at home.</p>

             (policeman). I went with the other officers to the house in Golden-lane, on Wednesday, the 12th of March - it is a marine-store shop - I saw Elmer in the shop when I went there - I went in, in company with Findlay - Elmer asked what we came there for - Findlay replied that he had come again about the church property, that he (Findlay) had been thereabout before last week - I told him I had every reason to believe it was then in his possesion - he most strenuously denied all knowledge of it- he said he knew nothing whatever of it - he had not got it - it was not in his house - I asked him, not having a search warrant, if he would allow me the privilege of going over his premises to see if I could find it - he granted me permission - we searched the house and premises - I and Pryor and Findlay - we went into the cellar - we examined the floor of the cellar first, and while we were examining the floor Elmer stood very quiet, but his wife appeared very uneasy - after examining the floor, Pryor and Findlay were knocking against the wall - Elmer remained in the cellar until a part in the wall sounded hollow, and I directed the dirt to be removed, saying I was confident the property was there - when I opened the bin, and the property produced was found, I turned round to secure Elmer, and found he was gone - I ran up stairs and directed Hull to go after him - he took him in the street, and brought him back into the shop - these articles produced are what we found in the bin, which was part of the wall covered over with a lid, and then covered with dirt - it is like a locker on board a vessel - it opened at the top like a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100013"/>locker - I have a list of the things found - there was an altar-cloth, thermometer, looking-glass, five Prayer Books, two Bibles, four oil lamps, two brass candlesticks, twelve other pieces of brass, an inkstand, towel, and two bottles, which I believe contained Tent wine - after Elmer was brought back, I proceeded with him to the station-house and when I got to the station-house, he said, the things were brought to him by two men - I neither threatened nor made him any promise - on my opening the things, he said voluntarily at the station-house, that the things had been brought to his house by two men, that he had not bought them, and that he had never seen so much of them before as he saw then at the station-house - among other things, found at his house, I found an account-book - I have it here - I asked him if it was his account-book - he said it was - it contains accounts of things purchased by him - I have had it ever since - I have examined it, and it contains no account of these lamps, and the articles I found in the wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. He told you he had not bought them, and had not seen so much of them as he did then? A. Yes; there are divers entries of things bought - he furnished every facility for searching the house, and remained with us till we discovered the bin - I have had the property in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the place in the wall a very easy place to discover? A. It was a very difficult place to discover - it was the last place I should have thought of examining - the iron instrument was fetched to try the floor - it was a common pricker used to try the ground.</p>

            . I was present at the station-house in Rosoman-street, on the 5th of March, when Higgins gave information, and was present at the search at Elmer's on the 12th of March - on the morning of the 5th of March, between eight and nine o'clock, I went to St. Philip's Chapel, and found it had been broken into by removing a window at the communion above the vestry - I went in at that window myself - I went into the vestry-room, and found a small deal box, in which the sacramental wine is kept - the lock was gone from it; this brass and iron lock,(produced by Cuthbert,) belongs to that box - it fits it - the upper part, where the hasp would be, was wrenched off, and the hasp is now in the lock - the box had been wrenched open, and the hasp given away - a paper was produced at the office, which was found on the communion-table, and which has been sealed up at the office.</p>

            . I have examined the gas fittings produced - I am beadle of St. Philip's Chapel - the minister of the chapel is the Rev. Thomas Watson - these gas fittings are part of the fittings belonging to the chapel; and the four oil lamps are part of the porperty taken from the chapel - the altar-cloth also, and the looking-glass, thermometer, and two candlesticks - the thermometer and candlesticks are the property of Mr. John Lee, who attends St. Philip's and St. Mark's - he is a servant to both churches - a Bible and three Prayer Books belong to Mr. James Lane - two Bibles and three Prayer Books belong to Mr. Thomas Jarman - there were eight half-pint bottles of Sherry wine missing from the box, and six bottles of Tent were taken from the vestry cupboard - this wine is the same as we have for the sacrament: it is Tent wine - on the evening before the robbery, at twenty minutes before eight o'clock, (Tuesday evening, the 4th of March,) I had myself secured the chapel - the gas fittings, oil lamps, and things were safely fixed there then - on the following morning I accompanied Findlay and the officers, and found them gone - this lock belongs to the box, and has been wrenched off.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Put your hand on any one article, and tell us if you can swear to it positively? A. This candlestick I know by having no screw at the bottom - I know this to be either the reading desk or pulpit lamp - I can swear to it by the worm inside - I have examined all the fittings: they correspond with the works in the chapel - I believe them all to be what were taken away - they appear to fit the place from which they have been taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you take them there to try them? A. We took part of them to try.</p>
               <p>JOHN HULL. I am a policeman. On the morning of the 12th of March, I accompanied the other officers to examine Elmer's house - in consequence of directions from Pryor, I went in pursuit of Elmer - I found him in Golden-lane - he had got two or three hundred yards; and at the station-house he stated that if it had not been for hiding these things away, it would have been all right - I had said nothing to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He did not say who hid them? A. No; nor that he knew of their being hid.</p>
               <p>Thacker's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I stand before you in a very awful situation; not having the power to procure legal assistance, which if I had, no doubt the evidence might have been rendered of no avail. Hatton has been several times in custody, and was taken for this charge, by reason of a knife being found with his name on it, which he says he sold to me. Now it must appear to you, how easy it will be for him to say he sold the knife to me, to exculpate himself. With regard to the evidence of Pryor - he took me in custody in bed; he showed me the knife; and I said I knew nothing of it, which I did not. In going to the station-house, he said,"Charles, I have known you and your father some time: this is a capital charge; it will be either life or death for you: if you will tell all you know, I give you my word as a man, all shall be right." And I said, "I know nothing of the robbery." As to the book found on Richardson, I own the book is mine; I lent it him two or three months ago, and that was the last time I saw him, till I saw him in custody. I hope you will take my case into your consideration. I wish to submit to the Jury how unlikely it is, if I was concerned in the robbery, I should have trusted myself in the hands of Hatton, by stating to him what he states.</p>
               <p>Elmer's Defence. I am totally innocent of purchasing the articles, they were brought to my shop by two men - I never bought them nor agreed to buy them. When I heard there was a noise about the things, I certainly concealed them away.</p>

You appeared to be wrangling with him - there was a mob collected round them, and he and his companion were using very bad expression towards each other - I did not know the way he was going, nor which way he lived - he was intoxicated - they were wrangling and quarrelling together when I came up.</p>

            . I am a police-officer. I came up with Avery at the beginning of this - there was sufficient to call a mob together, and it occasioned a disturbance and a mob before a shopkeeper's house sufficient for him to complain about - as Avery was endeavouring to take him, I followed him and saw the prisoner kick Avery to trip him up, as I suppose - a scuffle ensued, which made me go forward - Avery attempted to seize him by the collar, and they went down in the street - I ran up and saw him bite Avery's finger, and saw the blood run - I received a great portion of the blood over my clothes - no violence was used towards him by Avery - he used persuasion - I myself told him if he had been my own brother I should give him the same advice as he had done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you state on your oath that neither<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100015"/>you nor Avery took me up by the collar? I do not say you had the truncheon with you; but did you not take me up by the collar, and throw me down several times on the ground like a dog? I don't know myself (being intoxicated), but I am told so. A. No. no violence was used further than was necessary to secure you - I received several kicks myself, and my eye was very much swollen - he was very violent indeed, and I received several kicks, one on the cheek bone - Spring came and secured his legs.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he appear to hear without any difficulty then? A. Decidedly so - I was in conversation with him some time next day.</p>

On the 13th of March I heard a noise - I went to the door and saw a mob - I went up to the mob, which was two doors from my house - I saw the prisoner lying on his back kicking the policemen who were on each side of him; they had hold of him on each side by the shoulders, and he was struggling - the mob was very much excited against the police - they used no more violence than was necessary to take him, and I said they ought to be protected - the mob took part against the police, and I, to assist in securing the prisoner, took hold of his feet - I did not see him do anything to Avery's finger, but he hallooed out, and said his finger was off - I then let go of the prisoner's feet - I saw the policeman's finger bleeding, and I went directly to the station-house for assistance - there was not one atom of violence used to the prisoner; they did nothing more than was necessary to secure him - he laid on his back five or six minutes without their holding him.</p>

On the 13th of March, Avery came to my house - he had a lacerated wound of the second finger of his left hand - the wound was dressed, and he went away - the bone of the first joint was denuded of the muscles, and left completely bare, and the nail was gone - no part of the bone was gone - he came again the following morning, and complained of spasmodic twitchings in the jaw - there was danger of a locked jaw - he is not yet well, but is getting better progressively - it was a dangerous wound.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me insult anybody? A. I saw you drunk and riotous.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I humbly crave your kind attention on this unfortunate occasion - I respectfully assure you, I had no malice or guilty intention towards the prosecutor - it is with sincere regret and shame I confess that I was very much intoxicated, and have not the slightest recollection of anything that happened - I have been round the neighbourhood several years daily selling shell-fish - I do not suppose there is anybody in the neighbourhood but what knows me well - seeing me intoxicated would excite their attention, as I am not in the habit of being so - I challenge anybody living, ever to say they saw me intoxicated - I received a very severe injury in my head when a boy, which caused me to be deaf, and I have been under Dr. Curtis, the ear-doctor - having suffered that injury, I always find a very small portion of liquor takes effect, which always keeps me on my guard from being intoxicated; and had I wished to drink, my humble occupation would not allow me to do so - I have a wife and child - the money I earned would not allow it - I never insulted an individual in the street - I challenge every individual living to say they ever knew me act wrong in my life - had I been sober, I am the last man that would have done it - I am an honest man - I have had several situations, all of which I have left with a good character - nobody could suffer more pain and anguish than I have in Newgate - I have been in the Infirmary - I have had three blisters on my chest, and through over-excitement of mind, the blisters have turned to ulcers: and my wife has been confined to her bed, and subject to fits through fretting about this - I hope, as I had no malicious intention towards the prosecutor, you will take my case into your consideration - I had no guilty intention towards the man, and have no recollection of what happened - it is evident, had I been guilty, and wished to rescue myself, that it is not likely I should lie down on my back and kick - I had met an acquaintance that afternoon, who persuaded me to accompany him to drink - we had some home-brewed ale, and a quartern of gin afterwards, and it soon overpowered me - I should think you cannot call a man malicious in doing an act, when he is so overpowered, and has not the right use of his reason - drunkenness is next to craziness - I have always been respected, though I say it myself - I keep a small shop in Wheeler-street - the last situation I lived in, was at Mr.

            . I am servant to Mr. Eastman. On the 13th of September he ordered me to turn the gelding in the field between five and six o'clock - I did so - I went there again at eleven in the morning, and it was still there - I saw it there about twelve o'clock on the 14th- I went there again on Sunday, the 15th, and it was gone - I saw a horse in the possession of Evans afterwards - that was master's horse which I had turned out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A. Were you present at any examination at the police-office? A. Yes: I do not know when the prisoner was apprehended - I cannot say whether he was ever discharged.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH EVANS. The horse in question was in my possession on the 15th of February - I am a bargeman - I cannot tell justly when the horse came into my possession - I had him twenty-two weeks - I bought it in the morning - it was either the 16th or 15th of November - I cannot recollect the day - I do not remember when the prosecutor claimed it - I know I had it twenty-two weeks in my possession - the officer took it out of my possession - I do not know his name - they fetched me out of my boat as I was going to bed - I bought the horse of the prisoner - I found out it was twenty-two weeks ago, because I used to take a load of hay to London every week - I cannot justly say that I brought a load every week - I cannot say on what day it was I saw the prisoner with the horse - I took no notice - I bought it at the White Lion, either on Monday or Tuesday - I saw the prisoner there about eleven or twelve o'clock - I bought the horse of him there - I cannot say whether I have ever said what day I bought it - he asked me 9l. for it, he said he had a horse to sell - I wanted one, and thought that would be too little - I gave him eight sovereigns for it - if the horse turned out well, I was to give him 10s. more, when he came up again; and he followed me to Paddington, stops about a month after, and asked me for the 10s. - I told him I would give it him when I came up again, as I was rather short of money - I do not know on what day of the week, or in what month that was - it might be November, but I will not be sure - I was driving along the canal from Paddington - I was not taking any hay for my master about that time - I do not recollect how many loads of hay I took about that time, - I had so many masters - I work for anybody - I am sure I had the gelding twenty-two weeks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you buy the horse at the White Lion, at Paddington? A. Yes; I always put up there - many boatmen put up there - I never saw the prisoner before that - I saw him, I think, about the next week or fortnight - I saw him every time I came to town, but I had not 10s. - other persons were present when I bought the horse - my father was present - I paid for it just as I went into the room - I tried the horse along the river side before I bought it - everything was done publicly; there was no attempt at concealment - I used the horse to tow my barge - I thought it was a bad bargain - I frequently saw the prisoner afterwards at the White Lion, and about Paddington.</p>
               <p>MR. DAWSON. Q. Your father was present? A. Yes; he bargained for the horse, and I paid the money - the prisoner said he bought the horse in Smithfield market, to run in an omnibus, and it was too small for him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where were you when he said he had the horse to sell? A. Against the White Lion - I went to look at it in the stables - I did not look at it before he said he had a horse to sell - I never paid him the 10s. - he came after me for it, and I should have given it him if I had had it - my father is in Staffordshire.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner at 127, Edgware-road, on the 16th of February - I went up stairs - I found him standing in the room, and said, "Well, Peter, is this you?" - he said, "Yes" - I said, "You must accompany me to the station-house" - he came with me directly, and on our way I told him I took him on suspicion of horse-stealing - he made no reply, but on arriving at the station-house, I confronted him with Evans, who was there in custody, and who immediately said he was the person who sold him the horse; at the same time saying to him, "This is a pretty hobble you have brought me into, about this horse" - Bradley replied, "I cannot help it; I bought the horse in the market" - he said he sold it to Evans - he did not say at what time he bought it; nor did he then say at what market.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know if he has been in custody on this charge before? A. He was - I do not know by what officer; he was taken before the magistrate at Union-hall - I believe the same prosecutor appeared against him - I was not there - it was on the 14th of January - he was remanded until the 21st, and again, I think, until the 24th - I am acquainted with him by seeing him about the Edgeware-road - I cannot say what business he followed - I cannot say whether he returned to his residence in the Edgeware-road - I found him there a month afterwards - I do not suppose he absconded.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Evans before the magistrate on the first occasion? A. No; the property could not be found on the first occasion - I believe that was the cause of his being discharged.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you present at the examination? A. Not at Union-hall - I do not know myself of his being at Union-hall.</p>

            . I am second clerk at the police-office, Union-hall. I heard a deposition read over to the prisoner, by Mr. Edwin, the chief clerk - this is Mr. Edwin's handwriting - (looking at it) - this is the magistrate's signature.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why has not the prisoner himself signed it? A. The prisoner seldom or ever signs his own state<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100017"/>ment; it has never been a custom - he was not asked to sign it - Mr. Edwin took it down - the magistrate was on the bench - he told the prisoner he need not say anything unless he pleased - I was in the office when Mr. Edwin took it down - I was near enough to hear what the prisoner said, but not to see that Mr. Edwin took it down correctly - I cannot undertake to say he took it correctly - the prisoner said he bought the horse in Smithfield market of a tall thin young man; he did not know who it was.</p>

            . I am a stable-keeper, and live with Mr. Smith, at the Royal Oak, Back-hill, Hatton-garden - I am in the habit of attending Smithfield market regularly - to the best of my recollection I was there on Friday, the 13th of September - I saw the prisoner buy an old horse there - I do not know the person he bought it of- it was a brown poor horse; a middling sized horse - I saw it walked myself - I bid the man 6l. for it - the prisoner bought it for 8l. - I saw him pay the man the money - I generally ask the name of persons I buy of - they give a name - I have repeatedly bought horses of persons who are strangers - I walked with the prisoner - he said he would give him 8l. for it, if it was a good worker in a town cart - I stood by till the horse was put into a cart and taken out again - he said to me, "Brown, will you go and take anything to drink? I think I shall get 1l. or 2l. by this horse"- he offered 8l., and I went with him into the Bull's Head, and he paid him what I supposed to be 8l., but I did not count the money - the Bull's Head is at the corner of St. John-street - I think it was between three and four o'clock - it was an open sale; there was no concealment whatever - I offered the money myself for it - they did not close the bargain until it was tried in harness, and the man said, "If you try it, you must pay the expense of trying it, whether you buy him or no" - I afterwards saw the prisoner pay the money to the same man; he was a tall thin man - it was more than I would give for it - he asked 10l. for it - I was not in the prisoner's company after that day - I did not leave him directly - I have seen the horse he is accused of stealing - it is decidedly the same horse, but it was in a deal better condition; the marks and the colour are the same.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On what day was this? A. On the Friday; to the best of my recollection it was the 13th - it was in the week after Barnet fair, which makes me recollect the time - Barnet fair is on the 4th of September - I saw the horse the prosecutor claims to-day.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL EASTMAN. The horse is over at the New Inn - I do not know whether he has seen it - I value it at 12l.</p>
               <p>W. J. BOWSER. The hostler was dressing it at the New Inn-yard.</p>
               <p>MR. DAWSON. Q. Are you aware whether it is usual to keep a book at Smithfield to enter the names of people who sell horses? A. It is, if people will go to that expense, but it is not done once in a hundred times, if persons appear respectable.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. You saw the hostler dressing the horse in the New Inn: was it pointed out to you, or did you know it yourself? A. I knew it myself; at a distance I said that was the horse.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you know it was at the New Inn? A. Some of the witness said, "Come along, let us go and see the horse," and before I got down the yard I recognised it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you positive as to the day of the month on which you saw the horse sold? A. I am not - it was on a Friday: it must be either the 12th or 19th - I do not know what day of the week Barnet fair was - it was in September.</p>

            . I am hostler at the White Lion stables, Edgeware road - I know the prisoner - I do not know how he gets his living - I have seen him about there a good many times - there are stables with room enough for sixty horses - it is open to any person who chooses to bring horses there - I have seen the prosecutor's horse this morning - that horse was at the White Lion four or five nights - the prisoner brought it there - I do not know the day of the month - I should think it was about six months ago, as near as I can guess - I could swear to the horse - he rode it about ever so many different times - he made no concealment; he offered him for sale to three or four - he asked 10l. for him, but he made 8l. or 8l. 10s. of him - I was present when he sold it in the yard, and know he did sell it to a man named Evans, who paid him the money in the house - I know Evans very well; he used our house - I have been there six years - he offered it to Mr. Franks, Mr. Pitcher, and, I think, to Mr. Ambrose, and different people besides.</p>
               <p>MR. DAWSON. Q. Just try and recollect when it was he brought the horse to your stables; do you know the month, at all? A. No: I cannot tell - it was about six months as near as I can tell - I cannot tell whether is was five or four months ago - I will not swear anything at all about it - I am quite sure he had it there, and am quite sure he sold it there - I do not know whether Evans knew the prisoner before - I should think it was nearly five months ago - I am no friend of the prisoner's - I have seen him repeatedly, and heard many people call him by his name - I think he was five nights there with the horse - he told me he had bought it at Smithfield - I did not see any advertisement - I heard Webster say there was an advertisement - I did not tell the prisoner of it - I am sure he sold it to Evans.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you in the habit of making an entry when a horse is taken in by you? A. Yes; I always settle with mistress once a week - I cannot tell the day of the month - I dare say I could tell if I had my book here - the horse was taken to the stable on Friday night - I saw the horse about an hour ago over the way - it was the same horse as I saw Evans buy of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a hay salesman, at No. 3 Wharf, Paddington. I only know the prisoner by seeing him walking backwards and forwards - he offered me a horse for sale - I cannot justly tell when - it is the same horse which is at the New Inn; but I do not know justly the time, as I did not take particular notice - he sold it to Evans about a week after he offered it to me - I thought it would not suit me - he asked me £9 for it - I did not see the prisoner use the horse at all - I went with him to look at it.</p>
               <p>Mr. DAWSON. Q. He sold it to Evans about a week after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100018"/>he had offered it to you? A. Yes; Evans being a neighbour of mine, came and asked if I knew who had a horse to sell, and I recommended Evans to him to buy it - he did not tell me how long had he had it, or where he bought it - I saw no hand-bills respecting it - I cannot recollect in what month he offered it to me - I took no particular notice of it- it was the latter end of the summer, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not in the winter? A. I cannot tell - I do not notice such things - I could tell if I was to look back in my business, because I recollect, I had a horse died about that time, and I wanted to replace him - I have not brought my book with me - I do not know that I can recollect justly the month my horse died.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the 16th of February, I heard a noise in Hoxton Town about 5 o'clock in the afternoon - I was in doors - I went out, Warren and the witness Slater were struggling together - I asked Slater what was the matter, - he said something about a robbery, and I took the boy into the school-room, which is called the chapel, and there Slater stated in his presence, that they had been robbed on two previous Sundays, that he had secreted himself in the singing gallery, and heard the window open, and two persons enter - that he afterwards heard the cupboards opened - he jumped down and took Warren, and Spencer escaped - I took Warren to the station-house, and on the way there, he said to me, "You are not going to fetch the two Spencers - they were with me, they live at the china shop in Hoxton Town" - after taking him to the station-house, I told him to come to the light of the gas, for I thought I knew him, and I recognised him as having seen him with the two Spencers on two previous Sundays, with money in their possession in a coffee-shop - Warren had said in the coffee-shop there, "Flare up! we won't have a penny egg, bring me a three-half-penny one" - and he admitted that before the magistrate - I went in search of the Spencers - I found them at their father's house - he is a very respectable man - I took them into custody - the youngest Spencer was admitted as evidence for the Crown, on account of his youth - all their parents are very respectable, and I do not think anybody could say a word against either of the boys previous to this transaction - their parents have lived at Hoxton for thirty years, and bore an excellent character in every respect.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SLATER re-examined. The window was shut before I heard it open, I am certain - I observed before that all the windows were fastened - the window under the gallery was fastened - when I got down, it was wide open - it fastens by a piece of wood falling - it is a sliding window, and when it is closed, the wood fastens it, and keeps the frame from sliding back - the window is nearly four feet from the ground - there is a railing before the window - it was opened by putting a hand through a pane of glass which was broken the week previous, and lifting up the latch inside - I am certain the window was latched with the wooden latch - I had examined the windows to see they were fast.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SLATER. I never heard anything amiss of Warren - it was far from the wish of the school to prosecute the children.</p>
               <p>JAMES CAULDWELL. Warren always conducted himself with the greatest propriety - he was the last boy I should have thought would have been guilty of such a crime - it was not our wish to prosecute; but Mr. Broughton compelled us, (after remanding them for a week,) much against our wish - I hoped he would have inflicted some punishment on them on the Monday morning.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see it in my hand at all? A. I did; you walked very fast out of the counting-house, and then ran - I saw you drawing the paper from the counter - you had it in your hands, and immediately put it down by another pile of paper - it was on two other bundles on the counter - this is the paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman never saw it in my hand - I went into an apothecary's shop, and asked if they wanted an errand boy - they advised me to go into this shop - I went, and saw a boy run from the door, and the paper lying down - the gentleman came up - I asked him if it was his, and he collared me.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took charge of the prisoner - I took him close to Shoe-lane - I was coming down Holborn-hill, and met him running up the hill - Mr. Vizeu gave me the handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Skinner-street, on the right hand side, from Newgate-street. I saw, on the other side of the way, something which I thought was a handkerchief. I crossed over and picked it up. I was returning with the handkerchief - I had just got to the other side of the way, when Mr. Vizeu came up, and asked if I was a countryman. I said I was not. He then said,"I have lost my handkerchief, and believe you have taken it;" but he hesitated before he said he believed I had it. Several people having seen me pick it up, I hesitated before I gave it to him; at last I did, and it fell in giving it to him. I was walking on, and he called, "Stop thief." I ran, and was stopped, by the poulterer's shop, by a policeman - several people were there - one came into the watch-house to establish my innocence, but was not allowed to be heard - several saw me pick it up, and some are in Court now.</p>

            . My husband is a copper-plate engraver, and lives at No. 2, Hertford-street, King's-road - on Wednesday evening, the 12th of March, near six o'clock, I was passing down Skinner-street, on the right hand side by the church - I saw the prisoner some distance before me - nearly half the length of Skinner-street - I saw a handkerchief lying on the pavement - to the best of my knowledge it was a red handkerchief, but I was on the opposite side of the way - it was near the dusk of the evening - I saw the prisoner cross from the side of Farringdon-street - it was a few steps from Farringdon-street where he picked it up- I saw him do it - the prosecutor came up and asked if he was a countryman - he said no, he was not - he said he had lost his handkerchief, and hesitated - the young man was giving him the handkerchief, and it dropped - (I was in Court while the prosecutor was giving evidence) - the prisoner then walked away; I lost sight of him entirely and was walking on, when the gentleman called "Stop thief"- immediately afterwards I saw the policeman bring back the prisoner - I followed them to the watch-house, and attempted to go in - a gentleman attempted to go in, but the gentleman who had lost the handkerchief said he required nobody to speak, he could speak sufficiently for himself - a man told me he said so - I tried to go in to state what I saw, and was refused - I never saw the prisoner except on the evening in question - I gave my address to his mother and sister, who came up to the watch-house door in tears - I gave them the back of a letter which I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You live with your husband? A. Yes - this was near six o'clock in the evening - it was very near dusk - I was coming from the City from St. Martin's le Grand - I had been to see a servant who had come out for a day's holiday - I was to meet him, but I did not, and was returning home - I did not see the prosecutor till he crossed over to the prisoner, who had crossed back to the side of the way I was on - the prisoner crossed to pick up the handkerchief, and then crossed back - I did not see how the handkerchief came on the pavement - I believe the prisoner pulled it out of his pocket, and dropped it - he walked away; the prosecutor said, "I have lost my handkerchief" - I did not hear what was said next - it fell on the pavement - I did not see the prosecutor at the time it was taken from him - I did not see him till he crossed the road to where I was - he crossed from the side where I had seen the handkerchief lying, and was following the prisoner, who was quite close to him - he crossed the road before he spoke to the prisoner - a great many people collected.</p>
               <p>MR. VIZEU re-examined. I declare on my oath that this woman never was near me - there was no person near me when the man threw the handkerchief on the ground; I immediately picked it up, and he immediately ran off - I felt the touch at my pocket, and instantly crossed, as I saw the person slide away - he threw the handkerchief down and ran away - there was no time for it to be drawn from my pocket, and thrown down, and picked up, for I turned round instantly - there was light enough for me to see.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How far is Pemberton-row from Skinner-street, where this happened? A. I should not think above five minutes' walk - my brother was going to fetch some stamps home, and somebody came and said he was taken to the watch-house - my mother and I ran to the watch-house, and met Mrs. Reed; and a working man wanted to get into the watch-house to state what he saw, and they would not admit him - my mother and I were in tears - Reed told us what she saw - we asked her to state what she saw, and she gave us the back of a letter - we wrote to here to come here yesterday - we never saw her before this occurred.</p>

            . I live at Roydon, in Essex - I was at the Three Nuns on the 12th of February - I saw Wright taking some coffee - he appeared out of his mind - I saw him go out of the room about ten o'clock in the morning - he walked away into Aldgate to the stand, and got into a cab which the prisoner drove - I told the prisoner not to take him away, for he appeared out of his mind - the prisoner drove him away - I had seen him pull out a silk purse, and it laid sideways on the table - I looked through the holes of the purse, and there was a good many sovereigns, and he had got a watch and seals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That was not in the prisoner's presence? A. No, another cabman drove him first, but I brought him back into the yard with the first cabman - he went away, and I followed him to the prisoner's cab - he had got into a coach before he got into the cab.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner was the person you told not to drive him off, but he did? A. Yes, I told him not to drive him away - I said the gentleman was out of his mind - he said, "Oh, I do not mind!" and drove off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written)."I was taken from the stand, at Aldgate, by a gentleman who caught hold of my reins, and bid me drive off towards Romford - no person came to me and desired me not to drive - I accordingly went, and on the way to Romford the gentleman behaved very strangely, and wanted to get out - I accordingly did drive him on, and then I had to drive him back again, fully intending to take him back to the Three Nuns - in the way home I had much difficulty in preventing him getting out- but he did at last get out near Whitechapel church, at the street leading into the Commercial-road, and ran off - it was late at night, and, after a short time (in carrying another fare who engaged me) I went home to my master's stables - the cab remained in the yard all night - the next morning I went to the stables to clean the cab, and, in pulling out the straw to replace it with fresh, the seals fell out - this was seen by my master and another person - I was recommended to keep the seals for two or three days in case they might be owned, and if nothing was heard, to take them to Somerset-house - I therefore had them in my pocket when the officer came to take me."</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LAKE re-examined. The seals were attached to a ring which hung in front of him - I do not know how it was fixed, but I saw it under his waistcoat, and could see the guard round his neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say that a madman, in a fit of insanity, might not seize them and tear the guard off? A. I do not know - I saw him pull his watch out once or twice to look what was o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How were the seals attached then? A. I did not take particular notice of that - they did not fall - there was a guard round his neck - I could see that shine under his waistcoat.</p>
               <p>JOHN BENNINGFIELD re-examined. I did not notice the seals.</p>

            . The seals hung as most gentlemen's seals do - the guard passing through the split ring.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What sort of guard was it? A. A silver guard - I should not think it was weak, but tough.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COOK re-examined. The ring was attached to the chain - the seals appeared safe - they could not fall off unless broken, but they might have been broken.</p>

            . I am a waterman at the Turk's Head, Aldgate, No. 84 - I am appointed by the Commissioners of Stamps - on the 12th of February I remember seeing a tall thin man get into a dark cab, No. 1,729 - that is not the prisoner's - the prisoner's is No. 1,407 - that was the second cab heg ot into - he got into a coach before he got into the prisoner's cab - he got in at one door and out at the other - then ran along the rank and got into the prisoner's cab, took hold of the reins himself, and told him to drive down the road - I did not see anybody come up, and tell the prisoner not to drive him - I saw them go up to the other cabman.</p>
               <p>Q. When he got into the coach, was the waiter at the door of the coach? A. No, there was a country looking gentleman with a brown coat on - that person did not go up to the prisoner's cab, and tell him anything.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You generally get a gratuity from the cabmen, don't you? A. I get a penny from each - I got a penny from the first one, but I had not time to take one of the prisoner - the gentleman got hold of the reins himself so quick - Lake is the gentleman who spoke to the first man - I swear he did not speak to the prisoner - he spoke to the coachman and the first cabman, but let the man drive off.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was he near at the time he got into the prisoner's cab? A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LAKE re-examined. Q. Is that correct? A. No; the gentleman got out at the same door as he got in at, on the same side of the way - while I was telling the coachman not to drive him away, saying he was out of his mind, a cabman drove up to the door, he got into the cab, and I said to the cabman, "Don't drive him away, he is out of his mind" - that was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Then the man did not get in at one door, and out at the other? A. No; he did not go through the coach, I do not know whether it was the cabman or the gentleman, that turned the horse round and drove away - he got into the coach, and the cabman drove the horse round - he did not produce a watch or seals or money to the cabman - the moment he was in, the horse was turned round for Romford - I got into the first cab, and made the man drive him back into the Inn yard - the prisoner drove up to the coach door without being called, and I said, "Don't drive away: the gentleman is out of his mind."</p>
               <p>F. ELLIS re-examined. Q. Is what you swore true? A. Yes; the man got in at the left hand side, and out at the right - Parry was five or six lengths down the rank - the man went to him to get into the cab - the prisoner was cleaning his cab, and the gentleman jumped in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was he cleaning his cab? A. Rubbing the brass work in front - the gentleman jumped in - the prisoner turned round, took his seat, and they drove off together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which way was the horse's head turned? A. Towards Aldgate church, which is the general way of the rank - they turned round to go towards Romford - I heard no directions given which way to drive - I had heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100023"/>Lake interfere with the first cab and the coach - I could not get near him - I was shutting the door of the coach, and he jumped out at the other side - the third cab was next to the Boar, four or five cabs off - I was taking directions at the coach door - the person did not speak to the cabman, for the gentleman was speaking to the coachman at the same time as he jumped into the cab.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who was speaking to the coachman? A. The witness who was last up here; and at that time the gentleman bolted away, and went to the cab four cabs off - it was not the gentleman who was speaking to the coachman, but the witness - when I opened the door for the gentleman to get in, Legg went to the coachman, and told him not to drive him away - he was near me until the gentleman got in, and went round to the cab.</p>

            . I keep the Mitre livery-stables in Mitre-street. The prisoner stands at my stable - on the morning of the 13th of January, between half-past ten and eleven o'clock, I saw him cleaning his cab - I saw him take the straw out of the bottom - I was called away; but I saw a little bunch of seals fall from the straw - I saw the prisoner pick them up, and put them into his pocket - his master stood by the side of me at the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the cab been out that day? A. Not that morning - I was standing on the near side of the cab; and the prisoner pulled it out at the off-side, on the same side as the driver sits - there was no straw in the place where the driver sits; but he was pulling it out at that side - he did not call my attention to it - I was called away to a gentleman - it was a little bunch with two or three seals - they were not shown to me - he goes out of a morning, sometimes about half-past ten o'clock, sometimes not till twelve o'clock - Swain has at times only one horse to work with the cab.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was he pulling out the straw in the usual way on that side? A. Pulling it out to put fresh straw in - on the 12th of February he drove the cab home about twelve o'clock at night - he was solid and sober then.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was Underwood by when the seals were seen? A. Yes; he saw them drop out of the cab - he was pulling the straw out of the cab - he was at the driver's side, I think; he pulled the straw out and threw it on the ground, and the seals shook through on the ground - he told me he had taken a gentleman to Romford the day before - before he found the seals, he did not say any thing about the gentleman he took to Romford; only he gave me the duty-ticket of the gate - it was when he gave me the duty-ticket that he told me he had been to Romford - the seals were found on the 13th of February - he was taken into custody on Saturday afternoon, I believe - the 13th of February was on Thursday - he mentioned about driving the gentleman to Romford on the Thursday; but it was on Wednesday he drove him - he said nothing about a man out of his mind - he told me that morning, he had come home about nine or half-past eight o'clock the evening previous - I had not seen him overnight - I do not sleep on the premises - my cab does not go out at any particular time in the morning - I have only one horse to it; and when it does well, and comes home in the afternoon, the horse has rest - the prisoner gave me the day's work; he paid me 14s. for the day's work - he gave it me in silver.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Does he live with you at night? A. No; he gives me the money the following morning; but I have let it go a week or fortnight - I do not expect him to bring me the money at night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does he pay you one sum whatever he does? A. When he does well, he pays me more - if he goes twenty-four miles, I consider it a very hard day's work, and give him more rest in the morning - half-past ten o'clock would be none too early to go out.</p>

             (police-constable E 115). I took the prisoner into custody at a pastry-cook's shop, where she was in the habit of visiting the servant girl - I told the prisoner Mr. Jarvis wanted to speak to her - she said she knew nothing of Mr. Jarvis, but in going to the office she said she thought they could not do much to her - that she certainly did pawn the plate, but had given all the money to Develing.</p>
               <p>MR. JARVIS. This is my plate; it had been kept in a cupboard in the butler's pantry - the prisoner could not get it without receiving the key from Develing; unless Develing had left the key in the lock - the plate was in the care of Develing - I found the duplicates in the plate chest.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever authorize any one to pawn it? A. No; I believe the money was spent in drink by Develing and the prisoner.(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she was not aware the plate she had pledged for Develing, was without her master's knowledge.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). As respects the charge of embezzlement of £1. 2s. 10d., on the 8th of March last, that sum was received by me on that day, on my master's account, and was in my possession at the time I was taken by a policeman, and taken from me on the same day, the 8th of March, by him, which prevented my paying it over to my master - at the time I was taken, my master owed me 16s. for a week's wages, and my clothes, worth between two and three pounds, were in his possession - as to the other charges, many of the figures are written in pencil, as is usual in the trade, and from the lapse of time, I cannot speak to the particular facts, but throw myself on your merciful consideration.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 10th of March I went with a warrant between nine and ten o'clock, to the prisoner - I found him at work - his trowsers were in a terrible black state - I searched his house, but did not find the copper - I asked the prisoner how his trowsers became so black - he said the chimney had been on fire the day before - I went and looked about - I found some soot on a gap in a hedge, and some soot on the grass on which some one had been kneeling, and the marks on the soot exactly corresponded with the corduroy breeches which the prisoner wore.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner say that his landlord's chimney had been on fire the day before, and he assisted to extinguish the fire? A. Yes.</p>

On the 3rd of March I was called to take the prisoner, who was then in a pawnbroker's shop - she said, "How foolish it is for you to take me into custody, when, if you will give me time, I will get the things out" - I went to her lodgings, and found the two duplicates, which led me to the pawnbroker's where these things were - I was laid up at the time, or I could have produced several other charges against her - I have a handkerchief in my pocket now, belonging to a gentleman, who discharged a servant in consequence of it.</p>

On Wednesday, the 19th of March, I went out about two o'clock in the afternoon, leaving my wife in the house - she is not here - I was sent for about five o'clock, and found my wife at home - I found the house had been opened, and my clothes taken away - the back-door was opened and the bed-room - whether my wife fastened the house up when she went out, I cannot tell - I missed the articles stated in the indictment - I had seen the coat a day or two before in my box - I had seen the silk handkerchief on the Sunday - the trowsers I had not worn for several weeks - I cannot say they were all in the house that day - I have every reason to believe they were - I had not seen them for a day or two, as the chest was locked up - the prisoner is my son.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Warren place, Camden-Town. On the 19th of March, the prisoner brought a coat and trowsers wrapped in a handkerchief - I knew him before - he pawned them for 5s. in the name of John Horniblew, about four o'clock in the afternoon - he said they belonged to his father, who had sent him to pawn them - I did not know his name was not John - I recollect his coming to our shop about three times before - I am quite certain of him.</p>

             (police-constable S 118). I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday evening, the 23d of March, by his father's orders - he said he had made it all right with his father.</p>
               <p>ANTHONY HORNIBLEW re-examined. I know these things to be mine - I have had the coat about six months - I did not give him directions to pawn them - the trowsers are mine - I know the handkerchief by a hole in it - my son has not lived with me for some time - he has been a good deal out of employ - I did not turn him out of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I sat in-doors, my father and mother were eating their meals; they used to see me sit there, and not give me a mouthful; and so, when he went out, my mother said, "You had better take these things and go and pawn them - and that will learn your father to give you victuals another time."</p>
               <p>ANTHONY HORNIBLEW re-examined. I did not turn him out of doors - I do not recollect his stating this before the magistrate - my wife had nothing to do with it - she went out after I did, and while she was gone it was done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was but a few months ago that his wife took the things and pawned them, and kept away from him for three months - he did not exactly turn me out, but he said I should not come into his house - there are seven brothers of us, and two girls, and he hates me the worst of the lot - he told me to go and get my living where I could - he has told everybody not to come near me.</p>
               <p>ANTHONY HORNIBLEW. My present wife is not his mother - it is all false; I have half kept him for months, and have sent him things to the prison, and this morning, I gave him all the money I had but 1s. - I am sorry I am obliged to appear here.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What height is the wall they got over? A. He got over the rails, and from the rails on to the wall - the wall is about eight feet high - I never lost sight of Leppard - I could not distinguish his features - I saw the policeman catch him getting off the wall - he was off the wall when I saw him taken - the wall did not conceal him, because I was considerably higher than it, and could see over - I was very near them - I ran into master's bed-room, and missed his gold watch off the mantel-piece, and the silver spoon out of the kitchen.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the morning of the 25th of March I was on duty in Park-road, Regent's-park - I heard a female cry, "Murder - Stop thief" - I immediately ran to the house, No. 1, Park-road, and saw the prisoner Leppard, just getting off the wall - I immediately took him - then sprung my rattle - Serjeant Tate came up- I gave the prisoner to him - the housekeeper still remained at the window, wishing some one to come inside - I got over the rails; and on my way up to the house, I found this hat in the garden - on getting nearer to the house, I found the kitchen window broken in - it appeared to be burst in, and forced from the outside - I found the prisoner, Smith's, shoes inside the window - he owned them at the station-house - I went up to the housekeeper's room, and then she missed the gold watch - I came down, unbolted and unlocked the street door, came out and took Leppard, whom I had left in custody of Tate - on taking him to the station-house he behaved in a most disorderly manner, ill-using me - he bit me through the thumb to the bone, at the same time laying hold of my *** - I was laid up two days in consequence of the ill-usage I received from him - Smith was taken by some other officer - Smith acknowledged the shoes to be his at the station-house, but afterwards said,"They are not my shoes" - one of the shoes, he said, was not his, but belonged to Leppard - I found in the passage a piece of green stuff, a green shooting-jacket, 3 pair of breeches, a pair of white trousers, four pair of gaiters and an odd one, and a dressing-gown; and ofter locking them up at the station-house, the gold watch was found by another officer.</p>

             (police-sergeant). I was in the Park-road in consequence of the cry of "Murder," I went to the prosecutor's, and found the prisoner Leppard and Hull struggling at the gate - I seized hold of him, searched him, and found the handle of a plated candlestick, and a knife in his right hand pocket - Smith was directly brought up by two other constables, who had secured his hands - he had neither hat nor shoes on - I searched, and found in his coat pocket a razor with the prosecutor's name on it - I examined the kitchen window, found the sash forced out of the frame by some instrument; but the brick-work of the sash was rather rotten - I could not make it correspond with an instrument we afterwards found - the sash stood up against the wall inside the kitchen.</p>

On the 25th of March, I was on duty in Boston-street - about a quarter before four o'clock I was alarmed by a female calling "Stop thief!" and directly after I heard a rattle spring - I heard somebody come running down the road, and directly turned round the corner - it was Smith - I told him to stop - he took no notice of me - I shoved him against the pales, and stopped him - I then saw his hand go as if he threw something away - I asked what he had been doing - he said,"What is that to you?" - I took him back to the prosecutor's house, and there he was searched by Tate - when we took him to the station-house I returned to the house to inquire what was lost; and I went directly back to the spot where I took Smith, and found a spoon and a gold watch - I found them about four yards from Boston-street - he had thrown them over a place into a private ground - that was where I saw him throw something away - he had neither hat nor shoes on.</p>

On the 25th of March I was in Park-road - I heard a female scream, and a window crash as if it was broken - I ran towards No. 1, and saw Smith jump over the wall - I sprung my rattle immediately, and he ran in the direction of Boston-street - I continued springing my rattle, and never lost sight of him until he was stopped by Boat - we brought him back to the house, and Leppard was there in custody - we took Smith to the station-house - I found a crow-bar in the road just where Smith had jumped over the wall - the Kitchen window had been wrenched by some instrument.</p>

               <p>Smith's Defence. I was at work for Mr. Wirgman till eleven o'clock at night, and that razor fell out in the van; I picked it up when I got home; the shoes and hat are not mine.</p>

            . Q. Have you told us every thing you saw? A. I believe so, as far as I recollect - I had a pistol, and told them all, if they resisted, I would shoot them - it was loaded - what Hunt handed to Shipley was hot - I believe he dropped it - Peapall tried to make his escape directly I got into the room - he did not touch any of the implements - I was once in St. Catherine's Dock, and left because it did not suit me - I was not dismissed - there was never any charge made against me for stealing brandy, nor of stealing a donkey: except by people of this sort - there is no charge in the least against me in the police - I was never accused in my life of making false charges against any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not now under suspicion, and only allowed to wear your uniform till this trial is over? A. I am not - I was three years in St. Catherine's Docks - I went from there to Mr. Freeman's stone-wharf, Millbank, and left him on purpose to join the police - Miller had a file in his hand - that was all I saw him do - I have seen Hunt go backwards and forwards there night and day - I know he lived there - I had seen Peapall in the street about an hour or half an hour before - it was more than half an hour - I had been watching the house for a good while - I saw Peapall at the end of the street with a good many more - I did not continue watching - sometimes I had other business - I was not watching the house all that day - I was watching it for twenty minutes before I went in - in the course of that twenty minutes I saw some women go in - it is a kind of lodging-house - Peapall was not one of those persons - I do not know the name of any body who went in - it is a general house for these kind of people - three or four different families lodge there.</p>

I assisted in apprehending the prisoners - I have heard the evidence of the last two witnesses, and agree to what they state, as far as I was present - I found two bad half-crowns; one on the table, and one on the floor - I stopped Peapall, who was making his escape; and when I took Hunt, I searched him, and found three good shillings on him - when I entered the room, Miller dropped something - Goose picked it up - it proved to be a file; and I saw him heave away half-a-crown, which Booth took up - I took Peapall to the station-house - they met Bill Ballard - we were all close together in Orchard-street - Ballard wanted to know what was the matter; and I think it was Hunt said, "It is all up" - Peapall said nothing.</p>

            , of No. 7, New-street, Pye-street. He works at Hammersmith - Shipley came to me for a lodging about two months before she was taken - she came to me at No. 7, New-street, Pye-street - she looked at the second floor back room in No. 10 - she returned, and gave 1s. earnest for the room, at 3s. 6d. per week - she called herself a single woman, and paid the rent until she was taken - I went to the room once and saw Hunt there, and only him and Shipley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At that time did you observe any thing wrong? A. Not in the least - Hunt was washing himself there.</p>

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin to his Majesty's mint. I have been experienced in coin several years - this is a plaster of Paris mould for casting a half-crown - it has the impression of the obverse and reverse side of a half-crown, and appears to have been used - here is a good half-crown, and the mould appears to have been made with this good half-crown - this is a counterfeit half-crown which has been made in the mould - it agrees in date and every thing - it is the half-crown found in the mould - these two half-crowns produced by a witness are both counterfeit, and the same in all respects as the other - they were cast in this mould; and the one found on Miller is the same - this file has white metal in the teeth of it, such as would be used to remove the surplus metal from the edge - these spoons are the same metal as the base coin,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100035"/>and here is a pipkin with white metal of a similar description in it, and this tin hand appears to have been used in forming the mould, to keep it together while the plaster of Paris was in a liquid state - this tobacco-pipe has some white metal in the bowl, and might be used to ladle the metal out of the pipkin - this is plaster of Paris in the bottle.</p>
               <p>Hunt's Defence. I went up to No. 10, Pye-street, as I knew this girl as a friend, and had something to drink with her - I left word at the public-house that Peapall was to call there for his tobacco-box - he came, and was going out, when the policeman broke the door open, and swore he would blow my b - y brains out if I stirred.</p>
               <p>Shipley's Defence. Hunt came into my room about half an hour previous - he sent me out for six pennyworth of rum - I went and fetched it - I had occasion to go to two or three different places - I was not gone more than half an hour - I returned - we drank the liquor, and when I returned the other two prisoners were in the room - I returned with a bottle which I had borrowed at the inn; and keeping on my bonnet and shawl, I came down stairs a second time - I threw my shawl on the chair immediately, went to the bed, and put my bonnet inside the bed, and was returning from the bed, having occasion to go out again, when the policemen surprised me by the sudden entrance - the first policeman who entered, to the best of my knowledge, was Goose - he flew to Hunt - two others flew to the others, and the fourth stationed himself with his back towards the door - they bid me stand in the same position as I was in when they entered, which I did - when they searched the other prisoners a policeman came and searched me - then he left me in care of another while he took the three prisoners to the station-house - then came back and took me.</p>

               <p>Miller's Defence. I came up to the room knocking at the door - the prisoner, Shipley, let me in - I went for a clean shirt she had of mine, and in five or ten minutes Goose arrived - he immediately rushed to Hunt, put the pistol to his head, and said, he would blow his b - y brains out if he moved - he could not see me, for I was behind him, and he took a false oath that it was I dropped the file - I had nothing to do with it - a policeman laid hold of me, and took an oath I had thrown one across the room, but I had nothing in my hand - when Clifton went to give his evidence, Goose was behind him putting the words into his mouth.</p>
               <p>Peapall's Defence. I live at No. 4, New Peter-street. I was returning home - I called on Hunt for a tobacco-box I had given him the night before and forgotten, and was not in the room three minutes when Goose rushed in - I was taken to the station-house - Goose came and said, "Peapall, I am sorry for you, for I saw you go in not five minutes before, myself" - a soldier was in the place, and heard it, and they would not allow him to give his evidence - he is in the 15th Hussars, and is gone to Ireland, or he could take his oath I had not been there five minutes.</p>

No; my father was not at the cart all the time - he was gone down Old-change with a large bundle on his back - it was between twelve and one o'clock in the day - there were not many people walking about - there was a woman selling apples, and she saw it - I saw the prisoner again in about half an hour - the cart was then led away up Old-change - I am not mistaken in him - I took particular notice of him - I was frightened when I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. You were quite speechless? A. Yes - he dropped the parcel on the pavement when I got up again - he put it down as I walked towards him - he chucked it down, and broke the string - I took the parcel up while I was on my knees - I was almost up when he threw it down - I was in the road - he ran away, not taking any thing with him - the parcel is not very heavy.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not turn a corner? A. Yes, he turned two corners - I saw round both corners - I cannot see through a house; but I saw him turn the corner - I was following after him, within a dozen yards - I did not turn the corner at the same time; but I did not lose sight of him - I was not so close to him, when he turned the corner, as I was before, and of course lost sight of him - I knew him again the moment I got my eye on him - the boy cried, "Stop thief," as loud as he could bawl - he was not running when he was calling"Stop thief."</p>

             (City policeman, No. 36). I took the prisoner into custody in Bartholomew-close - he had been previously stopped by a crowd who followed him - I do not recollect seeing Sayer till we came to the top of Butcherhall-lane - I took him at the corner of Old Change, and the boy was there with the cart - that was about three hundred yards from where I took him - there is one turning into St. Paul's Church-yard, another into Newgate-street, a third into Butcherhall-lane, and a fourth into Bartholomew-close.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near was Sayer to the prisoner when you took him? A. I cannot say, but to the best of my recollection the first time I saw him was near the corner of Butcherhall-lane - there is a turning between where I saw Sayer, and where I took him - Sayer certainly might have had me in sight when I took the prisoner - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100038"/>do not mean to say he was not present - he might be in the crowd - there was a cry of "Stop thief" - Sayer was standing with the rest of the crowd when I saw him, and appeared to have been running - I should think it is above one hundred yards from where I took him to where I saw Sayer standing.</p>

             were with me; but they were a few yards before me - I had two ladies' work boxes tied in a handkerchief, and they were inside a ladies' dressing box, which was tied round with a double tape, and hung on my arm - Curtis came up to me, struck me a violent blow in the face, made use of a vile expression, and told me to drop the things - I called to Allen and Pavitt for help, but they were prevented by some other persons from coming to my assistance - Curtis got the property from me - he put his knee on it, and broke it - he then walked away pretty fast - it was dark, but the gas enabled me to see him - I pursued him, and called the police - when he found the police were coming, he dropped the boxes, and I gave him into custody - I did not see any one with him whom I could swear to; but there were both men and women with him - I called out murder - from the blows I received, I had a black eye, and my cheek was cut open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you a widow? A. Yes; Mr. Lilly has been dead three years - he was transported - I heard he was dead from a sailor who came from there - I was once tried here, but I was brought here innocently - there was another tried with me - I believe she was transported - it was for some wearing apparel - I now live with Henry Pavitt - he is married, and has three children - he pays for them - his wife and children do not live with him - I do not know what prevents them - this was about a quarter to four o'clock in the morning - we were going home - we had been out spending the evening with a party of friends, of Pavitt's, in Shoreditch - I had some beer with my supper - we had taken these boxes out in the evening to sell them; and we had one ordered by a lady in Holywell-street, Strand - I cannot tell how we got to St. Giles's to go from Shoreditch to Hampstead Road - I do not know that end of the town - Curtis was taken in about five or ten minutes.</p>

On the morning of the 25th of February, I was coming along the Bowl-yard with Allen, and Lilly was ten or twelve yards behind us - she called out Harry, and we turned, and saw some one ill-using her - before we got to her, we were surrounded - Allen was knocked down, and kicked severely - some more tried to get me down, and very ill-used me - I did not see Lilly until she came to me again - she had had two work boxes, and a lady's dressing box, tied with a tape, on her arm - there might be a dozen persons there, but I could not swear to any one - I was so beat about, I half lost my senses.</p>

            . Q. Were they all men? A. I believe one or two were women - I make boxes, and hawk them - I have no houses in Eden-street - I am a lodger of Frederick Allen's - I do not live with my wife - I live with Lilly - we had been that night to Shoreditch with a party of friends; and on returning home, we went through the Bowl-yard - we had been round Covent-garden to try to get something to drink, as it was market morning; but we did not get any thing - we had been four or five hours with our friends - we had some porter - I had no gin - I was not drunk - there was no gin drank in my presence, nor to my knowledge - I had been hawking those boxes round Spitalfields, and other places, that evening - we were not in Westminster to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK ALLEN. I live in Eden-street, Hampstead-road. I was with the prosecutor and Lilly, going home, at half-past three, or twenty minutes to four o'clock - I heard Lilly cry out, and went back to her assistance - I was assailed by Cain and several others, who began beating me, and prevented my going to Lilly - I was knocked down; but I got up again, and followed Cain across the road - we had a bit of a scuffle - I was thrown down and kicked on the head - Cain then ran off, and the officer took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. How came you to walk away from Lilly? A. Pavitt and I had some talk which we did not wish her to hear - I am a carpenter, but it is nearly three years since I was in work - I have been supported by my father and mother, who live in the country - I am the landlord of the house I live in, but I do not rent any other - I sometimes receive the rent of the next house (No. 11) for my father - it is let to a female - I do not know what she is.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, is it not a brothel? A. It is - I have nothing to do with any other brothel - I do not choose to tell where my father lives, nor what he allows me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. You saw them talking with some other persons? A. Yes: I was about 100 yards off when I heard the cry - I got up in about a minute - Lilly could not have got any distance before I got up; and when I got up, the box was on her arm.</p>
               <p>Curtis's Defence. I had been with some friends about ten minutes before I was taken - I am quite innocent - Lilly was tipsy.</p>

               <p>CHARLES SAMUEL CARTER. I live in Throgmorton-street.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you recollect doing any thing at all with the watch? A. No; I might have put it between the bed and mattress; there is nothing impossible.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask where her sister lived? A. No; I did not, because she told so many different stories, without my asking her - she was in conversation with the prosecutor - she at first said her sister lived in Salmon-lane - she then said her sister lived at the back of Mr. Belton's, close to the East India Docks - she then said her sister lived near the Royal Duke - she stated these three different places to the prosecutor - I cannot tell what he said - I did not tell the magistrate that she stated these three different places - I thought it was not worth while.</p>

             (police-sergeant K 10). I was on duty, when the prisoner was brought in, in custody, about three o'clock that morning - the prosecutor charged her with stealing some sovereigns; he thought four; but he could not say - she said she had never seen him - he was sober, but she was intoxicated - I think she might be able to pick a pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was she so intoxicated that a sober man might have prevented her from putting her hand into his pocket? A. I should think so - it was about three o'clock when I saw her.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Was this hat tied to the hat-board? A. Yes, with a string round it - there were about six hats on the board - it could not be knocked off with a stick - the board was about five feet from the threshold of the door, and round the corner from the shop window - the prisoner had got about twenty doors down the street, when I first saw him - it was half-past ten o'clock in the morning - I saw his face as he turned a court, and he then stumbled - it looked like a bad house that he went into - he was found in the gutter of the house.</p>

             (police-constable G 57). I took the prisoner - the prosecutor accused her of robbing him of 4l. - she denied it - I said she must go to the station-house, and when she got half-way up the street, I saw her put her hand into her bosom - I took her hand, and found in it these two sovereigns, this half-sovereign, and two quarter rupees, and in the scuffle of taking them from her hand I thought I heard something fall - I took her to the station-house, and came back to the spot, but could find nothing there - I went again at daylight, and found this other quarter of a rupee - the prisoner said, "You have lagged my Jem, and now I will go after him."</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WHITFORD. This is my master's silk - I have brought the piece it was cut from.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was that piece of silk in the warehouse before you came to live there? Witness. I do not know- about three quarters of a yard may be used from a piece to make patterns - I do not know how many pattern cards were made - I have found mistakes in the books - I do not know that there are many pieces of this pattern silk in the trade - I did not see you cut the silk.</p>

They are papers which have come round cloths from the country - they certainly are not new - I do not know that it is the custom of the trade to give them as perquisites - there are five months' wages due to the prisoner, at 25l. a-year - he had given me warning on the Friday before, but he had not left me.</p>

               <p>JAMES BARROW re-examined.

            . On the 8th of March, I drove the Birmingham Celerity coach, and saw the prisoner, about a quarter or twenty minutes to two o'clock in the morning, on horseback, in Towcester town, about four miles from Blixley - I met him on a chesnut mare - I turned round, and he rode by my side, 15 or 16 miles, alongside of my lamp - I noticed it as being a particularly fast trotter - it kept up with my coach - I lost the prisoner at Dropshot - it was a dark night, but I had two pair of lamps - I imagined he had stolen the mare, because he got through the turnpike gates without paying them, except one, where I winked at the turnpike man - I lost him near Brickhill-hill - one of the roads where I left him would lead to Edgeware - I afterwards saw him and the mare at Edgeware, and I am certain he is the man, and it was the same mare - that was on Wednesday, the 20th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many days afterwards? A. Twelve days - it may be fifteen miles from Brickhill to Edgeware - I do not know the distance at all - I took particular notice of the mare and the colour of it - I thought it singular he should ride so many miles with me, and his slipping through the gates - he went from one side of the coach to the other; sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other - I altered my pace, and beat him, and sometimes he beat me.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you, in consequence of his shifting from one side to the other, observe him more particularly? A. I did.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CHAMBERS. I live at Blixley, in Northamptonshire. In consequence of information from my servant, I went in search of my mare, on the 8th of March; and in consequence of inquiry, I got to Edgeware - I went to the White Lion, and saw the ostler; and, in consequence of what he told me, I went into the house, and found the prisoner there - several persons were there - he sat in the window - I said, "Young man, you have got a useful mare at the door here" - (I had seen the mare then; it was mine) - he got up, and came across the room; and when I came to the door, I asked the ostler, in his hearing, if he was the young man who brought the mare there - he said he was - the prisoner directly ran away, and crossed over the turnpike, and ran across the fields - I followed him on horseback, and overtook him - I told him I should take him - he said he hoped I should be as favourable as I could with him - I told him it was not likely I should be very favourable in the way he had served me - I afterwards took possession of the mare, and am quite certain it is the one I had lost - it is worth between 30l. and 40l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you took him, did you charge him with stealing it? A. Yes; he confessed it to me on the spot.</p>

            . I live in Brick-lane. I was in my shop - the constable brought the prisoner in, and I saw them searched - in about a quarter of an hour after they were gone, I found a piece of wire on the floor - before they came in I had not noticed the floor for some hours - I gave it to Thomas Smeaton, desiring him to take care of it, in case it might be wanted.</p>

            . I received the wire from my master- I saw him pick it up - it remained in my possession till next morning; I then gave it to Miss Bouchard - I had swept the floor half an hour before the prisoners came in- the wire was not there then - a great many other persons had been in the shop.</p>
               <p>CHARLES EAST. I saw nothing of the wire, I had not dropped it there.</p>

               <p>Castles. When I was taken into the shop I had the metal chain and two seals tied to my fob, and the policeman never took them from me.</p>

            . I live at No. 88, Hare-street, Bethnal-green - I deal in clothes, and sometimes other things, in Petticoat-lane - about ten weeks ago, I sold Castles a chain like that, but there are so many hundreds alike, it is impossible to say this is it - as far as I can take my oath, it was exactly like this, there was no seals to it - he put two seals on it - a woman brought me to the dock to see if I could identify him as the man, and I could - I know him because he asked me to give him a stoutish pin, I gave him one, and he pinned the chain to his fob - I thought it strange to buy a chain without a watch, which made me notice him - this happened at my stall in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Castles. The seals belong to my father - the prosecutor would have sworn to them before the magistrate, if I had not said so.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA BOUCHARD re-examined. I said I thought one of the seals was like what was in my window, but I did not like to swear to it - a great many more things were missing from my window - I do not swear to the seals.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CASTLES. I am the brother of the prisoner - I can take my oath I saw that chain in my brother's fob before he was taken, and the two seals belong to my father - he had the chain in his possession a fortnight before he was taken - I did not see him buy it - he has worn the seals ten years - my father is alive, but is not here.</p>
               <p>Castles. Dorset went to my mother and said, if she would pay him his expenses he would not come against me.</p>
               <p>JOHN DORSET re-examined. I did not do so - ever since they have been in custody their friends have come backwards and forwards to me to bribe me not to come, but I would not listen to it - they have threatened me even in the yard - I belonged to the Hampshire militia - Mr. Alderman Wood was the colonel - I was out four days, and Castles' friends charge me with being a deserter.</p>

On the 6th of March I was pot-boy at the Rose and Crown - I know the prisoner, and saw him there that day - a stranger was with him - it was a dark man, with large bushy whiskers, a frock coat, and slatecoloured trowsers - he looked respectable - he and the prisoner were drinking together for about ten minutes - the man went out and left the prisoner behind him - the prisoner asked him if he would have any more of the ale, he said, "No, drink it," and then went out - then the prisoner told me he had had many a good glass of ale at that man's mother's - the prisoner then went after him - they seemed familiar together.</p>

            , a soap-manufacturer at Bermondsey, as to the stability of Dobson - the Bill of Exchange was to be given for 30l. - he stated Dobson to be in the receipt of about 140l. a-year - after four or five days, during which I had made inquiry, he called on me again - I drew this bill, addressing it to William Dobson,(producing it) and handed it him to procure the acceptance of Dobson - he came to me about four days afterwards, and handed me the bill in its present state, apparently accepted by William Dobson - he said nothing more about Dobson - other persons were with him, and the person who was negotiating the business for him came with him to execute the warrant, and handed over the bill - a warrant of attorney was executed, and the bill delivered by the prisoner, and he endorsed it - upon that proceedings in the action were stayed - the bill became due on the 12th of February - it had been handed to my client - it is now in my hand unpaid - two sums of 6l. each have been paid on account of the warrant of attorney.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How much is there unpaid? A. 18l.; the sums were paid to me - I do not know whether I gave any receipt for them - we commonly write the amount off on the instrument - I always give a receipt when requested - the warrant was filed in the proper office - I do not know whether I wrote the sums off on the warrant - I presume I did - I may be wrong - I did not know it was material, and am not able to say - I recollect that 12l. was paid.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have stated that he paid two sums of 6l., how is it that you recollect that, as you do not recollect giving any receipt? A. I know those two sums were paid to me at my office.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was anybody present? A. I do not know - these sums are entered in my book - I have not my books here - I am constantly referring to them - I have not looked at them to satisfy myself about these two sums- the first sum was paid the latter end of November or beginning of December - the second, I think, two or three weeks afterwards.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100053"/>Q. Are you not in the habit of giving vouchers for sums paid you? A. Yes; I usually write sums off on a warrant of attorney, but do not recollect whether we did so in this case - I have not looked at it to ascertain - there was 18l. due - the bill was for 30l. - I do not know Dobson - I never spoke to him - the warrant of attorney is field in the office at the Court of King's Bench - it has been out of my possession since December or January.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You field the warrant in December? A. Yes; there is an Act of Parliament, obliging me to file a warrant of attorney - I had not any idea that the bill was forged, at the time it was given to me.</p>

            . I am a drysalter, living in Leadenhall-street - I was at Mr. Venning's at the time the bill was given by the prisoner - the prisoner and Mr. Gee wrote on the warrant of attorney - the prisoner told me an action had been brought against him and Mr. Gee, by Venning and Co. - and, as I knew Messrs. Venning, he asked me if I would go and stop the action - I went and spoke to Mr. Venning - the prisoner said, if I could stop the action, he would give the acceptance of his brother-in-law, Mr. Dobson - and it was in consequence of that, the bill was given - I was present when the bill was drawn, and when it was given to Mr. Venning, as being accepted (looking at it) - I have known Mr. Dobson about fifteen months, and have seen him write several times - I have endorsed this bill myself; but, at the time, did not look at the acceptance - I have seen Dobson write repeatedly; and on close examination, I do not believe it to be his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You endorsed it without seeing whether it was accepted? A. Yes; I knew I was rendering myself liable - I saw it was accepted, but did not scrutinize the acceptance - I looked at the name - I endorsed the bill to oblige the prisoner - as Mr. Venning said if I endorsed it, he would take it - I read the name in which it was accepted - I never satisfied myself whether it was a genuine signature, or not - I was merely doing a friendly action to serve the prisoner - I knew the prisoner and Dobson were related - I did not know they were intimate - I had not known Dobson's handwriting particularly well - but I have seen him write several times since that, and before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has he been writing in your presence, and called your attention to his writing since, desiring you to look at his writing? A. I have seen him write since - I do not know that he has written in my presence, and called my attention to it since this - I have seen him write two or three times since - I will swear I have seen him write three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he write for the very purpose of your seeing his handwriting? A. He has certainly.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the prisoner produce the Bill of Exchange? A. Yes - it did not enter into my mind that it was a forgery - I believed it was a genuine bill, and put my name on it without examining it particularly - I am now of opinion it is not Dobson's handwriting - he wrote several times in my presence, before the bill was in existence - he has since written in my presence, that I might be able to prove it hereafter, (within these two months) - if he had not done that, I should have given the same evidence exactly as I do now - that I do not believe it to be his handwriting, having seen him write previously.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM DOBSON. This Bill of Exchange is not my handwriting - I never accepted this bill, nor authorized or empowered the prisoner to accept it - I knew nothing of it till it was presented to me and refused payment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What line of life are you in? A. An officer of Excise, and have been so thirty-three years- I am not always in want of money - at one time I was not- I am at present, and have been so of late years rather - I have been a party to Bills of Exchange, but only for my brother-in-law; on no other occasion - I certainly accepted some Bills of Exchange for him, but not latterly - I never made a trade of accepting bills - I began to accept Bills of Exchange, I suppose, about three years ago or four years, between three and four - I will swear I did not begin so long as five years ago - I have accepted small bills, you may say twenty years ago - I do not suppose I have accepted two bills for twenty years till four years ago - can I recollect twenty years ago? - I swear to the best of my recollection I have not accepted ten bills, but I will not say positively - the two acceptances were small ones - I do not recollect the sums - I do not recollect these things after they are past - I have accepted about eight or nine bills for the last five years - it is not fifteen or twenty - it is not much more than half fifteen - I cannot swear to any number I have accepted - the prisoner is the only person I have accepted for - I do not mean the only person in the world - I have accepted for four or five more, I should suppose, besides him - they were bills for 5l. or 6l., for tradesmen - that would not distress me to pay - my salary in the Excise is 120l. a year - I am a married man, and have one child - I have accepted bills, where I have received no value, a great many times, rather too many times for me - I was obliged to pay them - I have accepted them out of friendship, where I have got no value, five or six times, chiefly for my brother-in-law - I have accepted none for the last half-year.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell me, that within the last five years, you accepted five or six bills for persons; not your brother-in-law? A. No; for people in trade who I dealt with - the largest sum I have accepted for, I may say, was about 10l. or 11l., not 20l. - I have accepted a bill for Mr. Collins, a cheesemonger, within the last twelve months - I dealt with him - I owed him money, and gave him that bill - I never accepted bills, where I did not own money, except for my brother-in-law - I have accepted about twelve bills for my brother-in-law - I do not mean to swear positively I have not accepted more than that, but to the best of my recollection, 50l., was the largest sum I ever accepted for him, and for which I got no value - I have stood accountable for the bills, and given security for them - I have mortgaged some land for it which I have at Merton, in Surrey - I have about half an acre there, and a house upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the kindness to tell me whether you did not very lately accept a 40l. bill? A. I do not recollect that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100054"/>did - I paid a bill to the butcher nearly a year ago - the prisoner was a party to that bill - I was not the accepter - I think Gee was - there have been bill transactions between the prisoner and Gee - I have not seen my wife here tonight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you have had bill transactions with Gee? A. Yes: I suppose he has seen me write - he has received bills of me, and acted on them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. A good many; six or eight? A. No - he must have seen some, of course - he saw the one the prisoner was sued on, no doubt, as he was the accepter - I should think Gee has held about two bills to which I have been a party, or three at the farthest - he did not discount any of my bills at any time - I cannot tell whether he endorsed any - he only accepted the one I have talked of - the prisoner had drawn the bill - Gee accepted it, and I endorsed it - we were all upon that bill - we were not together when it was drawn - he saw Harris afterwards- the bill was produced, and of course he saw my handwriting on it - there was one or two more bills with my handwriting, which he saw, and which I conversed with him about - I do not think he had more than one or two(we will say three, at a guess) on which my handwriting was, and to which Gee was a party - he might have been drawer or endorser, for what I remember - I cannot mention the amount of the bills - I was liable for them - I mortgaged the land at Merton for 200l.; but there have been mortgages on it since - I suppose the whole mortgages are about 450l. - I made the last mortgage about two months ago, before this transaction arose - I had accounts to make up, which made me mortgage - I had one bill out for 50l. - I had bills I was answerable for for the prisoner - I had accepted them - I think the last bill I accepted for him was about May or June - it was about 25l., I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your wife ever present at a conversation about bills? A. Not that I remember - there was a 30l. bill offered last June, and she persuaded me not to accept it; and I never accepted one since - she might have been present at conversations between the prisoner and myself about Bills of Exchange, but not lately - she has been present at times, but not for six months - she might formerly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not in her presence, before the last six months, given the prisoner permission to use your name - on your solemn oath? A. No, I never did, or why should I refuse that Bill of Exchange? - I have never given him authority to accept bills for me to any amount, not to my knowledge or belief - I will swear I did not - I do not recollect any thing of the kind - I should be quite beside myself to do so - I swear I did not authorize any person - I never gave the prisoner authority to sign my name as acceptor or party to a bill - I never knew of his doing so- my wife never did it in my presence with my consent - I am not at present living with my wife - we have been separated a few weeks probably - I have come here from Horsemonger-lane Gaol, where I am on account of his bills and one thing or another - I have not been separated from my wife through any disagreement.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The prisoner is your wife's brother? A. Yes - I have accepted bills for him when I have had no consideration for them - it is about four years ago since I began accepting bills for his accommodation - I could pay my way well before that; but since that I have become less able to pay my way, and do justice to my creditors - I have been responsible for this man - in June last I determined to accept no more bills for him - I was then obliged to mortgage my property to cover the different securities I had engaged in for him - I had had that property six or eight years - before I got involved in bill transactions for him, I did not think of mortgaging it - I lived within my income until then - I have lived apart from my wife merely on account of being in prison; that is the only reason - we still, I hope, agree - she has interfered, on the prisoner's behalf, with me, since this happened - she came to me about it - it is natural enough - she has done so.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you again, though she is capable of being called, did you ever, in her presence, in any way, give this man leave to write your name in any way whatever? A. I did not - I never heard or knew of this bill till it was presented for payment.</p>

            . I am servant to Lee and Co., who live at Nos. 14 and 15, St. Thomas-the-Apostle. On the morning of the 3d of March I was cleaning the window of master's house, and saw the prisoner standing by the side of Mr. Mortimer's house at Mr. Hindes' door - I do not know the number - I saw another man go into the house, bring a coat out under his arm, and give it to the prisoner, - I followed the prisoner, and saw him put it on - he went up the steps of the house, and came down again without going in - the door was closed - the other man walked up to the door and opened it - I do not know how - I followed them as far as the foot of London-bridge - the prisoner was secured - I gave information to the officers, who took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said before the Lord Mayor, that I was at the corner of the street, twenty yards from the house, and never went near the house. Witness. He was about a yard from the door when the other came out and gave him the coat - he had been walking up and down the street - it was the shop door his companion opened.</p>
               <p>BARTHOLOMEW NORDEN HINDES. I live at No. 8, Great St. Thomas-the-Apostle - Mr. George Mortimer keeps the house - I am a lodger - he pays the rent and taxes - I do not exactly know the name of the parish - I had a coat hanging up at the end of the shop, by the side of the kitchen door - the outer door, I understand, was open, but the shop door was shut - my coat was within the shop door - it must be opened to get at it - I cannot be positive that the shop door was closed.</p>

On the 22nd of March, I heard a noise in the yard, against the area window - I keep fowls in the cellar of my house - I looked out of the window, and saw the prisoners pulling up a stone in the yard - I thought at first it was one of my lodgers, and suspected nothing - I let it be for ten minutes - I then heard the fowls making a noise- I ran down the yard with a light, and called to the prisoners to come up, seeing them both down in the cellar - I called an officer, and they came out of the cellar, which they had broken into - it had been fastened before - they had entered it, by pulling off two iron bars, which run under the stone - they had lifted the stone - the bars secured and fenced in the area - nobody could have entered without breaking the bars - as long as the bars and stone were undisturbed, nobody could enter - they were lifted up and removed; when I called the prisoners up they came up the same way as they went down - I ran to the front door and shut them in - I kept them in the passage, and got an officer to take them - I found two fowls killed; one had his head nearly pulled off, and the other was kicking, dying - they must have been taken from the roost - the house is let out in different tenements - the landlord does not live on the premises - each person has their apartment - there is one common access from the street - there is no way of getting from my apartment to the cellar, without coming down the common staircase - the cellar is entirely in my own occupation - I have a lock and key to it; but it has no internal communication with my lodging room - I go down the common staircase to it - it is below the parlour floor - the doorway is opposite the staircase - I keep tools in the cellar belonging to my business<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100056"/>- the ground floor is between my part and the cellar, without any internal communication - the cellar is under the bulk-head of the staircase - the yard is common to all the house - the cellar is below the ground floor room - I found two of my fowls lying in the cellar - they were perfectly safe, an hour previously, at roost - the house is in the precinct of Whitefriars.</p>
               <p>Rose. Q. Where were you when you saw me in the cellar? A. In the yard - I held the candle down, and saw both of you - I saw your faces; and saw you both come up out of the cellar - you had no light, but I had a light in my hand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time was it? A. About half-past ten at night, when I first heard the noise - I found them there about ten minutes after.</p>
               <p>Stokes. Q. Do you say you saw me in the cellar? A. Yes, I did; I saw you sitting in a chair by the cellar window - I told you to come up, and you looked up at me; and seeing two of you, I called to my wife to call for assistance, thinking you too much for me - I went and held the front door, and called for assistance - the officer came and took you both in the passage - I was down in the cellar two minutes afterwards, and saw an Irishman collar you- I saw you both there, and when I got to the watch-house with the fowls, you were both there in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard a cry of"Watch," and ran to No. 14, Lombard-street - I entered the passage, and saw the prosecutor struggling with the prisoner - I collared Rose and took him to the watch-house- Stokes was brought to the watch-house by an Irishman,(I believe,) whose master would not allow him to give evidence - I afterwards went into the cellar - I do not know exactly who it was took the other prisoner - I am sure I found both the prisoners struggling in the passage with the prosecutor - when I got into the cellar, the two fowls laid there - one was dead - they were both warm - the dead one had been very recently killed - I know this house - Hunt lives on the one-pair, and has a flight of stairs to come down, and contiguous to the yard door, (at the further end of the passage, quite away from the street door,) is the cellar door- he turns to his right hand, and the cellar door is right under the stairs - that door leads nowhere but to his cellar- I found this poker in the cellar, and this bag - I found a tinder-box on Rose, and some matches on Stokes.</p>
               <p>Rose's Defence. I had been out drinking, and was rather intoxicated - the street door being opened, as I suppose, I must have fallen into the passage - all I recollect is falling into the door.</p>
               <p>Stokes's Defence. I was coming up the street between ten and eleven o'clock - I saw people going towards the watch-house - I walked down, and walked into the watch-house - the watch-house keeper asked what business I had there - I said, "I do not know, I have come in to see the man" - one or two said, "Oh, I suppose you know him." I said, "I have no knowledge of him" - the watch-house keeper said,"I shall take and search you" - I had bought one half-penny worth of matches that evening, and when I came home I took them out, but one or two might have fallen out in my pocket from the bundle.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SHARPE re-examined. The street door was shut, and the prosecutor holding it with one hand, and scuffling with the prisoner - I do not know who brought Stoke"- I did not see Stokes in custody till I saw him at the watch-house - how he got there I do not know, but I am positive he was one of the men in the passage, and whom the prosecutor was keeping in - I did not know him at first sight, when I first went in with Rose my attention being taken from him - my attention was not taken off him in the passage, it was afterwards - I am positive he was one of the two men in the passage.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HUNT re-examined. The bars were secured by being underneath the stone.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the passage door closed or open at the time? Witness. I cannot answer the question myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which way did they come out of the cellar? A. Through the hole they had made to go down - there are stairs leading down within the cellar door, into the cellar - they did not come out that way, but out of the hole they had made, which is outside the house - they came out into the yard, not into the passage - they came into the passage at the yard door - the yard is at the back of the house - they got through the bars in the yard, but before they got into the yard, they must have come in at the front door through the house to get to the bars - they must have come out of the yard, into the passage from the cellar to get out, but I secured them by shutting the street door - the street door is generally shut on the latch.</p>

             (police-constable G 86).

               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that as she was passing, the prosecutor accused a woman with robbing him, who run on to a public-house; and he seized her by mistake.)</p>

On Thursday evening, the 20th of March, I was at the Lion and Lamb at Hoxton - I was in liquor - I walked away towards Bishopsgate-street - I and my shipmate had a quarrel at the corner of Ashford-street - I walked away from him - a man came up to me, tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me about some vessel - he walked with me, and we had something to drink in Pitfield-street - we then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100059"/>went on towards Norton Falgate, went into another public-house, and had a pint of half-and-half - I had two £5 notes and some silver in my pocket - I had been paid that day - the man looked to me like a dyer - I do not see him here - he was with me about an hour, I should think: when we came out of that house the air took effect on me, as I had been smoking - I got to Bishopsgate-street, and then missed my two £5 notes, which must have been taken out of my pocket - they could not have got out - these are them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know them? A. By taking the number of them - I was tipsy, and do not know the man who was in my company for an hour - the notes were in my inside waistcoat pocket, which was buttoned - I had not lost them when I was in the public-house - I was not so overcome then as I was when I got out - I felt them as I came out; and when I missed them my waistcoat was unbuttoned - I think I met the man about nine o'clock in the evening - I should think I was with him an hour - I quitted him a little after ten o'clock - whoever the man was, he must have been with me between half-past five and half-past ten o'clock.</p>

On the 10th of February, the prisoner Hampton came to our shop - he brought a coat, three pair of trowsers, and three waistcoats to pawn - he asked 1l. 12s. on them (we should have advanced 4l. or 5l. on them) - I inquired who they belonged to - he said part of them were made for him at Windsor, when he was better off, and the others he bought of a gentleman's servant in Buckinghamshire - I then observed Dancey by the side of a waggon, on the opposite side of the way: and Hampton said that the man over the way knew all about it - I told him to call him, and he did - I then asked him about them - he said, "We have found them" - Hampton then said, "I have told the gentleman that part of them were made for me" - I told them I would look over our bills, and see if we had an account of any thing lost, and not finding any, I sent for the officer.</p>

I was sent for to the shop, and took the prisoner - I received these articles - Hampton said the great coat, one pair of trowsers, and one waistcoat, were made for him when he was better off - when we got to the station I asked him which pair of trowsers were made for him - he said he did not know - he said he bought the rest of them of a gentleman's butler in Buckinghamshire - in going to the office Dancey said to Hampton, "You have got me into this trouble by telling these lies" - I had heard something, and I asked Dancey for the direction where the portmanteau was, and I received from them a direction on a paper - the prisoners were both together at the time, and I do not think any one else was with them - the direction on the paper was, "

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You asked Dancey for his place of residence, and some person gave you a paper with writing on it? A.

            . I am an officer of Marylebone - on the following Monday I saw the prisoner - I followed him to a house in Short's-gardens - I put my hand to his pocket, and said, "What have you got here?" - he said, "A dirty shirt, and I will show it you" - he put his hand to his pocket, pulled out these four handkerchiefs, and threw them through the window into the yard, in a moment - I seized him by the collar, and asked some men who were at work in the yard to give me the handkerchiefs, but they took no notice of it - the prisoner then began to make some resistance - I took out my staff and said I was an officer, and if he made any resistance, I would make a hole in him - I then called to the men again to give me the handkerchiefs, but one of them took them up and threw them into a hole which they were digging - I said, "Is there not one honest man among you? - mind, I know you all, and if you do not give them to me, I will have you up" - at last one man took them out, and another man gave them to me - I then brought the prisoner out - he made great resistance in the street, and some women pulled my arm and some men ill used me - one of them bit my thumb, and I was very ill used - if a policeman had not come up, I must have lost the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite positive Ashman is the man you saw the first time? A. Yes; he is the driver of the first cab that the coat was put into - I do not think I can be deceived - I swear he is the man.</p>

             (police-sergeant E 12). Yesterday morning, a waterman came and told me a cab-man was wanted, for stealing a coat and cap, and he would point him out to me - I waited till he came in, and he pointed out Bonnor - he said, there was a man in Newgate to be tried, who was innocent, and Bonnor was the man - I spoke to Bonnor about it - he said, "I have the coat and cap, which were thrown into my cab, they are at my lodging" - I went with him, and got them - these are them.</p>
               <p>EDWARD ABINGTON. Bonnor is not the cabman.</p>
               <p>CHARLES GUNNING. Bonnor is not the cabman.</p>

               <p>Bonnor's Defence. I was the first cab on the rank, and the prosecutor called me, but we could not agree for price, and he called another cab and went off - I then got into my cab, and found the coat and cap in it - I took them home, and yesterday morning, when the policeman came, I gave them to him - there were plenty of people who knew I had them.</p>

            . I am waterman on the stand in Farringdon-street. I was there last Monday morning - I saw the prosecutor call a cab, which was driven by the prisoner Bonnor - it was not Ashman - he was not there for twenty minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time was this? A. About ten minutes before eight o'clock - the prosecutor called the cab that Bonnor drove first, and in two or three minutes he complained of losing his coat - I did not tell the gentleman that the driver was a red haired man - I said I knew the man very well, but I did not know his name or number - I know Ashman, by seeing him on the stand, but I will swear that Ashman was not on the stand that morning, till after Bonnor had gone off with the coat - Bonnor had a black horse - I never noticed the colour of Ashman's horse - they both had yellow cabs, but not from the same yard - one lives at Walworth, and the other in Theobald's Road - I have been two days and nights looking for Bonnor.</p>

            . I am clerk to Daniel Richardson - I have a Bill of Exchange (producing it).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How came that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100066"/>Bill in the possession of Mr. Richardson? A. It was given to him by Mr. Crook to sue the parties - Crook is an auctioneer in Skinner-street - we were to sue the acceptor and endorser, not the drawer - I think it was placed in our hands for that purpose in the beginning of 1831 - I believe shortly after it arrived at maturity - Mr. Crook held the bill from Radford, a sheriff's officer - I called on him several times about it - proceedings were taken, and afterwards stayed, on an arrangement between the parties - Mr. Noel signed a cognovit - he was a party to the arrangement by which these proceedings were stayed - I never saw Mr. Nesbett, the endorser, in my life, till this indictment was found - I do not know how the bill came to remain in our office for three or four years - I suppose it was by mere oversight.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NESBETT. I am a <rs id="t18340410-136-viclabel758" type="occupation">coal merchant</rs>

                        targets="t18340410-136-victim861 t18340410-136-viclabel758"/>. In 1830 I was acquainted with the prisoner - I knew him for a great many years - he has acted as my solicitor occasionally - this bill is drawn by a Mr. Goldsmid for £30 - the endorsement on it is not my handwriting - I never authorized the prisoner or anybody else to put that name on the bill - Mr. Noel has copied my hand repeatedly, and said, "See, I can do what I like with you, Nesbett" - I never signed this, nor authorized him to do it - I always told him never to do such a thing - I think this indictment was preferred last Session.</p>
               <p>Q. As upwards of three years have elapsed, give an explanation why this prosecution did not commence sooner? A. I was taken out of my bed on an execution of the cognovit - when the cognovit came due I had a letter sent to me- I was sent to prison, and continued in prison twenty-two months - I was compelled to take the benefit of the Insolvent Act - those are the causes why proceedings were not sooner instituted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You speak of being a coal merchant, how lately were you a coal merchant? A. I believe it is ever since I was taken into custody - I could not do business - I believe that is three years ago next July - I have only dealt in a few chaldrons since I have been out of business - I dealt in coals until I went to prison - since I have been out of prison I have been supported by a young gentleman, named McBeath, who is a godson of mine - no gentleman, named Bond, has helped to support me - I know two persons named Bond - I never was in Bond's house knowingly - I was never in a house where he carried on a gaming-table, to my knowledge - I do not know that ever he did keep a house that I was in - I was never in a house where gaming was going on, and where Mr. Bond was present at the time: that I am certain of- I know the Bonds by knowing their mother about thirty years ago - I have heard one of them is named Ephraim, and believe the other is Joseph - I saw them last, three, four, or five months ago - I met them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether Mr. Noel has been prosecuting these gentlemen for keeping a gaming-house? A. I know nothing of it, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this, and tell me if that acceptance is your handwriting? (handing him a paper No. 1). A. Why, really it may be, but I cannot swear positively to it, for I do not know that I ever wrote so bad as this - I do not mean to say that this is not my handwriting - I rather think this one is something like it (No. 2) - on my oath I cannot swear whether it is my handwriting or not - I am doubtful of it, because the N is not like mine, and the W, but it probably may be - I know my own handwriting - it may be mine; most likely it is - on my oath I cannot tell whether it is my handwriting - it may be; but I am doubtful of it - this one (No. 3) is like that - it is doubtful - it is not like my handwriting at all; but it may be - I rather think the W looks like mine, and it may probably be my handwriting; but it is not like my handwriting, which I always generally write - the W is something like mine, but the s is not mine to my knowledge - I never made such an S as this in my life, to my knowledge - but probably it may be - (looking at a paper, No. 4) - this is my handwriting, and yet there is an alteration in the s; but yet I believe it is my handwriting - (looking at a paper, No. 5) - yes; that is my handwriting, and you will see it is not like the rest - this is my handwriting - (No. 6) - the endorsement on the bill in question, is not my handwriting - I never did such a thing - it was through this bill, that I took the benefit of the Insolvent Act - I think it was in last September, six months ago, that I was discharged - I think it was in September that I appeared in the Insolvent Court - I never knew of Mr. Crook, nor heard of him till I was taken in execution by him through the cognovit, which the prisoner signed - I was taken out of bed through the cognovit; before that I had a letter sent to me - I never signed any cognovit - I never signed that cognovit.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The question was, did you ever sign any cognovit? A. I don't recollect that I ever did.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you sign that cognovit on which you were taken in execution? A. I never knew of it - I never signed it - I never knew of the action till I was taken out of my bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell me you were taken in execution and carried to prison at the suit of Mr. Crook on this cognovit? A. Yes, I was certainly - I never was released, and when I took the benefit of the Act, that was against me - I certainly was detained on that at the time I took the benefit of the Act - I don't know to the contrary - I don't know that it was settled in any way before - I had no other bill transactions in any way whatever, in which Mr. Crook could be a creditor of mine, except that Bill of Exchange - I don't believe the writing on these sheets of parchment to be mine (looking at some) - they are not like it - I could swear they are not (looking at one of them) - I think I could swear positively this is not my handwriting - the second is my handwriting - the first is not - I don't believe the third is - here is another, which I rather think is my handwriting - I cannot give you an opinion - there is a great deal of difference in it - there is a great appearance of mine - the top of this, I have in my hand, appears like my writing, but I don't believe the second is, at the bottom - I went into the Insolvent Debtors' Court, and was discharged- I then swore to my schedule.</p>

            . I am a solicitor - I have known Mr. Nesbett as long as I can remember - I don't believe the name Nesbett on the back of this bill to be like Nesbett's handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you acquainted with a gentlemen named Bond? A. Yes - I have known them as long as I can remember, only as neighbours<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100067"/>- I don't follow the same calling as they do - I don't know what they profess to be - they lived in Norfolk-street, Strand- I lived there - they also lived in St. James's-street - I have been in the habit of visiting them in St. James's-street for the last three years - I can't say whether they keep the house there or lodge there - it is a private house - the house in Norfolk-street is a private house now, and was so when they lived in it - they did not live in St. James's-street and Norfolk-street at the same time - they lived with their mother in Norfolk-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Noel acts as solicitor against those persons for keeping a gambling-house? A. I have heard so - I have not said it was for keeping a gambling-house - I never saw the indictment - I have been on intimate terms with Nesbett - I am not the person who introduced him to the Bonds - he has been there with me - I cannot exactly remember when I last saw the Bonds, but it was within a week - we have spoken of this prosecution certainly - it has been a general conversation amongst all the acquaintance - Mr. Nesbett has been present at the conversation - I have been with his solicitor, but cannot say whether he has, when Bonds were present.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do not you appear as a witness at the instigation of the Bonds? A. No; Mr. Storvill is the attorney, who conducts this prosecution - I do not know whether he is an acquaintance of Bonds - I did not say I had seen them together - I said, it was a general subject of conversation - I never saw Mr. Storvill in the presence of the Bonds - I am very well acquainted with the handwriting of Nesbett - I think he generally writes alike in his signatures, or I could not swear to his handwriting - I could name two or three peculiarities in the endorsement of the bill in question - the W is not like his at the commencement - it is not made like his W - it wants the curl at the commencement - it is not upright enough, nor round enough, nor thick enough - the whole of the signature is not thick enough - it is something like his handwriting - the last "bett" is like it, if it was thicker - he cannot write so fine as this.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not the fineness or thickness of a man's writing depend on how he chooses to lean on his pen? A. I should think so; or the pen itself - I cannot swear he could not write so fine, if he tried - he does not generally write so fine - any person intimately acquainted with his handwriting would say this is not his.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that (No. 3:) do you believe that acceptance to be in his handwriting? A. The W does not look like it, but I think the "Nesbett" is his handwriting- you see it is crossed over, but I cannot give so correct an opinion on this, as the other, because this is not crossed- I should say the "Nesbett" is his handwriting, but I do not think the W is - it has not the curl - I think the"Nesbett" is his handwriting, and the W not - I will not swear to it as the N is like his writing - he is in the habit of signing "Wm." - the m is not always legible (looking at No. 2), I believe this to be his handwriting this (No. 1) is the most like his handwriting of any - I have no doubt at all about it - (looking at No. 4) I have my doubts about this - I think it is his, but I have my doubts - I should say it was his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at the signatures on these parchments: what do you say to those sheets? A. This is decidedly - so is this - so is this; and so is the other - the two signatures on the last page of the parchment are exactly like his- I find two W's with the commencing loop - here are six signatures all together; five on the parchment, and one on the paper - all the signatures are his - the fifth parchment has two signatures - here are more than two W's with loops; for I see two are signed on both sides of the parchment - (looking at a deed of composition) - this signature is the handwriting of Mr. Nesbett.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you in the habit of seeing the prosecutor write seven years ago? A. Yes, frequently - perhaps infirmity may have made him write more tremulous now - I should think there was no difference in his hand - I cannot speak positively, because men do not always write alike - I have not observed any difference, unless it is more tremulous.</p>

            . I am a stable-keeper, and live in New-road, Chelsea - I know Mr. Nesbett, and have seen him write several times - I do not believe his name on the back of this bill to be his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Why do you believe it not to be his? A. I have seen bills I have paid him, and bills he paid me - his writing is more likely to be written with a grimey stick than this - it is stronger - the W turns differently altogether - the beginning of the W is different in the turn - this has got no turn at all - he makes an open turn, a turn like that - (writing the letter W on a piece of paper) - I consider it altogether not like his - I consider his W is as open as that I have made - he always writes the W so; and that one letter in particular not being written so, I do not believe it to be his.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the acceptance on this bill (No. 1) - tell me if you believe that to be Nesbett's handwriting? A. No, I do not think this is. - (Looking at No. 2) - I do not think this is his handwriting, according to my knowledge - I do not consider this (No. 3) is his; nor this (No. 4) - I do not believe the W. Nesbett on this first parchment to be his handwriting (looking at the parchment) - I do not believe the second sheet to be his handwriting; nor the third, to my knowledge - I do not believe it is - I do not believe the fourth to be his, not according to my knowledge of his handwriting; nor the fifth.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not believe any one signature on these parchments to be his? A. Not to my knowledge of his writing - I know Joseph Bond, who lives in Salisbury-street - he never lived in St. James's-street to my knowledge - he lodged in Norfolk-street, and kept a house in Salisbury-street, I believe - I never had any thing to do with his brother Ephraim - there is such a person certainly; but I know nothing of him - I have no connexion with him - I have lent his brother Joseph horses and chaises - I know Mr. McBeath very well, and I know his mother - I am bail for him - I do not know whether it is in a civil case for a debt, or for a prosecution - I entered into the bail at the Judge's chambers.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do not you know it is for keeping a gaming-house? A. I never was told so - I am bail for him for 40l.</p>

            . I am an attorney. My father was clerk to Mr. Justice James Parke, but he is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100068"/>dead - I do not believe the endorsement on this bill, in the name of Nesbett, is the prosecutor's signature - I have seen him write frequently.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Who applied to you to give an opinion on this? A. I was applied to last Saturday by Mr. McBeath, who has been an acquaintance of mine for the last eight or nine years - I sometimes do business for him as agent - I know Layburn - I have seen him here this morning - I was never in any matter concerned for McBeath in which Layburn became bail for him - I should say it is five months ago since I saw Nesbett write - I think I can form a tolerable opinion of his handwriting by the character of the W - his handwriting is stiffer than that signature, and I do not think he writes so well.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the signature to that bill (No. 1), do you believe that to be his handwriting or not? A. I do, in consequence of the curl at the commencement of the W - this one (No. 2) is something like it - I believe it to be his handwriting - there is a thick mark, and a slight curl, but not particularly round. - (Looking at No. 3) - I never saw him write in this way before - I believe "Nesbett" to be his handwriting, but not the W. - this looks like his handwriting(No. 4) - I believe it to be his - I believe all the signatures on these five skins of parchment to be his handwriting - (looking at the deed of composition) the character of the W is like his handwriting, but the N is not - it is in the style of his handwriting - I believe it to be his.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. These things have all been shown to you to-day for the first time? A. I never saw them before; and this bill I never saw till half-past nine o'clock this morning.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JOHN McBEATH re-examined. Q. The witness says he was bail for you, what was it for? A. Keeping a gaming-house - I have not been concerned in keeping a gaming-house - the charge is brought to invalidate my testimony in this case - Mr. Noel, I believe, is the attorney in that prosecution - I know he applied for the certificate of the indictment, and offered the officer a guinea to do it.</p>

            . I am a sheriff's officer. I received this bill from Mr. Noel - Mr. Nesbett's name was on it at that time - I cashed it for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you known Mr. Noel before that transaction? A. Yes; a great many years - I also knew Mr. Nesbett - I knew there were a good many cash and bill transactions between them - I have heard Nesbett say he has endorsed and cashed bills for Noel - I gave this bill to Mr. Crook - it was not paid when it came due - I saw Mr. Nesbett a good many times on it before procedings were taken at all - he said it was an accommodation - he has never denied but what it was his endorsement - only he said it was accommodation to serve Noel - I should not have gone to law with him if I had thought it had been any thing else - he always informed me that it was an accommodation; that I must go to Mr. Noel for the money, for he had accommodated Mr. Noel with it.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did he come to you? A. He was afraid I would proceed against him, because I threatened I would, as the endorser of the bill - I was in the habit of meeting him at Mr. Noel's office a good many times - perhaps ten times - it was a long while after he was arrested - I do not think I saw him at my house - after proceedings were taken, the action was stayed on an arrangement.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Were you present when the arrangement was made? A. I was obliged to consent to it - I believe Nesbett was not present.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. After proceedings were taken, did you see Nesbett on the subject? A. I cannot say that I did - I received the acceptance of other persons, on account of the bill - Nesbett was the endorser of the bill I received- I have one of the bills here - this is one of the bills I received in exchange for this - Nesbett is the drawer of that bill - I believe it is the same hand - no doubt the prosecutor is the person who called on me about the bill.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. At the time you had a conversation with the prosecutor about the bill, the bill, I believe, was in the hands of Crook? A. It was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prosecutor expressly admit the endorsement was his signature, or that he had authorized anybody to sign it for him? A. He has admitted it is his handwriting, because he said, "I did it for accommodating Mr. Noel - I accommodated him with my name to serve him" - those were the very words he used - I swear positively that the prosecutor made that admission that it was his handwriting, and he did it to accommodate Noel - I do not think there was any body present, I cannot say; when I was talking to Nesbett he was speaking of the indorsement of the bill - I had not got the bill - I had no other bill on his endorsement to which it could apply.(Mr. Alley here withdrew from the prosecution.)</p>

            . I am a coal-merchant. On the 2nd of July, (the opening of the new Hungerford market,) I was riding over Westminster-bridge - I observed the prisoners pressing rather close upon the prosecutor's heels - I suspected them, turned my horse round, and watched them - they followed him up one side of the bridge, and crossed over when he did - and directly he got over, I saw Wheatley distinctly take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to Taylor - I rode on and told the prosecutor - I got off my horse, and took both the prisoners - a crowd assembled, and the handkerchief was taken from Taylor's trowsers pocket - he said he had picked it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was a crowd of persons? A. Yes; more persons than usual were on the bridge - I can positively swear to them - I cannot be mistaken - there were a number of persons on the bridge looking at the ceremony of the market being opened.</p>

               <p>JURY to MR. POPE. Q. You say there was a considerable crowd on the bridge when you observed them pick the pocket - do you think it was possible for you during the time you got off your horse, to lose sight of the prisoners so long as not to be able to be certain of them again? A. I was watching them from one end of the bridge to the other- I have not a doubt of them.</p>

               <p>*** The indictments, in the cases No. 659 to 665 inclusive, were found by the Grand Jury at the last September Sessions, when the prisoners stated that they had been previously convicted at the Middlesex Sessions at Hicks' Hall, but were unable to produce a copy of the record. The Court granted time for an application to the Court of King's Bench for a mandamus, calling upon the Court to furnish the said copy. Upon Bowman being brought up at the last Session, he put a plea of autre-fois convict, and a copy of the record; the Court granted till the present Sessions, for the Crown to reply; and they having now put in a replication of nul tiel record the Court decided, on the production of the original record by the proper officer from Clerkenwell, that the said replication was good. The prisoner then pleaded, "Not guilty." The other prisoners, having agreed to rest their cases upon the decision in the above case, also pleaded, "Not guilty."</p>

I do not recollect his having received money before for me - he ought to have accounted for it - on the Sunday morning he gave me 15s., and said that was all he had received from Dunkley - he has shown a great deal of contrition; and I should not object to try him again - he has suffered a great deal - he may make a bright man yet.</p>

My house consists of four rooms, two on the ground-floor, which I occupy - I am a single man, and Mr. and Mrs. Goldsmith occupy the second floor and two single men, Fife and Johnson - they are two distinct families - I went out between eight and nine o'clock in the evening of the 26th of March, and left Mrs. Goldsmith and her tenant up stairs - I shut the street door after me - I did not lock it, it shuts on the latch - I pulled it too - I am sure it was fastened, because I tried it - I left my room door shut but unlocked - I returned between nine and ten o'clock at night - I got into the house with a latch key, and found the front parlour door open; these trowsers were removed, and this book-case, looking-glass, tea-caddy, and other things - they were removed onto a table in front in the room, and some were moved on the dresser - nothing was carried out of that room - on going into the bed-room I saw the two prisoners standing behind the bed curtains at the foot of the bed - I knew Cannon before - the other was a stranger to me - Cannon was not a friend of mine - the bed-room door was left ajar when I went out - I got hold of Goodlad and said,"I have got you" - he made no answer - I brought them into the front parlour and sat them in a chair - I only knew Cannon by seeing him about - I found my property moved from where I had left it - some things which were in the drawer before, I found then on the table - I sent for a policeman - I found a dark lanthorn and crow-bar there, and some picklock keys on a drawer - I had not left them there - I could not ascertain how the prisoners got in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. They might have been under the bed when you went out? A. No; there is no room under the bed - it is about eight inches from the ground - they could not creep under it, for there was an iron machine under it which would prevent their getting under it - it is a machine for an hospital bed - nobody lives in the rooms below stairs but myself - it is my dwelling-house - I did not go up to Mrs. Goldsmith - they might have been there, for what I knew - I am certain I did not leave my parlour door ajar - I lost nothing - nothing was removed except what I have mentioned - a portfolio was removed - I call it a book-case - I used to carry my primer in it when I used to go to school.</p>

I and my children occupy a room in the prosecutor's house - I recollect Hill going out on the 26th of March, between eight and nine o'clock - I heard him shut the street door - I went out afterwards myself, a little before nine o'clock - when I went out I shut the street door close after me, and I locked Hill's parlour-door myself - the bed-room door has no lock on it - I returned in three or four minutes, found the street door and the parlour door secure as I had left them - I went up stairs, and went to bed - I am quite sure the street-door was shut - the other lodgers were not at home at that time - I have seen Cannon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the name of the lodgers? A.

            . I am a policeman. On the night of the 26th of March, I was on duty in Nightingale-street, and was informed I was wanted immediately - I went to the prosecutor's house and found the two prisoners both in the parlour sitting down - Hill went into the room, and brought out the crow-bar and dark lanthorn, and behind the bed he found the picklock-keys - I fitted the crow-bar with the mark on this desk - it seems to answer as near as can be- I took them into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was a door any body could open? A. A common latch key would open it - there is a latch key here which will not open it - but one of the skeleton keys will open the street-door when it is locked - there is no key that would unlatch it.</p>
               <p>Goodlad's Defence. I was coming down the street with Cannon, and saw three men come out - Cannon knowing Mr. Hill, said, "Those men don't lodge there, let us go over and see what is the matter;" we went over, and just as we came to the parlour-door, the street-door blew to; we heard the street door opening; and he said, "I dare say here is the three men coming in again;" but Hill came in and accused us of the robbery.</p>
               <p>EDWARD HILL re-examined. My parlour door had been opened in my absence - I found it ajar when I came in.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You left the street door latched? A. Yes; the lodgers had latch keys by which they could let themselves in.</p>
               <p>MRS. GOLDSMITH re-examined. I had been into the prosecutor's room, and locked it after me, while he was out.</p>

               <p>RICHARD KIBLEY. These articles are mine; and the clothes he had on are mine.(The prisoner pleaded extreme poverty.)</p>
               <p>RICHARD KIBLEY re-examined. He was perfectly sober - I never had the least occasion to complain of his dishonesty before - he appeared in distress - he behaved extremely well before - he has three children and a wife - he never had any employment while in my house, to my knowledge - he told me he had independant property, when he came to lodge with me - I have not recovered the blankets, nor any furniture, except the bolster and two pillows - I had other lodgers in the house.</p>

            . I am going on for fifteen years old. I live at No. 1, Ingram's-buildings, Willow-gardens, Curtain-road. My father is a cabinet-maker - I have been used to work with him - I know the prisoners - on the night of the 14th of March, I went with Mrs. Pickard and Drew from Pickard's house, No. 19, Mill's Court, Curtain-road - I had known Mrs. Pickard about two years, and Drew about two months - I do not know where he lived; but he came from over the water - I used to see him at Mrs. Pickard's - Drew and Pickard asked me to go along with them - they did not say where - I went as far as the corner of Rosemary-lane by the watch-house - it is called Sparrow-corner - we got there about eight o'clock in the evening - we saw a broken window in a clothes-shop - we all three looked at it - Mrs. Pickard crossed over the road, and stood on the other side, and Drew put his hand in and took a bundle of waistcoats - there was a great wire against the hole in the window - it was hard to shove away - it was a very thick wire indeed - Drew shoved it away, and was forced to hold it while he took out the waistcoats, which were tied together, and lay about a foot away from the hole - I heard a lot of glass drop when he took the second bundle - the first were tied together in a bundle - I heard no noise the first bundle which he took - he gave the first waistcoats to me, and I crossed over the road, and took them to Mrs. Pickard, who was near enough to see where we got them, I should think - when I gave them to her, I crossed over, and Drew had another bundle out just as I got to the pavement - I heard a lot of glass fall on the pavement - I heard the noise just as he was drawing it out - it happened by his pulling his hand out - the parcels were both of one size - I crossed over and gave that parcel to Mrs. Pickard, and she said, "Come on" - I crossed over directly to Drew; and just as I got across the road, there was a bundle hanging half-way out of the window - Drew said he heard the man running across the shop, and he left that bundle there - we then went to Mrs. Pickard's house - when we got there we opened the bundles, and found it was some unfinished waistcoats - I did not know how many there ware at the time; but in the morning, a young chap named Morris came and divided them - there was eight in each parcel - Mrs. Pickard agreed in the morning to give Drew 3s. for his part, and me 3s. - I did not see her give Drew any money; but when I came, an hour afterwards, she said the waistcoats were not worth the money; and on Sunday morning she gave me five waistcoats for my share - I went and sold them to Mrs. Elliott for 2s. 6d. - she did not ask me how I got them, or any questions - she lives, I think, at No. 7, Wright's-buildings, Bath-street - they were open - she examined them one by one, and saw they were unfinished - I only asked her if she would buy them, and asked her 2s. 6d. - she immediately gave me half-a-crown - I did not tell her how I got them - she knew I got my living by going out with my father - she knew me - I left the waistcoats on the table; Pickard put the waistcoats which she got into a drawer up stairs - I saw her do so - I was afterwards taken up, and soon told about this transaction - Holland the policeman went to Mrs. Pickard's - I have seen some waistcoats in Attfield's possession since - they appear the same as I had dealt with.</p>
               <p>Drew. Q. Did I go with you that night and get them, or did you not bring them to Pickard's house yourself? A. No; he was the party who took them.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I went to Elliott's house on Tuesday, the 18th of March, in the evening, and saw her - I told her I had information that she had some unmade waistcoat-pieces in her possession - she seemed frightened, and could not answer me immediately, but her husband was present, and said in her hearing,"No, we have not;" and in a few seconds she said, she had had them, but she had taken them to a friend's house, in Old-street-road, that afternoon - I do not think she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100075"/>named the friend, but she said she would go and show me- she took me to Robins's, the doll-maker, in Old-street-road - when she got there, she asked a little boy for the bundle she had left there in the afternoon - the boy handed it out from under the counter, and gave it to her, and I took it from her hands - it contained five waistcoats unmade - I have them here - her house is not above one hundred and fifty yards from Pickard's - the doll-shop is nine hundred yards from Elliott's - she said she had them from a boy, and I think she mentioned some name, but I am not quite sure - I took her to the station-house.</p>

            , who is a doll-maker, and lives at No. 83, Old-street-road - I remember Mrs. Elliott coming to our house, on Tuesday, the 18th of March - she brought these waistcoats, and said, "Billy, may I leave these here until I come back, it will save me the trouble of going home?" it being some work she had to do - I put them under the counter - they remained there until Attfield came.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MARCHANT re-examined. These are Mr. Clark's property - I can swear to them by marks - also the appearance and the style of work and shape - I have examined them all - the other five are also his - I can match the buttons; in their present state the five are worth at least 12s. 6d., and the nine about 1l. - such waistcoats as these were in the shop window; on the Saturday morning I found a bundle of waistcoats partly sticking out of the window - there is a very strong iron bar before the window, and about three inches space between each bar - the bundle might be got through that space.</p>
               <p>Drew's Defence. Ware has brought me into it innocently - he has been convicted here once before, and was here last Session for stealing a gold watch - it is only to clear himself he comes here - he has transported two men, and told two or three people he would soon put some more men away.</p>
               <p>Pickard's Defence. I am quite innocent of knowing them to be stolen, or of being out with them - I was at home all night - he brought the waistcoats to me about half-past seven o'clock, and said a young man who lodged with me sent them to me to stop there until he came home, and I put them into the drawer - on Sunday morning he came and asked me for the waistcoats, and said he was going to give them out to be made - I gave him five of them - he is a very bad boy - Hall and Drake were convicted here innocently last Session, and he was the very one who did the crime at Tottenham High-cross - he is the worst of characters.</p>
               <p>HENRY WARE re-examined. I was acquitted of stealing the gold watch.(Elliott put in a written defence stating the witness Ware had brought the waistcoats to her to make up at a shilling each.)</p>

On the night of the 17th of March, he had a gold watch, which laid on the flap in front of the window, close to a pane of glass - the pane of glass was cracked, but none of it out - a piece of sticking-plaister was put across the crack to prevent its being pushed in, and near it laid a gold watch - I know the maker's name, and number - I saw it safe that evening, about an hour before I missed it, which was about a quarter or ten minutes to six o'clock in the evening - it was broad daylight - I was absent about five minutes, and when I came down I saw the glass pushed in, and the watch was gone, and I saw a boy going by the window - the door was fastened, and before I had time to unfasten it the boy was gone up a court - I do not know who the boy was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is the name of your firm? A. It is Mr. Conway Joyce - he is sole owner of the business - it was formerly Samuel and Conway Joyce - his brother has been dead six years, and the name remains on the door - no partner has been taken in his place.</p>
               <p>HENRY WARE. On the night of the 17th of March I went out with George Richardson and William Pickard - I called at Mill's-court, and saw them both outside the door - they asked me if I would go with them, as they were going after a lot of gold watches - they were outside Mrs. Pickard's door - I consented to go with them - they said they were going to Lombard-street - I went with them, and when we got as far as there, there was a cracked pane of glass at a watchmaker's window - I do not know the name of the house nor the number - it is in Lombard-street, opposite a little passage.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL JOYCE re-examined. That is the situation of my uncle's shop - it is nearly opposite a passage, and the only watchmaker's thereabout.</p>
               <p>HENRY WARE re-examined. When I got there, I shoved the cracked pane of glass several times, and so did Richardson, and the last time I shoved it, it went in - Richardson took out a gold watch - he crossed over to William Pickard and gave it to him, and they both went away - I stood by the shop till the young man came to the door - I then walked away, and after I got a little way I ran - I lost sight of them till I got home to 19, Mill's-court - they were outside Mrs. Pickard's door - it was then about five minutes to six o'clock - I should think it wanted ten minutes or a quarter to six o'clock when I was at the shop - it is about half a mile from Mrs. Pickard's - I saw the watch directly I got into the court - Wm. Pickard showed it to me, and said he dare say it would fetch 6l. - I went with him to Wright's-buildings, where William Pickard's wife lived - he gave her the watch and told her to take care of it - while I was there he took it from her again - I do not know what became of it after that - I never saw it again till I was at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you begin to rob first?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100076"/>A. About a year and a half ago - I was tried here last Sessions with Hall and Blake - I have not been boasting since that, that I got acquitted, and that they got transported for my guilt - I am sure I never said any thing of the kind - I believe I have been taken up before - I am not quite certain - I have been taken up once before - I recollect once; I dare say it is twelve months ago - I had forgotten it - that was on suspicion of stealing some handkerchiefs out of a house in Sun-street - that was the only time I was taken up except last Sessions - I was never before a magistrate, I will swear - nor ever in a watch-house, only when I was taken for the handkerchiefs - I swear that - I was before the Lord Mayor for the handkerchiefs - that is twelve months ago - I was never tried but once and never found guilty - I swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not tried here on another occasion besides with Blake and Hall? A. No; never in my life - I am sure of that - I got acquainted with Pickard about two years ago - Hall had been a companion of mine - I had known Blake I dare say three months, and I began stealing about a year and a half ago - it may be two years.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did you become acquainted with young Pickard and Mrs. Pickard? A. It may be two years - that was about the time I began thieving - I became acquainted with Elliott by my mother and father living in Mill's-court - Elliott is the son of Mrs. Elliott who was tried just now - he was an acquaintance of Pickard's and his mother.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been asked how soon you began thieving - who was the first person you went thieving with, or that set you upon it? A. I think it was Mrs. Pickard - I have not the least doubt of that.</p>

            . I am a female turnkey of the New Prison, Clerkenwell. Mrs. Pickard came there, and went up for re-examination on Saturday, the 22nd - I think she had come in on the Tuesday - I was informed on the Sunday morning of something, in consequence of which, when she got up in the morning, I called her into my room, and said, "Mrs. Pickard, I must search you" - she said,"What for?" - I said, "You have something wrong about you" - I attempted to search her - she resisted - I said, "I must call the assistance of the male turnkeys" - she took something out of her bosom, and held it in her hands - I said, "That is it, whatever it is" - she said, "Do not take it, my son's life depends on it" - I took it out of her hand - it was a gold watch - I have kept it in my possession ever since, and now produce it.</p>
               <p>Richardson. About a quarter to six o'clock, I was playing in Mill's-court, and saw Ware coming down Curtain Road; I said, "Henry, will you play me at marbles?" He said, "No: I have something else to think about; look here, I have cut my hand." I said, "How did you do that?" He said, "I broke a window in Lombard-street, and took out a watch" - he pulled it out, and said, "This is it."</p>
               <p>HENRY WARE re-examined. I did not tell Richardson that I had cut my hand by getting a watch out in Lombard-street - I did not show him a watch - I had no conversation with him about marbles.</p>
               <p>Richardson. I went into Mr. Pickard's house, and got him a bit of rag to tie up his finger, and picked out a bit of the glass - he said, "It will get well in a day or two."</p>
               <p>Witness. I had not cut my finger, nor did he put any rag round it - there was no glass in it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was your finger examined at the police office, to see if it was cut? A. Yes; the same night, at the station-house - I was taken the same night - Mrs. Pickard said, I had cut my finger in the joint of it - but it was not cut there - there is a vein of my finger now there, and she said it was the mark; but it is not a mark - it is the natural appearance of my finger.</p>
               <p>Richardson. He said he was waiting for Mrs. Pickard to come home, to give her the watch to put away, and he would then give me 1s. for doing what I had. Witness. I did not.</p>
               <p>Richardson. I was going home; I live close by Pickard's, and saw Ware in custody, going towards Pitfield-street. I passed by him, and went home. Witness. He, Martha Pickard, and George Drew, all passed the tailor's shop, when I was taken into custody - they stood at the shop - that was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after the watch was stolen - I was taken into custody on a charge of removing a pair of trowsers that evening, about ten minutes after the watch was taken - I gave information about the watch half an hour or an hour afterwards - the policeman went and inquired at the pawnbroker's and places where I stated they had lost the things, and found it to be true - I was not charged with stealing the watch at all - I gave information first about eleven gold rings - the watch was the second thing I mentioned.</p>
               <p>Martha Pickard. Q. Did not you come to my house about half-past six o'clock that evening, with your forefinger bleeding, and ask me to take care of the watch for you? A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now recollect whatever you have done amiss, you are now under the solemn obligation of an oath, and will add greatly to your crimes, if you do not tell the truth. Did you take the watch to that woman, and give it to her, desiring her to take care of it? A. I did not. I did not know that she had seen the watch, but it was found on her.</p>
               <p>GEORGE KEMP re-examined. I examined Ware's finger that night - there was no appearance of a cut or blood about his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What had he been taken for? A. On suspicion of stealing a pair of trowsers.</p>
               <p>

            . I am a policeman. I took Mrs. Pickard into custody - I took her to the station-house and searched her, but she begged of me not to search her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100077"/>strictly, as she was not in a fit state to be searched; and I delivered her over, to a woman who usually searches at our place - she found nothing - she was removed to Clerkenwell - on the night of the 14th, when I took the boy into custody, I examined his finger - there was no appearance of a scratch, or blood, or any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you him in custody when he began to make discoveries? A. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL JOYCE re-examined. This is my uncle's watch, I am sure, and what was lost on the night of the 17th of March; I value it at fifty guineas or pounds - it is our make - it cost us more than thirty guineas - the number is 1386, I think - it is now quite rusted away, but when it was stolen we should not have sold it for less than fifty pounds - it is on the same principle as a chronometer, and must have had wet on it to rust it.</p>
               <p>William Thomas Pickard's Defence. I know nothing about the watch - I was searched twice by the policemen before I saw my mother.</p>
               <p>Martha Pickard to Ware. Q. You say you came to my house at ten minutes to six o'clock, was it not half-past six o'clock? A. No; I was not taken so late as seven o'clock - the officers examined my finger, because a great many thieves have mermaids and other things pricked over their hands and arms.</p>
               <p>GEORGE KEMP re-examined. That was what I examined his hands for - I always look at the hands of thieves - I looked at their hands again next morning - there was no mark whatever on Ware's - I never had Ware in custody, though I know him to be a bad character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe they are very common fowls? A. No; I never saw any like them - this other one is not the same - I could swear to them, if I saw them running in a field in Yorkshire -

             was with me when I went to the prisoner's shop, when the prisoner said he knew the fowls were stolen - I have always told the truth on this subject - I saw Anderson after I had been before the magistrate - he is a paper-hanger, in the North-road - I told him that the prisoner was committed to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that you should never have done any thing of the kind, if the prisoner had not written a note to you, telling you you should not have the fowls any more? A. No; I did not - I said a message had come to me, by Harris, saying that I should not have the fowls again - he was committed and locked up in my presence - the magistrate said he would bail him, if he could get bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that it was a very foolish business, and that the prisoner might have settled the whole affair for a shilling? A. I do not recollect that - I frequently said it was a very trifling thing - I might have said that it was only a shilling or two matter - I said it was a foolish thing, but not that he might have settled it for a shilling - I had him taken up on the Monday, two days after the fowls were missed - they were in his custody till the Monday - he might have disposed of them in the time - Mr. Harris is here - the prisoner said, in his presence, he thought the fowls were stolen.</p>

The prisoner and his wife lodged in my house - they came some time in November, and had a ready furnished lodging in the front room, on the first floor - they lodged there about three months - I went into their room in their absence - I missed all the bedding, and the other articles stated - this was on a Wednesday or Thursday, about the 19th or 20th of January - the prisoner did not come home till eleven o'clock that night, and as I am out on my business as a journeyman baker, I did not mention it to him till about twelve o'clock on the Friday - I said, I had reason to believe my property was not safe - he begged me not to do any thing with him, but to go with him to his wife's father, on Kennington-common - I went there, but her father was not to be found - he then asked me not to do any thing, and gave me two letters, which he told me to deliver, but I did not - I afterwards heard something, and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you looked into the box which was left at your house? A. Yes; when I received your letter on Saturday evening, I opened the box, and found in it the pillow-cases which are stated in the indictment - the box had been tied up, and had never been off the premises.</p>

               <p>JAMES TREVILLIAN. I live in New Inn-street, Shoreditch. I employed the prisoner to help to remove some goods from Trimbley-court - I put this bed on his head with two sheets tied up in a blanket - he was to put them on the waggon, to go from the same house - I came down with a bundle - the prisoner and the bed were gone - I went after him for about an hour - I then caught him, and said,"What have you done with my bed?" - he said, "I know nothing about it" - I took him to the waggon and said,"For God's sake tell me where you have put the bed, for I have no other" - he still refused, and I gave him in charge - they found 2s. 6d. in his pocket, and 15s. in his mouth; and this duplicate was found inside the fold of his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you say, "I am short of money, you must pawn this bed?" A. No.</p>

            , I am in the service of Mr. Castle. This bed was pawned by the prisoner for a guinea, in the name of John Smith - I gave him a sovereign and some half-pence.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor employed me and six or seven more to remove some goods, about five or six o'clock, as he was going to leave his wife, unknown to her - between seven and eight o'clock, he was coming downstairs, and said to me, "I am short of money, you must sell this bed or pawn it; and if they stop you, or ask any question, say you are going to leave your wife" - I took it, and when I came back, the landlord said he had gone with the goods - I asked for my hat, and they said he had thrown it into the van - I saw him afterwards, and he said, "What have you done with the bed?" - I said, "You know very well" - he told me to keep the duplicate till he saw me alone.</p>
               <p>JAMES TREVILLIAN. I was removing; but I did not give him the bed to pawn.</p>

The prisoner offered this cambric in pawn - I detained it- he said it belonged to his mother - I said, "You look to me like a linen-draper's shopman" - he then said he lived with Mr. Verry - I went to Mr. Verry's in the evening, but could not find him - the prisoner was then gone; but I made inquiries, and found him on the Thursday evening afterwards.</p>

I was in Mr. Langman's house on Sunday morning - I went there at half-past five o'clock - Mr. Langman locked me in the bar- in a few minutes after, I heard somebody come down stairs and making a noise in the tap-room, moving the pots about and sweeping the place - a few minutes before seven o'clock I heard somebody knocking with their hand at the street door - there is no knocker to the street door - I heard the person inside go along the passage and open the door - I then heard the footsteps of two persons come along the passage - I heard a sort of rumbling noise, and one person go up the stairs - I then heard the catch of a window thrown back, and the window, which divides the tap-room from the passage, pushed up - I turned round, and saw Phillips in the bar - he had his hand on the till, which was shut - he saw me directly I turned round - I got up and said, "You have made a bad job of this, young man" - he said, "I am sorry for it" - he had his shoes off - his shoes were outside - I called Mr. Langman, who came down stairs - I left Phillips in his custody, and went up for Norris, who was brought down - he was dressed - I examined the window - a pair of steps had been removed from where I had seen them before, and they would assist the prisoner in putting his arm through a broken pane of glass, and putthing the catch back - there was nobody up stairs but Norris, not dressed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was not a very early hour? A. The house does not close until late - it is a night-house - the till is in a counter, shut up - Phillips's hand was on the counter - the counter is covered with pewter, but he had his hand nearly on the edge - as it appeared to me, attempting to take the till out - the till was not locked - no part of it was opened - I found no property of the prosecutor's in his possession - the steps had been removed from one place to the other.</p>
               <p>MR. LANGMAN re-examined. Q. Used you to leave out a knife-tray for the knives to be cleaned? A. Frequently - Phillips never used to come to assist in cleaning the knives - I never saw him after he left - I don't know whether I had left the knife-tray out that night - it was kept in the bar usually.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose Phillips had come to clean the knives, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100089"/>you had not left them out, Norris would naturally go to the bar to get the knives? A. No, they were not in that bar, but in a bar behind, not near the window - you have no business in that bar to get to the other: you must go into the bar the knives were in first - the house opens about seven o'clock, but Norris was rather late that morning.</p>
               <p>Phillips's Defence. I was out of employ - my fellow prisoner asked me to come and help him on Sunday morning - I knocked at the door, Norris let me in - I swept the passage out, and did two or three things for him - he asked me to clean the knives - I found they were not left out - Norris went up stairs - I immediately opened the window, and got into the bar - not with intent to steal, but to get the dirty knives.</p>
               <p>Norris's Defence. I asked him to come and help me, which he did - I let him - in - I left him at work and went up stairs - I heard a noise and came down - I am entirely innocent.</p>

               <p>Q. It appeared to you the deceased was about to protect himself, but was taken by surprise by the blow before he had taken his position? A. Yes: the prisoner, immediately he struck the blow, he stopped and picked up his hat, and ran away - the deceased was the worse for liquor - I did not consider him drunk - he was a good deal affected by liquor; and the prisoner was the worse for liquor a goodish bit - both were a good deal the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Mr. McNair, your master, here? A.

            . I live in Stephen-street, Lisson-grove. I was in the public-house, and saw the prisoner and Moulton - they tossed for beer, which was brought - payment was asked for - the prisoner refused to pay for it - he had lost his toss - he refused to pay, and was going away - the deceased stood up and placed his back against the tap-room door, and prevented his going away till he paid for the beer - the prisoner challenged him to fight - he would not fight, but kept his hands in his pockets - the prisoner turned himself round from the deceased to sit himself down, and ordered the beer to be brought; and it was brought in a third time - it had been twice taken away because there was a dispute about paying for it - he drank part of it himself, and the rest the company drank - I cannot say whether the deceased had any - he refused to pay for it again - the prisoner got up and left the tap-room, intending, as I supposed, to go home; and in the about five or ten minutes the deceased, myself, and two or three more followed - I saw the prisoner outside - he and the deceased had two or three words in the street - the prisoner challenged him to fight, and before the deceased had sufficient time to raise his arms up for self-defence, the prisoner hit him a blow which knocked him down - I did not observe that his leg was broken - the prisoner ran away - I followed him and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you sober? A. Perfectly - the prisoner was not drunk - I cannot say he was sober - the landlord came into the tap-room with one pot of beer - the prisoner was leaning with his elbows on the iron railing in front of the bar outside - he did not complain of the deceased turning him out of the house in my hearing - he got no blow from any body in my presence.</p>

            . I was house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital. John Moulton was brought in on the 22nd of February, at half-past twelve o'clock at night - he had a very severe compound fracture of the right leg - he got on very well for the first three or four days, but by the third or fourth day erysipelas followed, and ended by suppuration and sloughing, and then exhaustion: in my judgment, the broken leg caused his death.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did the deceased take hold of the prisoner's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100090"/>collar? A. Yes; he opened the door and threw him out - I told the deceased to let him alone, for he was drunk, and I told another man to see if he had fallen down the steps - I went and looked, and found he had not fallen - the deceased went into the tap-room, and came out in a few seconds - they went out into the middle of the street - I saw them both in the attitude of fighting - the prisoner struck the first blow and no more - I saw the deceased with his hands up, and at that very moment he received the blow - I am positive before that, that I had seen the deceased push the prisoner down the steps - the deceased was a stiff set man - not so tall as the prisoner - they were both fresh - the prisoner is a chaff-cutter, and the deceased an omnibus driver.</p>

He does not live in the house - I live in it, as his servant - he pays the rent and taxes - on the 9th of March, I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock, and left the shop and everything safe - I was alarmed by a crash in the night - I got up, and went down stairs - I found two shutters wrenched from their place - the bar was knocked off, and two panes of glass were broken - I missed a time-piece - it was dark in the shop - it was about half-past eleven o'clock at night - the shutters had been secured by me the night before(Saturday) - I saw Mary Turner about fifteen yards from the shop, when I got up - a person was afterwards sent for the watchman - I did not see either of the three prisoners - I saw one who was taken, but is now at large - I know the prisoners - I went out that night after the robbery, in my shirt, to see if I could find any of the depredators - I watched about fifty yards from the premises, and when I returned back, there was Michael George, the prisoner, and a person named Streak, by the shop - George asked who were the people who had been doing the mischief? - I told him we had sent the officer for one Muggleton - he said, "You should not have sent for him, for he is an innocent man, you should take Lake and Champkin" - I saw some hands taking things out of the window, when I first came down, and saw a table-clock in somebody's hands - I caught hold of it, and made an alarm - they immediately withdrew, and I recovered it - I could not see who it was had hold of it - it was a man - I saw the other two prisoners next morning, about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What time did you find out the robbery? A. About half-past eleven- I am sure it was after eleven o'clock, for the time-piece was going in the place, and their pulling it down, stopped it - I saw George four or five minutes after I came back to the shop - I might be ten minutes gone - in a few minutes after I returned, I saw George - it was not so much as a quarter of an hour after half-past eleven o'clock, that I returned, and saw him - there were other persons about where I saw him - Muggleton was in custody at that time, and that led George to say what I have stated - I could not tell whether he was intoxicated; he might be - I could not see him reeling about - he was outside the shop, when I first saw him - he was standing - I did not see him leaning against the wall.</p>

            . I am married - on the night Newsom's shop was robbed, I was about 200 yards from the shop, when I heard the fall of the shutters, and soon after that I observed Samuel Lake coming in a direction from Edmonton - he passed me in a direction from Newsom's shop - he was running - I followed him to the next door to mine - I asked him what was the reason he stopped out at those hours, to be locked out? - he said his father had fastened the door up, and the shutters too, that he should not come in - I saw nothing more of him - I saw him about two hundred yards from Newsom's shop, at first - there are a great many houses between Newsom's shop and where he was running - I cannot say whether he was alone, or in company - there was another man running, but I could not say who it was - he was running with Lake in the same direction - they ran to the next door to me, No. 11, Union-row - I followed them, but they separated before they got to the bottom of the row - they ran together a very few minutes - I lost sight of the other man in a few minutes, at

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were in Union-row; does that go in the same line as the High-street in Edmonton, or turn off from it? A. It turns off from it - every body coming along Edmonton would be coming from the prosecutor's shop - Lake was over at the door when I overtook him - his father lived next door to me - I heard him at the door, and they refused to let him in.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the night in question, I apprehended Lake and a man named Muggleton - I took Lake about half-past two o'clock in the morning, and Muggleton about a quarter before twelve o'clock - I took Muggleton to Mr. Fletcher's shop - Michael George was there - and after Fletcher ordered me to take Muggleton up, George asked me what I was going to do with Muggleton - I said to lock him up - he said, "You need not take him, he is an innocent man," and he would be answerable for him, if I would take Lake and Chamkin; they were the two - I afterwards took Lake and Champkin - I searched Champkin, and found a handkerchief and a glove on him - I laid them on the table at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did you take Lake? A. In

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did not George ask what was the matter when he first came up? A. I was not there when he first came up - the robbery was on Sunday night - George was ordered to come before the magistrate, and was taken into custody on the Friday afterwards- he had attended before a magistrate - I went with the summons, and fetched him from Southgate - he was before a magistrate three times, and was at large after the first and second examination; and at the third he was detained - that was on Friday - I went to him on the Monday, and found him at work at Southgate - I told him he must come before a magistrate to give evidence against Champkin and Lake - he said he could not say any thing against them - I told him he had said last night that he would - he said he could not prove what he had said - that he was in liquor, and did not rightly know what he did say - he said he had seen the persons who committed the robbery at the Roebuck public-house, and that was the reason he said it was them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far is the Roebuck from Newsom's? A. A quarter of a mile - I did not notice whether he was too tipsy to know what he was saying - I am sure he said what I have stated: and in consequence of that I took the other two men by order of Fletcher - George was examined first as a witness - I took Champkin at a quarter past six o'clock, about 100 yards from his own house.</p>

            . I live at Tottenham. On the Tuesday after Mr. Newson's robbery, my little boy brought me a timepiece - I gave it to Fletcher.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FLETCHER re-examined. Here is the timepiece which Mrs. Hart gave to me - I know it to be one of the timepieces I received on the night in question - it is Mr. Newsom's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long after you had taken a timepiece from a man's hand outside the shop, did you see Turner the witness? A. Three or four minutes - she was about forty yards from the house, not more - I was three or four minutes replacing the things - I then went out and saw her.</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE. Q. When you saw George, did he ask you what was the matter? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he give you any reason for saying the other two men were guilty, and Muggleton was innocent? A. None.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Mrs. Turner present when he said that? A. I do not know, there were some people present - George came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Witness for the defence.</p>

            . I live at Tottenham. I have known George six months - on Sunday night, the night of Mr. Newsom's robbery, he was with me from eleven to five minutes past twelve o'clock, down at the Bell - we just went into the Roebuck that night - there was George and Champkin, and Lake there - about twenty minutes before eleven o'clock, they were coming out - there were four of them - the Roebuck is about 100 yards from Newsom's shop - I and George and Henry Davis went down to the Bell - we left Champkin and Lake about the Roebuck - we left the Bell about a quarter or ten minutes before twelve o'clock - George had not any means that I know of, of knowing that Champkin and Lake had committed any robbery that night.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FLETCHER re-examined. This happened on Sunday night - the Bell is about 300 yards from the house.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Seymour-street, Euston-square - I have been a surgeon about five years - I saw the deceased after death,(not before,) on the 8th of March, at No. 23, Exeter-street, Brompton - she died of disease, effusion on the chest, and a concomitant disease - I should say the effusion of water on the chest, and perhaps the combination of water in the head also, was the cause of her death - there was effusion of water on the head, and congestion of the ventricles - these I should say were the causes of death- they produce death - I cannot precisely say the occasion of those symptoms - she had externally two bruises, one on the left eye, and one on the back of the head - I cannot say that they produced the symptoms - the bruises would have accelerated death, supposing the child to be labouring under disease - she had tubercular disease of the lungs.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you pronounce at all what was the occasion of the state you found her in? A. The effusion of water on the chest or head, or the tubercular disease of the lungs? A. It might be produced by fever, which I understand she laboured under - if she had fever at the time, I should conceive the blows accelerated the fever - the blows inflicted on a child in a healthy state, I should suppose, would not cause death.</p>

            . I am a member of the college of surgeons. I attended the child for about three weeks before she died - she was labouring under fever, occasioned, I suppose, from atmospherical causes, the effect of change of weather - if she was badly fed, it might have increased that, but would not have occasioned it - she was labouring under, fever, and had a pain in the head, which was produced, I understood, from a blow at the back of the head - which was sufficient to account for the pain in the head - it was a violent blow - the effect of the blow subsided before she died - I certainly do not consider that to be an exciting cause of the fever - it appears to me, she was labouring under fever, and died from the effect of the fever, produced from atmospherical causes, I suppose - I do not think that ill usage, or want of food, or violence, had any thing to do with it - she was not under the prisoner's care at the time I attended her, but under the care of a

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand that, having attended her three weeks before death, you are by no means prepared to say any violence, or blows, or want of food, or care, had occasioned the illness of which she ultimately died? A. I think not - if she had been used well, she must have died of the complaint - the blows on the back of her head or neck might have accelerated death - I cannot say it did - the blows were external and subsided - when she died, she had no symptoms whatever of water in the head, nor any fracture - I examined the body - there was disease in the bowels and intestines, but not the effect of want of food - it was the result of continued fever.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Had you seen the door that night? A. Yes; I was in the shop - when any body goes out of the door the spring forces it to - if a hand held the door, just at the point where it touched the spring, the second spring would force it open, I am certain - the spring which holds the door to, projects five or six inches - I live in the house and occupy it myself - I pay the rent.</p>

            . I think it was on a Saturday between one and two o'clock, or it might not be so late, that I went to Mr. Partridge's shop - I did not take notice of the time - George Drew and William Pickard went with me - when we got there, one of the windows round the corner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100094"/>of the shop was cracked - I put my finger against the glass, and it cracked all across and fell out - I got under the iron bar in front of the window, put my hand in about a foot, or a foot and a half, and brought eleven gold rings to the hole; three were hair, but the tops of them were gold - I took nine of them out, and gave them to Drew - both the prisoners stood at the window, and told me when any body was looking at me - their standing there would prevent people seeing me so easily; but people could see if they looked - they covered me - we all went to Mrs. Pickard's and looked at the rings - there were three hair - the other six were all gold - I only took nine, because a gentleman dressed in black went along, who I thought noticed me; and William Pickard said, "Come on;" so I took no more - the three hair rings were on one card by themselves, and three of the gold ones also - when we got home, Mrs. Pickard said they would fetch 2s. apiece, and some not so much - she went and pledged two wedding-rings at

            's - I went with her; and another one she pawned in Ratcliffe-highway for 2s., and one for 1s. - I do not know the name of the shop - after we got home, we had one of the hair ones apiece - Mrs. Pickard said one of the rings would not pledge, because it was not worth taking in - she said the pawnbroker said so - when we got home she gave me part of the money - I do not know what it was now - we tossed for the ring that was not taken in, and William Pickard won it - he told me he had pawned it at Cotton's for 1s. - he showed me the duplicate, and said he had got the best of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sur you did not give it to him? A. Yes - I always kept in my mind where I had been - I may make a mistake sometimes - I have told a great many of these things to my father, and he tried all he could to stop me from committing these depredations; but he could not keep me from going - I do not mean to continue it - it was quite daylight when this was done - I have never been convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been tried in your life? A. I was never tried more than before the Lord Mayor once, about a handkerchief - I was discharged then - I was never before a Jury except here last sessions, for a gold watch - that was Blake and Hall's business - I never did any thing wrong till I knew the prisoners - they enticed me, and said what good things they got.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you stole things, who did you take them to? A. Mrs. Pickard, I went with her son and Thomas Hall - my father endeavoured to persuade me from it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This is not a hair ring? A. No; it is a gold stone ring - they are coloured stones, not glass - a shilling was all he asked on it- I knew him before - I have seen his father at my shop, but not these nine months.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was 1s. all he asked for it? A. Yes; we do not offer more than people ask - I should not consider the stones in the ring worth two-pence.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to Ware. Q. Did not you say it was a hair ring, that Mrs. Pickard said nobody would take, and which you tossed for? A. No; I said there were three hair rings, but I did not mention what sort of ring it was at all.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER PARTRIDGE re-examined. The ring is one which I lost that day - I am positive of it by a mark on the back of it - it is one I manufactured myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you sold any of them? A. No; it was the only one I manufactured of this pattern - it was made too large - I cut it and resoldered it - the stones are pink topazes - I think I paid 4d. each for the stones - it is a gold ring - I should sell it for 18s. - it had got discoloured by being put in the ink at the office - this ring found in the woman's drawer, is one of the hair rings that I lost.</p>

            . I am a watchman at Galley Quay - I went on duty at half-past twelve o'clock in the morning of the 12th of February, and remained till nine o'clock - during the time I was there, I had no reason to believe that any of the bales were stolen - the removal of one of them into a boat at high water would not make much noise - it was high water at a quarter before five o'clock - a boat could come close along side the quay at high water, and a bale would not have above a couple of feet to drop into a oat, from the quay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Would it not take some trouble to drop a bale into a boat? A. No - I was there for the purpose of watching, but I had several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100098"/>articles to watch - these bales were standing on end - there was another watchman with me - I don't know how long he had been there, as that was my first day - the bales were about nine feet long - two of the bags, which are here, are not so large as one of the bales - one man would not be able to roll one of them; but when a bale of wool was thrown down, it would project from the edge of the quay two or three feet over the water - I suppose the wharf is fifty feet long - I did not go to sleep.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What width is the quay? A. From thirty to forty feet - the bale of wool stood within six feet of the water.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Then if one were thrown down, and some part of it projected over the water, would it be easy for a man in a boat to draw it into a boat with a hook? A. Yes, very easy - I was walking about the wharf- the place where these bales stood was in total darkness, and quite absconded from seeing anybody, while we were walking on the other part of the wharf.</p>

On the morning of the 12th of February, I was attending the Lock at Lee Cut, Limehouse, which communicates with the Thames, and I should think is a mile and a quarter from Galley Quay - about half-past seven o'clock that morning, a boat arrived, and a young man was in it - there was a bag in it, made of coarse stuff, such as they put hops in - I think it was rougher than these bags are - it appeared about five feet in length, and about three feet and a half wide - I spoke to the man, and he to me, and he went up the river towards Limehouse - it was a lug-boat - I saw some pieces of wool about the bag - I noticed the words "Legal Quay" on the boat - it came back about half-past six o'clock in the evening, and was then empty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you took particular notice of the bag? A. Not particular notice - it was about six feet long, a thing they carry hops in - I was about four feet from the boat - the bag could not have been nine feet long - it was a rougher covering than this - it was a different kind of material to these covers - it appeared to be stowed close - it filled the boat almost - if it had dropped into the boat, it must have made a splash - there might have been something in the boat to prevent its making a noise - it was a small lug-boat - the bag was not up to the top of the boat - it was about the middle - I did not know the man - it was on Ash Wednesday morning, and was very wet - it rained when he came in - it was a narrow boat, about ten feet long, perhaps, and would carry about four ton - there was no concealment about this.</p>

I saw the prisoner there on Wednesday, the 12th of February, when these bags were brought on a truck - there was a hole in one of the bags, and I saw wool in it- the hole was sewed up, by Mr. Bell's desire - I saw him again the next day - he asked me if they could lay there three or four days or a week, or if there was a boat going, that we could send them off directly - he followed me down the stairs, and I asked the porter who was shipping at the scale, if he was shipping any thing for Leeds - he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100099"/>the boat for Leeds was not in, but he would call it in, and he did, and shipped the three bags in it - at Mr. Bell's request, I marked the bags Nos. 1, 2, and 3, and a D with L under it; and they were consigned to Mr. Dufton, of Leeds - they were shipped on board the Conqueror, Captain James Simpson - they appeared to me to be like one bag, cut into three parts, and they were packed clumsily.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did they appear to be like one rough bag cut into three smooth ones? A. No; they were different qualities of case - they appeared to be one cut into three - I did not see the consignment - Mr. Bell, said to me, if I would ship them directly, he would give me 1s.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have said the bags had the appearance of different qualities cut out of one bag? A. It is different qualities, some of it is like sacking, and some like the regular bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us what you mean by one bag cut into three? A. It appears that the wool has been taken out and sewed up in separate bags - bags of wool are of a certain weight; but I do not weigh them.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Robert John Smith and Mr. Duff - they are the proprietors of Galley-quay, and take in goods as wharfingers - I remember eight bales of wool being taken in on the 11th of February, and on the next day, between three and four o'clock, I heard that one was missing - I examined the bales which were left, and one was missing - I do not know the number of it, but it had a triangle on it, with a circle at each corner - I went with Lee the officer to Mr. Bell's house, No. 16, Provost-street, City-road - that street does not lead directly into Old-street - we went about six o'clock in the evening of Thursday - the prisoner was not at home - we waited about a quarter of an hour - the prisoner came in, and either the officer or I asked him if he had had a bale of wool yesterday - he said he had not; and he asked Lee by what authority we were in his house; and if he had a warrant - he said he had been an officer himself, and his house ought not to be searched without some authority - Lee then showed his staff of office, and put several questions to him - I stated that I had lost a bale of wool - he asked if I was the prosecutor - I said I represented the prosecutors or the proprietors, I do not know which, but I think it was proprietors - the prisoner said he did not know it was stolen - I asked him from whom he bought it, but he did not make any answer to that - I asked him whether he paid for it by a cheque or by cash - he said he paid for it by a £50 note, and received a shilling back - he said he had no invoice, and had not entered it in his book - I asked him if he weighed it; and he said he had, and it weighed 549lbs. - I said, "You seem to have a specific weight: where did you weigh it? I do not see any scales"- he did not answer that question - I asked him where the bale of wool was - he did not answer - I then asked him if he had sold it - he said, "No" - I then said, "As you can give no satisfactory account from whom you bought it, or what you have done with it, it will be my duty to give you into custody" - he then said he would pay for the wool, and pay the officer his expenses, rather than be taken into custody - I said I could listen to no compromise; if he had bought it fairly, he could have no objection to state from whom he bought it - he then turned to Lee, and said,"You know him; I have not seen him before for six months" - we had left Wells outside, but after Mr. Bell had refused all knowledge of the bale of wool, we brought Wells in and confronted them - I said, "Do you know this gentleman, boy?" - Wells said, "Yes; that is the gentleman who helped me into the passage with the bale of wool yesterday" - the prisoner then said, "Yes, I did buy a bale of wool yesterday."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was after you told him that the bale of wool had been stolen, that he said, whatever wool he had bought, he did not know had been stolen? A. Yes; I said we came to inquire after a bale of wool that had been stolen; but Lee said, "Have you bought a bag of German skin-wool?" - the subject of the mark was never mentioned - I should rather think that is not an ordinary kind of wool - there may be some in the market, but no great quantity, in proportion to the general quantity of wool; but I do not examine the wool - we do not hear of German skin-wool in nine cases out of ten - there may be thousands of pounds of it in the market - I know nothing about the price of German skin-wool; but Mr. Bell said, "I have given 1s. 10 1/2d. for this: I shall not get a half-penny a pound by it."</p>

            . I am an officer. I was employed to go with Mr. Rayson to the prisoner - Wells went with us - Mr. Rayson went in first, and I went in afterwards - when we had waited about ten minutes, the prisoner came and knocked at the door - Mrs. Bell opened it, and said, "My dear, there are some officers here about some wool" - I was behind her - I asked him if his name was Bell - he said "Yes" - I said I wanted to speak to him - I then told him I called about a bale of wool that was brought to his house yesterday - he said, by what authority did I come: had I a warrant - I said "No;" but I told him my name, and what office I belonged to - I did not produce my staff - I then asked if he had received any wool - he said "No" - I asked him again; and he repeated two or three times that he had not - I told him to be particular - I then called Wells in, and said to him, "Do you know this person?" pointing to the prisoner - he said "Yes; that is the gentleman who assisted in taking in the bale of wool, and putting it down in the passage" - I said, "What do you say to that, Mr. Bell?" - he looked very earnestly at Wells, and then said, "Yes, I recollect that boy yesterday" - he then said that he had bought a bale of wool - Mr. Rayson then asked if he had an invoice of it - he said "No" - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100100"/>asked him repeatedly who he bought it of - he said he had not seen the person before for six months - I asked his name, and where he lived; but he would not give any answer - he said he would not answer any more questions without the advice of his solicitor, as it might implicate himself - he then asked what was the matter about this wool - Mr. Rayson said it had been stolen - the prisoner asked if it belonged to him - he said "No," he represented the person to whom it belonged - he said he did not wish anybody to lose any thing by him - that he bought it very dear, and should not get a penny a pound by it; and he would pay the value, and pay the officer's expenses - Mr. Rayson said he could not hold out any promise, or undertake any thing of that kind - in going along in the coach, Mr. Bell said the wool had gone a long way into the country; but he did not say where - after he was in custody, I went on the Friday morning into the neighbourhood of his house, and in consequence of information, I went to Pickford's wharf, and from thence to Huddersfield, where I found this wool in a boat - I searched the prisoner's house the night I took him, and there were several pieces of canvass, which I took up and put on a chair till the morning - I then went again, and they were gone; but I found some sweepings of wool, which I have here - I searched the prisoner to see if he had any documents of wool going away, and he had not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you go to search the prisoner? A. On the Friday, at Clerkenwell prison, to see if he had any papers relative to the wool which had been sent to Pickford's - that was all I went for- I did not go there to see what I could get out of him - I had no such intention - Mr. Rayson and Mr. Smith were with me - we were going to Pickford's in the early part of the morning, and we called there first - I did not go to ask him any questions, nor I do not believe the others did - there was some conversation between Mr. Bell and Mr. Smith - I did not put any question to him - I know my duty better than that - the reason I had not searched him before he was in prison was, I had not discovered where the wool was - I did not ask him if there was any body in the neighbourhood to whom he could refer me - I did not ask him about Mr. Marson - I heard Mr. Marson's name mentioned, but I do not recollect by whom - I went to Mr. Marson in consequence of something I heard - I will swear I did not ask the prisoner where to find Mr. Marson - I know nothing of Mr. Marson - the prisoner did mention something about Mr. Marson - he talked a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the words the prisoner made use of when he came to his home? A. I asked if his name was Bell - he said "Yes" - I then said I came about a bale of wool that had been brought to his house yesterday - I did not give him any other description of the article that was lost - I did not say German skin wool - if I had used such words, I must have recollected it - I did not produce my staff - if Mr. Rayson has sworn I did, he must be mistaken - there was a great deal of confusion at the time with Mr. Bell- I went to Mr. Marson's, but I think Mr. Rayson went before I did - I made some inquiries in the neighbourhood.</p>

            . I am a wool-broker, and live in Basinghall-street. I know the prisoner - I saw him on the 12th of February, about one o'clock - he came to me as I was in the White Hart, Bell Alley, taking dinner - he produced a small sample of German skin wool, and wished me to purchase it - he asked 2s. 2d. a pound for it - I objected to that price - he then offered it at 2s. 1d. - I said I was not a buyer at all - he then asked if I would take it at 2s. - I said the market was very flat, and I would have nothing to do with it - I saw him again the next day, and he said he had sent the wool off on speculation - he said he had about 5 cwt. of it - I have seen the wool produced by the officer, it was of a similar description to this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Does wool change its colour? A. Not particularly - I have known the prisoner four or five years - there was no appearance of concealment in this matter - it is impossible to tell the price of German skin wool - it differs in every sample - when I saw this wool at Lambeth-street office, I thought it worth 2s. 6d., a pound - it has now fallen considerably - I saw the sample the prisoner produced - I do not know that that was the same - 1s. 10d., was certainly a very reasonable price, for what I saw - if I had wanted wool, I should have had no objection to have bought of the prisoner.</p>

Hamburgh weight, but we generally add about 7 per cent. to the Hamburgh weight which would be 35lbs. more - here is a piece on one of these bags which seems to correspond with the wrapper of the following number - we received the bill of lading from Mr. Forgess, on the 11th of February, with a desire that we should enter them, and clear them from the Custom-house- I made an entry at the Custom-house, and the wools were landed from the vessel - the endorsement on this bill is Mr. Barr's - we expected ten bales. and we received nine- if there should have been only landed at Galley Quay, six with the triangles and circles, and three with the triangles only that would be nine, the exact number we received - if six and three were all that were landed, that would be all we could receive.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How did you see them? A. Through a hole in the next floor, about as large as a pane of glass - the bin was on the side of the floor - we were in the floor over it - we kneeled down - we knew they were stealing it - the bin holds about four loads - my master does not sell wheat - the mill feeds from that bin - I was not there in the old foreman's time - Mr. Clarke is foreman now - I do not know of any dislike between Mr. Clarke and the prisoners - we could not see the bin, and the proceedings at the cart at the same time - I ran to another hole - I was on the second floor from the ground - Hinchley was holding a sack, Smith was holding a bag, and Hibbert wheeled it to the cart - Lutman was against the door - there were three holes; through one hole I could see the wheat running: through another hole I could see the cart - I went to one hole, and then to another.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself, you say you went to a hole in the loft, and saw from that into the yard, and saw Lutman and his cart, how did you do that? A. I ran to another hole, and then saw them putting it into the cart - we looked through a board - Mr. Clarke has not been tutoring me what to say - he spoke to me about this on the Monday morning, before I had been to the Justice, and the day before yesterday he did not tell me what I was to say - he asked me whether it was the truth, that I did see them, and I said yes.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you say correctly at first, that after you looked through the first floor, you descended a ladder, and looked through another hole? A. Yes; the bin is very large, the hopper is in the middle - the bag is at one corner - the wheat was not running from the middle where the hopper is, but from the corner where the bag is.</p>

            , he is foreman of the prosecutor's mill. I was in the mill on the 5th of April, with Charles Burr, between twelve and one o'clock - we were at the top of the mill - there is a hole there - I looked through, and saw some wheat running out from the bin, from one corner where there was a bag - we then went down to the next floor, and looked through a hole, and saw the wheat run down into a sack; and the three prisoners who are employed in the mill, were there - we saw three sacks, which were put into Lutman's cart - we could see the door from the hole we looked through the second time - Hibbert wheeled the sack to Lutman's cart, and put them in - I told my father when he came home at night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why did not you tell your father when he came home to dinner? A. I do not know - I have not talked with my father above once or twice about them - he and the prisoners have had some quarrels - I told my father as I went home at night, and again the next day - when we first saw the prisoners, we were at the top of the mill - the hole was about as large as a square of glass - we looked through to the floor under us, and saw wheat running - the top of the bin is not inclosed by a sack.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hole in the under floor immediately under the hole in the top floor? A. Yes; there was nothing to prevent our seeing through the two floors at once - I saw through the first hole the hopper, and then I came down to see through the other hole - the hole in the room where the bin was, is about five yards from the bin - I know the difference between a foot and a yard - it was about five yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been talking about five somethings, and forgotten whether it was five feet or five yards? A. No; it was five yards - there was no other cart in the road at that time - I know Beech - he came with his cart at the time Lutman went away - my father talked with Charles Burr about this business the next day before we went before the magistrate - my father talked to me once after this about it, but not in Burr's presence - he told me he had talked with Burr - I am sure of that - I do not know what quarrel my father has had with these prisoners - they have been disputing - my father has rather less wages than some of them - he is not jealous of them - they said something to offend him about three weeks before this, and they had quarrelled about a month before - my father is rather angry with them - I was at Clerkenwell with my father before the Grand Jury - we talked on the road from Uxbridge - he has not talked over and over again with me about it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you quarrelled with the prisoners? A. No; the bran is not kept in the place where the wheat is.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARKE. I am foreman to Mr. Burr. On the 5th April I was at the Fox public-house - I saw Lutman there with his cart - I do not know what was in it - my son gave me some information when I went home at night - I examined the corn bin - two or three sacks of corn were gone - I know the hole the boy showed me in the floor - I could see what they described.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there a hole in the top floor? A. No; not in the boards - down the ladder you can see into the second floor - there is no hole<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100103"/>in the boards in the floor at the top, that you can see into the second floor - there is no floor above where the bin is - it would be impossible for any one to look through a floor above where the bin is, and see it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many floors are there? A. Four - the bin is on the fourth floor - it would be necessary for a person in the third floor, to look through a hole to see the wheat flow into the bin - there is no hole in a floor exactly under another hole: but within sight of it, three or four yards from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been speaking to any of the witnesses in this case? A. No; not on any particular point - I did not speak to any one about what he was to say - I only told my son to tell the truth - I never knew him to tell a story - I spoke to my son to-day about it - I told him to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before the Grand Jury with him? A. No; I did not - I came from Uxbridge with him - I do not know whether I talked with him there - I have been foreman at the mill two years - I found two of these prisoners there when I went there - I have 100l. a-year - Hinchly has 27s. a-week - Hibbert 20s., and Smith 23s. - I have had no quarrel with these men in particular, only in the course of work - I have ordered them what to do - they have insulted me many times, but I never resented it nor cared for it - I never told my boy of it - he might have heard my wife speak of it - I have never spoken to Charles Burr, or my son about this, but only to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BURR. I am the proprietor of the mill. I know the situation - if these boys were in the upper part of the mill, they could see the bin, and by coming down they could see the wheat running into the sacks, and by removing a little on one side they could see the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you often been in the mill? A. Yes; but I never knew of these holes till this transaction - I cannot tell whether they were made for this purpose - I should think none were so large as a foot - there are holes in many large buildings - three of these men have been many years in my employ, long before Clarke came.</p>

            . I am clerk at a Manchester warehouse, in Wood-street, Cheapside - I was in Chiswell-street, and saw the prisoner and another following the prosecutor and his friend - I thought the prisoner was making too familiar with the prosecutor's coat - I saw him lift the tail of it up, and then take out the handkerchief - it was a red one, but I was not near enough to observe whether it was silk or cotton - I gave notice to the prosecutor - he turned and took hold of the prisoner, who was not half a yard from him - when the prisoner took the handkerchief out, he passed it behind him towards his companion, who was on the left side of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near were you to the prisoner? A. About twenty yards - I was on the other side of the way - it wanted about twenty minutes to eleven o'clock - I crossed over and told the prosecutor - I did not see what became of the other man - I did not see any one run away - I said I supposed the prisoner might have put it into his pocket - I saw him take the handkerchief - if I had looked after the other man, as well as the prisoner, I might not have taken one of them - the street was full of people.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the 5th of April, I was on duty in Marylebone-lane, and saw the prisoner in company with another man, (not Willard), he had a roll of something under his arm, and was talking to Moss, a Jew, who keeps a clothes-shop - in consequence of what Moss told me, I watched them to the shop of Barnett, a clothes-dealer, then to the shop of Lazarus - the prisoner still had the goods under his arm - I accosted him, and asked, what he had got there? - he said a piece of silk - I asked if it was his own - he said it was - I asked what he was? - he said, a porter - I asked who to - he said he was a job porter - I said I had seen him go to several shops, which I thought was not right, and asked what colour the silk was? - he said he believed it was red- I asked if he knew how many yards there were - he said he did not - I took hold of him, and the other man, who was afterwards discharged - in going to the station-house, I asked where he lived? - he said, at Bayswater - at the station-house, I asked if he really lived at Bayswater? - he said, "Yes," and he would tell me all about it - I told him to reserve what he had to say, for the magistrate - he said, he was at work at Messrs. Broadwood's, and a man named Willard, who was an under clerk, had given him the silk to sell - he produced a piece of paper Willard had given him, to make a return on it, as to what the silk sold for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He gave you Willard's address? A. Yes; I afterwards saw Willard, and made him write his name on a piece of paper, to see if the handwriting was the same, and it was.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he say Willard called on him to sell the silk, or what? A. He said, Willard gave it him to sell - nothing was said about calling on him - Willard is an under store keeper at Broadwood's; and the prisoner was a French polisher, employed there.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Harding and Smith, silk-mercers, Pall Mall. This is one of three pieces of silk which I sent to Broadwood's on the 25th of March - it is a double sarsnet, used by pianoforte makers, and is wider than is generally used - there are eighty yards of it, worth 12l. - this is the wrapper I sent the silk in to Broadwood's - and the mark on the block of the silk corresponds with the mark on the paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Friday, Willard came into the shop at Mr. Broadwood's, and said he wanted to speak to me. I went to the bottom of the stairs. He said he had a piece of silk given him by the gentleman (who served Messrs. Broadwood with silk), as a Christmas-box, and he had had it some time - he asked if I knew who was likely to buy it. I said, "No," but if it was his own, and he came honestly by it, the Jews would soon purchase it - he said, "As you go home, you pass several shops, would you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100106"/>go and inquire?" I said I would; and, as I went home, I called at the Jew's, and said, I knew a person who had silk to dispose of - he said, "Let me see it; if it suits, I will buy it." On Saturday, Willard asked if I had spoken to any body? I said, "Yes, and they would look at it"- he brought the silks in his hand to the pay table, in Windmill-street, about half-past six o'clock. I went with him to a public-house - he asked the bar-maid to give him a pen and ink - he wrote me the direction where I was to call. I was not to ask any price for it, but to go, and let him know if it suited the party, and he would call himself, and arrange the price. I went to the shop about the silk, and directly I opened it, I thought it was not his own. The Jew said, if it was gown silk, he would buy it - I was bringing it away, and when I got to Marylebone, (Proctor, my shopmate, was with me,) a Jew caught hold of my arm, and asked if I wanted to buy any thing? - then the policeman caught hold of me, and asked what I had? I said, "Silk." I said it was not my own. I said I was a polisher - I did not say I was a porter - at the station-house I said, "I am drawn into this, and dare say I shall suffer for it, although innocent."</p>

            . I am the prisoner's uncle. He is in my employ - I am a French-polisher - Willard is in Mr. Broadwood's employ, and is called under-foreman, I believe - I remember seeing him on Saturday, the 5th of April - he had a paper parcel in his hand - a light-brown parcel, from ten to eighteen inches - I spoke to him - Willard was in the habit of going into my shop to fetch young men out, to go on errands - the prisoner has been in my employ five years, and always attended to my business.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Willard was employed at Broadwood's? A. Yes; and my nephew was employed on their premises by me - I was employed there by contract - I know they use silk in their business, but I cannot say it was silk - it was a paper parcel that I saw - I never knew a mercer give away silk as a Christmas-box - it might be so for all I know.</p>

            , late of the 47th" - I then told him, as the order was to pay the money on the sale of the stock, I could not pay it him then; but that he must come again in a few days' time, when the stock would be sold - he asked what day he should come - I think Wednesday was mentioned - this was on a Saturday - he remonstrated at not being paid then, and stated that he had received the order from Captain Gordon for a particular purpose, and that it was of a pressing nature - I said I was sorry to put him to inconvenience, but I could not pay the money till the stock was sold - he then left - I saw him again on the 18th of December; I think it was Wednesday (it was a few days after this) - he asked if I was ready then to pay the money - I said, "Yes," and asked him his Christain name - he replied, "Charles" - I then filled up the order, conceiving he was the proper person for whom it was intended, and whom he represented himself to be - this is the order (looking at it) - he signed it in my presence - this order which he signed was the authority for paying the money - in the course of our business, the party applying would be called on to sign such an order as this before it was paid - we do not pay the money in my department of the house - we should not part with the money unless that cheque had been signed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you ever seen Captain Gordon since he wrote that letter? A. No; I know nothing of the prisoner except in this transaction - we were agents for Captain Wainwright, late of the 47th- Captain Gordon is also of the 47th - Captain Wainwright's name is not Charles - we were agents for him while he was in the 47th - he is on half-pay now, and not in any regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner brought you that letter which was your voucher or authority for payment of this money? A. Yes, on his signing the cheque; the letter was my authority to charge it to Captain Gordon's account - if Captain Gordon asked for a voucher, I should have to produce the letter and the receipt - the letter is my authority, supported by the receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you use and treat that paper which you have produced in any other way than a receipt for the payment of money, which Captain Gordon had previously ordered to be paid? A. I treat it as a draft in acknowledgment of the money - Captain Charles Wainwright, if there is such a person, had no money in our hands to give an order to receive - the letter does not mention any Christain name - I am not aware that there is such a person as Charles Wainwright, who has any money in our hands to which an order could apply - I do not know all the clients of the house - I paid the money on the faith of Captain Gordon's letter to the party who said he was Captain Wainwright - Captain Gordon is at Mullingar - he corresponds with us from Ireland.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. The letter of Captain Gordon was the authority on which you sold out his stock? A. It was; the cashier pays the money on authority of the draft - he does not see the original order, when he pays the money - he pays it on production of the draft which the prisoner signed - my handwriting is on the draft.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The cashier knows your handwriting on the draft? A. Yes; my initials are on it - that forms a voucher or authority to the cashier to pay the money - he would not pay it unless it was marked by the clerk, who has charge of the account.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If the draft was not signed, your initials alone would not be the authority to pay it? A. No; the draft must be signed before the cashier would pay it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you consider you were paying the money to Captain Wainwright late of the 47th? A. No: I did not pay the money - I knew Captain Wainwright, late of the 47th, and supposed the prisoner to be another Captain Wainwright.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, although a gentleman by birth and education, I am so paralyzed by the disgrace and ignominy of my present situation, that I have not power to address you verbally, although my life or liberty might be the forfeit of my silence. I must therefore trust to this less effective mode of expressing to you the truth of my case. My father was a man of high respectability, nearly related to the banker and the baronet of the same name; he was an East India director, and I need not add therefore of good fortune. The wants of a man are more or less in proportion to his station in life. My life was that of a gentleman moving in the best society, and to keep a footing with those I associated with, required pecuniary means of considerable extent, and those means were supplied by the hand of a kind and affectionate parent, while my father lived; unfortunately he died, in 1832, and then, for the first time, it was found that his affairs were insolvent, and I, of course, destitute and pennyless. I was of no profession, for I had quitted the army in my father's lifetime, and of course had great difficulty to live and support myself and wife. I had some trifling assistance from friends, but that of course could not last, and I was unable to extricate myself from my embarrassments, and was obliged to keep myself secret and change my name; and, for fear of being arrested, took the name of Wainwright, and went to Ireland, where a friend of mine was with his regiment; this friend was Captain Duncan Campbell, of the 47th: he knew me both by my own name of Prescott, and by the assumed name of Wainwright; and, as I had held a commission in a dragoon regiment, I had (although retired from the service) been generally since styled Captain, which accounts for my being called Captain Wainwright, as I had been called Captain Prescott; and so friendly was Captain Campbell with me, that he advised me to continue the same name, and I corresponded with him by that name when I left Ireland and came to London. At length, my distress and difficulty increasing, I wrote to him for the loan of 50l., and an order came for the amount from a Captain Gordon; this order was addressed to me as "Captain Wainwright, British Hotel, Cockspur-street, London." I there received it, as I had received other letters, and then, as has been stated, presented it for payment on the one day, and received the amount on a subsequent day. Now, gentlemen, where is the forgery? Was I not the person who wrote to Captain Campbell? If I were not the person intended to have the money, who was? My brother-in-law's name, 'tis true, is Wainwright; his name is not however Charles Wainwright, but Henry Maxwell Wainwright; he lives at Aske, near Farnham, in Surrey, forty miles from London. Did he write to Captain Campbell or Captain Gordon for the loan of money? I humbly submit that it is the duty of the prosecutors, before they ask for a verdict of guilty, to convince you that I am not the person who was intended to have this money, by producing the person who was. Captain Gordon intended it for the person who wrote to Captain Campbell; and I am that person, otherwise I should not have received the letter addressed to me. Again, when I presented the order the amount was not paid, but I was directed to return some days after. Would a guilty man have returned? No; he would have sent a messenger, or done any act rather than ventured again to the same spot. I had no such fear; I was doing nothing wrong; and I returned and signed the draft which the clerk placed before me. If any other person had been in expectation of such order for 50l., that person would have gone to the British Hotel, for the letter, and to Cox and Greenwood's to inquire. Is there any proof that any, even the least, inquiry was made there for the letter? and if any other person but myself had expected it, and had been disappointed, would not that person have been a witness here to-day, and complained that he had been defrauded of the 50l. which had been sent him? Gentlemen, the facts resolve themselves into this - I was distressed, and in fear of my creditors, and to avoid arrest, assumed the name of Captain Charles Wainwright: my friend, Captain Campbell, knew it, and corresponded with me accordingly. I wrote to him for a loan, which was sent me by his friend; and I signed the name I had assumed, and by which I was known in the transaction. What forgery is this? What was my conduct when apprehended? - The officer said he had a warrant against me for fraud: I said I knew nothing of it. It was true; I knew of no fraud. He said it was from Cox and Greenwood's. Knowing I had committed no fraud, I offered to go there with him, but he refused to allow me: and then he mentioned the name of Wainwright; on which I instantly named the transaction, and the sum received. Did this look like guilt, gentlemen? No; I had nothing to conceal. I had received the money intended for me, and supposed, because I had not repaid it, that I was to be arrested for the amount, and, of course, was anxious to avoid a prison, not merely on account of the 50l., but for fear of other creditors. I certainly complained of the neglect of my friends, and my want of means to live,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100109"/>and said, I was obliged to do as I had done, referring thereby to the loan I had made of the 50l. These are the facts, my Lord and Gentlemen, and I trust you will see that in writing the name by which I was known to the person to whom I wrote for the money, I did nothing dishonest, or fraudulent; and with full assurance on your judgment, I rely on your verdict of acquittal.</p>
               <p>JURY to WILLIAM BALLARD. Q. Was it possible for the prisoner to mistake you for a sheriff's officer? A. He knew me as an officer of Marlbourough-street - I have been so ten or twelve years - I never knew him go by the name of Wainwright.</p>
               <p>JAMES POWELL. No application has been made for this money in the name of Wainwright; nor has anybody claimed it - I should not have paid it to anybody but a person named Wainwright.</p>

On Monday, the 17th of March, I missed two violins - I had seen them safe about six o'clock on the Saturday evening - I went to a pawnbroker's to make inquiries, and saw Elizabeth Green, the prisoner, there offering one of my violins to pawn - the pawnbroker said it had been pawned on the Saturday night by a tall young man, and had been taken out again - I asked how she got it - she said her husband bought it of a tall young man - she described him as the pawnbroker had done - I sent for an officer, who took her - she sent for her husband, who gave the same account - he was then taken before the magistrate, and let out on bail - he called on me in about a week, and said a friend of his had picked up part of a duplicate of a violin - we went to a pawnbroker's in St. Luke's, and found this other violin, which is mine.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. These things would have formed a considerable bulk? A. Yes. I went out that evening with Mr. Leekey, who lives in the same house - we both took the house together - he is also a tailor - he is not in partnership with me - he has a weekly salary - I know these bills, which are headed "Leekey and Broughton"- we had been in partnership, but that had been dissolved six weeks before this robbery - on the 16th of January - none of these bills have been given out since, to my knowledge - Leekey was before the magistrate - I believe he stated that he was not a partner with me, but I was in such a state, I could attend to nobody's evidence but my own - sometimes the lock of my door does not catch if the window has not been shut right - I believe the door was found open one morning by a person who was in my employ - I have not been forced to open it with a poker - it is possible that if the window had not been shut right, a person might push the door open - there was nothing of mine found on the prisoner, or about him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it his business to leave the window and door secure? A. Yes; if he had shut the window, and placed the post right, the door would shut itself when he went out.</p>

            , the servant, go down stairs about half-past nine o'clock - I then heard the stair-door shut, which makes a loud noise, and shakes my room - I sent my sister down stairs to know why the door was shut - that door leads from the stairs into the shop; and it is not a usual thing to shut it - I have been in the habit of coming down, if I heard any one in the shop, to see what was going on, and therefore that door was always left open - when I sent my sister down, she returned up again to me, and soon afterwards the prisoner came up, as soon as he had shut the shop - I did not see him shut the shop, but I heard it - he then came up stairs in consequence of my having sent my sister down to tell him I wanted to speak to him - he had promised to lend me a book, and I asked him for it - he said he had not got it; he had left it at Somers Town - he was finishing putting on his coat when he spoke to me - he then went out of my room, and shut my room door, which I never have shut - he wished me good night, and seemed in a bustle, as it was rather later than usual for him - Mrs. Broughton then came into my room, and the little boy came up - we all went down, and found the shop was stripped - I think from the time of the prisoner coming up stairs, and our going down and finding the shop stripped, was about two minutes - it might have been rather more, as I was working a bracelet, and was rather engaged upon it - the cloth that had been in the shop was all solid cloth and heavy - I do not think one man could have taken it away in two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>MR. BROUGHTON. I should think it would have taken two men ten minutes to have taken away the property if they had known the place - it would take a stranger, I should think, a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>JURY to ELIZABETH LEEKEY. Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of coming up to your room? A. He was in the habit of coming up at night, and saying he was going, and asking me to attend to the door; but I had not been at home till the last fortnight of his being there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he came up in the evening, was he in the habit of shutting your door? A. I do not know that he has shut it - I remember he closed it once.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have stated you heard the staircase door leading into the shop shut, and that it was always left open? A. Yes, by my wish it was; but it is a door that makes a noise when it shuts, as it does not catch well - it had lately been shut more frequently - I heard it shut that evening, as it shook my room - whoever went down stairs into the shop must have opened that door again - the prisoner said he lived at Somers Town.</p>
               <p>SARAH WARD. I am servant to Mrs. Broughton. She sent me out that evening at twenty minutes before ten o'clock - when I went down the staircase door was shut, and I opened it, and went into the shop - there is no other way out of the house but at the shop door - the prisoner and a young man were in the shop - no other person - the young man went out of the shop as I went in - the prisoner did not go out - I think the young man was not so tall as the prisoner; but I did not see his face - I asked the prisoner if that was Robert - he said "No," it was a young man; and he said something else which I do not recollect - the prisoner was putting his coat on - I noticed the busts in the shop were without coats - I had never seen them off before - I went out and returned in about ten minutes - the shop was then full of policemen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been in the habit of noticing the shop at night? A. No: this was on a Wednesday night - I do not know that the prisoner had been in the habit of folding up the coats on Wednesday and Saturday evenings.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you been in the shop on Wednesday and Saturday evenings? A. Yes - I never saw the busts without the coats before.</p>
               <p>MR. BROUGHTON. It was not the prisoner's practice to fold up the coats on those nights.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he never fold up the coats that were in the shop? A. The coats which were on the busts were two that were made on purpose for them - I do not know that they were ever folded up, or taken off, but by myself - I am out in the evening sometimes; but when I came home, I must have seen if the busts had been without coats, as I passed close by them; and I never did see that - there are gas-lights in the shop - one of them continues burning a little all night.</p>

             (police-constable S 187). I went to Sydney-street, and took the prisoner the next morning - I told him I wanted him on suspicion of being concerned in a robbery - he said, "Dear me, it is very strange if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100112"/>there has been a robbery at Mr. Broughton's, I left the shop safe last night, at half-past nine o'clock" - I said,"You are my prisoner, and must go with me to the station-house" - in going along, I asked him what time he got home? - he said, "Ask me no questions; I shall answer you none if you do" - I found nothing on him, nor in his room, connected with this robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT to SARAH WARD. Q. How do you know it wanted twenty minutes to ten o'clock, when you went down into the shop? A. I looked at the dial in the shop,</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The boy said they were two short men in frock coats, and I wore a dress coat. When Mr. Broughton and Mr. Leekey went out together, I was told to take the things down; it generally took me a quarter of an hour to do that. I had done about twenty-five minutes past nine o'clock. Mrs. Leekey then sent her sister down to ask me about a book I was to lend her - I said, I could not get it that night, as it was too far to go to Somers'-town, and return. I then went out, and slammed the door after me - Mr. Broughton knows that the door had been left open all night, and one of the workmen came in at the door the next morning. I went to a public-house in Oxford-street that night, and left a quarter before twelve o'clock. I then went home, and was taken the next morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was the number of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100113"/>policeman? A. I did not take notice of his number - I saw he had the police dress on, the blue coat - I know the police dress, and that was the dress he had on; that I am sure of - there was a linkman there, and he is here now- he had an opportunity of seeing what dress the policeman had on - Ellis did not give the shoes up to the prisoner at first - but he took hold of the toes, and Ellis had the heels - he took them at last - there was only Ellis, I, the linkman, and the prisoner there - I had gone to carry things to the ball with Ellis - I had a box on my head - my master's name was on the box - on the Saturday night afterwards, I was putting up my master's shutters, and saw the prisoner go past - my master went after him, and brought him back - my master questioned him, and he then went away - he was not detained then - it was about half-past ten o'clock - I had gone up to bed, after my master went after the prisoner, and was called down when the prisoner came.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure he said you had better mind what you said? A. Yes - I do not know what his number was - I did not think to take his number at the time - he had such a coat on as the policemen wear, but I did not take notice of the colour - I thought it was between a blue and a black - it was a great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you tell the magistrate it was a blue coat? A. No; I have no recollection of it - I might have said so - I did not see that he had a cape on - I will not swear whether he had one on - I know a policeman's cape - I do not think he had one on - I did not see it - I will not swear he had not one on - I did not notice whether he had an armlet on - I did not notice whether he had a lantern - I said before the magistrate that there were two linkmen there, and I thought there were - I had a box on my head with seven dozen of plates inside - my master's name was not on the box - the prisoner was brought to my master's on the Saturday night, and then let go - I saw him afterwards at the office.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you been taking any gin-hot? A. No, I did not get up till five o'clock that morning - I had been at the White Hart before I saw the prisoners - I had half a pint of ale there - I paid 3 1/2d. for it - I then saw the prisoners, and went to the Crooked Billet - I then had half-a-crown and a farthing - the gin came to 3 1/2d., and I had 2s. 2 1/2d. change - I had not seen the prisoners before - I treated them because I wanted to get rid of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you talking to Smith? A. Yes; and she put her hand into my pocket and took the money - Isbester had had hold of my arm before, but she had let go before Smith took my money - they both ran away together.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in the Crooked Billet, and saw the prosecutor and the two prisoners there - I saw the prosecutor change the half-crown, and they all returned into the tap-room - in about ten minutes the two prisoners came running out - I went in pursuit of them and took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean he was ten minutes in the tap-room with these women? A. From six to ten minutes - they had half a pint of gin at the bar, and they all drank it - whether they had any thing else I cannot say- the prosecutor is a very eccentric kind of man - I have known him take women home, fill their belly with victuals, and send them home again - they seemed very friendly together, and came in together - I do not know whether they took any thing in the tap-room.</p>

             (police-constable K 156). I apprehended the prisoners - I found two shillings, two penny pieces, one halfpenny, and one farthing on Smith - she said it was no great catch - I was at the bar, and saw them drinking the gin - I cannot say I saw them go into the tap-room.</p>
