On the morning of the sixth of July a little before nine I went to the bankers', and after I had been in the shop about two minutes, the prisoner came in and presented the check.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the check he presented - A. That is the check. I asked him how he came by it, he said that a gentleman in the street told him he would give him a shilling if he would go and get it cashed, the gentleman was in black, he knew nothing of him, he was at a distance from the house. I left him in the care of the clerk, I went out to try whether I could see the person that he described; I went a little way in the Strand, I saw a person at a shop window that I suspected; I took him in custody, and took him back to the prisoner and asked him if that was the man that gave him the the check; he said, no. I took him out; I saw another person, I asked him if that was the man; he said, no; I asked him where it was that he received this check from, and the person that he said gave it him, he said at the bottom of Catherine-street in the Strand. I asked him to look round if he could see the person; he said he could not. I took him to the office; he there said, that the very man I first brought into the banking-house was the man that he received the check of. I have not been able to see that man since.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Did you ever see the prisoner - A. Yes; he came into my boat and went sixty miles with me, up to Uxbridge, and there he left me. When he first came he engaged to go to Paddington, he left me at Uxbridge between five and six o'clock. When he was gone, I missed the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any conversation with the prisoner about the watch - A. Yes; I saw him sitting at a door. I told him if he would give me the watch or the money it would be better. He took us to the watchmaker where he had sold it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Handy.) You say you do not know the prisoner; was a watch brought to you any time, and when - A. On the 20th or 21st of last month, about one o'clock, it was brought by a person about the prisoner's height, I gave him ten shillings for it, that watch was in my possession till the Friday following, and then three or four men came into my shop with a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there then - A. I do not know that he was; some man asked me if I had not bought a watch lately. I said I had. I brought the watch out of the case; I said is that your watch; the prosecutor said, yes, he believed it was, but I had put new cases to it. I had repaired it and beat out the dents in it, they were not new cases. I asked him the watchmaker's name, he said, Cook, Oxford-street, I then said, this is not your watch, and put it in the case again, and they went away. After they had been to the magistrate in the evening, the constable came, and I delivered the watch to him.</p>

It is the window in the servants' hall, that looks upon the lawn in the garden; the shutters were shut to; I cannot say whether the window was down or not. I left the house near twelve o'clock.

He asked me to make up a bed for him, he was going off early, at five o'clock in the morning, by the coach, into the country. I made up I bed for him, I heard him go up stairs to his bedroom a little after twelve o'clock. I was in my bedroom by a little after eleven. He had been below alone three quarters of an hour before he came to bed. I heard him go down stairs and go out of the street door about three minutes after he had been in his room. The street door fastens with a spring lock, he pulled the door three times before he left it, it shuts very hard.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine the condition of the bed that you made up for him to sleep in - A. Yes, it was very much tumbled, as if a person had slept all night in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him come in that house after he had left it - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him in the morning - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>JOHN PERKS. I am a police officer. On the morning of the 24th of August I went to Mr. Ord's house and examined the manner in which it had been broke open; the entry appeared to have been made by the two wooden bars being sawed away, and then an iron bar, out of five or six, was turned of one side, the two screws were drawn out and left on the sill of the window inside, and the window was open. At two in the afternoon of the same day, I went to the White-horse cellar, Piccadilly, I there observed the prisoner sitting on this deal box, I asked him if it was his box, he replied yes. I tied his hands together and put him in a coach. On his way to the office he began to cry, and endeavoured to beat himself; he said, I have robbed the best of masters; I begged him to desist saying any thing further to me. I took him to the office, and opened the box, it contained the whole of the articles mentioned in the indictment. He said every article of plate was there, he had made away with none.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the whole of the articles in the indictment in that box - A. They were. On searching him, I found this black crape, this screw-driver, some lead melted in various forms, and some loose gunpowder. In his jacket pocket I found the duplicate of a pair of pistols, which appeared to have been pledged at Rochford's the same morning. In the morning I went to the lawn I discovered these matches and a candle under a clump of trees.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Cable.) Are these matches and the piece of candle the same that you saw there - A. Yes; I left them there.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Perks.) Has that candle been used - A.Yes, it has. I previously saw this candle and matches when I first went to the house, and under the apprehension of apprehending the prisoner, I desired them to let them remain.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lupton.) Look at that plate - A. I have examined them all, I have not the smallest doubt of their being my master's, and that they are worth more than 20 l.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any property - A. On a table at the end of the room laid thirty-six watches, and three time pieces, they were stolen; the watches I value at forty pound, and three pound the time pieces, the watches I put on the table an hour before I went to bed, and the time pieces I saw there.

            . I produce the property, I found it in the prisoner's lodgings on the 30th of August, between three and four in the afternoon. The prisoner was not there, he came in about a minute afterwards. As soon as he came into the room I searched him; I found a silver watch in each pocket; I have got them here. In the top drawer in his room I found six more watches, two watches in the bottom drawer, and three time pieces in the middle drawer. He told me that some man brought them there to him. I found some shirts and some napkins, they are all here. I found on the woman three pawnbrokers' tickets.</p>

            's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury; I am charged at the bar of this most honourable court on suspicion of committing a felony, to which I declare I am innocent. I lived in Angel-alley, Bishopsgate. I am a private in the first regiment of Royal Tower hamlet militia. I arose at five o'clock in the morning, and on my way to Hackney I was met by two men at Norton Falgate. They offered me the articles in question to pawn. I asked them why they could not take them themselves; they replied, they had particular business to attend to, they would call on me at night, and pay me for my trouble. I asked them whose property it was, they said, one of their brothers, who had left off business. I took them home in order for my wife to pawn them. I have been seven years in the navy, and in three general actions. I was at the battle of St. Domingo, under the command of Admiral Duncan, in which I exerted my best endeavours for my King and country. I volunteered myself to go down. I was struck with a splinter across my loins, and by the skilful exertion of the Surgeon I was enabled to do my duty at last. When I came over, I exerted my greatest endeavours in cutting out three privateers. I attended on Captain

I called to the watchman. I struck the man that was running with my umbrella over the breast to stop him; I pushed him against the watchman, they both fell together. I made an attempt to lay hold of him. He ran away. I followed him, he was never out of my sight. He was stopped by a person in Hooper-street; I then got hold of him.

            . On the 16th of August, about half past eleven at night, I was taking my supper in the house, I heard the watchman spring a rattle; I went to my door; in a minute the prisoner came running down the court, and the coachman after him. He holloed out to me, that is him, stop him. I immediately ran across the way, and seized him by the collar.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she take them out privately, or how - A. Part was privately.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you caught her hand - A. Yes, in the act, but not with all the goods in it. I caught one gold seal in her hand; upon my catching her hand, she dropped the others I believe, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing at the time you catched her hand - A. I believe I did; she said she did not know what I meaned by taking hold of her hand and polling her about.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else besides you and the two prisoners in the shop - Not at the moment when I detected her, I called my daughter from the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was she from that part of the shop where you was standing - A. I was standing up by the window, and she on the other side, we were close together, my face was that way at times where she was, they both kept me in conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the sliding of the sash make any noise - A. It generally does, but I did not hear any noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it slided back any material distance - It might be about six inches.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw one gold ring in her hand, are you sure she took up all the rest - A. I am positive that no one else did; she came some distance from the place, and then dropped them on the floor just by the counter; the chain she threw on the opposite side of the counter, not the side that I stood on.</p>
               <p>Q. They both came in together - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had seized her hand, you called your daughter you say - A. Yes, I sent her in for our next dear neighbour, he came; an officer was sent for, and they were taken into custody; the prisoners were searched; I believe about three or four shillings were found in halfpence, they had some money each of them, but no other coin but halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You said they looked at a pin, what was the price of the pin that they looked at - A. Half-a-guinea. Then they said they wanted one each; at three shillings, or three and sixpence. That one was half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the ring they looked at. - A. About seven shillings. I do not think they enquired the price of the ring.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, to say that I am totally innocent, in every respect, is not consistent with truth; but the crime of burglary, for which I am charged before you, I solemnly protest I am not guilty off. I will state to you the circumstances as they occurred, and the occasion of my retiring from London. On the 11th of October last, I received samples of these ribbons from a person of the name of Robbins, with whom I had some dealings; on my receiving the samples, it was agreed to meet him the next day at twelve at noon, at the public house of

            , Creed Church-lane; we met accordingly, he bringing with him a box containing the goods, and I not having the sample with me, could not conclude the purchase; he requested me to take care of them; I said, I was not going home; he said, he would take them; he took them to my house and left them. But to say I was about to purchase these goods in a fair and honourable way, would be to deceive the court, and make me appear more culpable; I had every reason to suppose that I was about purchasing goods dishonestly come by; and on my hearing that the officers found the goods in my house I retired from London, by advice of my friends; my absenting myself was not from a consciousness that I was the robber. The goods themselves lay in the most conspicuous part of my house, just as if some person had just brought them; had I stolen them, should not I have concealed them, and left the samples in any careless situation, instead of which, the principle was to be seen; was it not necessary for me to have the samples while the goods were in my possession, samples which shewed the quality of the goods; for this purpose I kept the samples till I purchased the goods, which is usual. And, as I have stated to you before, that the person with whom I was about to purchase the goods, had, in my opinion, come by them dishonestly; he brought the goods to Mr. Hodges, they were taken to my house, and I sealed the box, that I might be sure the box should not be opened: it was sealed in the presence of Mr. Hodges, who is since dead, which the officers can testify; had it been stolen by me, that seal would not have been left in the place. In it such an act, which a man guilty of the crime of burglary would have committed. It is always a presumption, that persons committing robberies are always anxious of getting rid of the goods; this bulk of property was disposed in different quarters, one

Mrs. Jackson, whom I shall entreat your Lordship to call, had part of the property. Is it natural to suppose that I should be the person who committed the robbery, whose interest it was to dispose of them; instead of which there is not the smallest degree of intimation, that I offered them for sale. The officers knew the things in the box, were what they searched for, and unexpectedly these goods were found in my possession twelve days after the robbery, is that a proof that I must have stolen them. Nor was such a key found in my house, at Sandy's-row. And, however blameable I may be for the intent to purchase this property, for which, I had every reason to believe, to be dishonestly stolen; my conscience acquits me of the theft. I trust you will see this transaction in a true light, and that you will not convict me of the capital offence because I am guilty of a crime of less magnitude; and if any doubts are entertained by you, I entreat you that I may have the benefit of that doubt.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present when this instrument was found - A. Yes; it was found at No. 4, Sandy's-row, at the house of Burkitt.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose - A. I lost the articles stated in the indictment. I was robbed to the amount of three hundred pounds, in watches and jewellery. None of the property has ever been found.</p>

            . In consequence of a warrant, I went, in company with Armstrong and Bishop, to No. 4, Sandy's-row. On searching a little small back-house, in a writing-desk on a table, I found this pocket-book, in this pocket-book is a list of articles of jewellery; I shewed it to Mr. Folkard, he said it exactly corresponded with the articles that were lost; I found that centre-bit divided in different parts of the house, as I have before described; I put it together.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a centre-bit used by carpenters - A. No; it is such a tool that I have seen found, with the only difference, the one I before saw found was a little smaller; that tool was applied to the aperture made in the shutter, it exactly fitted. There were several holes bored in Mr. Folkard's door, and this gimlet fitted them exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Folkard. Look at that pocket-book which was found in the desk - A. Here are a number of memorandums, and among them here is the statement of the articles I lost, and the sum affixed to some of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Supposing a man to have bought these articles, and to have entered them in a book, might it not be the entry of a man that purchased them - A. No doubt about that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had some lodgers in my house; I know nothing of that centre-bit whatever.</p>

            . Escombe lodges with me. On Monday morning he came home near one o'clock; he told me he had been robbed, and described the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in search of the person that robbed him of his watch - A. I did; we found the prisoner on the 31st of July, between nine and ten at night, she and another was walking before us; he said, here she is; she went into a public house, and we followed the moment she turned round from the fire-place and saw him, she was very much confuse, and whispered to the other girl.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she confused - A. She looked very pale, and was quite struck, and whispered to the other girl. I asked her whether she knew that young man; when I came into the passage with her, the landlord came out and touched her on the arm, and while I was talking to her about this young man, she ran away and spanked the doors after her; I pursued her into Short's gardens, I there saw her go into a house; the watchman sprang his rattle; we went and searched the house, and on the first landing-place on the stairs I apprehended her. I then said to her, why, if you are innocent, did you run away. She said, she would not come down; I pulled her away, and took her to the watch-house, and searched her the next morning; I found nothing but two letters.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to her character.</p>

I asked the man if it was his watch, he told me it was. In buying the watch he called for a pint of rum; I drank one glass of it. I left the man in the house. I went home, and never saw the man afterwards. The man said he was in distress for money, he was along with a woman of the town.</p>

We went to Tottenham, Ogle, Doyle, and Fairburn, went into Mr. Adlington's shop, me and Hamilton was on the opposite side of the way; in a minute or two I saw Doyle run out with a gown piece under his coat; Ogle came out with a parcel of shawls in his hat, and Fairburn with some stockings; we went up the road, and M'Carran went back into the house; he afterwards came out with some stockings and more things; we went into a field on the other side of the house; and there M'Carran and Doyle divided them.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the horse your's - A. No, I borrowed the horse and cart of my neighbour. I put this meat in the cart, and I got up and drove it homewards.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you got before you saw the prisoner - A. I think it was near five hundred yards; the prisoner stopped me; he said, Mrs. Powell, you must go back, Mr. Boots wants you.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before - A. I had seen him, but I did not know his name. I told him I could not go back; he said, I must go back, I had made a mistake in my bill; I said, I could rectify that another day; he said, he was one of Mr. Boots servant's, he could mind the horse and cart the while, I must go back; I got out of the cart and went back.</p>
               <p>Q. That was all the conversation that past - A. Yes; I left the prisoner with the horse and cart, as he told me he was to mind it. I went back, and said to Mr. Boots, Sir, what do you want with me, what is the matter, he answered, nothing at all, he did not want me; upon that I went back. He had run away with my horse and cart, and the meat.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner and the horse and cart were gone - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in search of him - A. Yes. I cried out, Oh! my God! I am ruined One Gorden, went and found the cart and horse in Brick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave an alarm - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What time might you see it - A. I saw it twenty minutes before eight o'clock. I left the house in care of my mother, and when I came back, my mother informed me the watch was gone, and Mrs. Bull and no one else had been in the room. Mrs. Bull never came home that night; I enquired at the pawnbroker's, and could hear nothing of it. On the next day, I saw Mrs. Bull near the rising Sun, Spitalfields market; I took hold of her, and said, Mrs. Bull, deliver up my husband's watch; she said, she could not tell what I was talking of. I took her home, and then I desired her to give up the duplicate, she told me she had none; I then said, must I accuse you or my mother, as there was no one else in the place; she said, not your mother, your mother is innocent, I have stole it, and I have sold it, it is what I expected, it serves me right.</p>

Yes; the prisoner came in about nine o'clock in the morning, she only staid a few minutes; I looked at the watch to see what it was a clock, the watch was there; I saw it at nine o'clock; a few minutes before ten I went to look what it was o'clock, I missed that watch; Mrs. Bull was gone then. On the 11th my daughter brought her home, and asked her for the duplicate; she said, she had no duplicate, she had stole it and sold it; I asked her where she had sold it; she would not tell it.</p>

On Thursday I went to Somerset House, to take my husband's half-pay; I came home on the Saturday, and about one hundred yards from my own door, I met Mrs. Evans, she said, give me my husband's watch; I told her, I did not know what she was talking about. I went up into my own room, and went to the cupboard for my husband's half-pay ticket, it was gone; she said, you have taken my husband's watch, I will keep your husband's half-pay ticket. Mrs. Evans said, make your husband's ticket over to me, and I will not hurt a hair of your head; I told her I would not make it over to any one, I had not pawned the watch nor sold it.</p>

On Saturday, the 4th of August, between eight and nine at night, I saw a man come in my shop, he took something off the counter, I could not see what it was; he was pursued. I did not know what I was robbed of until the hats were brought back.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SHONE. On the 4th of August I was in Mrs. Wallis's parlour in conversation with her; I saw some person go out of the shop with some straw bonnets; he was at the door when I saw him; I pursued him and overtook him, he was walking, with two bonnets in one hand and one in the other; I tapped him on the shoulder, and begged that he would walk back with me with those bonnets. When I took hold of him he gave me a violent blow on the cheek, and threw the bonnets, at me; about a minute I was insensible from the blow. I ordered my apprentice to take the bonnets up; I pursued him into Princes-street, he was entangled there by the posts; he said, b - r you, I will stick a knife in your b - y guts. I stopped, and called out, stop thief; he then ran, and I moved on behind him at a distance; a watchman coming by and a woman was knocked down; he ran into Queen-street, I collared him, I never lost sight of him, I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner break into your house lately - A. Yes; I was at home, it was a little after two o'clock on Tuesday morning; I was alarmed by a noise at the shutter of my shop door; I sleep in the parlour behind the shop; I heard it, and immediately got up; the noise ceased, I stopped a few minutes, and then laid down. I heard the noise again; I heard the shop door open, I ran out naked, and looked to the left, I saw two men, they did not see me, I ran after them, and caught hold of the prisoner, the other ran away, I held the prisoner tight by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that he was in the house - A. I heard the footsteps go out of the house, I was not a moment after them.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost nothing - A. No. They forced the shutter open, and broke the bolt. He was taken to the watch-house, we found a broken chisel in his pocket, and a knife; his companion had an iron crow, which he threw away in Howland-street, which was brought to my shutter; it exactly fitted the marks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I offer to run when you called out stop thief - A. You had not time, your back was towards me, I was immediately after you, when I saw you, you were talking together; the other man saw me, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you positive that they were in your shop - A. I am quite positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try the chissel to the shop - A. No, only the crow.</p>
               <p>MR. WARD. I am a broker. I picked up this crow at my door about half after five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left my work about five o'clock, with intent to take a chissel to make a seat-iron. I am a shoemaker, the knife is a shoemaker's knife, I had used it that afternoon, I took it to be ground, and on my returning from the fair late, I was locked out, I had no place of refuge, I was obliged to walk the streets. I saw two young men talking together, I said, are you locked cut, they said, yes; this gentleman came out, they ran away, he came and took me in custody.</p>

               <p>JOHN HUTCHINSON. On the 23d of July, between two and three in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in Northumberland-street, he was close to to Mr. Barnes's house, he was in company with two or three other boys, they hesitated a little while, then the prisoner went down the area steps; the area door was open. In two or three minutes he came up again, and brought some things up in his apron. I then asked him what he had got there, he hesitated, and either said what is that to you, or somebody has given it to me. I told him I should not let him go. He then said it was his first offence, he hoped I would let him go, and that the other two had desired him to go down stairs. I told him, if the person to whom the property belonged to would let him go, I had no objection, but I should not let him go. Mr. Barnes was not at home, he was sent for, and the property was identified,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what the property was - A. I did; I took it from him; it was two sheets and a towel, Mr. Barnes had the property, and the prisoner was taken to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went down the area, a man there gave me this property, he told me to go to the corner of the street, and he would give me something for my trouble.</p>

               <p>Q. What did these notes consist of - A. There were two five pound notes, the rest so many twos and a one.</p>
               <p>Q. How many twos - A. I know I had only one one pound note, besides the twos and the fives, twenty-two pounds I had first. I changed a one, and had eight shillings left; I changed that one at a house at Wapping, just after I came out of the West India Dock.</p>

He kept me off with one hand; and put his other hand behind him, he gave the pocket-book, notes and all, to the woman. He took hold of my jacket and tore it, here is the tear now. I held him until the watchman came up, and gave him in charge of the watchman. I never parted with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say any thing to you - A. Not a word. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Where did you come from - A. I came from Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. So you had twenty-one pounds of the produce of a former voyage - A. Yes, it was money that I left in England when I went abroad. I left twenty-four pounds, and I got twenty-two pounds of it when I came back, I got it from my sister, she lives in Wright's-buildings, Chick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always told the same story of it being twenty-four pounds that you left behind you - A. It was twenty-two younds that I got from my sister, I left twenty-four.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not at other times said it was twenty-eight - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, to this gentleman, when he served you with notice of trial within these two days, say it was twenty-eight - A. I did not; he came to me in the street, I said twenty-four, unless he took it in a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came on shore on the 19th, from two o'clock till near twelve o'clock at night, when you arrived at Aldgate, had not you spent your time in the alehouses - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you charged this man with having picked your pocket, How many alehouses had you been at - A. Three, as much as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear it was not five - A. No; I had spent twelve shillings; I was not drunk, you may depend upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. I cannot depend upon any such thing, you having spent twelve shillings in drink, and then you charged this man with having picked your pocket - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You went the next day before the Lord Mayor, and the Lord Mayor, after hearing your tale, let the man go upon bail - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was admitted to bail, did not you go to the prisoner's house, and the watchman with you, and desire him to give you money to make it up - A. I went to a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that - A. God in heaven knows; I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to that public house did not you go to the prisoner's house, see the wife, and inquire for the prisoner - A. I went with another man, not the watchman, the watchman met us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to the prisoner's house - A.I did not, I come past it, the watchman said, that is the house where the man that robbed you lodges; he went up to the door, and knocked at the door, he asked if the man was at home. She said, no. He took me into a public house and called for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. When he asked if the man was at home and she said, he was not, did not he ask where he was to be found - A. I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she, in answer to his inquiry, tell him that he would be likely to be found at a neighbouring public house - A. I cannot tell; we went to a public house at the bottom of the street, had a pot of beer, I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Court. You are asked the question, whether, after having knocked at the door and asked if the man was at home, did not you hear the person of the house tell him where he was to be found - A. No, not a word.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Before you quitted his house did not the watchman lift up the stick over the woman's head and tell her it would be worse for her husband if it was not settled - A. I will swear that was never in my eyesight.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did not this man come to the public house and ask the watchman how he dared behave to his wife so, and that he would never settle any such thing - A. I will tell the truth; he never spoke a word to the watchman or me either.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 19th of June, Mackgowen called me, a little before twelve at night; he said, watchman, I have been robbed, this is the man that robbed me. He had hold of him; I took him by the collar and led him to the watch-house, and from there to the Compter. The prisoner said he was not guilty; the other said he never loosed him after he took the money from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other person about there; any woman - A. No, not that I saw. The prosecutor said there were two women behind the prisoner that took it from his hands.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He told you where he lived - A. Yes; he told the constable of the night, and desired to send home to his friends.</p>
               <p>Q. You went before the Lord Mayor, and the Lord Mayor bailed this man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A day or two afterwards did you go to the prisoner's house - A. I might be happening to go through Mark-lane; I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever happen to walk with the prosecutor in Mark-lane - A. I did not walk with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it is quite impossible that you could have called at the prisoner's house - A. I am sure I am not certain; I do not recollect that I saw the prisoner afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. No, no, one thing at a time; we will come to that afterwards. Now do not recollect calling at the prisoner's house at all - A. I do not; it has quite slipped my memory, if I did, I never knocked at the prisoner's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you never knocked at the prisoner's door and saw his wife - A. I will not swear it; I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner in a public house in Mark-lane - A. I do; Mackgowen was in my company then.</p>
               <p>Q. Now only half an hour before you went to that public house, had not you called at his house and spoken to his wife - A. I might do it, I really have forgot it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him there, upon your oath did not he reprobate you for going to his house and ill-treating his wife - A. He spoke to me but one or two words, and that was an unbecoming word; I do not recollect it.</p>

On the evening of the 19th of June, I went out to meet a friend who owes me some money; I spent the evening at a friend's house; being disappointed of getting the money of my friend, who is here present, I staid with him till about a quarter past eleven o'clock; then I left his house and walked fast home, because I was later than usual. On my coming by Aldgate, seeing this man placed against a post, he asked me the way to Snowhill; I immediately told him. He said, d - n my eyes, what is the use for me to go to Snowhill? I have got no money. I went on about eighty yards, then this villain came and took hold of me, and swore I had robbed him. I believe it is a combination of the watchman and him to make money of me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LEWIS. Q. Are you a porter - A. Yes, a fellowship porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, in the month of June last, being at a public house called the White Hart - A. Yes, it was after Mr. French was taken up; I saw Ing, the watchman, there, and Mackgowen; the prisoner came into the house.

We went straitway from Red Lion-street to Plough-alley; there was no other one in company with us; there were sailors and women in the alley.</p>

Yes, at the end of the alley, the prisoner was among them, he was the first that struck Jones. I did not see Jacobs. I did not see the deceased insult any body before Jones came up. The prisoner said, if he could see the deceased, making use of a bad expression, he would have his life.</p>
               <p>Court. He did not mention his name - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did the deceased come near the prisoner - A. It might be five minutes. Jones was coming quietly along, the prisoner struck Jones with, I think, a stick, Jones had no stick, as I saw. There were about five Portuguese altogether, as nigh as I can recollect. They got Jones down at the corner of Plough-alley, and Jones called out, a knife! a knife! I saw the prisoner, he had a knife at the lower part of Jones's belly, and then I saw the prisoner throw it into the street. Then the prisoner ran about twenty yards towards Hermitage Bridge, before he was stopped, two gentlemen, who are here, laid hold hold of him, he was taken to the Thames Police. Two gentlemen led Jones to the opposite side of the way; he had his bowels in his hand; he asked me if I saw his bowels; I said, I did; he said I am no more for this world. I did not see any stones thrown: I did not see the whole transaction.</p>

The prisoner took a knife from under his waistcoat, and came five or six yards and stabbed him under his belly. I collared him immediately, and five or six Portuguese hit me on the head with sticks and stones, by that means he got away from me, and ran across the street. I ran after him, and catched him again; I never lost sight of him. His knife fell down in the street, I do not know who picked it up. I took the prisoner to the office.</p>

            . On the evening of this transaction, I was going to the Sugar Loaf, Hermitage-street; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190019"/>heard the cry of murder, I saw the prisoner making his escape from the last witness; I said, if nobody will lay hold of him, I will; and then I went with the people that took the prisoner to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Mr. PRATT. I am one of the pupils belonging to the London Hospital. I saw the deceased the next morning, he lived till eleven o'clock the next morning, and then died.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he wounded - A. On the left side, on the lower part of the belly, with a sharp instrument; in my opinion, that wound was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>REV. EDWARD ROBSON. Q. You are a magistrate of the county of Middlesex - A. I am. On Sunday, the 27th of August, about eight o'clock in the evening, I attended the diseased at the London hospital; he was sensible, perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sensible of his approaching death - A. I did not ask him that question; I administered the path to him, and took the examination from his own lips, and writ it down at the instant, and he signed it, that is the deceased's signature; he was perfectly sensible, though in great pain. The prisoner was present and heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the prisoner understood it - A. Certainly it did; though I was surprized on the second examination, to find that he wanted an interpreter upon what the deceased said. I asked the prisoner two or three questions, he gave me answers. The man was brought before me in custody. I went to the London hospital to take the deposition of

             - Who says, that yesterday afternoon, between five and six o'clock, or it might be a little sooner, I was near the bottom of Hermitage-street, and passing through Plow-alley, I met the prisoner and two other men, who, because I did not make way for them, grossly abused me, and shoved and struck me. I went up to the house where several of the Portugueze lodge, my shipmates then came to me. Several of the Portugueze then came up, I was then fighting another Portugueze with a stick, the prisoner seeing me likely to get the better of him, struck me with a knife and stabbed me in the belly. I am certain the prisoner is the man who shoved me in the alley, and I am certain that he is the man that stabbed me with the knife.</p>

            . I live in Russell buildings; my father-in-law lives in Plough-alley, No. 10, opposite to where the Portugueze lodged; I was there in the evening, before this accident happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in the course of that day, see the deceased, in company with others, go to the house in which the Portugueze lodged - A. I saw them in the alley, but not to go to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before you herd the poor man lost his life - A. About three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased in company with any one - A. One, two, or three; more or less, they addressed themselves to me, and said, they had been ill used by the Portugueze, which they had been fighting with sticks. The Portugueze had fastened their door and window shutters; I advised them to go home, they walked down the alley, and I went to my friends.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. About what time had you any occasion to be in conversation with any persons - A. Between six and seven.</p>
               <p>Q. After having that conversation, you advised them to go away. and you also went away, when did you return - A. It might be half an hour afterwards. That quarrel was over, and another had ensued in Hermitage-street, and that was over.</p>
               <p>A. How do you know that the person that you conversed with in Plough-alley was the deceased - A. I do not know that it was, I saw the deceased in the dark, I could not get near enough to see whether it was the man.</p>

            . I am a tallow-chandler in Hermitage-street. On the day the man was killed, I was at my door, a tall thin man went down the street about half an hour before the murder was committed, in a blue jacket and trowsers, he appeared to be full of vengeance, and used bad language against the Portugueze, they were two more with him, but they did not appear to like to come with him; I never saw the man before to my knowledge. I did not see the deceased after the accident happened.</p>

            . Q. I believe you are a servant to Rodriquez, the landlord of the house, where this man lodged - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day that the man was killed, had you seen him at your house - A. Yes, he came there between five and six in the afternoon; a Portugueze and a lodger came into the house, and the deceased followed, and four of the deceased comrades followed him; his comrades persuaded him to quit the house; he said, he would not, without fighting. I told him my master was not at home, and whatever words he had with the man, to decide it elsewhere; he wanted to fight with the man that came into the house. With a deal of persuasion he left the house; in about seven or eight minutes the deceased returned again, and there were six with him outside of the door; he used violent language and struck one of our men, his name is Lopez. I shut the door and the windows, the deceased went away, our lodger came in; he returned, in about seven or eight minutes, with the end of a rope, he had seven or eight comrades with him, he thrust violently against the door and the window, saying, he would break the door, if the b - y b - r did not come out. Mr. Gill persuaded him not, as the men were quiet, saying it would be against the law to break the door; the men were quiet at that time, and the house was shut up. He said, he would not leave the alley that night, and every b - y b - r that he met, that he thought was a Portugueze, he would split his head open; revenge he was determined to have. I know no further, than I heard the cry of murder in about ten or twenty minutes afterwards. The prisoner was not in the house during any of these times, but Lopez was, he was the person that was first struck.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You are the servant of the lodging house keeper where the Portugueze lodge - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. The American sailors and the Portugueze sailors are always fighting - A. Yes, I generally hear of them fighting. I did not see the murder done, nor did I go to the hospital.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190020"/>Q. The man that you called the deceased, was not he an American sailor - A. Yes; he is a Welchman, as I am informed, he is called an American.</p>

               <p>Q. On the day he was killed, did you see him at the house where you lodge, and at what time - A. From four to five in the evening, I do not know for what they came; I was at home, I saw the deceased come into the room, at the lower part of the house, where I was; he called to all the Portugueze to come out to fight, they refused; the deceased went out, and we all remained in the room. He came in again the second time, they pushed him out of doors, then the deceased struck me; there were seven or eight with the deceased. As soon as we pushed him out of the door, we locked the door and fastened the windows, and remained inside of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When the door and the windows were fast, did you remain within, or did you go out to walk - A. The prisoner and I went out to take a walk as far as the London Dock, on our return home, the deceased, with some other men, followed us home to the house. They would not let us into the house. They fell upon the prisoner and struck him, I ran away and never returned back.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was it after the man ran away, before you heard of a man being killed - A. About two hours afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Pratt. Did you observe any thing particular upon the eye of the deceased, that they have mentioned - A. I think I do, indistinctly, there was a mark on the man's eye, he was marked with the small pox, a middle sized man.</p>

The landlord introduced Mr. Shorter to me, and then Shorter said, I will buy your mare; I asked for the mare, cart, chaise, and harness, sixty five pound; he said, that he had not got the money, but I was going into the baking business again in the city, and coals would be as useful to me as the money. It was perfectly understood, that I was to have the goods before he had the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what was said - A. He said, I was to have the coals the next day, that he had bought them of Horn and Devey. I was not to deliver the mare until I had the value.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time where was your mare - A. In Mr. Cowell's stables, the mare was that night, that was the 22d of

             the next morning Mr. Cowell came to me, he gave me some information, and before I got to the stable the mare was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he gave you any intimation of his coming to take away the mare - A. No, nor had I given him any permission to do it. I met the prisoner, after having been seeking for him in Worship-street, between two and three of the same day. I said, Shorter, you have taken away my mare; he said, d - n your eyes I do not know what you mean, I have sold her, he said it was his mare. I sent for an officer, and he was taken to the office.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been drinking - A. I was forward in liquor. I was under the piazza's when I lost my watch; I did not see it taken; it rained very fast, I stopped there for shelter; a girl came up to me, followed by the prisoner and another man, and accused me of striking the girl as I passed; I told the girl that I never saw her, and told her to go about her business; upon which, the prisoner and the other man came up to me, and made use of very abusive language; I was then surrounded by nine or ten. When I saw that I made off to the other end of the piazza's, just by the theatre door, I was not there many minutes, before I heard a great noise at the place which I came from, upon which I returned back; there was a gentleman there, accused the prisoner of attempting to pick his pocket. I told him, these are the fellows that insulted me. The prisoner came up and pushed me, asked me who I called fellows; he knocked me down; I got up again; he gave me two or three blows then ran away; I followed him into Wild-street; the watchman caught him. I lost my watch in the scuffle; I did not perceive it go. When I left the house I looked what time it was, I had not felt it since. The watch has never been found.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of April, 1806, were your premises broken open - A. They were; on the night of the 16th we presume so, on the morning of the 17th we discovered it. The shutter at the warehouse door was forced away from its fastening, a pane of glass was taken out, by which means they entered, there was room for the admission<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190021"/>of a boy at least, I should think for a man. The counting house is in the warehouse, so that if a person gets in the warehouse, there is an admission into the counting house, where there was fifty pound, besides an Exchequer bill for one hundred pound. I think the number was 1401, I have got the memorandum in my pocket, it is a brokers memorandum, it was a collateral evidence, not what I received with the Exchequer bill. This Exchequer bill was enclosed in an iron drawer, within the iron safe, which drawer having been locked, was forced open; I never discovered any thing of the Exchequer bill, until the prisoner was taken up. The Exchequer bill was my private property; I had that Exchequer bill in my possession three or four months; I have the number and date in my pocket book. If I saw the bill I could swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, looking at that bill, have you the least doubt that is the bill that belongs to you - A. No, this is the bill that I lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This has been cut across has it been paid - A. I have received from government the amount of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have lost nothing - A. Yes, I have lost fifteen pound. After the robbery, I applied to government for that bill; and upon my given bond that I never would call for payment, they paid me the money.</p>

My Lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I come to this tribunal, equally impressed with the confidence of my own innocence, and in the justice of the court, conscious as a British subject, I shall have justice from a British jury; I claim your indulgence for a few moments, while I relate the circumstances of the prosecution. It is a well known fact that I was educated for a merchant, that I have imported and exported corn and cheese, and by the loss of two vessels and the failure of a house at Boston, in America, I was a considerable sufferer; I became insolvent; since which time, I have resided at Liverpool and London as a dealer in corn and cheese. In the year 1808, I was a resident in Somers-town. Gentlemen, in the beginning of August, 1808, I had several mercantile transactions with Mr. Benjamin Shaw, who then lived in Walbrook, and having to receive some money of him on account of cheese delivered to him; I received of him, at the Virginia coffee house, that Exchequer bill with other monies, making in the whole, one hundred and nine pound, thirteen shillings, and one penny; this transaction very fortunately took place in the presence of gentlemen, who will prove, in a very honourable manner, the way I became possessed with this bill. I was subpoened at Warwick, I left London on Saturday, the 13th of August, and arrived at Warwick the next day. The trial was over on the 16th, and I set of for London. In consequence of which I was pursued, and took back on a charge of forgery; and so high ran the tide of malice and revenge, that although the magistrate knew no forgery was committed, still he committed me upon a charge of forgery. Gentlemen, it shews you the malice of the parties who were my prosecutors. After laying eight months under the dreadful charge of forgery, in a jail, the worst England can produce; under a jailor the most tyrannical, in the center of my enemies, who were determined upon my life; my dear family ruined; obliged to associate with ruffians of the worst denominations; deprived of all communication, even of the nearest relative, unless with the third person. At March assizes a bill was found upon me for forgery, and one for a fraud, all arising out of the same charge. I tried the charge of forgery, the prosecutors were not able to make out their case, I was most honourably acquitted, without being called upon for my defence. I was then permitted to find bail in six thousand pounds; not being able to comply with it, I was detained. Gentlemen, the managing persons, and the principal witnesses in the prosecution, their malice have never ceased, it has continued with double perseverance. All this was grounded upon whim and supposition. Is a man to be stamped with ignominy, and his family to be ruined, because an insatiable thirst for popularity, actuated them to bear an individual down great part of his time. I was suffering the most dreadful affliction, and upwards of two years imprisonment in the bloom of my life; I trust these things will be duly deliberated. Gentlemen, since my arrival in town, and Shaw's name being in the papers, in spite of my endeavours he has been able to keep back. I will prove to you that he is in town, or in its vicinity, and not in America; that his wife has called upon me several times, is well known - Why could he not call if he was an innocent holder of the bill - Why did he not come forward, and prove to you, that he and me are innocent men. It appears to me, and I think it must in his own mind, that he ought to come forward and prove the honourable way he possessed it, or I think every honest heart would avail himself of that. My conduct in this was when I was committed for trial; I did not deny the bill, when the attorney and committing magistrate lodged a warrant against me. I instantly gave up the name of Shaw, as the person from whom I received this bill; I used every effort in my power, by which means I became possessed of this bill. I was buried to the world, or at that time I had it in my power to produce Mr. Shaw: two years have elapsed, and from my long confinement, and my finances being ruined, I have not been able to bring him forward. I suppose, at the request of the prosecutor, in order to lead me off my guard; the first time the warrant was served upon me, the jailor assured me, that the warrant was withdrawn against me; but to my inexpressible surprize, the day on which my confinement expired, at twelve o'clock at night, I was taken out and brought up to London. I have certainly been hunted down by the hand of power. Therefore, being confident of my innocence and integrity, I shall call such witnesses, as I trust you will not convict me upon this charge. Any of you, gentlemen, might have been placed in my unpleasant situation; even his lordship on the bench might have been a holder of this bill, it being a government security. It is not impossible, that the day on which the burglary was committed, that it might have been circulated through several persons hands, and that with impunity. It is a known fact, that persons who are in the act of making these depredations, they, if they cannot part with the bill they so obtain, destroy it. But this bill is found in my possession two years after the burglary was committed.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190022"/>Gentlemen, whatever prejudices may rest upon the public relative to any mercantile transaction of mine, nothing criminal whatever has attached to any part of my conduct. Even after I had given an hundred pound for it, had I known a felony was connected with it, I would have destroyed it, and my having possession of the bill, no man would think I committed the burglary. And if I had been aware that any felony had been connected with it, I would not have gone to the office of Mr. Bish, to know if it was a good bill; Mr. Bish is known to be a government broker, and in all human probability, Mr. Bish might have had information that this burglary was committed. My going into the county of Warwick was not any premeditated design, but by order of the court; would I have then in my possession a bill to which a burglary was connected. I most solemnly declare, that if any nefarious transaction is concerned with this bill, a fraud must be imposed upon me by

            , our English constitution breathes nothing but liberty, no man can be punished without guilt, and of this guilt there must not only be proof, but the guilt must be proved by legal clear evidence, so that nothing dark shall operate to the subject. I bid defiance to my most inveterate enemy to prove, that any knowledge of guilt of mine is connected with it. Gentlemen, my ruin must have been sought after, but if Providence, through your medium, should restore me to my family, it shall be my prayer to God, to fulfill those great and important duties of a christian, a husband and father, to the end of my life. Give your minds to the facts, examine into the truth, and I am certain your verdict must be an acquittal; thus you, gentlemen, and self approving conscience, will release me from woe, and I am restored to my family to alleviate their wants.</p>

            . Q. What way of life are you in - A. A tanner, I reside at Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the habit, some years ago, to frequent the Virginia coffee house - A. I was in the habit of going there frequently, about the latter end of July, or the beginning of August, 1808; I have seen the prisoner there two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Shaw - A. I cannot say I know the person to swear to him; I knew a person of that name that was produced to me by the prisoner, if he was in this court I could swear to him, I saw a bill which the prisoner produced to me, and asked me if I knew what it was; I saw him receive it of a person, that he told me was Mr. Shaw; he told me it was an Exchequer bill, I never saw such a one before, it was signed Grenville, and there were some figures on the back of it, it was cut in two, and sealed or wafered on the back.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and tell me whether you think that is the same bill that you saw of the prisoner's - A. I could not swear positively, I believe it is the same, it has the same appearance, it is cut in the same way, wafered in the same way, the same signature, and for the same sum of one hundred pound.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You and the prisoner are acquainted together - A. I knew him when he was in Ipswich, he had a bank there; he sent circular letters about for connection; I applied to him for the loan of thirteen hundred pound on my estate, it was not complied with; during that interim, they were taken up and tried for forgery, in the very place where we are now.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards became acquainted at the Virginia coffee house - A. Yes, about two years back.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after you became acquainted with him as Ipswich - A. Rather more than four years.</p>
               <p>Q. However, he and you met two years ago; you saw the ceremony pass; the person that he called Shaw offered to him a piece of paper, which he shewed to you, which he told you was an exchequer bill; that is all you know about it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where it came from, and whether ever it was in Mr. Shaw's pocket, you do not know. When were you first told that you were wanted as a witness - A. About a week or ten days back.</p>
               <p>Q. Then till a week or ten days back, you had no knowledge that you should be wanted as a witness here - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that your friend was taken up at Warwick two years ago - A. I saw it in the papers. He is no friend of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew where you lived - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Why, upon his being taken up did not he write to you? Did you receive a letter from him - A. There was one letter wrote, I took no notice of it, there were several letters, as I understood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not tell me what you understood, tell me what you know. Is the first account correct, that you never heard that you should be called upon as a witness till a week or ten days ago - A. It is impossible that account can be correct, if I received a letter; I had a letter from the prisoner at Warwick after he was taken up. I cannot recollect any circumstance of the letter at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you a master tanner - A.I am supported by my brother, he lives at Kimbolton, I live at Greenwich. I have not worked in the trade for three years; I never worked with any body, only as a journeyman to myself.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. I have known the prisoner about three years.</p>
               <p>Q. In the summer, 1808, did you meet him at the Virginia coffee house, by appointment from him - A. I have met him there to receive money of him for work that I had done, for boots and shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing any instrument of security of money paid to him - A.There was a gentleman in company at that time, I think, in August, 1808, gave him a note. In fact the note was put into my hands. There was a gentleman in company gave Hitchin the note, I believe he called himself Shaw.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know it if you was to see it - A. I have no doubt about that; I think it was wrote upon the corner on the face of it.</p>
               <p>Court. What was written upon the face of it - A. A name upon the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it, a parish indenture - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it written or printed - A. I think written. There was a person's name in writing; I think it was part written and part printed. I think it was a one hundred pound note, or bill, Mr. Hitchen informed me that Mr. Hitchen shewed it to me, because he could not pay me for the work I had done, without I got it changed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get it changed - A. I went to the gentleman's in Walbrook, Mr. Shaw could not change it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190023"/>Q. Then the prisoner did not pay you - A. No, because he had not small notes enough.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Look at this bill, are you able to say whether that was the bill that was shewn you - A. Yes, I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw that given him by Shaw - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What was the amount of your bill - A. Two pounds fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You came for the two pounds fourteen shillings just in the nick of time - A. No, I was not in the nick of time.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Shaw was there, he handed over the bill to him, and he handed over that bill to you; he said, Mr. Gaskin, I cannot pay you without I get that bill changed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say, I will go over to Palace-yard and get that bill changed - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live - A. I live at No. 26, in Marshall-street; St. George's Fields.</p>

            . It is a mill for grinding corn. The prisoner was in our employ at this mill. On the 2d of September I was alarmed by the watchman's rattle, I looked out of the window, the watchman told me he thought there was somebody stealing the poultry, and while I was dressing myself, he came and asked me if I knew any person that lived in such a house, I desired the watchman to wait at the mill to see if any body came there. I live about twenty yards from the mill. I went to the watchman and told him to go his round as usual, and I placed myself here to keep the watch. After I had been watching some time, I saw the prisoner go into the mill. When he came out of the mill, he had nothing with him, he came as far as the little bridge, to see if any body was watching him. He immediately after went into the mill and took something under his arm; he came out of the mill about fifteen yards, upon which I seized him by the collar; he had got barrel heads and hair brooms. I asked him whether he was not satisfied with going once. He said, he had not been home. I interrogated him, and then he said, he had been home, he had taken flour.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these things the property of Mr. Leader and Co. - A. The hair brooms and barrel heads were in our possession, they are worth one and sixpence, or two shillings.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

Full two months she told me that the lower part of the house was over run with rats, and for a fortnight back; she repeatedly requested me to send for poison for them. I sent for it at last.</p>
               <p>Q. What poison was it - A. I wrote for poison, not knowing what I was to have.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you write - A. to Mr. Midgley, in the strand, chemist and druggist. I received the poison; the prisoner took a note and brought back the poison.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the poison - A. I ordered her to put it into the desk, which she did; a few minutes afterwards I put it into the back locker, the division of a large writing-desk. I did not lock it. Soon after that; I told her to settle the parlour and bring up tea. She brought up tea in two teapots. I then gave her some halfpence to fetch some mortar to put over the rat-holes after the poison was put into the holes. I then cut bread and butter for the children, and poured out the tea; my own cup of tea stood till it was quite cold. I then poured out some for the children. It appeared as usual at the time it was at my mouth. I took the cup of tea at one draught, it being cold. As soon as I took the cup away, I found a great heat in my throat, and said, oh! there is pepper in this tea. I sat still for some time, then I poured out a cup of tea; I was going to take it to allay the heat of the throat, I recollected myself, that it was wrong to take that tea, as it might be all alike. The children were taking their tea. I sat still. It run all down me, searching me to the lower part of my stomach. It soon searched round me, and met me at my back bone. I then wished the girl would come in; she was gone for the mortar, she had not returned. I thought I never felt any pepper search me as that did. It then shot into my thighs. I then began to think that the girl sure had not played tricks with the packet of poison. I did not think she had. I looked at the packet; I satisfied myself that it had never been opened. I then sat down: I had not sat many minutes, before one of the children, the last<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190024"/>tea that went down his throat, it flew all over the table.</p>
               <p>Q. How old was that child - A. Five years old. I was angry with the child, and hit him two pats over the head, I thought he had eaten more than his stomach could bear, and I turned him away from the table. I walked across the parlour to get a cloth to wipe up the tea that the child had cast up. I then was seized with a trembling. At the time I was wiping it up, the child brought up more. I was then frightened, and thought it was not an overfilled stomach, and wished the girl would return. The other child was then taken sick in the same way. The girl returned in a few minutes after the second child was taken ill. I then said, Eliza, what have you put into the teapot, my tea tasted as if there was pepper in it, but I never tasted any pepper that searched me like that. She said, nothing, madam, I have not put any thing in. I said, Eliza, tell me the truth, if you have been playing any tricks with the pocket, tell me, I can go to the chemist's in Southampton-street, he will give me something it shall be of no consequence whatever. She said, no, indeed, madam. She still denied it, and said, if you will please to look at the parcel, you will see it is as the gentleman gave me, tied up, I dare say in half a dozen knots. I then said, there is no time to be lost, give me my hat and pelleise, I must go to the gentleman and ask him how the packet was tied where it was bought. I ran as fast as my trembling limbs would let me go. In the middle of Southampton-street I was taken sick, and at the bottom, by the straw shop, I was taken sick again; between that corner, and forty-nine, in the Strand I was taken sick again. I thought I should never be able to get to the shop, I should die, and the children would die.</p>
               <p>Q. You never did examine the pot, did you - A. No, not at any time. I went to Mr. Midgley, Mr. Midgley mixed up medicine for the two children, and went to my house and gave it to one of the children. I went to Mr. Moore, of Great Russel-street; I went to his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you recover - A. A fortnight, all but a day, I recovered myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the girl - A. She calls herself fourteen last February; she has lived in my service a twelve month last May.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any occasion to correct her for misbehaviour - A. She had behaved exceeding well; I never corrected her but for dirt and filth only, I repeatedly corrected her for that.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon before that had you corrected her for dirt and filth - A. I was making her a new gown the day she gave me this. About three days before, I had been angry with her for wearing dirty linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever perceive any rats in the house yourself - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Who put the tea into the teapots - A. I put the tea into the two teapots myself. I gave them to her, she took the two teapots down stairs and put the waser in, and brought it up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you had poison in the house before that - A. Yes, in January before, there were none of it left, not the least in the world; and there was no person in the family that could have gone to the desk but the girl and me.</p>
               <p>MR. MIDGLEY. I am a chemist and druggist in the Strand. On the 16th of August, I received a note from Mrs. Parker, the prisoner brought it; she says, I will be obliged to you to favour me with some more poison to kill the rats, as I am overrun. Upon which I put up a parcel of two ounces of arsenic. The prisoner requested to have more than the usual quantity, as they were dreadfully overrun. I put up two ounces in one parcel, that was all that she had; it was marked on the outside, poison, on the outer paper, and the inside paper, arsenic, poison.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the effect of arsenic as to the human body - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard what the prosecutrix said, was that the operation of arsenic - A. It operates different, according to the quantity. As it operated as an emetic, which is not the effect of poison, it could not poison; her symptons, that she has described, are the effect of metallic poison; it will have that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Arsenic generally makes the tea black - A. I believe it was not Chinese tea; it was a tea of English herbs.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It was British herb tea, I always buy the herbs ready prepared.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Midgley. Did you look at the parcel afterwards - A. I did; it had been opened, it was lesser in quantity, about a quarter of an ounce, I weighed it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Parker. When this girl told you to look at the parcel, you did not look at the parcel, did you - A. I had looked at it before; I was convinced, in my judgment, that it had not been opened, there was not an extra rumple on the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Midgley. You made up the parcel yourself - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it altered - A. The knot was twisted when it was returned by Mrs. Parker; it was tied in my usual way, a double knot, not twisted. When I arrived at Mrs. Parker's, the child Stanley was very sick. I tasted the tea, it had a strong metallic taste, I boiled some arsenic in the same herbs, which I bought of Mr. Butler, the appearance of the tea is not altered by the infusion of arsenic.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Have you any lodgers - A. Yes; they have a place to themselves, they never go into the kitchen, or into my apartments.</p>

I went up to his house to enquire for him, they denied him at first; then, after that, they said, stop, he will be in in a few minutes. I went out and met him in the passage; he asked me to go up to this woman's room, he told me to take the teapot down, he took three shillings out of the tea-pot; he took me out, and made me drunk, he said, he would get me ten guineas of a recruiting serjeant; he would get me to sleep with himself, then I might go where I liked. Then him and I laid down in the bed together, and on my returning down stairs, I found these things which are now there.</p>

               <p>Q.Where were your lodgings - A. In the Weaver's Arms public house. I went up to my bed he came up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190026"/>with a pot of beer; that was between seven and eight o'clock, the day light had not gone out of the sky; that was the first time I lodged there, he lodged there before. He came up with a pot of beer; he said, sailor, will not you drink; I took a hearty drink, and said, here is money to get a pot of beer for yourself; he brought spirits next, I drank a little spirits with him and bid him good night. The woman was with him all the time, they went out of my room then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they shut the door after them - A. I do not know, there were two or three beds in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any people in them - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay them for the liquor - A. I gave them half a crown, I think I gave it to her, they were both together, and they brought me the change; my getting out the half crown was the way they knew I had money; I had nineteen one pound bank notes in my right hand pocket, and in my left pocket I had the silver.</p>
               <p>Had you any thing in your pocket besides - A. I had two duplicates in the same pocket with the notes, the silver was four pound twelve shillings in dollars and half crowns all, only a sixpence and some halfpence in my left hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. After they left you did you go to sleep - A. I doubled my jacket and put it under my pillow, under my head, and went to sleep; I awoke two or three times in the night. When it was quite early, almost day light, I found my jacket was gone and all my money; I had a duplicate of a watch, that was gone; the other duplicate was for a coat and pantaloons, I pawned them together I pawned these things because my ship was not paid before I got my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your property again - A. My witness has the duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you got your money - A. I got it that very evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you much intoxicated when you went to bed - A. No more than I am this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been acquainted with these people before - A. I never saw them before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to get acquainted so soon - A. By her boiling the water for tea, that made the acquaintance. She introduced this man into my company.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 14th of August, I saw the two prisoners at the wine vaults, at the top of Gray's-inn lane, they were in a hackney coach, stopping to have something to drink. Blackman got into the coach and searched it; I was there, he found nothing; the coach went on with them in it. We went after the coach, from some information, Blackman and Mantz got into the coach, and I got on the box, and we drove to the watchhouse. I searched Crouch, I found on him, eight dollars, six half crowns, five shillings in silver, and some halfpence, and these two duplicates; one duplicate is a coat and pantaloons, the other is a watch.</p>

            . We came up to the coach at the wine vaults, the corner of Middle-row, Holborn, they called for something to drink, Blackman knew them, he examined the coach and found nothing; the coach then went away. We went and stopped the coach, I opened the coach door, and took eight one pound notes out of Crouch's hand, he was trying to put them under the seat of the coach; I found a one pound note underneath where the woman had been setting in the coach. I was ordered by the magistrate to give the notes up to the prosecutor.</p>

            . On the 14th, I saw the prisoners come up to the wine vaults at the bottom of Gray's-inn-lane, in a coach, I knew him; I got into the coach to secure the prisoner, hearing that he had been throwing the notes about the street. He knowing me, he chucked the notes out of the coach; I held him by the hand that he should not destroy the notes, Mantz took the notes from Crouch; and at the watchhouse the coach was searched, and Mantz found a one pound note. The next morning there came an information, that this wooden legged man had robbed this sailor. Mantz left a jacket in the coach, we took the number of the coach, and two days afterwards I found that jacket in the same coach. It proved to be the sailor's jacket that lost his money.</p>
               <p>Mantz. I did see a jacket in the coach that belonged to the sailor, we went and got it.</p>

            . I am a constable. Mr. Metham called upon me two or three days before, and wished me to remain in his house while the prisoner went out to his dinner, for him to weigh his work. On the 12th I was there about one o'clock, the prisoner came down from his work with another of his shopmates, I watched him into Long-lane, he there went into a cook's shop. Mr. Metham came after the prisoner, and saw him, he appeared as if he was going back to his work. Mr. Metham took hold of him, told him that he had robbed him. We took him back, and searched him in the parlour; I took some silver out of the prisoner's breeches pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in possession of a quantity of cochineal, and where was it deposited - A. At Mr. Thompson's in Clement's-lane; I had bought it of Mr. Thompson, it remained there upon my credit.</p>
               <p>Q. About the 16th of August had you sold it to any body - A. To Mr. Bennet, of Plumber's-row, Commercial-road. On the 15th I sold it, and on the 16th I was to deliver it to him. On the 16th about a quarter past nine in the morning, I went down to St. Magnus's church to hire a <rs id="t18100919-46-deflabel254" type="occupation">porter</rs>

I am certain the prisoner is the man; he went with me to St. Clement's-lane, Mr. Thompson delivered to me fifty-six pounds of cochineal, the value of it is on hundred pounds sixteen shillings. I then went out of Mr. Thompson's with the prisoner, intending to accompany him; I told him to go to Mr. Bennet's, number 12, Plumber's-row, Commercial-road. I wrote a direction on paper with a pencil, as I should not walk close with him, but keep him in sight. I saw him in Fenchurch-street, by Aldgate pump; there I was stopped by some friends; I was talking with them on some business; when I looked round for the porter, I missed him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue with them - A. Not more than a quarter of an hour. I went directly to Plumber's-row, the goods had not been delivered; I went as fast as I could to Saint Magnus's church, to find the man that he was talking to, and what regiment he belonged to; he was in a soldier's dress. In consequence of information I received there, I obtained a warrant, and went to his house, he resided in a back street near Bunhill-row: we found him there, I knew him immediately, although he had changed his dress and was clean shaved and had his hair cut. I asked him whether he did not recollect me, and whether he did not carry a load for me; he denied it. I have never been able to find the cochineal since.</p>

               <p>JOHN SANKEY PUGH. I am a constable. On the night of the 16th of August I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's house, in New-court. Moor-lane, I found the prisoner at home, Mr. Connop charged him with taking the cochineal, he said he knew nothing of it; Mr. Connop said, he was certain he was the man. Bailey was present, he said, he could swear he was the man which the prosecutor hired. I searched the prisoner's pocket, I found a two pound note, I asked him how he came by it, he said, he had it of his serjeant, he belonged to the London Militia. I searched the woman, on her I found six or seven dollars, three or four half-crowns, and some shillings. I asked her how she came by that silver, she hesitated, he said, you bitch, you took it for your work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any duplicates on them - A. No; there were some things that lay as if they were just taken out of pledge; he said, he had taken them out with his own money.</p>

I asked him how he came by it; he acknowledged he took it out of the warehouse; he said it was for his wife and children; after that he said, that he had taken it for his brother in Germany.

             came into the coffee room and called for a bason of broth, which I gave him, he paid for it the instant he had it. I went to the further end of the coffee room, he got up out of the box, he ate none of the broth: I looked at the bason and saw the spoon gone. I followed him close to the end of Flower-de-luce-court; I put my hand on his shoulder; he asked me what I wanted; I told him the spoon was gone which I gave him with the soup; he said he knew nothing of it; I told him it was an unpleasant circumstance, he had better come back into the box, there was nobody there but him. He took the spoon out of his pocket, I grasped his hand with the spoon in it, and brought him back to the coffee-room. He declared it was his first offence; I was convinced it was not, he had stolen one a fortnight before, from the same box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 5th of June, 1771, I obtained a commission in the forty-seventh regiment by purchase; in 1774 I was in two actions with that regiment. On Bunker's-hill I was in the fortieth regiment, as a lieutenant. I have been wounded at four different times in my body. I have two sons serving my king and country. In consequence of a melancholy family loss which I sustained, my affairs became deranged; I was obliged to have refuge at Saint Martin's workhouse; from thence I was discharged much about the time that man mentions of the capture of the spoon. I was pennyless and friendless; unfortunately for me I did take this spoon; I was starving in every sense of the word. I now submit myself to the mercy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190029"/>of the court, not doubting but that mercy will be blended wish justice. It is the first time I ever was before a court of justice.</p>

Stanton was stopped and taken to the watchhouse, and after being questioned by the officer, he confessed that he had robbed me of my watch, and told where his companion lived.

On the 14th of August the prisoner Stanton was brought into the watchhouse, charged by the prosecutor of having robbed him of his watch; he denied any knowledge of the watch for some time. When I told him I must take him to the Compter, he said, he took the watch out of the gentleman's pocket, that he had given it to Goodear, who had run away with it. He told me Goodear lived with his father in Union-court, Fashion-street, Spitalfields. I went there, and found Goodear; I charged him with the watch; he denied any knowledge of it; I told him I should search the house; then he told me not to make a noise, he would shew me where the watch was. He took me into the privy, there were some boards nailed up to form a cieling, there I found the watch.</p>

On the 29th of August, about nine o'clock in the morning, as I was sitting in the parlour, behind the shop, I heard a square of glass break; I went to the shop window, I perceived one of the squares of glass had been broken, I examined the window, I saw nothing had been taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the window before - A. The same morning. It had been cracked about three or four days before, by an instrument being put against it; it was cracked only in one part of it, no part of the glass was out. At first I missed nothing, I retired a little way behind the partition that separates the shop from the parlour. and in a minute or two the prisoner Toomey put his hand into the hole of the window, that he had made, and took out a ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the ring here - A. No, it was a gold ring, the fellow one to this.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with it - A. I cannot say, he went off; I went to the window and looked into the tray, I found that one was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to see the boy - A. My sister saw the boy as well as myself. I went after him to Scotland-yard, and took him, I am sure it is the same boy; I found the knife upon him, which had upon the point the same putty; it is a bright red putty; I cannot be mistaken. He said, nobody could hurt him; I could not find the ring upon him. I saw him in company with the other boy, Barry, after he had done the act, but not at the time.</p>

After some time, I observed her shuffling her hand underneath her gown, as if she was shuffling something under her gown. When Charington went out the second time, Annesley went after her, we perceived that she had something under her gown; Mr. James went after her, and brought her into the shop; I went out too, and saw six handkerchiefs lying at the door in the shop; I saw that Annesley had something in her hand, I took it out and opened it, it was a piece of an apron, and a shawl wrapped in it; the shawl was Mr. James's property, it cost above two shillings and sixpence.</p>

Yes, it was taken from my bed-room; I went to bed about ten o'clock, I laid it by my side, I missed it before five o'clock in the morning; it has never been found. Sullivan slept in the same room that I did, not in the same bed; he and his comrade got up in the morning before four o'clock. He once told me that he would allow me half-a-crown a week if I would let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him it would be better for him to confess - A. Yes; he never told me what he had done with the watch.</p>

In consequence of that I went and took a look at him. As soon I got to Tower-hill, some men attacked me, who confined my hands and my legs.</p>
               <p>Q. How many - A. that I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners - A. I do not know either of the prisoners. I was confined by a set of ruffians, they held up my head at the same time, in consequence of that, I found I was robbed of my watch, a gold chain, and seal.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the chain hanging out - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you felt your watch before this - A. Before I went to see this bullock, I had felt it within a quarter of an hour of the time I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen it since - A. I have not. I followed the persons across Tower-hill, some lads came up, and observed to me, that I had lost my watch, they knew the parties well. They shewed me the parties at the corner of St. Catharine's. I was knocked down, and they repeated the blows at the back of my head; I was senseless. They took me into a house, they desired me to go home, they were a desperate party, they said.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, I live in Moor-lane. O the 4th of July I was out, I saw a bullock and people following him; I saw the prosecutor on Tower-hill, by some railings; there were some people about him; I did not exactly see what they were about; I saw a man come from the crowd with a watch in his hand; his name is Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue in your sight - A. Not long; he gave the watch to another person; I perceived it was a silver watch and a yellow chain; I went to Mr. Jones to show him the man that had the watch last. I saw no more of Williams till he was taken into custody, Mr. Jones followed me, I shewed him the man that had the watch; I watched to see where they went, Fidgeon came out of the house and said d - n your eyes, what do you tell lies of me for, and hit me over the head. Williams had a butcher's mixture jacket on, and a white hat, at the the time I saw him, and when I saw him in custody, between six and seven o'clock, he had his jacket and white hat on.</p>
               <p>MOSES ISAACS. I live with Mrs. Parsons, Shoemaker-row. I was out on the 24th of July, I saw the prosecutor at the corner of a street in Tower-hill. I did not notice what he was doing; I saw a mob of people about Mr. Jones, about thirty; I saw one of them coming away with a chain hanging down his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you judge whether the watch was in his pocket or in his hand - A. In his pocket, with the chain hanging out, so that any body might see it; he ran when he had the chain hanging out.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had the chain hanging out of his pocket were there any seals to the chain or not - A. There were; I did not take notice how many; I am sure there was one, I cannot say whether there was more than one or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who was the man that was running - A. No, I only saw his back; he had a brown great coat on, it was not either of the prisoners, he ran towards the warehouses on Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners - A. No, not till I came into St. Catharine's-lane, and there I saw the two prisoners with a bull, Mr. Jones went to lay hold of another man; Williams struck him over the head with a stick, he was knocked down; Williams was dressed in a white hat. After the bullock was in the slaughter-house, I met Mr. Jones; we went into a public house.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, New-court, Aldgate; I am no trade, I do any thing for a living. On the 4th of July I was on Tower-hill, I saw Mr. Jones standing against the iron railing of King-street, he was standing still, the people with the bull were about six or seven yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were there following of the bull - A. Perhaps twenty-four or twenty-five, they were going towards Mr. Jones and passed him, they were fourteen or sixteen that stopped and surrounded him, Williams was one of them, he was dressed in a butcher's mixture jacket and a white hat. I saw some man put his hand to Jones's small cloaths, but to swear that it was the prisoner, I will not. I saw Williams come from the crowd with a gold or metal chain, and one or two seals, but a watch I did not see. Williams ran on following the bullock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what he did with the chain, and what he had in his hand - A. I saw him deliver it over to a tall man, dressed in a dark brown great coat. Then the bullock went on towards St. Catharine's-lane, Mr. Jones followed the mob, to try to get one of the prisoners whom he thought had robbed him, and when they came near the Black Boy, St. Catharine's, Fidgeon said, here comes the gentleman that you robbed, or drawed the thimble, or some such words like it. Then three or four turned back with sticks in their hands, Jones stood at the door of the Black Boy, which was open, they struck him, he fell backwards into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Fidgeon among the crowd on Tower-hill - A. Ye, I did; he was in the mob with them that surrounded Jones. They left the bullock at Mr. Smalls. I went into the public house with Mr. Jones, he desired us to give him our direction. After they had left the bullock, Fidgeon came to

               <p>Q. How did you find this woman - A. The woman was laying upon the bed, he took the woman up and looked at the wound, and said it was a terrible cut; I saw that her throat was cut. The two watchmen had quitted the room; I said, where are the watchmen. I went to find the watchmen; they were gone in search of the prisoner, I went after them, I met the watchmen going down Mutton-hill, with the prisoner, they were taking him to New Prison, Clerkenwell, I went with them. I heard the prisoner say, when he got to the prison door, he hoped she might be dead in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she able to speak at that time - A. No. There was a great deal of blood upon the bed. I sent Watkins for the docter. I looked all over the room to see if I could find any instrument that it was done with, I could not find it: I came down stairs, and looked if I could find it upon the stairs, I could not; I went up stairs again, I could not find it; I came down stairs and held my light up, I looked the other way to see if I could see it in the passage that leads into Saffron-hill; I saw something moving up and down upon the steps in Saffron-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that near No. 5 - A. Yes, within five yards of the door that comes out into his passage, I directly held my lanthorn up, it moved from me, I pursued it, I saw it was a man; I sprang my rattle and holloaed out stop him. A man coming up Saffron-hill stopped him, his name is Cootes, he knocked him down; my brother watchman catched him by the collar, as he was on the ground; I said to the prisoner, how could you do such a rash act as you have done; he said, what I have done I shall be happy if she is a dead woman, and I shall die a happy men. I took him to the watchhouse, he said the same there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I suppose you were a stranger to the parties before you were called there - A. I was no acquaintance of theirs.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, on this Tuesday evening, hear the cry of murder - A. Just as I was going the hour of half after twelve, I heard the cry of murder; I went directly down Union-street, and just as I was turning, Watkin's said, it is murder in Onslow-street. I went to No. 5, Onslow-street, with Watkins and Winterburn, I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you find in the room - A. The brother of the prisoner, and the brother's wife; there was no light there, I begged my partner to give me a light; I lit my lanthorn, I saw, then, blood all over the bed, and the woman lying with her throat cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that woman was - A. They called her the prisoner's wife, the brother and sister both said it was his wife. The prisoner was not there then.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known this woman before - A. I saw her two or three nights before, they had two or three words before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear their names - A. I heard their names were Griffin. When I was there three nights before they had words; he said it was his wife, and the landlady below said it was his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon seeing her upon the bed what did you do - A. I went down stairs and went in search of the prisoner, I went into Castle-street and just as I turned into Onslow-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190033"/>again, my partner's rattle sprang, I saw the prisoner running, and Cootes after him; he hit him on the side of the head and the prisoner fell down; I catched him by the collar and took him to the watchhouse; on our coming up Saffron-hill, he said, he hoped she would be dead; he said the same at the watchhouse; from there we took him to prison, then he said, he hoped she was dead, or would be dead when we got back.</p>
               <p>- FAULKENER. I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner's lodgings, No. 5, Onslow-street - A. I did, in company with Mr. Skinner, the doctor. When we got there, I saw the woman lying on the bed with her throat cut; she was setting up on the bed when I went in, she was held up by two men, whom I did not know; the doctor ordered that she should be laid down; he examined the wound and said he could do nothing for her, that she must be taken to the hospital as soon as possible; she was then held up by me and another; I asked her who it was that had done it.</p>
               <p>Q. She was then in a dying state was she - A. Yes; the doctor said he was certain that she could not make me any answer, she could not speak. I then asked her if her husband had done it, she nodded her head twice; I asked her if she was sure that her husband had done it, she nodded her head twice again; I asked her what it was done with, she pointed with her left hand towards the foot of the bed; and turning over the bed, between the cording of the bed I observed the razor lying on the floor; in the manner that I hold it was open; there is some blood on it now, and there was some blood on it then, and there is the name of Griffin on the handle of the razor. I requested a man that was standing at the foot of the bed to pick it up, he did, and gave it to me. I held the razor up to the woman's face; I said, mistress, was it done with this, she nodded her head twice; I asked her again if she was sure that her husband had done it, when I had the razor in my hand, she nodded her head; I asked her if she was sure that she did not do it herself, and she shook her head; I asked if he was her husband, she nodded her head; I asked her no further questions. She appeared to be sensible for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards; before we moved her she endeavoured to speak to the brothers wife, but could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the brother's wife there all the time - A. All the time I was there, and the brother was in the room with me, and the doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you assist to carry her to the hospital - A. I did; she died between there and Holborn-bridge, in the city of London, in the parish of St. Andrew's.</p>
               <p>Had you known the prisoner before - A. I am not positive whether I had seen either of them or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her name mentioned - A. I did not, while I was there. The brother's wife accompanied us to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The prisoner was not present at the time that you put these interogatories to the deceased - A. No, I did not see him untill the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SKINNER, Q. You are an apothecary - A. Yes; I was sent for to the poor woman; when I came there I examined the wound, I found there was a compleat separation of the wind pipe, and the wound being so extensive in depth and breadth, I could render no assistance whatever; it was evidently mortal, and she was then sinking very fast for want of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the cause of her death - A. Yes. I desired her to be taken to the hospital; I thought it was better for her to die any where else, than in the filthy room where she was then lying. She smelled very strong of liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before - A. Yes; I attended her five or six months before, of a uterine hemourage; I knew her name was Griffin, that was all, that she was the wife of Griffin. When I was called at that time, she was very much in liquor, and the room smelled so much, that my mouth was full of water; and she smelled very much of liquor this time.</p>

             there - A. He was not, I saw a great deal of blood upon the bed, I desired them to lift her up; I then asked if any doctor was sent for, they told me there was; the surgeon came while I was there; I then took the candle and searched for the instrument, and just at that time there was a cry, that the man had gone up Hatton-garden, then I quitted the room, and went in pursuit of the man, I found him in the watch-house in Hatton-garden. I asked him if he had not done a pretty thing; he said, he had, but do no talk to me here, I shall be talked to in another place; he did not say what the job was. I searched him and found nothing upon him; I looked at his hands to see whether they were bloody or not, they were not, I then took him to the New Prison, going along, he told me that she had been out all the night before, and him, his brother and his wife, had been in search of her, he met her in the gin shop, at the corner of Charter-house-lane, they went in and had some gin together; and they went to another house and had four or five pots of beer, it grew late and they came home, then we had got near on to Clerkenwell-green. As I was going to take him to the New Prison, he said d - n it, Cook, you know me very well, let us go and have something to drink; I told him we could not have any thing at that time of night; he said, Yes; I declined having any thing. I then, going along, told him it was a bad job for him; he said, he hoped she was dead, he would not mind being hanged, as to-morrow, for he should die a happy man, he said, how should I like another man to go along with my wife; I said, not at all; he said, that is the reason I done it; he said, she had been out all night, he had been looking for her all night, and part of the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not tell you that she had been with a man all night, and that she told him he would give him a good wapping - A. I think I recollect his saying, that she told him, that one Jem would give him a good wapping, she had been out all night, I do not recollect any further.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. What is become of the sister - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the deceased, the prisoner's wife - A. Yes; the prisoner called her Nance; I had some business to do for them about five months before, I had a warrant to serve for the man and woman, and he called her Nance four or five times.</p>

               <p>Q. How long before you reached the corner of St. Paul's-church-yard had you reason to be certain that you had these notes - A. I had them in my pantaloons pocket when I came into St. Paul's-church-yard, I had a one pound note and two twenty pound notes. At the corner of St. Paul's-church-yard the prisoner came to me and hugged me round the waist, and pressed me to go with her, she was alone, I told her to go about her business, I had not a wish to go with her, after which, I said, where do you live, I insist upon your going about your business. She then said, I am unwell, she would not go with me, and then left me; she left me before I perceived I had lost the notes. When I got upon Ludgate-hill, I put my hand to my pocket, to see whether I had the notes, and my pocket was inside out.</p>
               <p>Q. After this woman left you had you been accosted by any other woman - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of an evening was this, light or dark - A. It was dark; but there were lamps where she stood. I looked her in the face, I am sure it is the woman; afterwards I went to Charing-cross and made my loss known. I saw her again on the 17th in custody; I was sure that she was the woman that accosted me in this way. The bank sent to me, informing me that they had stopped the twenty pound notes. I only know that I had two twenty pound notes in my pocket that I had of Mr. Read. I have one twenty pound note, the other is at the bank, I could not trace it.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you receive that of Mr. Read - A. On the 8th of August, about four or five hours before I lost it.</p>

               <p>- JOYCE. Q. Did you go with Mr. Sparkes, to the prisoner's lodgings on the morning of the 27th of July - A. Yes I did; not finding him at home, I went again at eight o'clock in the evening he was not at home; I went again about ten minutes to nine, he was then come in; I asked him how he did, he said he was much better he had been ill some time; I told him I was glad of it, I sat down, I told him he was wanted at Mr. Parkins's that evening he wished to know what was the matter; I told him I did not know, he wanted to know if it would do in the morning, I told him no, I must go myself if he did not go with me, he directly said, if I would stop a bit he would go with me, he walked directly out of the room into the passage, and I got up from my seat to the door in the passage, he had slippers or shoes on at that time, he put on his boots and returned to me in the room, I suppose it was not two minutes at least; I asked him if he was ready, he told me he was, he came out and immediately laid hold of my arm, and walked with me to Mr. Parkins's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in the course of your way acquaint him with the business - A. That would have been impossible, I did not know it myself; I asked him questions deviating from what I thought it was. When he was brought to Mr. Parkins, he was not at home; Mr. Sparkes came in. In a few minutes I saw a letter taken out of his coat pocket, my initials are to it, I have no doubt that is the letter. Mr. Sparkes asked the prisoner where he got that letter, to the best of my recollection he said, he did not know how he came by it. After Mr. Parkins came home, I heard him acknowledge that he had stolen it; I remember hearing him say he was there; I do not remember any more he said, he acknowledged that he had been guilty of stealing it; he acknowledged his guilt, what words he made use of I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I take it for granted as you walked together to Mr. Parkins, you told him he had better tell you all he knew, and you would endeavour to serve him - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when he came to Mr. Parkins's office, the clerk was to take in writing what he said, the same as if he was a Justice of Peace; was there any Justice of the Peace present - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. So then there was no friend of the prisoner there; an examination of the prisoner takes place and it is taken down in writing, both the interrogatories and answers, did you attend to take in writing what the prisoner said - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Sparkes did - A. I believe so, I expected so.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that writing - A. I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you have been stating against the prisoner was taken down by Mr. Parkins or by Mr. Sparkes - A. I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he at first deny all knowledge of the letter when Mr. Sparkes was interrogating him - A. He certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or any body else say any thing to get him to alter the declaration that he first made - A. Nothing was said to him whatever to induce him to make a different declaration.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH BONNER. Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever accompany him to buy any linen - A. Yes; on the day after he left the office to the best of my recollection he laid out five-pound, and some odd money, he paid it in a note and some odd shillings, he brought a trunk home in a coach, I think that is the trunk.</p>

On the 27th of August, a little after three, as I was coming from one coffee room to the other, I saw the prisoner at the stairs with a bundle under her arm, she went from the stairs to the private door and walked away. From information I followed her, and stopped her about twenty yards from the house, she said, she had been sent by a woman to fetch the things to wash. I brought her back and the bundle with her.</p>

She went out and came in again, and said, I might go; when I had put part of my clothes on, I found two one pound notes on the bed. I examined my pocket book, and missed seven one pound notes, and a two pound note; I called the watchman, he came and searched, he found nothing on the prisoner or in the room.</p>

While I was there I had occasion to take out my pocket book to pay for a watch, I had in it property in bank notes, to near the amount of one hundred and forty pound. The prisoner was sitting before me, he had an opportunity of seeing the notes.</p>

I had a pint of porter to drink, and a sixpenny worth to drink while I was there, exclusive of some wine and water the prisoner pressed me to drink.

In the course of a minute I found somebody over me, endeavouring to take my book away, I holloaed out, murder, two or three times; the book was taken away, and they snatched at my watch chain; in snatching the chain they dragged the button off, but fortunately, I caught hold of my chain; there were two or three over me. I heard the prisoner over me, he said Nash.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure it was the prisoner's voice - A. I am certain of it, I have heard his voice a score of times; they separated and got away. Immediately I got up I saw the prisoner before me; I endeavoured to lay hold of him, I could not; he escaped for that night. He was taken the next day at the same public house, and directly I saw him, I said, there is one of the d - nd thieves that robbed me; the prisoner seemed to be alarmed, endeavoured to make his escape by throwing the table over, and applied to the poker; he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you never recovered any of your property - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. You had known the prisoner before, you had no difficulty in knowing his person, as well as his voice - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You said so at all the examinations, before all the magistrates; there is one of the magistrates here - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you knew him before Mr. Birnie - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>R. BIRNIE, ESQ. Q. I believe you were one of the magistrates acting on this occasion - A. The only one; this is the examination taking by me, I had the prisoner up three times.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. How many examinations did you attend before the magistrate - A. Three, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. In all the examinations before the magistrate, you had just so much certainty of the prisoner as you have now - A. Certainly, I had, I never before the magistrate entertained a doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the servant maid of the house to give evidence to day - A. I believe she is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any application to her on the subject of this robbery - A. Certainly not, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did she tell you that she would tell no untruth about it - A. No such conversation.</p>

In the morning, soon after sun rising, I went to the stack, I missed three, there remained fifteen. I had information at one o'clock that there were two in Porter's garden, I went there it was removed, there were the marks of hay having been there; I went to the prisoner's premises, where I saw two trusses of hay on the barrow, he lives in Michael-row, Brompton about a mile from our premises, he is a milkman, and keeps four or five cows. The officer asked the prisoner how he came by this hay, he said he bought it and paid for it.</p>

At the time we have just mentioned, I was sitting in a room having my tea, the door and the whole front of that room is glass, I saw the door that goes into Freeman's-court,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190042"/>open; I have a front door that opens into Cheapside, and another door that goes into Freeman's-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, with certainty, that that door was closed - A. I am not clear that it was not closed, I am not certain, no one made their appearance; I have not the smallest doubt that the door was closed.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any body come in - A. No one: I went forward into the shop expecting some one coming in; I went on the threshold of the door, looked up the court, to the right and to the left, and saw nobody that was likely to be coming in, I then shut too the door and returned into the room again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you closed the door again - A. That I am sure of, and then I returned to the room where I had been drinking my tea, and just as I sat down, I saw a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at all tell whether he came in at the front door, or the side door - A. I am certain that he came in at the side door, in Freeman's-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that side door locked - A. No. The counter is exceeding long, from the position I saw him in, I am quite certain that he must have come in at the side door, between the time of my going into the room and drinking a cup of tea. When I saw him, he was in the act of taking something off my board, where I have a number of watches laying on the spot towards which part I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive that your side door was open from the manner in which he stood - A. I have no doubt it was; I called my servant down stairs and advanced to the shop.</p>

             was the man. I immediately went into the street, I looked into the court and saw the man just turn the corner of the court into Cheapside, the door is close to Cheapside, and Cheapside was very thin of people, there were no more than three people near; I immediately ran up to him, caught hold of his left arm, told him he must go back with me immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you had left your shop could you perceive whether any of your watches or watch cases had been taken - A. No, I had not time, I did not know whether I had lost any thing or not. He turned round with me to go back, according to my desire; I thought I discovered a wish for him to get his right hand round to his pocket; I was very watchful of that and kept him forward with my right hand, I had hold of his left hand, I thought he wanted to get rid of something; at that instant, another man joined him, which is

It passed quickly on to the other, but it appeared to me to be a watch; I then laid hold of the old man, and kept hold of both, I seized him by the collar, I had hold of the other by the arm. They struggled violently, I was afraid that I might loose one or both. I called out stop thief, some people closed in against me in the front, I then dragged them into the first door that was open, Messrs. Townshend and Simpson's shop, two doors from my own, and through a small passage, I took them into the warehouse, there they were secured. They dropped the watch and a pair of cases in the passage; I saw some, thing in the set of falling while they were in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them say any thing at the time they were secured - A. No; I told the persons round me under what charge, and for what reason, I had taking them, they neither of them said any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. After the watch and cases were picked up, did you know them to be yours - A. I knew them to be mine in the place where they were dropped, I had no doubt of it, both the watch and the cases.</p>
               <p>Q. After they were secured, on going back to your shop, did you perceive there was a watch and a pair of cases missing, which you had when you were at tea - A.Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What watch was it - A. A metal watch; one left with me for a glass to be put in, it belonged to a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the worth of that - A. Twenty shillings. The watch cases, they were also a customer's, they had been gilded, and had not been taken out of the paper; the cases were worth ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of these prisoners known to you before - A. No, I never saw them, to my knowledge, before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say it was between five and six o'clock when this robbery was committed upon you, perhaps you observed them through the mirror - A. I have no mirror in my shop; I saw the person in my shop, and when, I went into the street, from the figure of the man, and the colour of his coat, altogether, I knew him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you hang the watches up that do not belong to yourself - A. They were laying on the counter the cases were wrapped up in paper, the watch was laying without glass.</p>
               <p>Q. If the cases were wrapped up in paper, I want to know how you could see the cases - A. It is tishy paper, I could see the yellow cases through the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took hold of Day the other prisoner was not present - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the people came about, it excited their curiosity - A. No; I had only hold of his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the old gentleman at your shop - A. I did not. After I took hold of Day, I thought there seemed to be a wish to get at his pocket, I kept him forward; the old man presented himself all in a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoners were taken into your neighbour's shop, there was nothing found upon them - A. The property was dropped in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you put too the door - A. I am quite sure; I supposed the wind might open it the first time, seeing nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. If you supposed the wind opened it one time, the wind might open it another time - A. I am quite sure the door was shut the second time, because I shut it close too the second time, and tried it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at tea, you are not sure that you saw either of the prisoners there - A. I am sure I saw a man, I am perfectly sure that the mans features that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190043"/>I saw in the shop, was the man in the street.</p>

            . I am a constable; I was sent for to take charge of the two prisoners. I have a watch and a pair of cases.</p>
               <p>Q. Who delivered you that watch and cases - A. As soon as I went into the house I saw the two prisoners, I knew them before; I said, I know these men before; the gentleman said, they have been into my shop and robbed me of my watch and cases; they had opened his door and took them out. I took them down to the counter; Mr. Anness gave me the watch and cases, I have kept there ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is the watch that was on my counter, I have no doubt of it, and these are the cases, I have the watch belonging to the cases.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you can have no doubt, but that watch and cases were those that lay on your counter just before - A. No.</p>
               <p>North's Defence. I had been carrying a box to the Castle, in Wood-street; I went up inadvertently, and said, what is the matter; as to me, I know nothing about it all; he laid hold of me and took me into the warehouse; he was there a great while before the constable came to search us, and then the watch and case were handed over to Mr. Anness.</p>
               <p>Day's Defence. When this property was picked up it was about a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Immediately I took them in the passage, I stamped upon the watch; a gentleman's servant gave me the watch.</p>

On the 13th of September, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner, with another man, came into my shop, the prisoner brought in a new pair of trowsers and tried them on, they were not mine. I asked him the reason of his coming into my shop to try on trowsers, why did not they try them where they purchased them, and not to take up our time; seeing me offended, he seemed to make an offer to sell his other trowsers; I told him, I did not want to buy any thing, to make haste out of the shop. I then ordered the lad to go on with his work, in getting the goods out of the door, I was assisting; I then got outside of the shop, when I perceived the goods, which hanged on the top rail of the window, pulled over off the rail, altogether. I ran into the shop, and said, was it not sufficient for you to come in and take up our time, without robbing us, come make haste, get out of the house, not knowing at that time, that he had got any of my property with them, we shoved them out. When they had got out into the pavement, my youth observed he had a pair of velveteen breeches under his coat; I looked, and saw a deficiency of a pair of velveteen breeches; I followed him, and found him in Mr. Baron's shop, he put the breeches on in their shop, under the trowsers, I pulled the trowsers up and saw they were my breeches, he has torn the mark off, I knew them to be mine. He was taken to Lambeth-street office and searched, the handkerchief was found upon him, I saw it taken out of his side pocket, I am positive it is my handkerchief. When I charged him with stealing the breeches, the prisoner said I pushed him out of the shop with the breeches; when I pushed him out, I did not know he had these breeches.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they go out of the shop of their own accord - A. No, they were shoved out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them while they were in the shop take and thing - A. No; as they were going out of the shop, I saw a pair of velveteen breeches on the prisoner's arm, part inside of his jacket, and part out; I informed my master, he examined his stock and missed a pair. We pursued the prisoner. I know the breeches to be my master's property, and the handkerchief likewise.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was shoved out of doors I had no small clothes on, and when they brought my clothes out of doors, they brought them breeches with them. I was in liquor the night before, I did not know where I was.</p>

            . I was serving in my master's shop, on the 8th of September, the prisoner came in, asked me what I could have a gold seal for; I told him about a guinea and a half; he asked me if it would make any difference, if he paid part of the money then, and paid the rest when he called for the seal; I told him no. I shewed him some, he took up two seals, the one which he had in his finger and thumb, he laid down, and the other he held in his hand, concealed under his little finger, he directly shifted his hand from the tray, along the glass case. I had a seal in my hand which I told him the price was twenty eight shillings, I put it along the counter, to his hand in which he had got the seal, to see whether he would take it in that hand in which he had the seal concealed; I pressed him very strongly to take hold of it, saying it was a very strong seal, and wished him to examine it; he directly shifted his hand off the glass case into his right hand breeches pocket, with the seal in his hand. I directly laid down the seal which I had in my hand, and took hold of him across the counter, by his collar; I asked him to deliver up the seal which he had in his hand, in his pocket; he immediately drew it out of his pocket, and gave it into my hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190044"/>I still held his collar; he begged my pardon, and said, he did not intend to steal the seal; I told him I should call my master. I rung the bell and called my master.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the worth of that seal that he had put into his pocket - A. Thirty shillings.</p>

Somewhere about midsummer, he came into my master's yard with a bridle and saddle; he asked me would I buy them; I told him I did not want to buy them for my own use; if I bought it, I should want to turn a few shillings by it. I asked him where he got it; he told me he drove farmer White's team at Shipston; his master had sold the poney, and told him to sell the bridle and saddle.

            . I am a Clerk to Mr. Clement, the Solicitor. On the 8th of June I took the prisoner these papers. I paid him six pounds six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did the prisoner ever account to you for the six guineas - A. He did not; he received the fee on the Friday, and left me on the Saturday, I did not see him until he was apprehended about five weeks afterwards. At the time he left my service there was about a guinea and a few shillings due to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner in the habit of receiving fees, and to balance the fees against his salary. - A. When there was a balance of salary due to him, I let the fee remain in his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I received Mr. Clement's money there was Clerk's fees and salary due to me. I left Mr. Humphreys for fear of being arrested.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time that he left your service, how much money was due to him - A. A guinea and eight or nine shillings, he never told me that he was in embarrassed circumstances, he had no claim upon me for fees.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of August last, had you purchased any wine of your wine merchant - A. I had given orders for ten pipes of port wine to be delivered on the 16th of August, the ninth pipe was delivered, the cellarman bottled it and lackered it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who stacked it - A. Hughes, the cellarman of Messrs. Gray and Burcham, wine merchants. In consequence of information that the prisoner had been tipsey, I went into the prisoners room, I found a number of lacquered corks laying about, all of which seemed to be drawn with cork screws; I found a bottle of port wine in his room in the grate with a lacquered cork. I challenged him with having secreted it, he denied it; I searched further and found in a drawer that he used in his room another bottle of port wine, under the bed I found eighteen bottles of port wine, and nine more under the side of the bed. He then confessed that he had taken them, and hoped I would be merciful; I then desired to have his box searched, his box was locked, he refused opening it, upon which I told him if he did not, I should send him to the watch-house, lock up the room, and obtain a warrant, in consequence of that he opened the box, I found four bottles of Madeira wine, similar in flavour to that which I have, which I believe to be my own, I found a pocket-handkerchief belonging to me, and one to Lady Charlotte, one I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this you ordered two of your servants to set up with him that night - A. I did, and from information of others I saw more bottles.</p>

About four o'clock in the afternoon, the waterman that attends the ship brought the prisoner on board, he introduced him into the pantry, and asked me whether I would give him a glass of grog; I told him, by all means; I told him to help the prisoner, as I was busy. He helped the man; the man drank a glass of grog, and he had some beef and bread; he sat himself down upon a chest adjoining my chest; I was going to and fro; I had occasion to go to my chest, this money was laying at the top, ready for me to give it to one Mr. Moel, to bring it up to London for me. Two boys came down and wanted to have a pair of trowsers, I took out the money and laid it on the chest to get out a pair of stockings and the trowsers; the prisoner said, aye, there is cash there. It did not strike me. I then put the money back and shut the chest, I did not lock it; it was tied up in a cotton nightcap. Soon after I was called up into the cabin to get some water; I went upon deck to the drip-stone, there was no water, and I was absent about half an hour, during that time I cannot say whether he was left alone in the pantry or not; Mr. Johnson, Mr. Moel, and the waterman were in the pantry. Every one quitted the ship about dark, and when I went to my chest, intending to pack the money up, the money was gone. I had no suspicion of any but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never found your money - A. No; he sold the coin in Leadenhall-street. He confessed that he had done the depredation; he hoped I would shew him lenity.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL BOND. I am a waterman, I was employed by this ship. I am sure that the prisoner is the person I took on board, and introduced to the steward of the ship; I know nothing about the taking of the money, I was not in the pantry at the time.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on Tower-hill; I then went to his lodgings; in searching him, I found in his breeches pocket this leather purse, in it were found four dollars, three half crowns, and two shillings; in his side pocket I found a book containing twenty-nine one pound notes. I asked him who it belonged to; he said, to his wife, she was deranged in her mind. After I had counted part of them over, I said, how many notes should there be; he told me twenty nine. You say they belong to your wife; he said, no, I said no such thing, they belong to my mistress, I am foreman to Mrs. Hunter, stonemason in London-wall, she gave it me to pay the journeymen their wages. I then took him to the office. On the Monday the prisoner said he had robbed him, he hoped he would shew him as much mercy as he could. The silversmith and his young man came to the office on the Monday, and could not identify him.</p>

On the first of August I went to Charing-cross for the purpose of apprehending pickpockets; I saw the two prisoners in company with another, I followed them into the crowd, they were following Mr. Jackson; after he had been in the crowd five minutes, the three persons surrounded him, they were all standing as close at they could behind him; I saw Lee make several attempts to take his pocketbook out; I saw Mr. Jackson put his hand to his pocket; after some time he took his hand away to move his hat, at the same time a coach came alongside of the pillory, to take the men out, Lee took hold of the pocketbook, I laid hold of him by the collar, and with the other hand I took hold of the book; the next witness was in company with me at the time, I desired him to lay hold of Chinnery;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190048"/>the other made off, before Lee drawed the pocketbook out of his pocket, Chinnery looked round at me, then I looked off; he then gave the other a touch of the arm, as much as to say, take it now. I knew their persons all three.</p>

            . I was in company with Humphreys, I saw Chinnery and Lee in company, close to Mr. Jackson; Chinnery spoke to Lee, and Lee pointed down to Mr. Jackson's pocket; what he said, I cannot say; he had got his hand in his left pocket; just after that, a coach came up, Mr. Jackson moved rather to the right, Lee took the pocketbook at the time, Humphreys took hold of Lee, I took hold of Chinnery immediately; there was a third person in company with them. Humphreys picked up the pocketbook.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Gentlemen of the jury, It is my humble hope and trust, knowing that I am come before a jury of my countrymen, to offer these few observations; although they may appear foreign to the charge, yet they are inseperably connected with the groundwork of my conduct. Gentlemen, I am unfortunately deserted and persecuted, and the persons I mean to ailude to are the appointed guardians to my wife and family. In their views they are fulfilling the voice of a dying parent, in persecuting the children. My brother was sent on board a ship at the Nore. I am the husband of the eldest child. I have been insulted by them in the grossest manner, and by them treated with indignation; our quarterly salary was diminished; not having it in my power to have redress from the law, I threatened them with manual punishment. I was plunged into a prison fourteen weeks by their power. I began to think I was to be sent after my unfortunate brother, and the only thing left for me to do, they told me, was by signing a certain deed to our disadvantage. I refused to do it, and at the same time I got bail; I absconded, and was a prey to the greatest distress. This was my fatal epoch; I was unable to appear in public, I was friendless and deserted; my infant son and dying wife made me do acts of the greatest dishonour; nothing but the most imperious necessity prompted me to act as I have done. I have a letter from the honourable Mr. Wilbeiforce, Member of Parliament, I beg leave to forward it to your Lordship, that you may be satisfied.</p>

On the 28th of July, about seven o'clock in the morning, from information, I ran out of the shop and found this coat and waistcoat upon this woman; it is my property. When I overtook the prisoner, she said, she had nothing upon her; I told her I must get a constable and get her searched; I took the coat from her, and she dropped the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the coat and waistcoat. I never was in the shop, nor do I know where the shop is.</p>

               <p>"Honoured Master - I hope you will not advertise me, or mention the circumstance to my relations; I have been one of the greatest villains to you; I was young and inexperienced to Mr. Bates, he is an old man, and should not have betrayed a boy to commit such a crime; he said, he would tell me how I might steal the boots from you, and to mark the name of any person in the shop that took the work in, and he would give me sixteen shillings a pair for them; he said he would send them off for Bombay, he told me that he sent them off to a captain. I am now assured you can hang me for forging the name of the men in the shop. I hope you will forgive me for the sake of my poor aunt. May God protect you, is the prayer of the wretched</p>
               <p>"Sebastin Pullen."</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I received this letter after I had desired Owen, one of my men to go to Pullen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, after you had received this letter, go to the house of Bates with

             - A. I did, to number ninety-five, Bartholomew Close; he is a shoemaker, and keeps an open shop there. Leadbetter searched his shop in my presence: the prisoner was not within; Leadbetter opened a cupboard in the shop and found thirteen pair of boots, twelve pair of them were in an unfinished state. I swear, to the best of my judgment, the twelve pair of unfinished boots were my property. Bates then came in the shop; Leadbetter addressed him, he said, that he had got a warrant to search the house, he had found them boots, he wanted to know how he could account for them. Bates replied, that he bought them of Mr. King, that he could produce the bill and receipt. He took the file where he usually filed his bills, and sorted them over for about ten minutes; the officer seemed impatient, seeing he could not find it, said, he must come along with him. He was taken away. In four or five of these boots are my marks, and the others have the appearance of the marks having been rubbed out; I place the number in the back of the boot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Your usual method of doing business is this, that you or your, clickers deliver out the materials to Pullen, and he is to bring back these materials to you made up into boots - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How many clickers - A. I have three that are in the habit of doing that.</p>
               <p>Q. You have three clickers, and the duty of the clickers is this, he delivers out the materials to the maker, the maker brings the work home and receives from your clickers a shop-bill, which is an acknowledgment of his bringing home the work that he had taken out - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the production of that shop-bill to you, you or a clicker pay him for his work - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore what is here conveyed in the letter, by marking the initials of your shopmen, is imputing this sort of fraud, instead of bringing home the work that he should have obtained from your shopman, a shop-bill, purporting that the work was brought home; that you understand by that - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the fraud is a double fraud to you, you pay for the work, and do not get back the boots - A. That is the case.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you have given out the leather for the making, and the boots are not brought back to you, and yet you have paid for the making - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These marks that you speak of are made upon the leather before it goes out to be made - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the crime which you impute to Pullen, instead of bringing the boots home to you, he obtained from you the money for making - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were never in your possession in the shape of boots. You have charged him with having taken these boots from you; they were only boots in the shape of legs and soles - A. No other way.</p>
               <p>Q. The finishing is only the blacking and polishing; afterwards did you find any last at Bates's - A. I took five, but I thought one of them did not belong to me; I found them in the shop with the numbers rasped out from the usual place where I number them.</p>

Mr. Limebeer took out six lasts from the rails, five of them he thought were his, and one was not.</p>

When she came back into the shop, I told her I was informed she had secreted a shawl, or shawls. When she was in the shop she denied it, and threw off her cloak, and appeared in great distress, and ran behind the counter.

               <p>Q. Where did that returned post-chaise take you to - A. It took me to the Bull's Head, I went there to get lodgings, I could not get them; my wife was with me at the time. We went from the Bull's Head to the Barley Mow, Long-lane, for the same purpose. The postboy left me there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply there for a bed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get one - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know him - A. I know him perfectly well; I took the right cuff off his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him there - A. Yes; I treated him with some drink; he said he would get me a bed; we were in company there a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you change any piece of money there - A. A seven-shilling-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see that - A. He did; I paid for the liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had been there a quarter of an hour did you go out together - A. Yes; my wife and he went with me, we went down the lane a good piece, he said, there is a house I can get lodgings; he said to my wife, stand there, of that side, if I do not get lodgings in that house, I will get lodgings in another. I went with him, and he walked close by my side; my wife staid behind.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was that - A. I could not tell then. When he got me outside he got hold of me by the throat; he put his hand into my trowsers pocket, and took all my money out of my pocket, some of it fell on the ground. Upon this I catched hold of the right hand cuff of his coat; it tore off, I threw it away, I never saw it any more. I tried to lay hold of him the second time, and had like to have fell on him; if I could have held him I would not have let him go until I had beat him all over blue. I had nineteen shillings odd, a five-shilling piece, two halfcrowns, and two sixpences, all the rest in shillings. I attempted to pursue after the man, I sung out; there were two others with him; I called the watchman, he run after him, but he knew the way well.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pocket from which he took the money the pocket in which you had put the change of the seven-shilling piece into at the public-house - A. Yes, and it being a wet morning, the patrol challenged my wife what she had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. You communicated your loss - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the patrol go with you any where - A. The patrol went with me to the Barley Mow, when I returned there I saw the prisoner drinking at the bar with a woman.</p>
               <p>Did you know him - A. Directly I knew him.</p>

               <p>Q.Was his coat deprived of its cuff - A. It was quite fresh torn off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with the robbery - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say - A. Nothing; how could he say any thing for himself, he remained silent; the patrol took him to the watchhouse, I saw him searched, and one of the shillings I knew in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was found upon him - A. There was half-a-crown, and two or three shillings, there was one that I got from my wife, I had it in my hand playing with it like a child, it had an A upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back to the place where you had been robbed - A. Yes, with a lanthorn, I found nothing; I was creditably informed, that there had been a lanthorn there before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you returned back to the spot where you had been robbed - A. About a quarter of an hour; it could not be more.</p>
               <p>Q. When he seized you by the throat were you disabled - A. Yes, I could scarce speak at the time.</p>

I was; on the 30th of August, about half past one o'clock, I was going by the Bull's head, Smithfield, I saw this man and woman telling the watchman that they had been robbed; I directly took them to the Barley-mow. I asked him if he should know the man if he saw him; he said, yes, from all the world, he said he was dressed in a light coloured coat, like a coachman, and part of his right cuff sleeve was gone away, by his seizing him by the cuff, he had pulled it off himself. I said, come along with me, we will try if we can find him. We went to the Barley-mow, and there was the prisoner and a woman standing at the bar, directly they saw him, they said that is the man, I will give you charge of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe the sleeve of his coat - A. Yes, it was gone off, it appeared quite fresh, I found it was the right arm; I asked him particular; he said, the right arm, so I found it. I searched him at the watchhouse, I found on him a half crown, two shillings, and three or four halfpence; before I shewed the prosecutor the money, I asked him if he should know any of the money; he said, there is but one shilling I can swear to, it was marked with the letter A. I shewed him the half-crown, he said he could not swear to it; I shewed him a shilling, a remarkable one, he said he could not swear to it; I shewed him the other, he said he could swear to that, it was marked with a letter A upon it.</p>

I went to the top of the stairs, I saw the prisoner putting the property in his pocket and under his waistcoat; I was about three minutes watching him, I then called him up, and asked him what he had been about in the cellar; he said, he had been putting the things away; I asked him what he had put the things in his pocket for; he denied having any thing about him that did not belong to him. I then told him that I saw him take them, and desired him to return them to where he took them from. He took these seven pins out of his pocket, they are worth about a shilling. I sent the officer to search his lodgings, there he found one hundred screws, twenty-four bolts and nuts, and two spring sword case catches.</p>

On the 16th of August, about half past two o'clock, before day-light, near Pellican-stairs, I saw a ship's boat rowing to shore; I boarded the boat, the prisoner only was in it; I examined the boat, found it belonged to the ship, Hilton, a collier of South Shields. I took the prisoner in custody; when I landed him he made a start to run, I laid hold of him; I searched him, in his waistcoat pocket I found a watch, and chain and seal to it, two dollars, two shillings, and two sixpences; in his trowsers pocket I found two ten pound notes, a two pound note, a one pound note, and a guinea, in a brown silk purse; he made me to understand, that he had worked for the money, and the watch he had bought of some sailor, I locked him up; in the morning I found out the Hilton, and gave information, Captain Wood came to the office.</p>

            ; I was not in place at the time I lost my property, I lodged at the three Compasses, Bedford-square. On the 15th of September, I was coming up Oxford-street, just by the Pantheon, I saw Harrison, who appeared at that time intoxicated; a woman came up to him and took a watch out of his pocket, it was soon returned to him; I offered my assistance to convey him home; he then said, that he would go into a public house in Oxford-street, which he did, I went with him, he still appeared to be intoxicated, and called for a pint of beer; Cogney there made his appearance, and sat close by the side of us. I asked Harrison if he would go; he said, that he had been drinking, he had fourteen shillings to pay, if I would go with him there he would go home; I agreed to go with him; we went then together to Thomas M'Carthy', public-house, in <placeName id="t18100919-109-crimeloc625">St. Giles's</placeName>

They had not been in above half a minute, before Harrison produced a pack of cards, seemingly from the window, and offered to play a game of put with the person appearing like a groom, the did play; the groom got up and asked me to hold his hand while he went out to make water; Cogney was sitting by all the time; I immediately replied, I did not understand playing at cards, I did not wish to have any thing to do with them; he said, d - n it it can be no harm, you can take hold of the cards and just look at them while he returned back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand the game of put - A. No; I had no intention of playing at cards at that time; I then laid hold of the cards, I looked at the hand, there were two three's and an ace; Harrison then offered me to play for a pound note, I refused, the groom had returned then, he persuaded me to do it; I pulled out a two pound note, the Groom took the two pound note, before I began playing Harrison had recovered from his drukenness; I pulled out my watch to see the time, and laid it on the table, the watch and notes were taken away in less than a minute, and they all three went away at once, they did not stop to play; when they went away I stood very much confused; the landlord came in, told me they had robbed me, which way they had gone, why did not I follow them; I followed in the direction the landlord told me, I saw Cogny and Harrison going into a public house; I immediately offered five shillings for any body to go for a constable. They let Harrison out of the back door; I saw Harrison again in King-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190053"/>Q.Harrison was not able to walk strait when you saw him first in the morning - A. No. I went round King-street, Seven Dials, I saw Harrison and catched him by the collar, he immediately produced the watch in the middle of the street; he said here is your watch let me go. He was secured</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Cogney again - A. I did not see Cogney for some time; I said to Harrison, d - n you give me the two pound note; he said, he had not got that; then I said you shall not go away from me. This was about one o'clock, it was half past four when we took Cogney; on the same day the officer searched Harrison, Harrison produced a bad five pound note, and a gambling thing, which Harrison called a puzzle, the note was made to look like a five pound note. Cogney was found in a court near St. Giles's, the officer brought him out to me, I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of your property found upon him - A. No, there was not, they could not find the two pound note. The other man, that appeared like a groom, has not been taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know him again if you were to see him. - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. Whenever you see him lay hold of him and convey him to the first public office - A. The day after, the publican and some other man, a strange man, came to me, brought me two one pound notes, instead of my two pound note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have been a gentleman's servant, how long have you been out of place - A. Six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know how to play at cards - A. I have played among servants, I do not know the real game of put.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know which is the best card to the game of put - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Which is the best card they reckon at put - A. They call three.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in your hand - A. Two three's and an ace.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had a very good hand - A. I do not know what the hand was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then two three's and an ace would be a good hand at a gentleman's house - A. I do not know much about card playing.</p>
               <p>Q. You understand which is the best card - A. I am not a gambler.</p>
               <p>Q. You put down a two pound notes, did not the prisoner put down a two pound note - A. I do not know whether he put down any thing or no; I put down a note which the stockholder took up. If I had won, I did not expect to have a one pound note of a man that was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you put down your watch, and Harrison staked his watch against it - A. No, I put down my watch, they took the watch immediately and went away, they did not give me time to play.</p>
               <p>Q. When you put these down did not you mean to play for the watch and the note - A. I did not intend it at all.</p>
               <p>Court. For what purpose did you put down your two pound note on the table, explain it to the jury - A. Not with any design to play; being persuaded, I took the two pound note out, and it was taken away immediately.</p>
               <p>- READ. I am an officer of Bow-street; I was coming down King-street, Crowder had hold of Harrison, Harrison had returned him his watch; he charged him with a two pound note, Harrison said he had not got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you at what place this happened - A.He did not know at that time; he said, it was at a public house; the prisoner, Cogney, took us to it; some time after I took charge of Harrison, I knew Harrison before, not Cogney.</p>
               <p>Q.When you had taken Cogney, did the prosecutor know him - A. Yes, he pointed him out, and charged him with being in company with him, and taking his watch and two pound note; Cogney said, he had never seen Harrison before, he owned being in company at that time. Harrison appeared to me to be sober, I searched him, I found this puzzle, and this fivepenny note, the five is marked in the same way as a five pound note; Cogney had no notes or money about him. When I apprehended Cogney, he was at the Hare and Hounds, Puckeridge-street, kept by Thomas M'Carthy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you learn from the prosecutor himself, that he had been playing at put - A.He said, that when this man went out, he persuaded him to take up his hand, he said he did not play it out; I understood him that he took the note out to play.</p>

            . I was coming down King-street, I saw Crowder collar Harrison; he charged Harrison with his watch and a two pound note; Harrison took out two watches, he gave Crowder one, he said, here is the watch, let me go; Crowder said, I want my two pound note; Harrison told him he had not got it; Crowder said, he would not loose him. I understood the same as Read, that he had pulled out the note for the purpose of playing, and that they had run away with the watch and note before the game was out.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the watch, it is a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Harrison's defence. I was very much in liquor; we played four or five chalks; at the commencement of the play we did not play for watches or money. He put his two pound note, and clapped his watch against my watch, as for the note I never had possession of it. When he came to me in the street, I said, here is your watch, take it; as to the puzzle, the prosecutor was present when I bought it; I bought the puzzle for my children, and the note I gave twopence for it in Holborn. The prosecutor, I am convinced, has taken a false oath, merely to take my liberty away. I have lived seventeen years in one house, Captain 
               <persName id="t18100919-109-person918">Newman</persName>
             lives in the house with me; if I was that notorious character, I should think that respectable man would not live in my house; my wife keeps a boarding school in Surry. When the prosecutor found he had got such a good hand, he put down his watch against my watch. I never saw the prisoner before in my life, had not he been indicted he would have been a witness for me. If any officer can say I was a thief, I should willingly go out of the country. I was so tipsey, that when I was taken to Bridewell, I laid upon the stool; I had my gold ring taken off my finger. I am innocent of the charge I declare to Almighty God.</p>
               <p>Cogney's defence. I came into the house for a pint of porter, and sat there; I know no person that was there; I drank out of their pot; I never saw them before.</p>

On Tuesday, the eighteenth of this month I lost the property; about seven o'clock in the evening I crossed the street to speak to an opposite neighbour, and on my turning my back to his house, I saw the prisoner walking backwards and forwards at the front of my house; after seeing him make two or three attempts to go into the shop, I went over to my shop and informed my wife, who was in the parlour; she disturbed him two or three times; I came to the door and looked at him; he would not go away; I went across the way and waited a considerable time; he after two or three times attempting, went into the shop, took the goods mentioned in the indictment from off a pile. I then crossed the street, and when he came out, with the assistance of a neighbour, took him by the collar; he attempted to drop the goods; I caught them as he was dropping them. I took him to Worship-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the goods - A. Thirty yards of Gingham, and twenty yards of printed cotton.</p>

            . On the 31st of August my man and I went up to bathe. I saw this gentleman jump into the water; the prisoner then put his hands into the water and went towards the clothes; he took something out of his pocket, what it was I cannot say, I have every reason to suppose it was a knife; he ran away, I pursued him, it was not twenty yards before I took him; immediately a mob gathered round him, I suppose he delivered the watch to a gang that was round him. I found the fob where he fell, not half a minute afterwards.</p>

On that evening I went up to the river, after the constables had done duty, with an intention to bathe myself, I put my hands into the water to see if is was fit for me to go in, as I was hot walking; I began to unbutton my coat and waistcoat, I was taken short, I immediately made the best of my way to the hedge, there was a hue and cry of stop thief, I fell down; I was taken into a greenstall and searched, they never let my hands go, nothing was found on me.</p>

On the 17th of July I lost from my workshop thirteen coats, a waistcoat, and a pair of breeches; the prisoner worked for me eight days before that. I have only found four coats and a waistcoat. On the 17th of August I saw the prisoner in Leadenhall-street, I asked him where my property was, he told me he would take me to his lodging and shew me; he took me to Rosemary-lane, there he ran from me; I caught him again and gave him into the hands of the constable. He had a coat and a waistcoat on of mine. We found the other three coats where he confessed he had sold them.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it broken open - A. No, I had left the door upon a latch; it had been broken open before, I had placed a spring gun on a bench, and fastened a string to the door, they cut the string and went in. I saw the property in their possession on Thursday evening last, about eight o'clock, I asked the prisoner Eades how long he had the table, he said fourteen years; Mortimer said he knew it to be his table. I then gave them in charge of an officer.</p>

            . On Thursday night last I was returning from the garden where the table was stolen in company with Mr. Cole, I saw Mortimer, he had the table on his bead, Eades and another man were with Mortimer; we followed them to a public house, the sign of the Loggerheads; I left Mr. Cole to take care of them, I went for Mr. Pittard.</p>
               <p>ROBERT COLE. I was coming along Hackney-road with Mr. Pickering, Mortimer had the table on his head, Eades was with him; Cadman the officer was in the public house they stopped at, Cadman told me Eades had offered to sell the table to him for a pound, he offered him fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>JOHN CADMAN. I am an officer. Eades offered me the table for a pound, I offered him fourteen shillings for it, Mortimer said he would give him fifteen shilling for it, it should not be sold for that. I came out of the house; I received information that the owner of the table was sent for, he came and owned the table, he saw them fetch it out of the house.</p>
               <p>Eades' Defence. Going to my labour I found this table against a brick wall in Hackney-road, I took it home; on my going up Shoredith I met

On the 6th of September, at a quarter past nine o'clock in the morning, I was in the accompting-house at break fast, the prisoner came in, went round the counter, and reached this piece of cassimere out of the window; he walked out of the door into the street; I ran after him, and caught him with the goods under his arm. I brought him back and gave him in charge of the constable.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

On the 27th of July I met the prisoner at the top of the cellar stairs, I immediately sent him out; I went down into the cellar and found some bees-wax concealed between the cellar and the flooring of the shop; I left it in the same place I found it. The prisoner came in a quarter of an hour; after he had been in the cellar and was gone to breakfast, the bees-wax was gone; no person had been in the cellar but him. Before this I had seen empty bags in the cellar that gave me suspicion.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKERY. I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's lodging and searched his bed-room; under the bed, in a box, I found this soap, there is eight or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190060"/>nine pounds, eight sticks of Spanish juice, ginger, and this tap-borer. I found all the articles in his lodgings mentioned in the indictment. As soon as ever I found them, I took them to the prosecutor's house, the prisoner was sent for into the accompting-house; I said, we had been to No. 28, Long's-buildings, Whitecross-street, we have found these things in a box under your bed, to whom do they belong. He said, I am very sorry, they belong to my master; I took the soap for my wife's washing, the Spanish juice for my cold.</p>

             had oil on the quay in our charge, until the duties were paid. On the 18th of August, between eleven and twelve at night, I was walking down the Custom House quay, I saw three men standing very near together to the oil-cask; I said, what are you doing here, the prisoner was one of the three; as I stepped up to them, two of them ran away, and at the same time the prisoner had got a bladder in his hand, and appeared to be doing something at the bottom of the cask. I laid hold of the prisoner's coat, asked him what he was doing there; he begged for God's sake I would forgive him, and consider his wife and family. I told him I could not forgive him, my place was in danger. There was a pint of sweet Florence oil in the bladder, there were two spills in the cask. I secured the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was shewn the oil in the bladder. I had oils at the Custom House Quay, and this oil was the same as I had there. I believe it to be mine. We had the cask re-guaged, there was a deficiency of some gallons.</p>

On the 9th of August, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop followed by two other woman, she asked to look at some prints, I shewed her some, she was backward in purchasing, I suspected her honesty. There were four whole pieces of printed muslins on the counter; the top one was folded up; she, by the assistance of one of these other women, contrived to get it under her cloak. I saw her draw it off the counter and then put it under her cloak. I let her take it out of the shop; I followed her and took her about twenty yards from the shop door, I brought her back into the shop, she dropped the piece of print from under her clothes about a yard from the shop door; I saw it after it had dropped, there was nothing of that description before she came in; I took it up, it was the same piece of muslin I had seen her put under her cloak.</p>

On the 17th of this month I lost the mutton; I was standing at the front of my shop, my wife hear a rustling noise in the passage, she called me in, I immediately missed the neck of mutton, it hung inside of the shop, I had seen it two hours before, I hung it there myself, I walked out of the door, I perceived nobody but the prisoner driving a cart with two horses in it; I suspected him and followed him two hundred yards, I perceived that he had got something wrapped up in his apron, I stopped him, and asked him what he had got there; he said nothing. I took the mutton out of his apron; he then said, as to the mutton, I I bought just now, I gave a shilling for it; I told him he could buy mutton cheaper than I could, there was six pound of it; he said, take the name and number of the cart, you will find me there. He whipped his horses on, I could not stop him until he got into Fleet-street. I am positive of the mutton being mine.

               <p>Q. Do you know the defendant Lawrence - A Yes, I understand he is a working watchmaker. On the 21st of April, last year, he came to my mother's shop, he brought two chains and wanted four pounds ten on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they the appearance of gold chains - A. Exactly; it was impossible at the time for me to discover the fraud. I asked him what they weighed, his answer was, two ounces, or exactly the weight which they did weigh; I put it in the scales and found it correspond exactly. If I had considered them to be base metal I should not have thought them worth two shillings. There is one I cleaned up, it does not look half so well as when brought in; they are made precisely the same as a gold chain, I lent him four pounds on them; Lawrence was alone at that time. On the 6th of May he came again alone, he brought me two more chains nearly the same passed as before, I lent him four guineas on them, they had the appearance and fashion of gold chains so as to deceive me. On the 3d of June he came again and brought two more, he got four pound<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190062"/>on them, they were exactly like the others: on the 10th of June he came alone and brought two more, he had three pound ten on them; on the 20th of October he came again and brought three chains, I lent him six pound on them. On the latter end of that month I had occasion to go to the drawer, I had a great quantity, upon that I opened them, I found the deception, they had changed colour, I found they were base metal. These chains could not have been made for any other purpose than to deceive, they are not fit to wear for in two or three days they would turn black. The prisoner never redeemed any of them.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of the discovery you made you caused Raxter to be apprehended two or three days afterwards - A. Yes. These chains were so made that they deceived me with aquafortis. At the time I took some of them in I tried them with aquafortis, and they deceived me. There is not a grain of gold in the metal; I had an essay made, I should suppose there is some pewter mixed with it.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember the prisoner Raxter coming to Mr. Read's to pledge chains - A. Yes, she came first to me on the 11th of April, last year, she brought one chain, two pound I lent on it, she said she brought it from her brother. At the time I received it it appeared to me to be a gold chain, I weighed it, the weight corresponded with the weight of a gold chain, it is not a gold chain. On the same day the prisoner Lawrence came and brought two others, I lent him four pound on them; the chain that she and he brought were of the same appearance and make, and every thing exactly the same. On the 18th of April Lawrence came and brought two other chains, I lent him three guineas and a half, I weighed them at the time they appeared to be gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they gold - A. They are not.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 11th of April was it pawned by Lawrence or Raxter - A. By Lawrence, I did not see Raxter that day. On the 25th of May Lawrence came and brought one chain, upon which I lent him one pound fifteen shillings, I weighed that. On the 13th of October he came again; brought two gold chains, for which I lent him four pounds.

            , and said she brought it from her brother. On the 30th of the same month she brought another chain, I lent her two pound, and the 3d of October two chains, four pound, on the 7th of October she brought three chains, I lent her six pound eight shillings; on the 27th of October two chains, I lent her three guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe after that Mr. Read made a discovery of these things not being gold - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take in all these chains upon the footing of their being gold - A. I did, I weighed them all as gold in the presence of Raxter and Lawrence.</p>
               <p>Q. Were ever any of them redeemed by Raxter or or Lawrence - A. No. On the 2nd of November Raxter came again, we stopped her, I went out and shut the door and brought a constable in, I found the prisoner Lawrence at the door, he ran away, she was examined before the alderman on the 6th of November, and while she was being examined Lawrence was apprehended in Guildhall-yard upon this charge of fraud; Lawrence then said the chains were his, and he had sent Raxter with them. All the chains were precisely the same sort of metal; I was deceived.</p>
               <p>MR. READ. Q. Your young man has told us that he went out to fetch a constable the last time Rexter came - A. Yes. I told her I stopped her in consequence of her bringing a great number of chains, she said they did not belong to her; I told her if she could produce the person to whom they did belong, that was all I wanted; previous to that she said they belonged to her brother, she then said they belonged to a friend, she did not know where he lived for the last three years. While she was under examination at Guildhall the officer proposed to go out into the yard, as it was most likely the man was waiting about there; in consequence of that my young man went out and he was brought in; he said the chains belong to him, she did not contradict him; he did not tell where he lived that time, said he was a journeyman watch-maker.</p>
               <p>HENRY CHAMBAUD. I am a working goldsmith. I have examined a few of the chains, when you see a few of the chains you see the whole, they are all alike, they are made in imitation of gold, I have no doubt for the express purpose of deception; they are polished, the expence of polishing them is a needless expence, unless to make them pass for gold; gold chains are not polished. I have essayed one of them, there is not a grain of gold in them at all.</p>

               <p>ROBERT GUTHERIDGE. I am a servant to Richard Birch, a fishmonger in the Strand. On the 15th of August, between the hours of nine and ten in the morning, I saw these two men standing at the corner of Chancery-lane, near Middleton's and Jones's shop, knowing them to be suspicious characters I stood and watched them, I saw them go to the shop window and stop, then they went on again; when they got a few yards from the place I went up and saw a piece of glass out of the pane, I immediately went in and gave information; I came out and crossed the opposite side of the way, I saw these two men make a turn to come back again, when they saw a person inside taking away the goods from where the window was broken they walked on as fast as they could as far as Temple-bar, and I went about my business. In the evening I saw them in custody, I am quite sure they are the men.</p>
               <p>- BATES. On the 15th of August I was coming from my work I saw the prisoner in the brown jacket (Francis) go up to the window, I saw him pull something from his waistcoat pocket, it appeared to me to be some sharp instrument, he shoved his hand to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190063"/>window, afterwards he walked away; he came back again and then I saw the window was broke; I watched the men; after that they went up to the window again; I saw the prisoner in the brown jacket take some handkerchiefs out and tuck them inside of his waistcoat. I am quite sure of it; the other prisoner was by the side of him.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I could not state whether they took five shillings or fifty poundworth of silk handkerchiefs; I have so many, or whether they took any; I cannot recollect missing any particular pattern.</p>
