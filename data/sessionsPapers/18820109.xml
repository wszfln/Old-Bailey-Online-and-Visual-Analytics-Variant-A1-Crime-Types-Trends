I am a member of the firm of Lion Lion and Sons, wholesale boot and shoe manufacturers, 19 and 21, Sun Street, and 32, Chiswell Street, Finsbury—we have from seventy to eighty indoor hands—in March last Hall and a man named Chandler were foremen in the clicking department—things did not go on very well, and after 25th August I made a complaint against Chandler, and he was dismissed on 15th September; Hall said he did not wish to work without Chandler, and we said he had better go—after that the men were on strike, and I saw the prisoners and others constantly outside the premises in Sun Street—on 6th October I saw them with a crowd of nearly fifty outside the premises at 1 o'clock, the dinner hour: they ware hooting, shouting, and hissing both at me and the men—Harris was in our employ as a clicker.</p>

I am a widow, and keep a grocer's shop at 76, Southampton Street, Clerkenwell—on "Wednesday, December 28, about 1 p. m., tne prisoner came in—he owed me 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he put a coin on the counter and said "Will you take the 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I owe you out of this sovereign; I am sorry I have not been able to pay you before"—I gave him a half-sovereign, nine shillings, and fourpence, and placed the coin in a drawer in my bedroom, where there was only silver and half-sovereigns—on the Friday morning I turned out my money to count it, and the sovereign came out woman upwards—the woman was Britannia, and the coin was bad—I found out that Jill lived at 14, Edward Square—I went there and said to him "You have given me a bad sovereign;" he said "I did not know it"—I showed it to him, and he said "That is one, and the other I changed at Mr. Parker's, in Copenhagen Street; a man named Clare gave them to me in Bagnigge Wells Road—I do not know where he lives, but I may see him at 12 o'clock if you will go with me"—I said "I don't think I can wait to go there with you;" he said "Well, you might not possibly see him"—I said "I think we had better see a policeman"—he said nothing, but went with me to the corner of Edward Street, where we saw a policeman and went with him to the station, where the prisoner said "If you will go to my father in Myddelton Street he will give you a half-sovereign"—last Wednesday morning, when he was out on bail, he came to my shop and said "My father will give you a half-sovereign to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> no further with the charge"—he also said that Clare would not come forward, and he should have to summons him at the County Court for the money.</p>

Hancock's 14 years, and that they were very anxious that he should get married, and that if he could get a respectable woman he should not be long thinking over the matter, that he had taken a great liking to me, and he hoped I would meet him again—he said Messrs. Hancock wished him to get married so that when he was out there would always be some one at home—I made an appointment, and met him again on the following Wednesday at Hereford Gardens, and he took me past Messrs. Hancock's in Bond Street, and pointed to three windows, and said Messrs. Hancock had given him those rooms for when he got married—he asked me if I would let him have my watch, as it was his birthday on the Saturday, and he wished to make me a present of his photograph, which he would have taken on steel at 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and put inside my watch—I had my watch on; it was a gold one—I gave it to him for the purpose of having the photograph put in it—there was no chain attached to it; it was to be returned on the follow-ing Saturday, the 12th—I met him on that day; he did not return me the watch—he said the case fitting tight he had had to send it to the manufactory to have it bent, but he would give it to me in a day or two—I next saw my watch at the Marlborough Street Police-court, produced by the pawnbroker—at the time he told me about the watch being at the manufactory he told me had become security for a man in 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that the man could not pay up, and the loan office people had come down on him for the balance of the money, and that he must leave me in a hurry and go and scrape the money up from somewhere—I met him the next day, Sunday, and went to church with him; inside the church he claimed me as his for ever, and asked me to be faithful—when we left we went for a short walk, and he said he hoped I should not be angry about what he had to say, and then he said "How much money have you got?"—I said ""Five pounds"—he said "But how much altogether?"—I said "Forty-seven pounds in the savings bank"—he said "I wish you would let me have it"—I hesitated, and said "I will let you have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I had not got it with me then; I met him on the following day, Monday; before I gave it him I said I had a few questions to ask him—he said "I am yours, and you are mine, you have a right to ask any questions you like"—I said "You say you have shares in the Great Northern Railway, and that you are a member of the Hearts of Oak; will you bring me the papers?"—he said "Certainly, if you wish it; but the woman that cannot trust me may go; why don't you dress yourself and go down to Messrs. Hancock and see for yourself"—from that I believed what he said was true—he never showed me any papers—I then gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the Wednesday I went to the Post-office Savings Bank and withdrew 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on that same night I saw the prisoner again, and gave him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me this document; it is in his writing.

Hancock and made inquiries about Charles Henry Pearson, and I was referred by them to Messrs. Garrard in the Haymarket—I there saw the right Mr. Pearson, not the prisoner—in consequence of what he told me I consulted Mr. Abrahams the solicitor, and afterwards applied for a warrant—I parted with my watch and money to the prisoner believing that he was in the employment of Messrs.

Cook—on 24th November the prisoner came to me about 5.10 p. m.—I manage the waiting depart-ment—customers who want to take away goods come to me for them—the prisoner said, "I have bought silks and linens for Mr. John Baker, at Princes Risborough, and I wish to take them with me"—as soon as the goods came to me I saw that they were entered and packed, and I wrote the name of John Baker, Princes Risborough, in our signature book—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw the prisoner sign "A. Thomas," as it is there—I said," Will you sign this book and give me your order?"—he said, "I have no order signed by Mr. Baker, but I can show you quite sufficient to convince you that I come from there"—he then pro-duced this pocket-book, which contained sundry entries of goods, a pattern for black and white check flannel, and a slip of paper—he also said," I have been at Spencer, Turner, and Co.'s the whole of the day buying goods for Mr. Baker, but those goods they were unable to do, and I have had to come here for them"—I then said," I am not satisfied with this; I am afraid I shall not be able to let you take them, shall I send them, by passenger train?"—he said," That will not do at all, the</p>

               <p>goods are particularly wanted for the morning, and unless I take them with me I shall never hear the last of it, as Mr. Baker is a most particular man"—I said, "The only thing I can do is to take you to one of our managers, will you come?"—he said, "Certainly, but look sharp about it, as I have to catch the 5.50 train from Paddington"—I went with him to Mr. Wall, and repeated in the prisoner's presence to Mr. Wall what had passed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are 32 departments—I am usually busy—I was talking with the defendant about a quarter of an hour—I cannot say I had no intention of giving up the goods—I rather had the intention at first, the prisoner seemed so plausible—I know Mr. Baker as a customer only—I took particular notice of the prisoner because when I go before the manager I have to be careful what I say, and in this case I did pay particular attention—I was with the manager about five or six minutes—I can pledge myself that what I have given of the conversation conveys the exact meaning.</p>

Cook and Son—Mr. Babbage came to me with the prisoner, and said in his presence, "I have some doubts as to the statements of this person as to his represent-ing Mr. Baker"—I said to the prisoner, "You tell us you are a buyer for Mr. Baker, of Princes Risborough; what authority have you? have you any order?"—he said, "I have no order, but I have a pocket-book," which he took out, or probably held in his hand, in which he showed some endorsed memorandums to me which I did not read, and he added, "I have been during the day buying goods in the West End"—I said, "What house?"—he said, "Spencer, Turner, and Co."—I then said, "That is not quite sufficient, we shall require an order from Mr. Baker before I can allow you to have the goods," offering at the same time to send them by special train," and they shall arrive there as soon as you pos-sibly can"—he made some objection about the irregularities of the train, and the uncertainty of the delivery would probably get him into some trouble—this weakened my confidence in him—I said, "I cannot let you have the goods," and I believe he said, "I shall go to the Fore Street Company," or some other place.</p>

I was informed of this attempted fraud the latter end of November, and on 29th I went to 29, Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road—I received a pocket-book and a piece of flannel—I made further inquiries, which led me to go to Wolverhampton on 5th December, after obtaining a warrant at the Mansion House in the name of "A. Thomas," which he signed in this book—Mr. Paull saw the prisoner first—when I saw him I said "I am a detective officer from London, I hold a warrant for your arrest for attempting to obtain goods from Messrs. Cook's;" he said "I did go to Cook's"—I said "When did you go?" he said "That I shall decline to say"—he was brought to London—I showed the pattern to Mr. Paull when Mr. Babbage was present.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner</hi>). I have been 15 years in the public service—I am 30 years old—I have been for nine years in the Ordnance Map Depot, St. Martin's Place—Hawkins was cashier there; he was my superior; he has been there the same time—I have pleaded guilty to this charge—about April last he said that he was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deficient in his cashbox, and asked me to make it up by altering sale papers from gross to net, to make it appear that the sale was to the trade with discount, instead of a sale to the public—I consented—we were on friendly terms in the office—this was the first time anything irregular occurred—in July he had lent mo 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account; it was arranged that I should make the balance up in the same way as the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did so, and he got his balance—in September and October I continued to do the same thing, and the balance was divided between us equally, 1 making the sale notes net instead of gross—this sale note of 18th October (<hi rend="italic">D</hi> 390) is my writing, it purports to be a sale to Simpkin and Co. of 12 maps, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., discount 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making the money to account for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this receipt is signed by Hawkins, "15th October, Messrs. Maud, Solicitors, 12 maps, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received"—a sale note was made out on the 15th, which I after-wards destroyed, and made out this fictitious one of the 18th; that was done with Hawkins's knowledge—the signature is his and the body of it mine—the transaction is entered in the cheque book in my writing on the 18th as a sale to Simpkin and Co., at the discount price, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a register was kept by Hawkins—the number on the sale note is 390, and in the register 390 is entered as a sale to Simpkin's by Hawkins—that would show that these maps had been sold to the trade—it ought to have been entered with the word "gross"—in Hawkins's cash book it is</p>

I find in the register against the No. 470 "Barwise" in Hawkins's writing—no entry was made at first; there is some pencil under the word "Barwise" which appears to be the word" gross—I did not put my initials to it, but Hawkins put this "E.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I live at 41, St. Thomas Road, Brixton; I was living at No. 15 at this time—I went out of town on 22nd December till the 24th, when I was taken in custody—I had made a verbal statement to the Treasury on the 21st, and on 28th October a written one—there are fire or six salesmen in the office—Mr. Goodwin is the manager, and there was a young man who did not attend to the public—I knew Hawkins sixteen years ago at Southampton, and was always on intimate terms with him—he proposed these frauds, and I assented at once—I made no remonstrance—I got nothing for it in the first instance—I got about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the public money—I have borrowed money of Hawkins for some years past, as I have been in money difficulties some years—in 1878 I was secretary to the church choir at Battersea, and had the keeping of the money—I embezzled it, and had to pay it—I know Bacon—I did not borrow money from him—he came to the office two years ago, and said that he came from my cousin whose bill he held—my salary was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I am just married—I have no family—there was an I. O. U. of mine in the possession of another person—I could not live on 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week because I used to get in company, not particularly bad company, but not good—I was keeping that company at the time I was secretary to the choir—Newnham was a salesman under Hawkins—it is not out of friendship for Hawkins that I have made this confession to day—I thought it was the only way to make amends to my employers—I did not do it to mitigate my punishment—I said in my confession to the Treasury that I did it to make amends and to mitigate my punishment; I have now given up all hope of my punishment being mitigated, and it is simply to make amends—there is only one file for the six salesmen, and it often happens that sale notes are filed so quick that Hawkins had not time to enter them separately—he had to give change, and for the amount he had to depend upon what I put on the ticket—he had six or seven books to keep; he lent money to several persons in the office; that was money taken during the day—I suppose that was a breach of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188201090046"/>
               <p>trust—he would make a note of it and put it in the cashbox—he lent money to three persons in the same department, including myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He lent the public money to three other clerks under him—when the discovery took place I wrote first on 24th October, and I wrote out a full statement on the 28th, and on 5th November I made this list of the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this was done at the office on the Saturday afternoon—Hawkins was there at the same table with me—he had already prepared a list, which was in his writing—we agreed as to the amount, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was divided between us—I was suspended on 26th October—when I heard that a warrant was out I went to Portsmouth to consult my friends, and then went to Scotland Yard and gave myself up—Hawkins had been taken two days before.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">GOODWIN</hi>. I am manager of the sale depot, St. Martin's Place—Hawkins was next in position to me as chief clerk and cashier—my attention was called in October to some irregularity—I remember 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. being received from Barwise by Green across the counter—that was the full price for an ordinary customer—Green passed it to Hawkins, who was sitting behind him—as it was not from the trade Hawkins would have to enter the whole amount—I looked in the cash book the same day, and found only 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. accounted for—when I looked in the register the word "gross" was against it in pencil in Hawkins's writing, over it "Barwise" is now written—if it was a sale in gross, the word gross ought to be entered—the sale to Maud would be at the full price, and the full price ought to be accounted for—I communicated with Colonel Scott, the executive officer—the money is paid to the Paymaster-General every day—Green came to me afterwards and made a statement—he afterwards wrote a letter, and on 28th October he made this full statement—on October 29th Hawkins's wife brought me this statement in his writing—Colonel Scott had suspended them both on the 26th. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I consider it my duty to you, I am extremely sorry for the breach of trust. I considered it my duty to assist Mr. Green, who was so involved in debt. ") On 4th November Hawkins came to the office to have access to the books and papers—I had written this letter to him at the request of my superior officer. (<hi rend="italic">This stated:</hi> "I am desired by the E. O. to inform you that the course of action taken by the Treasury will depend to some extent upon your making voluntarily a full statement of all the case, &amp;c. If you will call on me to-morrow I shall be glad to see you. ") He came, and I arranged for him to come to the office on Saturday after business hours, and go through the books—Green came there, and they were within a few yards of each other at the table for some hours—Hawkins then wrote this letter of 5th November and this list, and gave them to me.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Hawkins made statements from time to time that the staff was not sufficient, and that he had quite as much work as he could do—he was asked to sign papers referring to the sale of maps, saying that the supply was equal to the demand, but he did not say that it would be his 
death-warrant to sign sale notes referring to maps which he had never seen—I have said "Hawkins complained to me that he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188201090047"/>
               <p>been several times compelled to initial vouchers for maps he had never seen"—he first complained of that three months ago, and on one occasion he said that initialling those papers without seeing the maps was signing his 
death-warrant—I thought he meant that as a joke—he had to post up his books from the papers on the file; that is the only way he could know the amount—if you look at the paper you will see "Supply compared with order"—Hawkins was not supposed to carry in his head the price of particular maps; it is mentioned on the majority of the maps, but not on all—fifty or sixty do not remain on the file before he posts them, but they do accumulate; a rush sometimes comes all at once, but not frequently—I have sometimes taken his place, and found that they came in so fast that I could not post them; the average number of customers is from thirty to fifty a day—I have no knowledge of Hawkins saying "I have been to blame for not looking after the clerks"—he would be to blame if he lent the public money to his brother clerks; I have heard that he did do—I have seen pieces of paper in his cashbox representing money advanced to the clerks—I should not sanction such a practice if I knew it; I should report it to my superior officer at once—Green made a confession to me on 16th October, and I telegraphed to Colonel Scott, who came to London next day—I had no instructions that Hawkins should be given in custody, and I cannot account for two months elapsing—Colonel Scott told me to inquire whether the money could be refunded by Green—the time which elapsed between a clerk giving in the sale paper, and handing over the money would depend upon the nature of the sale; another paper might be given in the interval—Hawkins had also to keep a demand book and an abstract of sales, and to fill up a considerable number of forms of various kinds—he had not to carry anything in his head.</p>

                  </hi>. I have the general super-intendence of the Ordnance Map Depot—I live at Southampton; the main office is there—in consequence of a communication from Mr. Good-win I came to town and went to the office towards the end of October, but did not see Hawkins till a day or two afterwards—I then told him that the evidence which had come before me was sufficient to justify me in suspending him, and that he was suspended, and that I regretted that it had occurred, and I explained the evidence to him—I had seen Green first, and told him in Hawkins's presence that I had evidence that sale papers had been altered, and sales had been effected at gross prices which had been entered in the accounts at net prices—I do not think Hawkins said anything to that—I suspended him, and he wrote a letter on 29th October, which was sent to me, and I directed a letter to be written on 4th November—I subsequently reported the matter to the Director of Survey, who sent it on to the Treasury—I had no power to order a prosecution, but the Treasury did so early in December.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think Mr. Goodwin had complained as to his own work, but not that the office was undermanned—I was ready to listen to Hawkins; he might have explained at the time—suspension is merely a step which prevents a man you cannot trust, going on with his work; it does not pass judgment upon him—I should not consider myself justified in asking a man who had taken the public money to refund it; I did not ask Mr. Goodwin to make proposals that Green should refund the money—if Goodwin had told me that the cashier was lending the public money to his fellow-clerks I should have suspended the cashier, as it was a breach of trust.</p>

On 13th December, about five to 6 p.m., in consequence of being called by a female, I went to 52, Belsize Road, St. John's Wood—I there saw the prisoner in the first floor front room, smashing the windows with a saucepan—she had a paraffin lamp alight in her left hand—as soon as I went up the front steps I saw the floor on fire, and the door of the front dining-room, which was locked—the bottom part of the drawing-room door was also burnt; it was just getting into a flame, about four inches square of it was burnt, and the floor was burnt through to the rafter—I found this empty paraffin oil bottle lying on its side in the passage about two feet from the door, and there was oil on the floor extending about six inches from where the fire was—it looked as if it had been poured out of the bottle, which was 15 or 16 inches from it—the oil appeared to have run under the door into the room, under some matting—with the assistance of another man I got some water and put the fire out—it was a full blaze—the prisoner was in a very excited state—she was partly dressed—she had no shawl or bonnet on; only a blanket—she said she would wreck the b—house and burn it down, and throw herself from the top—she had placed a pair of steps against the fanlight leading on to the roof—it is a three-story house, with houses adjoining, and a piece of garden in front—there was a crowd of people outside—the gas-pipes were torn down in the back drawing-room, and also downstairs outside the back kitchen door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 11, Boundary Road, St. John's Wood—on 13th December, shortly after 6 o'clock, as I was leaving my house, I met a man who asked me to come into Belsize Road—I found a crowd of 200 or 300 people there—I went into the house and saw two policemen and the prisoner—she was seated on the two bottom stairs, wildly excited; her feet were bare and bleeding, cut with pieces of glass—her face was smeared with blood from one of her hands, which was bleeding, and she was covered with soot, which, mixed with the blood, went all over her face—she was only partially dressed, not with ordinary clothing, but with pieces of blanket and an old dress pinned together, and she was screaming and gesticulating and fighting with the policemen, and the instant they let go of her she commenced to destroy the house and break the windows—I spoke to her quietly, and asked her to come into the back dining-room to enable me to attend to the wounds that she had—after a few minutes she quieted down—I had never seen her before—I said "You are very excited, what is the cause?"—she said "You mean am I drunk"—I said" Yes"—she said" I have been drinking, but only sufficient to nerve me for this work"—I said" What are you doing this for?" she said "Because I have been cruelly used"—I said" In what manner?"—she said that her husband had deserted</p>

               <p>her some three years previously, that a post-nuptial settlement had been made giving her a life interest in the house, which was then handsomely furnished, by which she considered that her husband intended her to become a prostitute; that she had no intention of doing so, being a virtuous woman, that she had sold her furniture bit by bit until she had come to the last; she then wished to let her house to some one who would give her a twelvemonth's rent in advance, and with that she meant to pay her rent and go to Belgium, where she could earn her living as a governess; that she had found a man to take her house, but her trustees refused him as a tenant and had let the house to a Mr. Roberts; that she only knew that that day; that she had then borrowed half a sovereign and sent a telegram to her trustees asking them how they dared let her house without her consent; that she had received an answer, "to avoid a Chancery suit," and she then determined to wreck the house, and wreck it so completely that, sitting in the kitchen, she should be able to see the sky above her, and having done that she meant to mount on the roof of the house and jump off; and that all she had done was lawful, and no one could take her—I could not leave her with the fixed determination of destroying herself, which I believed she was very likely to carry into effect, so after a long argument she consented to come up to New Street station with me and see the inspector on duty—she was then charged and detained, and I and the inspector returned to the house—during this con-versation she talked perfectly sensibly—my opinion was that she was an angry woman partially excited by drink, but perfectly sane, and knew perfectly well what she was doing—she could distinguish between right and wrong.</p>

I am in partnership with Mr. Vile as jewellers, at 3, Holborn Circus—on 30th September the prisoner, who I did not know, came and presented the card of a friend of ours, saying that he hoped in conformity with that we should allow him to pick out a watch for his boy—we don't sell retail, but we said that in consequence of the recommendation we should not object, and he selected three or four silver watches to take away to show to his wife; he also selected a gold English watch for his wife, value 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a gold watch for himself, value 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he has not paid for them—he said that he had realised a good deal of money in various ways, and had just realised an estate and was about settling with his lawyers in Lincoln's Inn, who had sold an estate for him which realised 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. profit, and that he intended to build a house, and asked me to furnish him with the name of an architect—four or five</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188201090061"/>
               <p>days after the first interview I was examining a parcel of rose diamonds in his presence, and he said that he had a friend who made much money by selling ornaments, and he thought it would be a good speculation—I told him it would be far better for him to have brilliants—he said I" think my wife wants something new in the way of diamond ornaments, I shall be very glad if you can show me something to-morrow or the day after when I look in again"—I got a pendant; he looked in on 20th October, saw it lying there, and inquired the price—I told him that it cost about 275<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I would treat him as a friend and let him have it for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "You would not mind my showing it to my wife, and if she decides on it I will bring it back into your custody till my affairs are settled, and then I shall give you the money and you will give me the pendant;" and in a jocular manner he said "I wonder what a pawnbroker would advance on an article of that kind; I should think he was the right person to value the article"—I said "Well, they generally are on the safe side, and they are sure not to value it too high; I don't wish to go on my own judgment, if you have any wish to value it, do so"—he said "Could you indicate me a pawnbroker who understands the value of diamonds?"—I said "Mr. Attenborough, at the comer of Fleet Street"—just before going he said "Really it is too bad, I do not like to do it"—I said "I don't care about the transaction, it is simply to oblige our friend that I allow you to pick out anything; you can do just as you please"—he took it away, and came back in half an hour and said. "Well, I went to Attenborough's, and they could see by my looks that I did not want to pledge it, but only wanted to feel the value, and they declined to tell me unless I paid them 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; but if you will allow me I will take it away and show it to my wife, and bring it back to-morrow"—I was not aware he was a bankrupt—I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The friend whose card he brought me was Mr. Gamblin—he took away the pendant on 20th October—he said he was selling an estate, out of which he expected to realise 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. profit; not that he was buying an estate to sell it again—I left for the Continent the day after he took the pendant away, and I do not know whether he brought it back to the shop, but Mr. Hall, our clerk, is here—I was away a week or ten days, and when I Came back he was in custody—he had. four of our watches in his possession—he decided to buy three, and returned one; in point of fact, he had goods of mine for the purpose of deciding whether he kept them or not—I had no objection to his taking them to the pawn-brokers for the purpose of valuing them, but I did not suggest it—I did not say that I had often valued things at the pawnbrokers'—I told him I was going to Switzerland—I will not swear that I did not tell him that the thing might remain in abeyance till my return—I returned about 30th October.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">HALL</hi>. I am manager to the prosecutors—I remember the prisoner calling there from time to time—he told me that he had sold an estate in Scotland—he was always mentioning estates, and he showed me a bundle of what he said were title deeds of estates—I saw him last on I think 26th October—he did not return me the pendant—he called nearly every day, and sometimes twice a day—he said nothing about the pendant on the 26th, but on two occasions he withdrew from his trowsers pocket a silver paper parcel, and said "We have not decided about it yet," and replaced it in his pocket—it looked like the pendant as it was wrapped in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188201090062"/>
               <p>silver paper—this entry in the approbation book is in my writing—it was made at the time, but we do not show our customers our books—it is when translated, "Moore, friend of Gamblin, diamond pendant 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—on the afternoon of the 20th I went into the private room with some cheques for Mr. Moore to sign—he had a parcel in his hand, and he said "Then it is an understanding that if we decide to keep it, I bring it back to you to hold till I bring you the money."</p>

On 7th December, at 12 o'clock, I went to Witherup's bedroom at this coffee tavern and charged him; a conversa-tion took place, and on 12th December, at 6 p.m., I went there and saw him again—on the same day I saw Brown at Rickett and Smith's office—I said "l am a police officer, and some money has been taken from a safe in the coffee palace, and I have been told that while you were there one of the keys was missing; can you throw any light on the matter as to whose possession it is in?"—he said "I will tell you all I know; the manager's key was lost, and I advised him to have a new lock put on the safe; the new lock was afterwards put on, but whether five, six, or seven keys were supplied, I can't say; when I left I gave up my key to Abbott, the boy, and afterwards, when I came in the evening, I used to borrow his</p>

               <p>key if I wanted to open the safe; I heard that one of the keys was missing, but that was after I left; if there is any other way I can assist you I am willing to do so"—I left him, and after Witherup was arrested I went with him and Sergeant Partridge to Brown's house, and waited till 1.30, when Brown came home—I then knocked at the door; Brown came to the door; he was the worse for drink—we went into the kitchen—Witherup remained outside—I said "You recollect seeing me to-day?" he said "Yes"—I said "Since I saw you to-day I have reason to believe the missing key is in your possession; there is great suspicion attached to you, and in order to clear it away I ask you to allow us to search your premises"—he said "Have you a search-warrant?"—I said "No; but if you are an innocent man you cannot object to our taking that course"—Brown's wife said "Let them search, you have nothing to fear"—he said "Well, you can search"—I went into the next room on the same floor but there was no furniture, only a couple of keys hung up—I went to a bedroom with Brown and his wife; I asked him where his box was; his wife moved a packing-case which was on it, used as a dressing-table, and a little box was taken out—Brown gave me the key of it; I opened it and found in it a small money-box containing 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—I said" How do you account for the possession of this money?"—he said" I have saved it"—this memorandum was at the bottom of the box; I asked him whether it referred to the affairs of the Coffee Palace Company; he said" No, my wife sells papers in the streets on Sunday mornings, and that is an account of them"—we went down into the kitchen again, and I said "When did you last see Witherup?" he said "I have not seen him for three weeks"—I said" Witherup says he was here this day week, the night of the robbery, and that you were drinking together"—he said" That is not true"—I said to Partridge" Bring in Witherup"—he did so, and I said to Witherup "I wish you to repeat now what you told Mr. Payton respecting the robbery"—I took out some paper and wrote down his statement—he said" We met here between 8.30 and 9 this day week, and stayed till 10; we went out and had drink at several public-houses, which 1 can show you; we then went to the coffee palace, and entered the front door with the key that I had; it was one o'clock; we opened the office door and the safe with keys that Brown had; we took out 14 bags containing money, two cash-boxes, and then left; we took a cab near Elm Street, and drove to the 'Angel;' walked down City Road, and took another cab, and drove to Old Street, where that cab was discharged; took another cab there, and drove to Dalston Junction, and discharged that cab; we walked to 10, Birkbeck Road, and got there between two and three, but I don't well know the time; we put the cash-boxes on the table, and broke them open with tongs; we counted the money, and I think there was 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver, I am not certain of the amount; I had 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., about 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it in silver, which I changed for gold, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; Brown had about the same amount in gold and silver; I saw Brown last Wednesday at Rickett and Smith's office; I told him the Inspector had searched my room, and to destroy whatever clue he had,"—Brown then said" Yes, I admit he did come to the office"—Witherup said," Brown said he had silver in a box locked up; after counting the money we went out of the house, turned to the right, at the top of the road there was a constable standing; we then went to the New River at St. Paul's Road, and I threw</p>

               <p>the boxes into it; the boxes contained some penny tokens; a little farther on we threw in the key of the safe and of the front door, and the key of the cash-box; this robbery was suggested to me about three months ago by Brown in the coffee palace; Brown's wife was present when we re-turned to the house, and saw the bags burnt"—I said to Witherup "Can you describe the position of the public-houses where you were drinking?"—he said "The beer-shop opposite Dalston Station, Nottage's public-house (they know Brown there as Burns), and a public-house between Dalston Junction and Ridley Road"—I read the statement over, and Brown said "You might take me if you think the evidence of a fellow like him is sufficient"—I said to Sergeant Jenner, "Go to Nottage's public-house, and ask him if a man named Brown was there on Monday, and ask him who was with him, and bring him here if possible"—Brown then said "I admit being with Witherup on Monday, and that we were at Nottage's, but that proves nothing"—that was the Monday of the robbery—they were both taken to the station and charged, and in Brown's possession a further sum of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was found, making 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in all—they went in separate cabs to the station—we stopped near the New River, and Witherup pointed out the spot where the cash-box was put in—I went there three days afterwards with two river men, and was present when one cash-box was pulled up—I was away a few minutes, and when I came back the other was lying in the boat—Brown's house had the appearance of great poverty—these are the "tokens" that were in the box—only two rooms were furnished—the kitchen, which was a sleeping room for the two children, and one other room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The kitchen looked as if it was the dwelling-room—I did not say before the Magistrate," Before he was taken away Brown said to Witherup, 'Look me in the face and tell me the truth'"—the clerk must have adopted a question; those were not my words, but Brown may have said so for aught I know—Witherup demurred at first to my searching his room, but afterwards allowed me to do so, and I found in his box a number of chess-boxes, knives, and dominoes, new—I did not know they were stolen—I asked him to show me his money—ha said, "I have done a good deal already, I shall not show you my money"—I saw him again an hour afterwards in the presence of Mr. Underwood, the Company's solicitor—he was then asked again to show his money, and objected, but he afterwards agreed to show it to Mr. Underwood in private—that was on the 7th—between then and the 12th no action was taken—when Mr. Payton required an explanation about the seven or eight chess-boxes which were found Witherup said that he bought them at a shop in Houndsditch—they contained chessmen com-plete, and there were some domino-boxes and four new carving-knives, which were compared with those in use in the palace—he said that he bought the carving-knives in the Borough—he took me to two or three places in Houndsditch; I found it was all moonshine, and then he declined to go to the Borough; he said, "Oh, it is no use now"—up to that time he had not said a word about Brown or the cash robbery—I showed him the tongs at Brown's house, and he said that he was excited and could not say whether those were the tongs—I can't say whether Brown has a lodger; I saw a man at the door one night; I believe it to be a feint.</p>

I am a clerk at Mansion House Chambers, City—I was in the service of the Coffee Palace Company from July, 1879, to 5th November, 1881, and knew both the prisoners while they were employed there—Brown came in August, 1880, and left on 27th August, 1881—I remember the new lock being put on the safe with six keys—I did not have a key, but Brown gave me his key when he left—he afterwards came in the evenings, and used to borrow it—one key was missing about a month before he left in August—when he left in the evening he did not give me back the key; he used to leave it with the manager—Brown and Witherup were friends, they used to leave together when work was over, but Witherup lived in the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw them in the coffee-palace together several times after Brown left the permanent service of the company in August—Witherup remained as a lodger, and was on friendly terms with the other clerks; he was there with Brown just the same as anybody else—when Brown came for night-work the safe was opened, and I lent him my key to lock up when he had finished his bookkeeping—when there was money in the safe I remained and saw him lock up the safe; he asked me to do so—on more than one occasion there was as much as 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it—I knew Mr. George, the manager, before Mr. Creer—he lived at 17, Canonbury Grove—I have been there, but I don't know where the cash-box was found in the river.</p>

               <p>remember the late manager of this company having notice to quit four or five months ago—I was not then in the service; I had left 12 months—I had conversations with Brown, partly in the office and partly in a public-house in Dalston when we spent the evening together—be said "Mr. George is about to leave, and the key of the safe is lost; I will get one of the keys, and we will steal the money, and suspicion will not fall on us"—I said" Will there be any fear of being found out?"—he said "No, very likely the suspicion will fall on Mr. George"—I said "It is risky; lam in a situation now"—it ended in my agreeing, but not at the first interview—we had nine or ten conversations—some were at the Radnor Arms, Dalston—I met him on 5th December at 9 o'clock at his house; we stayed an hour, and then went out and had several drinks together, and took a hansom cab, and drove to Clerken-well Prison; we got out there, and went to the coffee palace—I opened the door with a key, and we went in—Brown opened the office-door—1 kept watch on the stairs, next my bedroom, which was on the next land-ing—when all was settled, and Brown had the money, he locked the office-door, and we took a hansom to Elm Street, Gray's Inn Road—he had the bags in his pocket, and I carried the cash-boxes; we discharged the cab at the Angel, and took another to Old Street, which we discharged, and took another to Dalston Junction; we got to Brown's house at 3 o'clock, where we broke open the cash-boxes and counted the money—there was 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which we shared, throwing the coppers aside—I had 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; we then went to St. Paul's Road, Canonbury, where I threw the cash-box into the river, I being the tallest to reach over the rails.</p>

On 29th October I understand the order was cashed. On that day I went with the prosecutor and Mr. Maurice to M. Bacheler's, where they left me. I returned to Madame Blondel's. She asked, 'Where are your friends? Mr. B. has called, and wants to see one.' I told her I had just left them. Ten minutes afterwards they came. During the whole day I was constantly in the company of these people. "</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, of Fitzjohn's Avenue, Hampstead—on Friday evening, about 5.30, I heard a disturbance, went to the front of the blacksmith's shop in the yard, and saw Woolley on the ground—I stepped over him without touching him—Jones was fighting with Price—I said "Stop that fighting, I will not have it here; my work must go on; I must not have you men coming here to fight with my men; go away"—I stopped the fight, and put Jones outside the door—I then picked Woolley up from the ground in my arms, and said "Who has done this?" he said "One of your men inside, let me get at him again"—I said "You shall not here," and stood in the shop door and kept him out, and persuaded him all in my power to go away—they both went to the stable, and Jones came back and hit me on my head with his fist, I believe, and Woolley came back and hit me—I don t think he cut my head, but he knocked it against some iron—they knocked me on a bench—Woolley held my coat, but I got to the door; he fell, and pulled me on top of him, and Jones was <hi rend="italic">pasting away</hi> at me all he could—I found myself faint, and called out "Men, where are you? Can't you get this fellow away from me?"—that was Jones—I was on my knees—I was kicked on my thigh—no one was there then but the two prisoners—my watch chain broke in the struggle, and I lost my watch—I did not knock Woolley down—after I got away I could not see, and was wiping the blood out of my eyes, and Jones came back and struck me again on the back of my head—I was struck, I should say, 40 times—Woolley was, I think, worse for drink—Jones was sober—they were taken in custody.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Holyhead, a porter, of 22, Lant Street, Borough; we occupied the first-floor back—the prisoner lodged with his wife, the deceased woman, in the room above us—I was at home on Sunday morning, 13th November; between 11 and 12 o'clock I heard a noise of quarrelling in the prisoner's room—I heard him first commence to beat his wife at the corner of the fireplace—I heard the sound of blows, and the woman screamed out "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Jerry,</hi> don't"—a few minutes after that I saw the deceased on the landing by the door; she came running out from her own room; she had to come down a flight of stairs to get on to the landing—she showed me a mark on her left temple; it was not black, it was a large ridge as thick as a finger across her temple; it was only the flesh raised—she made a com-plaint to me, and she went downstairs into the yard—I next saw her about half-past 1 in my room; she sat down because she was not very well, and then went upstairs to get her husband's dinner ready for him—I heard them quarrelling again; I could not tell the time—I heard the scuffling of feet on the floor, and the woman screamed out something about her back—I called to her to come into our room, but received no answer—she did not come down—the prisoner came down on to the lauding, and told me to mind my own business—I said nothing more to him, but spoke to the landlady—he went upstairs to his own room—I heard nothing more then—I had seen the deceased between 10 and 11 that morning; at that time she had no mark on her face whatever, and appeared to be in her usual health—I knew she was pregnant—the doctor came to see her about 6 o'clock on the Wednesday evening in the following week—she had one child, a little boy not able to walk—she was a very quiet woman—I saw her on the Wednesday night between 10 and 11; the mark was not so largely raised, but it was getting discoloured—she died on the Friday, 25th, at 8 in the morning, after the doctor saw her—I was present when she died—between the time the doctor saw her on the Wednesday and the Friday morning, at 8,</p>

Thomas Buck-nell, died—I never heard the prisoner say that he did not like his wife to associate with me, because I had been separated from my husband—I did not say before the Magistrate I heard the sound of a blow—I said the sound of blows—the deceased did not complain to me of having slipped downstairs; she never slipped downstairs—on the 24th the prisoner went and fetched some milk and new laid eggs for me to give to his wife, and he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get what she wanted—I waited on her during the confinement; there was not more flooding than usual—her face was yellow when she died—Mr. Matcham, the doctor, asked who gave the woman the black eye, and I said the prisoner—I did not tell the prisoner so in the presence of Mrs. M'Carthy's mother.</p>

I am a widow, living on the second-floor front room at 22, Laut Street—on Sunday, 13th November, I went into the prisoner's room between 11 and 12 o'clock—the prisoner was in bed—the deceased was there dressing the little child—I went back to my own room, and five or ten minutes afterwards I heard a scuffle by the fire-place, and then a blow and a scream; the boy and the mother both screamed together—the noise proceeded from the fireplace in the back room—before I heard the blow I heard voices, but could not hear what was said—I heard the prisoner go downstairs soon after, and then the woman came into my room and picked up a small looking-glass to look at her face—she called my attention to a blow on the left temple, and a swelling of the flesh; it was raised up like my finger—I put the flat of the blade of a small knife to it to take it down—in the afternoon at 3 o'clock I heard the prisoner go upstairs into his own room and a scuffle, and she said "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Jerry,</hi> don't, you have done quite enough!"—Mrs. Holyhead said she was not going to stay in a house where a woman was being slowly murdered, and Mrs. Fitzgerald, the landlady, then came upstairs—I saw the deceased again the same day; she came into my room, and said she was very low, and felt faint and sick—I saw her again from time to time up to her death—the mark on her face turned several colours; green and yellow—on the Tuesday before she died I took her up to Mr. Pond's, a chemist's shop in Trinity Street, Borough—on the Satur-day, and before the illusage, she was in her usual health.</p>

                  </hi>. I am parish surgeon of St. George's—I received an order to see this woman on Wednesday, 23rd November—I law her about midday—she was in bed, in a dreamy condition—her left eye was black, or rather it was recovering from a blow; it had passed on to the green stage—the prisoner was present—I said to the woman in his presence, "How did you get that black eye?"—she replied," I don't know"—I then asked the prisoner if he knew anything about it—he said "No"—I said, "Don't tell lies; she is your wife, you must know"—he then said," Well, if you want to know, I gave it her"—she had not then been confined; there was the appearance of labour coming on—she had a labour pain while I was in the room—I gave her an order for the infirmary—the prisoner said, "Can't I get her into the hospital? I shan't let her go there"—on the 24th I sent my assistant to make inquiries—I received certain information from him, and I went to the house about half-past 5 o'clock—I then found she had already been delivered of a female child—she was quite unconscious—I examined her, and found there had been slight haemorrhage, not extensive; she was not actually flooding at that time—what I saw would not bring on the unconscious state she was in—her breathing was very deep—she was jaundiced—I should say the bruise on the eye was of a week or ten days' standing—she could not have been suffering from jaundice very long; the skin on Wednesday was very slightly jaundiced—on 25th November, at half-past 10 o'clock, I went and found that she was dead—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination next day, seven hours after death—I have the notes I made at the time—in my opinion the cause of death was inflam-mation of the brain, produced by external injury—immediately under the seat of injury on the left temple I found an inflamed surface extending more or less over the whole surface of the brain, radiating from that patch—such an injury might or might not be likely to bring on jaundice in a person whose liver was slightly diseased—I examined the liver, and on the upper portion, on the right side, I found the remnants of an old hydatic cist—the liver in the immediate vicinity of that cist was somewhat diseased—I do not think that the death could have resulted from the birth of the child—the flooding would relieve the congestion of the brain—it is an old remedy to bleed for inflammation of the brain—there was to hæmorrhage on the Thursday evening after I was called in.</p>

               <p>the communication from my assistant, on the Thursday evening, after I had seen that the woman was dying—I do not remember Mr. Boardman, the solicitor, asking me why I put the man in custody when the wife would probably want his assistance, or replying "This is my third mid-wifery murder case this year"—it was not my third; it was the first; I had two or three either of manslaughter or murder last year—I believe I was at the Old Bailey three times—I said at the police-court "There had been extensive haemorrhage during the night"—that was from information communicated to me, not from my own observation—there were no signs then; it might have been cleared away—if there had been extensive haemorrhage it would of course have been dangerous—haemor-rhage of any kind is very dangerous to man or woman—I have never found flooding after delivery cause death—I am speaking with a personal experience of 2,500 cases, and I have never lost a case by <hi rend="italic">post-partem</hi> haemorrhage; I know it from recorded cases of course—confinement at seven months is not very much more dangerous than at the full time; it is to the child, but not to the mother—I do not deny that flooding after birth is intensely dangerous, or that" there is no contingency in which the life of a patient depends so completely upon the coolness, decision, and promptitude of the attendant—if a medical man loses his head he will probably lose his patient."—judging from what I saw on Wednesday the jaundice was so slight that I should say it was com-paratively recent; I should say it had not existed a month—supposing the woman a fortnight before death had received a blow on the head which had caused what I saw, that would tend to bring on premature confinement, I should say in from 24 hours to 14 or 21 days—I cannot say that it was the cause of the premature confinement, but it might have been—she also had a blow at the back of the spine about the size of; he palm of my right hand; I saw no other bruise—she was a fairly will-nourished woman, not like a person who suffered from want of food—the bruise at the back was just over the kidneys; apparently about the same date as the other, because there was about the same amount of discoloration—assuming that there had been excessive hœmorrhage, and that there was a lack of promptitude or decision on the part of the attendant, I do not think that that would account for her death; the condition in which I found her was certainly not one from loss of blood; in my opinion inflammation of the brain caused the death—I consider that the inflammation of the brain was the result of the blew which I noticed on the eye, whenever that was inflicted—there need not have been severe concussion at the time the blow was given; there must of course be some; it depends upon the severity of it—a blow might cause inflammation ultimately, although there might be no severe con-cussion at the time—I gave information about the prisoner on the Thus—day, because the woman was dying; I had no feeling against the man—I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination seven hours after death—it did occur to me to call in another medical man; I asked the divisional surgeon and also Mr. Warner and another gentleman to attend.</p>

               <p>questions coherently; gaping or yawning is a very marked symptom—if she had died from flooding there would be the absence of blood in almost all the organs of the body; the lungs especially would be bleached and dry to the touch, and the spleen would be very pale—flooding is nothing more or less than bleeding to death; in that case I should expect to find blood absent and the body bleached—it was not so in this case—she could not be roused to consciousness—her face was not bleached, but congested—she did not yawn, she snored—blood was not absent from the organs—the lungs were moist and contained a normal quantity of air and blood—the spleen was not pale—in the case of a person dying from inflammation of the brain, I should expect to find in the last stage general insensibility, with occasional delirium, ending in perfect coma—she was just merging into that condition when I saw her, getting dreamy and rolling her head about—that was on the Thursday—on the Wednesday she was in a transition state—on the Thursday perfectly comatose—I was not with her when she died—I do not think she died of jaundice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a student of medicine at Guy's—on Wednesday, 23rd November, at 6 o'clock in the evening, I was called to see the deceased—Mr. Warner, who is obstetric assistant at Guy's, went with me, and I assisted him in delivering the woman about a quarter of an hour after we got there—when Mr. Warner left, about half an hour after the delivery, she was still flooding—I was left behind to watch her, and to arrest the haemorrhage—I stayed till 3 o'clock in the morning—there was very little flooding as far as I could see; it had quite stopped when I left—I went next day, Thursday, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I examined her; there was no sign of the flooding having returned—she was very much jaundiced; she had a quick, thin, feeble pulse, her pupils were very much dilated, her skin was hot, and she was delirious—I found Mr. Matcham's assistant there, and I left him in charge of the woman.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188201090090"/>
               <p>and I went afterwards, about 5.30—I found the deceased lying in bed; she was conscious, but in a very peculiar condition; her pulse was very quick, she had a dry brown tongue, the skin was hot—when I asked her questions she did not answer in a rational way, but more or less inco-herently; in fact she did not answer the questions at all, but rambled on to something else—she was delivered about a quarter of an hour after we got there—the child was alive at birth—it was about a seven months' child—there was haemorrhage, not very severe, not more than one sees in a large number of cases—I left Mr. Edsall there with instructions what to do—in my opinion there was nothing in her condition to cause death—I thought she was in a condition to make one anxious, but I did not think she was going to die so quickly—I did not consider the haemor-rhage dangerous, or I should have stopped—it was not sufficient to cause death in my opinion—the appearances were consistent with inflammation of the brain.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. and a graduate in medicine. I am attending here in another case, and have been accidentally present and heard the evidence in this case—flooding is a dangerous thing, but the death as it is said to have taken place in this case would not be a probable result; the death would be from syncope, from coma, that would not be a result of extensive or recurring flooding—coma is a very frequent termination of jaundice—the circulation of bile in the blood produces the state of coma, and therefore the fatal result—the symptoms of jaundice being contemporaneous with the confinement would, in my opinion, be consistent with her death; the jaundice would produce the premature confinement, and that would produce coma and death—I think it unlikely that inflammation should set in ten days after a blow, if there was no active concussion at the time or immediately after; it would be very uncommon—I never knew a person to have a blow and immediately afterwards to walk downstairs, talk intelligibly, go out and talk to persons, and then a fitful kind of dreamy condition come on, afterwards terminating in death; it would be inconsistent with active sypmtoms—a person dying in the manner described, I should not say there was necessarily any connection between the blow and the death—I would not say it was impossible, but improbable—if a person had jaundice and was prematurely confined of a seven months' child with unusual flooding, I should not consider death improbable—the coma would not influence my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew nothing whatever of the case till I came into Court—I simply give my opinion from what I have heard here; I never saw the person—the symptoms do not indicate syncope, but coma—I agree that in the case of brain irritation there would be a quick pulse, a dry brown tongue, a hot skin, vomiting in the early stages, restlessness, delirium, stertorous breathing in the last stages, and coma—in the case of flooding there would be pallor and yawning, and after death scarcely any blood in the organs, the lungs pale and dry, and the spleen pale.</p>

A competent medical man conducting a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination would be able to say with confidence whether on a particular part of the brain there was a patch of inflammation; that is a sort of thing which there could be no mistake about, or whether there was or no inflammation radiating from that patch over the other portions of the brain—in such a case I should consider that that state of the brain contributed to the death—I should find it exceedingly difficult to connect the blow with the jaundice—if the patch of inflammation was found immediately under the spot where the blow was inflicted I should decidedly connect the blow with the inflammation; I should consider that the blow caused the inflammation; jaundice would be most unlikely to cause that—flooding would be most unlikely to produce inflammation of the brain; it would operate to relieve the inflammation—it would not be an immediate result—if a woman were drained of blood she would be</p>

I am a divisional surgeon of police, and have been so nearly thirty years—I have had a great number of cases of blows on the head to attend to, and cases where they have ended in death within 10 days—it is not a common occurrence, but a person may receive a blow producing unpleasant symptoms at the time, and yet go about their usual business, and in 10 or 12 days bad symptoms may set in—jaundice from diseased lungs during pregnancy may produce blood-poisoning, and death may result from that—a recurring haemorrhage is a very dangerous thing—coma is an invariable result in blood-poisoning from jaundice—you may have inflammation of the brain or the heart, and death may result.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am accidentally in Court to-day—I have heard Mr. Howell's evidence—I do not agree with him entirely—I differ with him about a person being able to walk about for days—in a case of blood-poisoning every organ of the body is affected.</p>

When jaundice is the result of a violent blow it follows soon after the blow, in a few hours, it might be a day or two, particularly about the sixth or seventh month of pregnancy—a slip downstairs or any shock might cause it—irritation of the brain would not tend to produce jaundice unless there was some scirrhosis of the liver, then vomiting would be the result, and very likely jaundice would follow—inflammation of the brain would be likely to produce premature birth, or a fright or shock might do it—if a person had inflammation of the brain after a premature con finement with comatose symptoms I should not consider that the inflammation of itself was connected with the death, but as a remote cause of bringing on the labour—I agree with Mr. Matcham that there would be a marked distinction between death from the consequences of a confinement and from inflammation of the brain, but not so marked between death from inflammation of the brain and from jaundice—I should ascribe it ia this case to the jaundice—when a person has jaundice the whole of the bile is absorbed into the blood, and you would have blood-poisoning from that—in a case of a person having jaundice and dying, and after death inflammation of the brain is found, it would be difficult to say whether the person died from one or the other—if the jaundice came on immediately after the inflammation of the brain I should say that in-flammation caused the jaundice—the bad symptoms from a blow do not immediately follow—if jaundice followed in two days I should say the blow caused the jaundice, and then the inflammation of the brain, and then death—it would be impossible to tell with any certainty that the jaundice was the result of the blow.</p>

I live at the Regent's Arms, New Street, Lime-house—on 5th April I saw an advertisement in one of the daily papers for a manager for a beerhouse—I answered it to 50, Baker's Row, and on receiving a reply I called there, and saw O'Neill and a man named Johnson—I went with him from there to the Regent's Arms—O'Neill said he had just taken the house, and wanted a manager for it, and he believed there would be a good business done—he said he required a deposit of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this was on Friday—I said I would call again next day, as I had not got the money with me—I did call next day, and saw O'Neill at 50, Baker's Row—he said that he had got a good business there as a coffee-house and several beds, and was doing a very good trade—Johnson was in the coffee-shop, and said it would be a good thing for me to manage the beerhouse—O'Neill was present; he said the house belonged to himself, that it was his own property—I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit on the Saturday, and entered into this agreement. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated the </hi>6<hi rend="italic">th April between O'Neill and the witness, by which he was to be engaged as manager of the Regent's Arms for six months at a salary of</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week, the witness agreeing to deposit</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">for which he was to receive 21/2 per cent., payable monthly.

(<hi rend="italic">This was to the same effect as the former, and was witnessed by Lawrence Sullivan; attached to it was also a receipt for</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) I paid him the 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance then, and took the management of the place—in the following September. O'Neill told me that he had a beerhouse, the Regent's Arms at Limehouse, and that I and my son could manage that—he asked me what 1 could pay as a deposit—I said I could pay him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down; he did not pay me any wages while I was at Baker Row—I did not receive any money till the 21st—I paid him a further sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 8th September, and he gave me this receipt.

The 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due to me for wages, and the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for interest—I did not take possession of the Regent's Arms; it was never convenient to go, as the other manager had not left—I was constantly asking O'Neill when I was to go there—</p>

               <p>he replied I should go shortly, it was not quite convenient, as the other manager had not left, and I remained at Baker's Row—on or about 20th October I saw a man named Cress, and after some conversation with him I told O'Neill he must pay me and let me go—I told him I thought it was very strange conduct for him to have another manager in, and say nothing to me about it—I told him that Cress had told me that he had come there to be manager at Baker's Row, and as I was not wanted he had better pay me and let me go—he said he would do so—Cress did come as manager, and I remained on till O'Neill was taken into custody—during the whole time I was there I never received any more money than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—while I was there several people called about the Regent's Arms, and some about Baker's Row, and some about Burdett Road, as managers—I saw Lyons at Baker's Row very frequently—the people who called generally saw O'Neill; nobody else—I think Lyons did not interfere in the management of the business in any way—it was a very quiet little business that was done at Baker's Row—'Lyons took his meals there occasionally; generally with O'Neill—when Cress came O'Neill told me that he had taken lodgings for me at 13, Brady Street, and I went there to sleep because Cress had my room—he told me he would pay me in a fortnight, but he did not—I believed his representations that the furniture was all his own, and it was on that belief that I parted with my money.</p>

I could take the management in a week—I declined it—he said he was sorry for that, because I was a respectable young man and he should like to have me—he then suggested that I should deposit 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "I will deposit 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and have a three months' agreement, and if I find you a</p>

Lyons"—Lyons drew that up—he told me he had known O'Neill for years, that he had known him to be a thoroughly respectable hard working man, and that I should not be wrong in trusting myself in his hands; in fact, I ought to think myself lucky in meeting with such a man—I was unable to get my money back, and placed the matter in the hands of my solicitor—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the agreement that was signed—I did not see Lyons draw it, but he told me himself that he drew it up—I believe the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by O'Neill.</hi> Mason did not tell me that he had been three months in the place; I do not know whether he is here—I made no inquiry as to what the house in Baker's Row was; I have lived within three minutes' walk of it for ten years—I am in the house at present, managing it—Mr. Brand gave me a receipt for the money I paid—there was an harmonium in the house in Baker's Row—Brand gave me up that, and I have it now; you wanted it, but I said" No, I will keep it; I may want to play a tune on it"—I have the rent<lb/>book here showing the money I paid—I received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. while I was at Baker's Row—I told you that the place was a mere deception—as soon as there was a trifle in the till you went and took it out, so that it was impossible to say what the takings were; there was not sufficient left to pay the servants—after you were arrested I took my family there, and we have been managing it between us; I had your name erased and my own put up—my son goes out to work, and I have to go out too—I have not seen Mason since.</p>

I am surgeon to the M and Thames Divisions of Police, and live at Union Road, Rotherhithe—I was called early last Tuesday morning about half-past 1 o'clock to the police-station, and there saw the prosecutor and prisoner, both bleeding profusely—the prosecutor was bleeding from a trifling cut on the forehead, another on the bridge of the nose, another on the left temple, and nearly the whole of the fleshy part of his nose was separated from the bony parts, a cut beginning at the left-hand side and extending round through the nostrils; the whole of the cavities of the nose were exposed—my attention was not called to a wound in the shoulder at that time; I saw a cut in the clothes on the following day—the prisoner was likewise bleeding very much from a wound in his right hand, which had divided one of the metacarpal arteries; that was his only wound—the injuries of both had evidently been done by some such weapon as a knife—it could not have been done by falling down on anything sharp—the prisoner was very much the worse for drink, very violent—the prosecutor was sober.</p>

Bridge, and had it labelled for Waterloo, and I had occasion to go to the ladies' waiting-room here, and I thought I had seen my luggage put out on the platform, and I thought it was safe till my return; I have been to the platform and it is not there"—I said "Most probably it has been taken on to Charing Cross in error, and if you will call again in about an hour and a half I will endeavour to get it back"—she came back, but I had discovered no trace of it, and promised her that I would send it to her address, which she gave, Surrey Lodge—she said she would be very glad if I could get it that night, as it contained very valuable property—about two days afterwards John Dennison came there and said "I am the husband of the lady who lost her luggage on Saturday night; have you heard anything of it?"—I said "No—he said "My wife in her confusion said on Saturday night that it was a black box covered with canvas, but it should have been a black leather travelling trunk"—I said that I would use my best endea<lb/>vours</p>

               <p>got my trunk from the cloak-room and had it labelled for Waterloo Junction; when I got there I had to go to the ladies' waiting-room, and on my return my trunk could not be found"—Sergeant Bamett said "It is strange you should go to London Bridge when Waterloo is nearer"—she said "I always go to London Bridge"—I asked them to describe the contents of the trunk, which they did jointly, correcting each other;" he said, "My dear, we paid so much for that;" sometimes she corrected him, and gave me particulars; there was no reluctance on her part; in fact, she gave the main descriptions, and I took it down—they claimed for a scrap-book, which he said was valuable, with pictures inside and a blue gilt cover with album on front and a group of the Royal Family, and leaves, flowers, and birds—he claimed two guineas for it, and said his wife was taking it to show to her friends—I found a scrap-book answering that description at Russell's, a pawnbroker's, in Walworth Road—she also claimed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a black silk princess robe, trimmed satin down the front, and two quiltings at bottom—I found a dress answering to it at Thomson's, a pawnbroker's, 42, Praed Street—she also described a pair of pebble earrings and brooch to match, Marquis of Lome plaid, set in gold, for which she claimed 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I found articles answering that description at Attenborough's, pawnbroker's, Walworth Road—they also claimed for a prayer-book and other things, amounting altogether to 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I took the prisoner John and found at his lodgings twenty-four duplicates for things pledged just prior to the loss of this trunk—there is one lot an iron pledged on 7th October for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and another for another iron on 12th October for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was within three days of the alleged robbery—most of the pledges are for sums below 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I read the warrant to John—he said it was a false charge and the railway company would have to pay for it—I went with Barnett to arrest Arthur Dennison—I read the warrant to him—he said "I know nothing about the 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it is a scheme of my wicked old father; I did not know his game till he asked me to bring the trunk home to my place; it was locked and I did not know what was in it"—we found the trunk at his house, 19, Bowling Green Street, Kennington Lane—I inquired at Peabody Buildings, but he was not known there—the trunk was opened in my presence; it contained an old piece of carpet, five rolls of waste paper, two old commissionaires' coats, a pair of old trousers, one of the things claimed in the list he gave me—the box was locked; we broke it open.</p>

I am a widow, and live at 3, King's Bench Walk, Blackfriars Road—on 25th December I went out about 7 p.m., leaving no one in the house—I came back about 9.30, and found the house as I left it—I went out again, and returned at 10 30—I found the prisoners in my room—the shutters and window were open—the street-door was wide open—I afterwards examined the lock, which was knocked off when I got in—there is a second door farther in on the right-hand aide, and I found in my room Henry Davis standing with his back towards the door, and John Davis by the side of the cupboard—I said "For God's sake, whoever it is let me get a light"—when I'd got a lucifer, I said to John Davis," Jack, how came you in my room? how dare you take that liberty?"—he said" I've come for some things"—I said" Let your wife come for them"—I had an iron foot and a pail belonging to the prisoner, but he did not come for them before—Henry took off his coat to fight—Jack said "Don't hit her, I won't allow you to hit her because she will make a sneeze of it"—then my lad went out with them—I went for a policeman, but could not see one, and came back—I missed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., my rent money, from a box which had not been locked—I had examined the box at 9.30, and found it safe—I saw Henry Davis at the station the same night—both were drunk—Henry was more sober than Jack. <hi rend="italic">Henry Davis's Defence,</hi> The door was six inches open, and I shoved it.</p>
