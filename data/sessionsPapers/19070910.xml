                  </hi>, porter, employed by Pickford's. On July 30 about 25 to 9 a.m. I was in Falcon Street, Aldersgate, when I saw a London and North-Western Railway van. The carman in charge of the van left it to deliver a parcel, when I saw Saunders jump on the Shafts, take a parcel from the van, walk into Aldersgate Street, and give back turnings, to Aldersgate Street Station. I followed, and at the railway station I spoke a constable. He took hold of the two prisoners, but they wrenched themselves away and ran off in different directions.</p>
               <p>To Saunders. I do not know whether when the constable got you you made any effort to escape. I am certain you are the man who took the parcel. I never lost sight of you all the time.</p>

                  </persName>, New Scotland Yard. Early in June last, in company with Sergeant Story, I saw Alfred Asser and another man I believe to be Sims in the City Road. Alfred Asser entered a metal shop and rejoined the other. I spoke to the shop<lb/>man, and, in consequence of what he told me I followed them through a number of back streets to 19, Digby Walk, Green Street, Bethnal-Green. David Asser opened the door to them, remained some time looking up and down the street and then re-entered. David Thomas Asser afterwards came out and after a time returned. With Story I kept observation on the house up to July 23. I have seen the whole of the prisoners enter and leave the house frequently and from the rear of an empty house, 13, Green Street, I have seen Alfred Asser, Sims, and Reynolds on several occasions making coins. On July 22 I saw Alfred Asser mixing silver sand with water in the back yard. On July 23, shortly after nine a.m., Sims entered by the front door, let in by David Asser. I afterwards saw him with Alfred and David Asser in the kitchen, Sims and Alfred Asser seated at the window in the presence of David polishing what ap<lb/>peared to be coins and wrapping them in white tissue paper. Alfred and Sims then left the house. Shortly afterwards Reynolds arrived, stayed about ten minutes, and then proceeded to a metal shop in Old Street. On his leaving the shop I ascertained what he had pur<lb/>chased and returned to 13, Green Street, Whence I saw him in the kitchen of 19, Digby walk talking to David Asser and a woman. He went upstairs and remained there until about 4.30 p.m. On that day I applied for a search warrant. On July 24, at 9.30 a.m., Sims entered at the front door, was joined by Alfred Asser, remained some time, and left. At there p.m. I saw Alfred Asser lying on a bed in the first floor back room. He remained there till five p.m., when he came downstairs with something white like a mould in his hand, broke it up, and threw it in the dustbin in the yard. I saw David Asser, Alfred Asser, Sims, and Reynolds in the first floor bed-room, Alfred Asser, Sims, and Reynolds seated on the bed polishing coins, David looking on. I then sent Story for assistance, sur<lb/>rounded the house, and entered. Alfred Asser was in the yard, David Asser in the kitchen, Sims and Reynolds were sitting on the bed in the first floor back room. Sims jumped out of the window and was taken by a constable. On the bed were eight counterfeit</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100008"/>
               <p>half-crowns in front of Reynolds. The prisoners were all taken to the yard and detained, David Asser being taken in the first floor front room. We searched the house. On the bed in the back room was a tin box containing 33 half-crowns as from the mould and five geats or portions of the metal which fill up the pouring hole broken off from the coins; 26 of the coins were dated 1901 and the rest 1889. In the front room I found eight counterfeit half-crowns of 1901 in a jug on the top of the cupboard, the coins having been filed but not quite finished. In the same jug were 13 florins clipped and filed, and showing that they had just been taken from the solution. In another jug was some metal and copper wire. I also found a saucepan with metal inside, four files showing extensive use, six spoons partially melted off, and silver sand. In the kitchen I found a tin box with six half-crowns and two florins finished for uttering. In the dust-bin were portions of plaster of paris, on one of which the milling is perceptible. I told the prisoners they would be charged with being concerned in possessing and making 72 counter<lb/>feit coins. They were taken to the station and formally charged, when the three prisoners Asser gave their address as 19, Digby Walk, Sims gave his correct address, and Reynolds gave his father's address.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Alfred Asser asked me to fetch the man from the metal shop to identify him. I am not positive I saw Sims with Alfred Asser in the City Road. I have seen Reynolds go several times to the metal shop. I did not know he had been convicted before until after the arrest. I never said of Reynolds, "We never thought to get this fellow here." Prisoners could not see us in the house in Green Street, as we whitewashed the windows and made small holes to look through.</p>

                  </persName>, New Scotland Yard. Early in June I saw Alfred Asser with a man I believe to be Sims enter a metal shop. I followed them to 19, Digby Walk, and afterwards took park in the observation on that house and in the search on July 24, when the articles produced were found. I confirm Yeo's evidence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not know the prisoners prior to the obser<lb/>vation. I am positive I saw Reynolds enter the metal shop in the City Road on several occasions, generally by himself. From inquiry at the shop I learnt that he purchased metal there. I recollect his asking at the police court for the man to be brought to identify him. I saw him several times in 19, Digby Walk up and down stairs, but I have not seen him working on the coins. We could see right into the back bedroom from Green Street. When I entered the room there was only one of the prisoners there, but just priviously I saw the others there. I cannot say whether David Asser was cooking the dinner. I did not seen David Thomas Asser until he was in custody. When the prisoners were taken to the station I was not in company with a man who had had penal servitude. The key of the empty house was in charge of a tailor, from whom we had it from time to</p>

David Asser was lodging at the house when the pre<lb/>vious tenant was leaving. He applied to rent the house and I let it to him at 8s. a week from December 1, 1906. Mrs. Asser generally paid the rent. David paid me once or twice and Alfred Asser paid me once.</p>

                  </hi>, Inspector of Counterfeit Coins to H.M. Mint. I have examined 55 half-crowns and 15 florins (produced). They are all counterfeit. The 55 half-crowns are made from two moulds and the florins from one. There are six gests, the super<lb/>fluous metal formed in the aperture of the mould and attached to the coin. The coin is perfected with a file. Piece of plaster of paris produced shows a slight indication of the milling, but I could not say what coin it was made for. The saucepan contains metal. The jug contains copper wire, some of which has been used in the battery for plating purposes. Some of the coins are very rough, others nearly completed. They are good specimens, especially the half-crowns. Silver sand is used for polishing, Files for completing the coin. The spoons are used for pouring the metal into the mould, and some of them have metal sticking to them. One spoon has been used for mixing the plaster of paris. The broken bits of plaster of paris might be a part of a mould.</p>
               <p>Statement of Alfred Asser. I plead guilty to have in counterfeit coins. My father and brother are innocent. They have never seen the thing in their life. My father and brother had just come home.</p>
               <p>Statement of Sims. I looked at the coins, but had never seen any<lb/>thing like them before he asked me to look at them.</p>
               <p>Statement of Reynolds. Alfred Asser told me he had the things given him to mind. I knew nothing of them in my life.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath). On July 20, three days before the arrest, I was going for a walk along Mile End Road when I went into a public-house and met a man who was in possession of these</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100010"/>
               <p>things. He said, "Hullo, Alf, are you going to have a drink?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Alf, would you mind these coins for me?" and I also said, "Yes." He handed me a cloth bag containing these coins, saucepan, files, silver sand, copper wire, a little bit of plaster of paris, a few spoons, a candle, and one jug. We then left the public-house and I took the things straight up to my bedroom. This man came round to my house on July 22 and whistled up at my window. I came down and said to him, "Come away from the door. I do not want my old people to know anything about it. If they knew I was doing wrong they would turn me out." The next day I met Sims in Green Street; we walked along for three minutes and met Reynolds against his father's stall. I said to Sims and Reynolds, "Come round to my house at half-past four and I will show you something I have been minding for a man." They came round at 4.30 when I was alone in the house and I got the bag of things from under my bed and started showing them. No sooner did Sims see the things than he said, "Alf, I would not have anything to do with them Reynolds said, I would aim them over the canal out of the way." While we were looking at them my brother came home from work, and three or four minutes afterwards my father, who is 65 years of age, came in to have a rest. They were not in the place five minutes before my place was surrounded by the police and they took everyone who was in the house at the time. I gave information for the arrest of this man while I was waiting on trial—I expected him in every minute—therefore I should have my revenge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not know the man's name—he has been in trouble—I had known him for three weeks. I did not know he had been in trouble then; I was told so in Green Street, where he had been seen. He did not show me the things, simply gave them to me in a bag. I asked no questions. I kept them under my bed so that no one should see them at home. My two little brothers sleep in my room—not the prisoner David Thomas Asser. None of the things were taken to kitchen. The police were so excited when they came in—I believe they were drunk—they do not know where they found the things. Everything was on my bed when the place was entered. It is untrue to say that any coins were found in the front bedroom or in the kitchen. I did not go down to the back door and break up anything and throw it in the dust<lb/>bin—it is untrue. I did not do anything. I was work<lb/>ing with the things—I was going to throw them in night I was only looking at them, not polishing them our anything. I was work<lb/>ing not in the habit of going into metal shops. I never went into metal shops. I never went into the metal shop in the City Road. The things remained in the cloth bag under my bed until I took them out to show them to the other prisoners when the police came.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100011"/>
               <p>come round at 4.30 and he would show me something. I went up to his bedroom on the first floor at 4.30 p.m. and he fetched these things out. I saw the coins and said, "The best thing you can do is to have nothing to do with them." I remained in the house about half an hour sitting on the bed. I was rubbing one of the coins to remove a yellow mark when the police came up shouting. I looked down the stairs, there were a lot of police rushing up like a lot of madmen. I thought the best I could do was to jump out of the window so as not to get myself in trouble.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have only known the Asseres as public-house sequaintances for three or four weeks. I have never been to their house till the day of the arrest. Alfred Asser showed me eight half-crowns. There were some boxes lying on the table, and I picked up one of the half-crowns. He had the things in a bag about two feet square, and he took them out and put them on the bed. I saw no saucepan, florins spoons, files, copper wire, or mould. I have never been with Reynolds to metal shops. The only times I was in the house was the day I was arrested.</p>

Alfred Asser told me about the things, and asked me to come round in the after<lb/>noon, which I did, and he showed me the things in his bedroom. I said, "The best thing you can do for the sake of your old father and mother is to get rid of them." He took the bag from under his bed and pulled the coins out. I saw they were bad half-crowns. He told me a man called George had given him them to mind, that George had come round for them and he would not give them up without the money George had promised to give him for minding them, and that George had said, "If you do not give me them things you and your old people will suffer for it." Alfred Asser had gone down-stairs to have a wash, and when the police came in there were only Sims and myself in the room. When the police came in they said "We are luckier than we thought. We never thought of seeing this fellow here" (meaning me). Story said to a constable, "I should never have known anything about this only lately—last night." They took us all into the yard and Yeo read the search warrant and said. "You can think who you like who shopped you—who has put you away—but do not think it is the tailor in Green Street"—that is the man who gave them the key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When Alfred Asser met me on July 24 he said, "I have been made a tool of by this here man; he gave me these things to mind." He said, "Come round and I will show you some<lb/>thing that will surprise you." I may have called on Asser to ask him to go to a music hall, but I never was in the house before the day of the arrest. I have never been to Young's, in the City Road, and never bought any tin in a metal shop, or entered a metal shop in my life. I have known the Assers all my life, and am a great</p>

               <p>friend of Alfred Asser. I may have gone into the house and had a cut of tea on Sunday. I am positive I was not there the day before the arrest. When I got into the bedroom Alfred Asser pulled a bag from under the bed and took a few coins out. I saw the police take the tin box from under the pillow. The tin box was not in the kitchen. Everything that Yeo says about me is untrue. I have seen the man George in the neighbourhood and have heard he has been convicted.</p>

On that day she wrote a letter addressed to, "The Manageress, Universal Hair Coy., 84, Foxbury Road, Brockly, Kent," ordering some arti<lb/>ficial hair, and enclosing this postal order. I posted the letter at a pillar-box in Finchley Road, about 11 p.m. on July 26. The order was quite blank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. On august 20 I gave evidence at the police court. It was 10 or 14 days before that that I was first spoken to by Mr. Hill. I cannot identify the postal order.

A few moments afterwards Mrs. Mepham came out and walked to the post office at 351 Lordship Lane, about 70 yards from the "Plough." I followed her, and saw her present and receive payment for a postal order for 15s. The order produced bearing the name "Humm" is the one she cashed. I spoke to her after she had taken the money. I obtained possession of the order and left the office with her. We met prisoner walking towards us. I said, "You are Mr. Mepham." He said, "Oh, yes, I gave her that, and said "your wife has just presented and revived payment of this postal order for 15s. in a name other than mepham." I showed him the order. He said, "Oh Yes I gave her that, and take all blame, if any." He and his wife then went with me to the General Post Office, where they were seen by Mr. Hill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner was under observation by me and James for ten days. He was the only man we had instructions to watch.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk in the Secretary's Department, General Post Office. There having been complaints of losses of letters pass<lb/>ing through the Brockley postmen's office, I was instructed to in<lb/>vestigate. I directed Davis and James to keep prisoner under obser<lb/>vation. In the evening of July 27 I saw prisoner at the General Post Office. I told him who I was, and cautioned him. I showed him the postal order produced, and said, "Your wife states that you gave her this order. How did it come into your possession?" He said, "I bought it this morning about 20 past 10." I said, "At what office?" He said, "I bought it from a traveller's coachman in Hare-field Road, Brockley, on my way home." I said, "What is his name and address?" He said, "I do not know. I only know him as a traveller's coachman. I do not know his employer. He appears to be a draper's traveller. I have only spoken to him two or three times." I asked, "In what circumstances did you buy the order, and how much did you give for it?" He said, "I gave full value—15s.—for it. He was staying there with his horse, and I was talking to him and he said he wanted to change the order. I did not change it there and then, but I gave him the full value for it." I asked if the handwriting "M. Humm" on the order was his. He said, "No, it was filled in when I had it." I asked him whether he could tell me where the coachman could be found. He said, "No. He comes to Brockley about once a week. It is now about three weeks since I saw him." I asked prisoner to do some writing for me. He consented, and wrote at my dictation the signatures on the sheet produced. I was not satisfied with the matter, and gave prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner has been 24 years in the service. He has four good conduct stripes; he has risen from the position of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100015"/>
               <p>telegraph boy to be assistant head postman at a salary of 46s. a week. As acting head postman at Brockley it would be his duty to preside over the sorting, not himself to sort. His 24 years' ser<lb/>vice would count towards pension, and if convicted of any set of dishonesty the accruing right to pension would be absolutely lost. I asked him if he had any objection to being searched, and to have his house searched; he consented, and the searches were made; his wife also turned out her pockets; no covering letter, or postal orders, or any thing at all suspicious was found. I gave prisoner into cus<lb/>tody on the charge of stealing from or out of a post letter a valuable security. At that time I did not know that the order had been stolen. I gave him into custody because he could not give any satisfactory account of his possession of the order. I did not know that it was illegal to give a person into custody merely on suspicion. I have not tried to "build up" a case against prisoner. I made a written report, and the matter then passed into the hands of the Solicitor to the Post Office. I do not remember prisoner saying, 'You are doing me a great injustice." The names that prisoner wrote at my dictation were those on about a dozen orders that had passed through the Brockley office and had been stolen; I wanted prisoner's writing to compare it with the writing of the name 'Humm."</p>

                  </hi> (Prisoner on catch), after detailing his Post Office career and position, as spoken to by Mr. Hill, said: On July 27 I was doing head postman's duty at Brockley; on that morning there were 28 sorters and three principal postmen in the office; my duty was to superintend the work of these men, not to do any sorting myself. I went off duty at ten a.m., and left the office about ten past ten. On my way home I met a traveller's coachman with whom I was on speaking terms; he was standing in Harefield Road with his horse and brougham. He had a postal order which he wanted me to cash; he said he could not leave his horses the post-office was about three minutes' walk away. I told him I could not change the order; he said, "If you will change it I will take 14s. 6d. for it"; I said, "No, you are a working man like myself"; then I looked at the order and saw it was all right, and I gave him 15s. for it; he offered me the price of a drink, and I would not even take that. Twice before I had seen this man in Harefield Road, apparently having his lunch; on another occasion I have met him at the "Shakespeare" public-house and had a drink with him; after the I used to say, "Good morning" when I met him. He was a rather short man, with a heavy moustache, black hair, wearing the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100016"/>
               <p>ordinary coachman's coat and boots, plain trousers, and a top hat. I never knew the name or address of the man or of his employer. When I took the order it already had the name, "M. Humm" filled in. I gave the order to my wife as part of my wages; I had received my wages on the 26th. The account given by Davis of my movements on the 27th is correct. I was taking my wife and children out for a ride; we were going to Dulwich Park. As we were in Lordship Lane my wife said, "There is a baker's shop here; I will take some cakes into the park for the children." I looked and saw that the shop was also a post-office; I said, "You might change the postal order as well." On meeting the messengers, what I said to them was, "I gave my wife the order; if there is anything wrong with it, I take the responsibility." (Prisoner substantially agreed with Hill's account of the interview at the General Post Office.) When Hill told me he should give me into custody I said, "You are doing me a great injustice; I know nothing whatever about it." The postal orders shown to me by Hill I had never seen before in my life; (orders produced) there is no writing of mine on any of them. I have never seen a letter from Mrs. Gooli to the Universal Hair Company.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I first spoke to this coachman about three or four weeks before this affair. You may say that he was an acquaint<lb/>ance of mine, but I never thought of inquiring for his name or address or where he was employed. My suspicions were not aroused in any way. It was only three minutes' walk to the post-office and I might have gone and cashed it, but I was on my way home and did not want to retrace my steps; I did not need the money at the moment. I have been out on bail since July 30. I have made every effort to find the coachman and failed.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I have inquired for this man all through Brockley, also at Forest Hill, where I once saw him pass; I have been all round Lewisham, New Cross, Deptford, and Greenwich; also to different drapers in St. Paul's Churchyard and Oxford Street; I have advertised for him, but had no replies. As a postman I am on nodding terms with a great many people whose names I do not know. I admit that I may have been indiscreet in changing this order, but my suspicions were not aroused.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of Henry Lucas, manager of the "Black Eagle," 114, Brick Lane. I have known the prisoner for about four months as a customer. On July 17, 1907, she had a glass of ale (1d.) and paid for it with a 2s. piece and I gave her 1s. 11d. change. After she had left I tested it with Aquafortis and found it bad. My husband broke it up and threw the pieces away. I think the date of the coin was "1906." On Saturday, July 20, prisoner called with a jug for has a pint of ale (1d.) and tendered the florin produced. I tested it, found it bad, and asked her where she got it from. She said she must have got it in the Lane with some fish. I asked her where she got the one she brought on Wednesday—she said she must have got that in the Lane. A policeman was fetched and took the pri<lb/>soner into custody. Prisoner was in the habit of coming in the afternoon for half a pint of ale in a jug.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The pennyworth of ale was an accustomed pur<lb/>chase. I knew prisoner lived near. She sometimes sent her little girl for beer. On July 20, when she gave the coin, I asked her to wait and she did. When the policeman came she said, "I must go home to my three little children." She spoke in Jewish, not plain English.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. The coin was good enough to deceive my wife. It had practically no ring in it. Prisoner has been a customer on and off for a half pint of ale.</p>

Mrs. Lucas said, "This woman has just come into the bar, called for half a pint of ale, and given me a bad 2s. piece," handing me the coin produced, which I saw was bad. Prisoner said she got it in the Lane buying fish Mrs. Lucas said prisoner had given her another bad florin on Wednesday. I asked prisoner where she had got that, and she said that she might have got that in the Lane also, buying fish. Is reply to the charge she said she might have got both coins in the Lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There are many complaints about bad florins being circulated in the district. Prisoner gave her correct name and address. I know she is living in Herman Street with her three little children. She said at the police court that her husband was in an asylum maintained by the Jewish Board of Guardians.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner said he must have got it from his em<lb/>ployer, and that perhaps the one he had given to Mrs. Wilkinson was bad too. Wilkinson was bad too.

He said, I know where I got it from Give it me back I said "I cannot do that." He said, "I gave the wife one as a deposit on the balls.

The landlord said prisoner had passed two bad florins, one to Mrs. Wilkinson as a deposit on bagatelle balls and the other to Smith and called for a pot of ale. The coins were handed to me. Prisoner said, "I gave Mrs. Wilkin<lb/>son a 2s. piece and I also gave Smith the 2s. peice. I did not know they were bad. I must have had them from my employers last Thurs<lb/>day or Friday night." I then arrested prisoner, took him to the station, and found a third bad florin on him, 2s. 6d. in good silver, and 1 1/2d. in bronze. He was charged, and said, I am innocent of the crime. I did give Mrs. Wilkinson a 2s. piece, and also one to pay for the beer."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prosecutor took two or three minutes to fetch me. Prisoner made no objection to being searched. Prisoner waited to be arrested and made no attempt to escape. (To the Judge.) The had florin was with the good money in his left trousers pocket. (To Mr. Lawrie.) I said at the police court that I told Wilkinson when he handed me the money I thought it was a good one.</p>

                  </hi>, Inspector of Counterfeit Coins to H.M. Mint. The three florins produced are counterfeit; two are from the same mould. They are rather rough imitations.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I believe from information that a great many bad florins have been circulated—it is a favoured denomination. I gave evidence with regard to a gang of coiners who have been sen<lb/>tenced to-day, and if the amount of metal they are said to have bought has been used, a great number of bad coins must have been turned out every week.</p>
               <p>(Thursday, September 12.)</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant said he thought that there was not sufficient reason to doubt the prisoner's statement that he did not know the coins were bad, and that, as the prosecution did not call the person from whom prisoner said he got the money, he did not think the prisoner's conduct was inconsistent with that of an honest man.</p>

               <p>Reference was made to the Pawnbrokers Act of 1872 and to the Sale of Goods Act.

I read the warrant to him and, in reply, he made a long statement, in which he admitted that the jewellery had been pawned comporarily. I found upon him a ticket relating to a bag left at victoria Station, whither I went on the following day. From his bag I produce seven pawnbroker's contract notes, which correspend with his statement as to where he had pawned the things. I also found in the bag two diamond brooches, a diamond and pearl ring, a muff chain, and a bracelet. I showed them to prisoner, who said they were the property of Mr. Reyne, the prosecutor. I also produce a specimen of visiting cards which I found in his bag with the name of the Right Hon. W.J.H. Tremayne, of New York. Prisoner's real name is Taylor. I also produce some "appro," notes found in his bag relating to some of the jewellery from the prosecutor. He had on him six £10 notes, a £5 note and £2 15s. in money. I have been unsuccessful in tracing the notes. I also found a ticket relating to a bag at Brighton. It contained a number of papers, but nothing connected with this case. The date of the first of the "appro," notes is July 19.</p>

Prisoner's explanation of that was that he had already sold it to the lady, who could not afford to pay for it, and he was to pledge it for the balance which she was supposed to own him.

                  </hi>. 3, Dyers' Buildings, Holborn. I identify all my jewellery that has been produced. Prisoner was for some time in my employment as a diamond setter. On July 19 he obtained from me four diamond pendants, which he stated he wanted for a customer in Manchester. I have never been paid the value of them. As far as I can recollect he said he had a lady customer in Manchester who wanted a diamond pendant or two, so I let him have four for her to choose from. My manager, Mr. Brown, was in the room at the time. I had previously let him have jewels to sell on my behalf. I gave him an "appro." note with the pendants. On July 24 I received a letter from Belmore House, Regent's Park, stating that prisoner was to go to Captain O'Shea the following day (Thursday), when he had made arrangements for his wife to see a pendant or two. He had spoken to me months before of Captain O'Shea, who, he said, was an old friend of his father's and lived at a house in Bromley, and was a very rich man, and kept horses and carriages and servants. Pri<lb/>soner called on July 25 and said he wanted the things at once. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100025"/>
               <p>told him he could not have them before two o'clock or half-past, par<lb/>haps three o'clock. He called again after dinner and took the things away a tiars, three necklets, half-hoop diamond ring, and two brooches. A ring and muff chain he had had previously. He said that Captain O'Shea was in a position to pay for any jewelley, how<lb/>ever costly, and on the strength of that statement I let him have the things. From that date I saw nothing of him until I saw him in the police court on August 3. In respect of some portion of that jewellery which was taken away on July 25 I gave prisoner the "appro." note produced. The total value of the things is £1,602. He asked me to put £100 on each article for his own profit; if it was a £300 article he wanted me to put it at £400, so that he might sell it better. In the evening I received a letter from prisoner, purporting to be written from "The Limes," Bromley, stating that he had sold a tiara at a very good price and had a very good chance of selling another one, as Captain O'Shea's sister wanted to buy one, and he (prisoner) was to go to the house on the following day to show her what he had. Prisoner also said he would be back in town either to-morrow (Friday) evening or Saturday morning, when he would know about the pendants and bottle up all accounts. On July 29 I received a letter from prisoner, stating that he had had an offer of £1,650 for the whole of the jewellery, and he gave an address in the letter to which I was to wire him. On the 30th I had a telegram to the effect that he had only just received a replay, and was very dis<lb/>gusted after all the trouble he had taken, that he was coming straight home, and would never try to sell anything again. After that I heard nothing of him. He did not turn up next day. I have not received any of the Jewellery back nor any payment.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I know that you were singing at Ascot as a pierrot—you told me so. I let you have some articles to take to Windsor to sell. I remember that on July 24 you showed me a telegram with reference to a tiara but can you prove that was from Captain O'Shes? You told me you were going to see Captain O'Shes. When you spoke to me about Captain O'Shea I said if you would bring the man to my place I would take him to one of my customers and he could sell him what he liked. I remember that you said that if you could sell a tiara you would want £50 out of it for yourself. The £100 additional I was to put on the articles was supposed to be your profit. As to whether until this happening you have never noted in a dis<lb/>honest way towards me, I decline to answer the question. There is no such man as this Captain O'Shea in the kingdom.</p>
               <p>To the Court. Prisoner was in my employment about twelve months. Previously to that I had frequently done business with him. He had occasionally had goods to sell to a small amount. The total value of what he had to sell would perhaps be £400 or £500. He had perhaps £50 or £60 at at time.</p>

                  </hi>, manager to last witness. I was present on July 19 when prisoner called for the jewellery for Manchester. He</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100026"/>
               <p>said he wanted two pendants to show a customer, but further than packing them I did not have much to do with the transaction. On July 25 Mr. Reyne showed me a letter he had received from Taylor asking for one or two necklets and I procured the goods. At about 1.30, I think when I came back, Taylor was there and he saw the things then. He said he wanted them to show to Captain O'shea, who lived at "The Limes," Bromley. He said that Mrs. O'shea was a very nice lady. On July 30 I went to Bromley to try and find this place £"The Limes." I did not come across any person of the name of Captain O'shea. I went to five places called "The Limes" at Bromley in different roads. They were all houses of about £35 a year. I went to another "Limes" at Shortlands, the station before you come to Bromley, but there was no Captain O'shea there. I called on two occasions at Albert street Regent's Park, and saw prisoner's father and mother. On August 8 I again went to Bromley with a view to finding Captain O'Shea, but failed to do so. I should say I spent seven hours in the search on each occasion. My impress<lb/>sion is that the goods taken away by prisoner were to be returned on the following morning.</p>
               <p>The pawnbrokers recalled stated that the jewellery was pawned on July 25, between half-past four and half-past five.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath) read a long statement, in which he said that, owing to business being at a standstill, and having practically nothing to do, he accepted an engagement to sing as a Pierrot in a troupe at Windsor and Ascot during the race week of this year. Knowing that several of his private customers would in all probability be visiting there, he thought it a good opportunity to dispose of some jewellery, so he asked Mr. Reyne and other gentle me if they would let him have a few articles on approbation, and they did so. The troupe lodged at Windsor, and he went to a large hotel opposite Windsor Castle where, meeting some friends, he showed them his stock. A gentleman who was a stranger to him examined the articles, and selecting three, paid for them, the amount being £24. This gentleman asked several questions about the jewellary business, and prisoner told him he could supply through his firms any article of jewellery, large or small, and gave him Mr. Reyne's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100027"/>
               <p>card. The gentleman gave his name as Captain O'Shes, of "The Limes," Bromley, and said that any jewellary the required he would be pleased to give prisoner the first opportunity of supplying as he liked the style of the articles and they seemed reasonable in price. reasonable in price. He also said he would be pleased to recommend prisoner to any of his friends. Prisoner went on to say that his father was a cab-driver and had been privileged to drive many well-known gentlemen, and his father had often spoken to him of a gentleman, and his father had often spoken to him of a gentleman named O'Shee, whom he knew to be a wealthy gentleman. In dealing with the gentleman at Windsor he was throughly under the impression that he was dealing with the gentleman his father knew, and had the castest faith and trust in him. In conversation Captain O Shea said he had brought out a system of backing horses by which a good income could be made, provided one had the brains to get the necess<lb/>sary information and capital to commence with. O'Shea said he was very well known in racing circles, and three gentlemen to whom he introduced prisoner testified to this fact. O'Shes explained the system and invited any of those present to join him as partners, on the condition that they should pay him 10 per cent of all winnings for using his system. Three friends of his each gave him £50 and O'Shes invited prisoner to do the same, and as the system seemed a safe investment prisoner gave him £40 and O'Shes lent him the other £10 in order that he might have an equal share with the other three. O'Shes said that he himself was investing £600 in the system and showed them the money in six notes. As prisoner could not bet himself owing to performing on the course as a pierrot, it was ar<lb/>ranged that a man should come to the corner of the grand stand where he was performing and tell him the name of the horse that had been backed be forming and tell him the name of the horse that had been backed before each race. This was done with one exception when he did not know until after the race which horse had won, which seemed to prove their good faith. At first they won, but even<lb/>tually the money was all lost, Captain O'Shea saying that the loss wa due to insufficient capital. O'Shea then suggested that they should again put £50 each, saying that they were certain of winning. The other gentlemen agreed and gave him the money, but prisoner said he could not join them as he had no more money. O'Shes said it was a pity prisoner should not have the opportunity of recovering his loss and offered to lend him money, saying that he could repay him in his own time. Prisoner accepted and gave an I.O.U. for the money, which was again lost in the last two days. Prisoner heard nothing of O'Shea for a week or two, when he wrote asking him if he could pay his debt. He replied that he was unable to do so and O'Shea said he would expect it in a month. Prisoner met O'Shea afterwards in London and spent many evenings with him and the three gentlemen he had met at Windsor. O'Shea took him for many rides in his motor-car and always treated him in a perfectly gentlemanly manner. Prisoner sold them several small articles which they paid him for. They told him they were following the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100028"/>
               <p>system and doing fairly well over it. The only time it had failed was at Ascot, and invited him to try again, but he told them he was in debt and could not borrow again. That was about July 24, when he was going to work as usual. On the morning of that day, just before lunch time, Mr. Reyne handed him a telegram from Captain O'Shea, asking him to go to lunch at the raleigh club, Regent Street, with reference to a tiars. He showed the wire to Mr. Reyne and asked if he could spare him, and Mr. Reyne said "Yes, "men<lb/>tioning that if he should be successful in getting an order he would be pleased to get him one or two tiaras to show to Mrs. O'Shea. He met Captain O'Shea outside the Trocadero Restaurant in Shaftesbury Avenue, and went there to lunch with him, as he said it would be more private than the club. Captain O'Shea then told him he wanted a tiars for his wife, costing about £350, and would not go to more, and asked him if he could get one or two on the following day, as his wife was coming from Bournemouth, and he would like her to see one. Captain O'Shea invited him to dinner at "The Limes" the fol<lb/>lowing evening saying that it would be a good introduction to his friends, suggesting also that prisoner should bring a few other articles to show them. Prisoner wrote to Mr. Reyne, telling him what had occurred. With a view to clearing his debt to O'Shea he stipulated with Mr. Reyne that if he sold a necklace he should have £50 out of it, and it was arranged between Mr. Reyne and himself to put an extra £50 on each article above the price they were quoted at to him. At the shop the next day Mr. Reyne entrusted him with one tiars, three necklaces, and the small brooch which was found in his bag at the police station. On leaving the office en route for Charing Cross Station he met Captain O'Shea, who was sorry to say that Mrs. O'Shea had been detained and would not be in town until sun<lb/>day, and asked prisoner to dine with him then. Going to the Hol<lb/>born Restaurant, prisoner showed the articles to Captain O'Shea, who chose the tiara there and then. Captain O'Shea also said he would like to show the other articles to his sisters, and if they were satis<lb/>factory he would probably buy the lot. After conversation Captain O'Shea said he had that morning seen a friend, who was a trainer of horses, and had told him of a horse that had been specially trained for a race at Liverpool on the following day, but said he would not be able to take advantage of the knowledge, as he was short of ready money until Saturday, when he had a big cheque coming in, adding that if he could borrow £400 until then he could make a big fortune with it. He then said to prisoner: "You can do me a great favour if you will. You will have to keep the articles until Saturday to show my sisters. Will you pledge them for me for £400, so that I can back this horse to-morrow." Prisoner told him he did not think it proper to do it, as they were not his articles. O'Shea then said, "I know I am asking you to do me a great favour, but you know the name I bear everywhere, and you need not be afraid, as I can faithfully promise to redeem them on Saturday; in fact, I must</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100029"/>
               <p>to show them to my sisters and to Mrs. O'Shea, so you will not run any risk, and you can come to Liverpool with me if you like to see that everything is straightforward, and it will save me borrowing from my friends. If you will do this for me I will forgive you the £50 debt, and if the horse wins I will make you a present of another £50." Prisoner, throughly believing O'Shea to be the man his father had told him of, and being anxious to rid himself of a debt which had worried him, agreed to pledge the articles on the condi<lb/>tion that O'Shea would redeem them on the Saturday at all costs. He accordingly took a cab to Dodd's, the pawnbrokers, in Theobald's Road, where he pledged the two necklaces for £270, Captain O'Shea waiting outside. Thence he drove to Robinson's in Mortimer Street, where he pledged a necklace for £120. The money in both instances was handed to Captain O'Shea. He then went to Bromley with Cap<lb/>tain O'Shea, but as the latter said there was no one at "The Limes" to get them dinner so late they had dinner at an hotel. From there he wired to Mr. Reyne, telling him that he had sold one necklace and was going to show the others. Next day he travelled to Liverpool with Captain O'Shea, and there met the three gentlemen he had met at Windsor, one of them being Captain O'Shea's commissioner. They went into the paddock, and there met the trainer who had told Cap<lb/>tain O'Shea about the horse. The trainer said something privately to Captain O'Shea, who immediately gave the commissioner money, in<lb/>structing him to put it on the horse at the best price obtainable. The commissioner thereupon went into Tattersall's ring to execute the commission, Captain O'Shea remarking that he always backed his horses like this. The horse lost and all the money was gone. Prisoner and O'Shea came back together to Crewe, where prisoner left him to go to Manchester to see a customer about a ring and pendant an arrangement being made to meet the following morning to redeem the articles as promised. On the following morn<lb/>ing Captain O'Shea said his cheque had not arrived, and, owing to a mistake, he would not have it for another week. Prisoner said he would have to get them for him at once as he had to return them. Captain O'Shea said he was sorry, but could not do so, and to save prisoner getting into trouble, he would buy the lot as he was sure they would suit the ladies, and offered £1,650 for them, saying that he would pay for them on August 25, as he paid all debts, large or small, on the 25th of the month. Prisoner told O'Shea he would have to consult his governor, and asked whether, if the offer was refused, O'Shea would redeem the articles at once. He said, "Yes, of course, I will; I will borrow it if needs be. I have plenty of money, but I cannot get it for a week or so. I do not want to get you into any trouble, and if the offer is refused then I will get them at once and pay you for the one for Mrs. O'Shea." Prisoner wrote to Mr. Reyne telling him of the offer, and asking him to write him to Brighton. O'Shea then said, "Pledge the other tiares and I will try to get some money at Newbury races. I cannot always lose and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100030"/>
               <p>I shall not know the result from your governor until Monday. An<lb/>other £100 or £200 will not make any difference." Prisoner accord<lb/>ingly pledged the tiara for £85 at Gill's in the Hampstead Road, O'Shea said that would hardly be enough and asked him to pledge the pendants which he had in his bag to get a little more capital, and eventually persuaded him to pledge two pendants and two rings of his own, guaranteeing to redeem them with the other things, Prisoner gave O'Shea the money and himself went to Newbury, and again the money was lost. They parted on the course, Captain O'Shea going to his wife at Brighton and prisoner returning to London. It was arranged that prisoner should go to Brighton the next day, and he did so, returning in the evening. On the following (Monday) morning he received a wire from Captain O'Shea asking him to meet him early. He did so, and Captain O'Shea persuaded him to pledge the other two pendants and the ring to have one more try at Goodwood on a horse owned by a friend of his, agreeing to buy all the articles pledged, whether the offer was accepted or not. The same day prisoner went to Brighton, where he saw Mrs. O'Shea but as the necklets were in pawn he asked Captain O Shea not to mention them until they were redeemed. Mrs. O'Shea said she was going to the Irish Exhibition with O'Shea's sisters, and he was to follow. Prisoner then received a telegram from Mr. Reyne declining the offer, whereupon O'Shea flew into a rage, and said he was dis<lb/>gusted at being refused three weeks' credit, and would have nothing more to do with the matter. Prisoner reminded O'Shea that he had agreed to purchase one of the necklets and the other things that had been pawned, whether the offer was accepted or not, and said he would get into trouble if the things were not returned. Eventually O'Shea said that he had spoken in a temper and would not get pri<lb/>soner into trouble after obliging him as he had, but would keep his promise. He also said he was going to Goodwood on the following day, where he had arranged with his friends to back a horse with money prisoner had given him. If the horse won he said prisoner could at once have the money and redeem everything, and if not he would go to Ireland where his big house was and get the money. Prisoner went to Goodwood and he horse just lost, having been backed by O'Shea to win £1,000. On subsequently inquiring at the Raleigh Club prisoner was told that they did not know Captain O'Shea there, and a few minutes later he was arrested. Prisoner concluded. I hereby declare the above statement to be a full and true account of my dealings with the man who styled himself Captain O'Shea. I pledged the articles fully believing that they would be redeemed. I have had articles from Mr. Reyne many times and have always acted honestly with him. Prisoner also referred to his testimonials and with reference to the card describing himself as the Hon. D.J.W. Tremayne, declared it to be the result of a foolish flirtation with an actress two years ago. He expressed regret for any incovenience this unfortunate affair might have caused to Mr. Gerard O'Shea. He</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100031"/>
               <p>had pledged everything in his professional name of Tremayne, but had given his own address. He pleaded guilty to pledging the articles and giving the money to Captain O'Shea for the purpose of backing horses, but not guilty of obtaining by false pretences. This, he added, was his first offence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I first met O'Shea at the hotel at Windsor on the evening of the commencement of racing; that would be June 18. I have made no endeavour to trace him otherwise than by making communication to the officers. As to the suggestion that I pawned the things for the benefit of a man I had only met once, I was foolish enough to do so. I was known to Messrs. Dobbs, having done a lot of business with them. I thoroughly thought they would be redeemed. I mentioned to Dodd's manager that they would only be in for a day or two when I pledged them. I went to Bromley on the night I received the articles, July 25. I did not go to "The Limes." As soon as we got outside the station he went to an hotel—I think it was the Railway Hotel—and I came back from there. The same night I wrote a letter to my employers as from "The Limes," Bromley. I wrote the letter at the hotel, and Captain O'Shea sug<lb/>gested that I should put "The Limes," Bromley at the head of it. I cannot give any reason for that, but the object was probably to de<lb/>ceive my employer. At the time I wrote, "I have sold a tiara at a good price and have got a very good chance of selling another," I had pawned some of the articles. I did not tell Mr. Reyne I had pawned them. Mrs. W. F. Johnstone was a customer of mine, and I pawned the necklace in her name, because it was a question of getting the pawnbroker to advance the money. It may be that was suggested to me by O'Shea, because when you pawn an article for £100 I take it it is a little difficult to get such an advance if people do not know you very well. At Gill's I stated that I was a theatrical person and was pawning goods for myself and wife. I admit that I told lies to the pawnbrokers in order to get the money—telling lies for a man whom I had only known a month, and of whom I knew very little. The address I gave of Belmore House is where I liver, and 73, Hatton Garden is where I used to work. I was dismissed from Mr. Dooley's employment. I was allowed to use the address when I was there. The statement to Mr. Reyne that Captain O'Shea was an old family friend was made at O'Shea's suggestion.</p>

               <p>Mr. Davis applied that all the jewellery in the hands of the pawnbrokers should be restored, and also the property in the hands of the police, there being besides certain jewellery a sum of £65 odd.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100032"/>
               <p>Judge Lumley Smith said the police would no doubt give the property up to the real owner and no order was required.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis: I am told it is necessary to get an order.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attenborough contended that the Court had no power to make a discretionary order as to the repayment of the pawnbrokers where the pledges are over £10. The whole purview of the Pawnbrokers' Act was with reference to small lossa. Pawnbrokers could charge what interest they like over £10. It was not here a question of imposing terms. There was no power to make an order for the simple reason that his clients had a valid right of property in these goods. The general proposition was that no Court had power to take away goods the property in which was legally vested in one man and to bestow them upon another. It was only where the Court was satisfied that a prosecutor was legal owner of the goods that it had power to make an order under the Larceny Act or any other Act.</p>
               <p>Judge Lumley Smith: Do you say that no order can ever be made on a pawn<lb/>broker? Supposing a man steals my watch and pawns it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Attenborough: If he steals your watch the property in the watch still remains vested in you and the Court would order the watch to be returned to yes on proof of ownership. This is a matter of the civil rights of the partice. If the prosecutor here has any property in these articles, it is subject to the rights of property which my clients have quite innocently acquired. That these goods belonged to Mr. Reyne at one time is not disputed. He delivered the goods to the prisoner under certain contracts which are known as approbation contracts. We do not have, fortunately, to depend upon Mr. Reyne's verbal statements, but we have the transaction reduced into writing. When one looks at these approbation notes and at the letters which Mr. Tremayne writes, it is perfectly clear that Tremayne had these goods, not as agent, but as a buyer, tot deal with them as he liked, and to sell them for any sums he liked, and to make any profit he liked. Counsel referred to the Sale of Goods Act (Sec. 18) dealing with the various events upon which property passed upon a contract of sale, and cited Kirkham v. Gill (1897, 1, Q.B., 201), where it was held that the original vendor could not receiver goods from the person with whom they had been pledged, though he had been the victim of dishonesty. Vendors might protect themselves by adopting a partion form of approbation note. As to the suggestion that conviction revested the property in the prosecutor, that was no doubt so before the Sale of Goods Act of 1893, but section 24 of that Act drew a clear distinction between a prosecution for larceny and a prosecution for false pretences, and since the passing of that Act it had never been the practice in these courts to make orders of restitution where goods have been obtained by false pretences and had got into the hands of innocent persons for value.</p>
               <p>Judge Lumley Smith: What happens under the Factors' Act? Supposing a factor is sent out to sell his master's goods, and pawns them, the pawnbroker gets a good title.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attenborough said it was subject to a number of reservations which had to be construed by the courts. In the first place the factor must be a mercantle "agent" within the meaning of the Act so as to give rights of property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Oliver Brown, manager to Mr. Edward Martin, of Brighton, asked that £20 of the money found on prisoner, and now in the hands of the police. might be given to Mr. Martin, as prisoner in his statement admitted that part of the money found on him came from Martin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis said his case was that no property passed; that the property remained all the time the property of Mr. Reyne, and that the offence committed was larceny by a trick.</p>
               <p>Judge Lumley Smith: What will be the position supposing I do not make as order? If I make an order does that prevent the parties from questioning it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Attenborough: If you make an order it places my clients in an extremely difficult position, they have either to obey it or disobey it. If they obey it they lose the whole of the property, their title to which is a valid one; if they disobey it they are brought here for an order to attach them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attenborough: They are not prejudiced in the least. It would have to be tried by action</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100033"/>
               <p>Judge Lumley Smith: In the meantime a large amount of money would be locked up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attenborough: But it is my client's money.</p>
               <p>Judge Lumley Smith: I was thinking whether any arrangement could be made by which they could be sold and the money held.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attenborough: We should not have the slightest objection to that.</p>
               <p>Judge Lumley Smith: Supposing I make no order, the next course will be to see the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis: I should probably adopt civil proceedings.</p>
               <p>Judge Lumley Smith: The convenient thing would be for the money to be paid to the pawnbrokers without prejudice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis: It is a large sum of money.</p>
               <p>Judge Lumley Smith (after referring with the Recorder) said it was not the prac<lb/>tice where there had been a conviction for false pretences to make an order for restitution, even though the Court had the power, and he should be very sorry to depart from the common practice. As to the point made by the prose<lb/>cutors that although this was a conviction for false pretences it might have been treated as larceny by a trick, he did not know that he ought to take upon himself to ascertain the position of the parties as if the conviction had been in form of larceny. He proposed, therefore, to leave the parties to their civil remedies, and not to make any order in regard to the restitution of the goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attenborough suggested that the jewellery and money in the hands of the police should remain in their hands. Under the Police Property Act application could always be made at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Judge Lumley Smith did not think he ought to interfere. Any order of this Court would not decide finally whose was the property in the goods, but was merely a convenient way of saying who should have possession. The police would exercise their own discretion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis, in answer to his Lordship, said he proposed that the other indictments against prisoner should remain on the file.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 16, Burlington Road, which is nearly opposite No. 21. On July 27, about 11 p.m., I was at the "Little Wonder" beershop, Laurel Bank. Prisoner and her husband were outside that house; they had a barrow, and were struggling at to which should wheel it home; I saw him knock her down with his fist. Afterwards she wheeled the barrow in the direction of Bar<lb/>lington Road, the man following; I heard her say that he should not enter the house that night. When I got to my own house I looked out of the front window and saw that there was a bit of a skirmish going on; there was a small crowd round. I heard a re<lb/>port, and saw a flash, from between the door and the gateway of No. 21. I ran downstairs and saw Alfred Dearman lying on the ground, bleeding from the left temple and also from the nose. Four of us carried him into the front room. I heard prisoner say, "You are not hit?"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Deceased was the worse for drink; her was using very foul language during the quarrel; he called his wife a whore and kept up a stream of abuse. I have known the couple for some months. Prisoner was always a very sober, hard-working, well-behaved woman, an excellent wife and a good mother. Deceased never appeared to do any work. When prisoner said, "You are not hit?" she seemed very distressed, and upset and horrified at what had occurred.</p>

                  </hi>, 19, Burlington Road (next door to No. 21). On July 27, just after 11 p.m., I saw prisoner and her husband with a barrow; I heard him say to her, "I'll show you what I will do with you when I get you home"; she said, "And I'll show you who is master over my barrow what I worked hard and paid for." I went on an errand, and returning in 10 minutes saw Dearman lying in the road; prisoner was standing at her door crying; I asked her what was the matter; she said, "I did not mean to do it; I fired wide; I never intended to hurt my husband; I only did it to frighten him; he has drove me mad."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When I saw the two quarrelling together, de<lb/>coased was using very foul language to his wife; he was frequently very violent and abusive to her; she was a respectable, sober, well-behaved and hard-working woman. When Dearman was being car<lb/>ried indoors I heard him say, "She did not mean to do it, it was my fault."</p>

                  </hi>. I occupy a room on the first floor of No. 21. On this night I noticed the altercation about the barrow outside the house. I heard prisoner say, "You are not coming in here to-night,</p>

               <p>Alfred Dearman; if you do I will put this through you"; I was at the back then, and could not see her. It was an expression com<lb/>monly used by the deceased himself, and I did not take much notice of it. Just afterwards I heard a report like the crack of a whip-Looking out of the window I saw Dearman lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Deceased was using very filthy language to pri<lb/>soner. What prisoner said sounded to me lime, "I will put this through you." not "I will put you through it." I have frequently heard deceased use vile language to his wife, and he has struck her many times; he did no work, and was a lazy drunkard.</p>

                  </persName>, 140 Y. I got to 21, Burlington Road, about 20 past 11. Dearman was lying on his back in the front room. He said to me (prisoner being present), "I have been shot." Prisoner said, "I have shot him, but I did not mean to do it; I fired wide of him; I only wanted to frighten him; I do not think the bullet struck him." I asked prisoner what she did it with; she said, "With that patent horse-killer." The instrument was lying on the sideboard, with a mallet and box of cartridges.</p>

                  </persName>. The deceased man was a house cropper. Shortly before 12 on this night I went to 21, Burlington Road; he was lying on a bed; prisoner was also present. I said to him, "Dearman, what has happened?" He replied, "We had a little quarrel, and she fired the patent horse-killer at my back; I saw her strike the killer with the mallet; I did not know it was coming to this; I think it is my fault; I am sorry it has happened." Prisoner was about to speak, and I gave her the usual caution. She said, "You drove me to it; look at the beastly names you called me; you struck me several times"; turning to me she said, "We had a row; he cut my mouth, as you see it, and struck me in the mouth; you know what a life I have had with him; and this week it has been something terrible; what he said to me drove me nearly mad." I had known the couple for some time; prisoner is a most respectable, hard-working woman; she has had a shocking time with her hus<lb/>band; he was a thorough blackguard, the most filthy-tongued man I ever heard; he had been on the drink, with money that she had earned, all this week. Pointing to the horse-pistol, she said, "That is it; I only intended to frighten him, but did not know whether it was loaded or not." In reply to the formal charge of attempted murder, she said, "I am sorry; I shall have to leave him; it is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100036"/>
               <p>shocking what I have to put up with; I wonder something has not happened before." Dearman smelt very strongly of drink.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner has six children, and is now pregnant. she has more that once come to me and complained of her husband's violence, and I have advised her to take him before the magistrate. I have also spoken to the man, and he has admitted that the fault was always his, and promised to give up the drink and turn over a new leaf. I should say that, standing in the doorway as she was, is would be impossible for prisoner to have taken aim with the pistol; it was 999 chances in a 1,000 against her hitting the man; it is a wonder that she did not hit somebody else; a very slight tap of the mallet would explode the cartridge.</p>

I said, "Yes; as well as can be expected"; she said, "Oh, dear, I have been trying to think all night how the thing came loaded; he had it out and oiled I on Friday, as he was going to kill a horse, but whether he put the bullet in or whether I done it in a temper I cannot remember; I was mad at the time; he had been calling me such fulthy names all night."</p>

                  </persName>. I saw the deceased man at 21, Bur<lb/>lington Road, about 11.30 p.m. on July 27; he had a bullet wound in the left throat; I felt the bullet lying under the skin. Next day I and my brother Edwin performed an operation on him; we followed the track of the bullet, and discovered that he was paralysed from the chest downwards, and that the bullet, had fractured a rib. He improved considerably up to August 2, when he sank suddenly and died. The post-mortem examination showed that the bullet had bruised the right lung, which had collapsed, causing a strain on the heart which it was unable to bear.</p>

                  </hi>, 3, New Street, Upper Baker Street, butcher. I and my cousin, William Rason Coulthurst, were executors under the will of Miss Miriam Coulthurst, my sister. She died on Feb<lb/>ruary 10, 1902. Under her will I was entitled to a life interest on her estate; there are reversionary interests in favour of her nephews and nieces. My co-executor died in July last year. I have known prisoner 13 or 14 years. He acted as my colicitor both before and since I became executor. In the beginning of February, 1903, I had a sum of £300, part of the estate that I wanted to invest. My co<lb/>executor and I saw prisoner on February 9, 1903, at his office. I had a conversation with him and said I should like the £300 put out on a mortgage or something safe, and I should like to get 5 per cent. on it. He showed me a few papers, and said he would let me have the deeds in a short time. I agreed to make the investment on mort<lb/>gage at 5 per cent., and paid him cheque for £300. From time to time I got cheques from him for interest. I wrote to him repeatedly as to our having no security to show for the money. His replies to me were always evasive; he said that he had not been able to find a permanent mortgate for the £300, but that in the meantime the money was lent on deposit of deeds of ample value. Finally I wrote to him insisting either that he should foreclose or show us satisfac<lb/>tory security. Eventually I consulted Messrs. Dodd, Longstaffe, and Co., and the matter was by them placed before the Committee of the</p>

               <p>To Prisoner. I have known you some 15 years; you have acted as solicitor for me and members of my family, and considerable sums of money have passed through your hands; up to this all transactions had been satisfactorily carried out.

                  </hi>, Examiner in the Department of the Official Received in Bankruptcy, London. I have investigated the prisoner's affairs in his bankruptcy. His total liabilities were £16,125; of that about £6,400 were moneys due to clients. Nothing has so far been realised from the supposed assets. In prisoner's paying-in book there is a counterfoil entry dated February 10, 1903, "£300, Miss Miriam Coulthurst's executors for investment on mortgage at 5 per cent." There are no documents or book entries showing how that £300 was invested; I have not traced any money received by prisoner from any client as being paid by way of in interest on that £300.</p>

                  </hi>, 3, Margaretta Terrace, Chelsea. I have known prisoner nearly 20 years; he acted as my solicitor. In October, 1903, I had £350 and my husband £100 to invest. I spoke to prisoner on the subject, and eventually the £450 was handed to him "to be repaid in six months and to carry interest at 6 per cent. per annum, payable quartely, and to be advanced on security of houses now in course of erection by Messrs. Abbott and Herbert in Heathfield Road, Millhill Park, Acton." Some months later my husband got back his £100; my £350 remained. In 1905 I began to press prisoner for repayment; her told me he had invested the money in some rubber mines in Bornco. The sic per cent. interest was regularly paid. On February 8 last, I was paid £10 on account. On February 14 prisoner wrote stating that he was about to be made bankrupt, and adding, "I fear there will be no dividend, but I assure you that my barkruptcy will in no way release me from my moral obligations to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100039"/>
               <p>you, and that I shall continue to work until you are paid off." I have never received my money, or any deeds or securities for it.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I do not think you intended to rob me of one shil<lb/>ling; although I lost my money I should not have been here to-day if I had not been obliged to come. You may have told me, not that the money was invested in a Borneo Company, but that a client who was indebted to you had an interest in a Borneo Estate and would shortly be paying you money out of which you could repay me. I had the greatest confidence in you; you have never misappropriated any moneys of mine; I regret very much being here to-day.</p>

                  </hi>, estate agent, Portemouth. I acted as agent for Miss Beatrice Annie Hill in 1905. Prisoner had been acting for her, and held a number of her deeds; having decided to live in Portsmouth, she instructed me to obtain all her deeds from prisoner. I communicated with him, and he forwarded me particulars of different securities. Certain transactions were settled, but I could get no satisfactory settlement in respect of about £350 supposed to be secured on mortgage of two houses in Leslie Road, Finchley. I came up to London in December, 1905, and saw prisoner about this balance; he said he was very sorry, but he had re-invested the money, and through no fault of his he could not at the moment repay it, but that he was negotiating a very large transaction, some £50,000, and Miss Hill would eventually get her money. I then instructed a solicitor; proceedings were taken, and a judgment recovered for £344; payments on account were made amounting to £40 5s.; so that roughly there is still £300 due to Miss Hill. Prisoner gave her</p>

               <p>Prisoner's statement before the magistrate: "I am not guilty. I did not convert any of these moneys to my own use fraudulently. I never had the remotest intention of defrauding one of these clients of one shilling. If the properties and shares in which I was interested had not depreciated in value, or if prior to my banckruptcy, I had been able to get in the debts due to me, which amounted to more than £2,000 I should have been able to satisfy all these claims in full."</p>

               <p>Prisoner (not on oath) submitted to the jury that on the evidence it was not possible to convict him of "fraudulent" conversion. He</p>

               <p>admitted that he had dealt with these moneys and converted them to his own use, but he absolutely denied that he did so fraudulently. His bankruptcy was due to bad debts, to the amount of over £2,000, and the depreciation of value of shares and properties in which he was interested. In fact, he stood in the dock as the result of misfortune, not of deliberate, intentional crime.</p>

                  </hi>, 265, Franciscan Road, Tooting, clerk. On Saturday, August 31, 1907, I was at Fresh Wharf with my wife waiting for the Balle steamer on which my son and daughter were returning home. As the people were coming off the boat, Kemp and another man were close to me. As I leaned over to touch my daughter, my wife called out to me to mind my watch, and I caught Kemp in the act of taking it from my pocket. It was afterwards picked up and is the watch produced. I bought the watch 27 years ago for 35s., but it is an excellent timekeeper, and I would not change it for a £10 watch. Just at the time some one spoke to me about the Kingfisher. I do not identify Anderson as the man who spoke, but the first question he asked me at the police court was, "Did not I speak to you about Kingfisher?" This was said to me about five or ten minutes before the watch was stolen, as the boat was coming in.</p>

Kemp was being detained by prosecutor, who said he had been robbed of his watch and this man had got it. Anderson was by Kemp's side. I recognised him as he was about to move away and said to him, "Half a minute, you are the other man." Prosecutor's son said. "Yes, that is him." Anderson was walking in Kemp's company. They made no reply to the charge. The watch was found underneath where prisoners were standing on the mud of the river.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Anderson was not exactly walking away, but on the staging. I have seen him before. I did not hold him as there was another officer behind—he had no opportunity to run away.</p>

My father called out that somebody had taken his watch and he caught hold of Kemp and I of Anderson's collar. I saw there was a scuffle and that Anderson was with Kemp and pushed with him in front of my father, so I concluded they were both together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had never seen Anderson before. The robbery occurred about three to five minutes after I came off the boat. I saw that Anderson pushed with Kemp. I did not see anybody pushing behind them.</p>

Just as the boat came in there were a lot of people there and I spoke to the prosecutor five or ten minutes before the robbery occurred. If I had been concerned in the robbery, should I have done that? Other people were pushing behind me—there were about 150 to 200 people on the pier, and the constable was shoving them one way and another. The constable did not lay his hands upon me. I suggested to walk to the station. He said, "I believe you are the otehr man." I said, "If you believe so I suggest going to the station." He said, "Very well, come to the station."

                  </hi>, assistant inspectors of messengers, Western District Post Office. Letter produced of August 12 ad<lb/>dressed to H.C. Temple was found by me in a process behind the waste preventer of the messengers' lavatory on Thursday, August 13, at about four p.m., with about 50 to 100 other letters which had been opened and the contents taken out. All messengers would have access to that lavatory.</p>

                  </hi>, assistant, Upper Baker Street Post Office. On August 13, at about 8.25 p.m., prisoner cashed tow postal orders (produced) for 2s. 6d. each with me. In consequence of in<lb/>structions received I took note of the appearance of the prisoner. I particularly noticed the cap that he wore. On August 16 I picked the prisoner out from a number of others at the General Post Office. (To the Recorder.) I hesitated at first and then I picked him out from about a dozen youths. I could not say whether any of them had a beard or moustache. I do not remember that there were any at all like the prisoner. I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been inquiring into the loss of letters passing through the Western District Office, and particularly those addressed to the Temple Association. On August 16 I saw the pri<lb/>soner, cautioned him, and showed him two postal orders produced for 2s. 6d., and asked if he knew anything of them. He said he did not. I told him those orders were cashed at the Upper Baker Street Post Office, and that the person who cashed them wore a cap with the badge, "Adelaide Cycle Club"—did he belong to the club? He said, "No, I never belonged to the club." He subsequently said that although he did not belong to the club he had such a cap and badge at home. He gave me specimens of his handwriting, writing a number of names of persons and post offices on the sheet (pro<lb/>duced). He was afterwards indentified by Hasting and creek.</p>

He paid me a florin, which I gave him change, and placed it in the till. Afterwards I examined the coin and found it was counterfeit. I then gave it to the police. On August 31 prisoner came again about quarter past 10 in the morning. and gave the same order as before, also offering a florin, which I saw was counterfeit.

I had been warned by the police, as bad money had been circulated, to keep my eyes open, and as prisoner drank up his beer very quickly before I got the change ready, it made me suspicious, so I took note of his appearance.</p>

                  </hi>. I have a warehouse on the second floor of 9, Noble Street. About 12.20 p.m. on July 3 I left the warehouse with the goods safe. The door was locked with a padlock. I re<lb/>turned just before one o'clock, and saw the padlock was missing and also the goods—value £40. I then informed the police.</p>

                  </hi>, porter to Mr. Thornhill, 9, Noble Street, On July 3 I was standing at the front door of the premises between 12.20 and 12.40, when I saw a man come downstairs carrying several parcles,. which he gave to a man who was in the street with a barrow. The first man then went upstairs again, I following. I saw a man in the doorway of Mr. Duck's wareshouse. I had seen this man (who was the prisoner) on the Monday and Tuesday before in Noble Street. In the doorway prisoner said, "It's at right; the guvnor's inside." I then went up to own wareroom, gave my book in, and came don again. Prisoner was putting several parcels on the landing, and the man whom I had seen first was taking them away. I went down to the front door and waited five or ten minutes. The prisoner and the other man came down again with parcels which they put on the barrow and covered up with tarpaullin. They went away towards Falcon Square. I next saw prisoner at the police station on August 10 among about a dozen others in a line. I looked first up the line, then I saw prisoner in the centre and picked him out. He had a waxed moustache both at the warehouse and at the station.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100048"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. I meant to say that I saw a man going upstairs first. I am not a regular employee at the premises; I go there occasionally. When I saw prisoner at the door I did not think there was any harm in it; I thought he was one of the customers. I didn't observe the padlock was off. I did make some mistakes in my evidence. I swear prisoner is the man I saw. I said at the police court that when I came back from lunch Mr. Duck said, "Have you been in my place? and I said no. It was rather dark in the warehouse.</p>

On the 10th he was iden<lb/>tified at Cloak Lane by the lad Turner, who went straight up to pri<lb/>soner and said, "That is the man." Prisoner's moustache was waxed. When prisoner was arrested he handed me the jimmy (pro<lb/>duced). When he was searched 14 keys were found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Turner stood and looked at all the men before picking prisoner out; then he went directly up to him. Prisoner did not give a fixed address, so I could not try the keys found on him.</p>

                  </persName>, City Police. On July 16 last about one p.m., I was in Cheapside with Detective Shuard, where we saw the prisoner Matthew sitting in a coster's barrow in his shirt sleeves. Suspecting him, we kept observation. After a short time a man came and spoke to him then disappeared. Matthews now put his coat on. Soon after the same man came down the staircase of 33, Cheapside, carring three rolls of cloth on his shoulder (one of them produced), which he placed on the barrow. Matthews put them straight. The other man went up and down the stairs three more times, each time bringing three rolls of cloth, making 12 in all. All of a sudden Matthews wheeled the barrow away, followed by shuard. I went into No.33, and on the landing, half way, up, I saw three rolls of cloth. I came to the conclusion there had been a job, and came down in a hurry. I went up cheapside till I came to Shuard, then went up to Matthews, and asked him where he got the stuff. He said he was wheeling the barrow for someone, and did not know where he was going. Not being satisfied I took him into custody. Afterwards I went to 33, cheapside, with Sergeant Chap<lb/>man, and found the ware-room door on the first floor had been forced open with a jemmy. I circulated a description of the other man, and on August 10 at Cloak Lane Station picked him (craig) cut from nine other men. While taking him to the mansion House Craig said, "I am marked for life; I am satisfied."</p>
               <p>To prisoner Craig. You were carrying the parcals down the stairs in such a businesslike way that I thought it might be a genuine transaction, so I was waiting till you were going away; but I have ascertained since that you were distrubed, and so got away. I never say you come out of the premises the last time. I was 18 ft. away from the premises. There was a crowd of people in Cheapside.</p>
               <p>To the judge. I had never seen either prisoner before.</p>

I moved there on the Tuesday before Bank Holiday.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. When arrested I said I was with two men who asked me to do a job for them with the barrow. I gave their names, Smith and Duchy. I described Duchy as aged 26, height about 5 ft. 5 in., weak eyes, light suit, light cap, and collar and tie. I described Smith as about 5 ft. 10 in., black moustache, large scar side of right ear, and one under chin, light striped coat and vest, dark jacket, trousers, and hard felt hat, sometimes wears a light cap. Craig has weak eyes. I am willing to identify the two men, if it is 10 years to come, to prove my innocence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Curtis Bennett prosecuted; Mr. Bernard Champion appeared for Schon; Mr. Forrest Fulton appeared on behalf of a Mr. Mendel<lb/>shon photographer, at whose instance a warrant against Hayter had been issued.</p>
               <p>Hayter pleaded guilty in all to 11 indictments, nine for forging and uttering cheques, one for conspiracy to defraud, and one for falsification of accounts; Schon to two indictments for uttering forged cheques. The Nutriola Company are vendors of patent drugs, and carry on business in Oxford Street. Hayter entered their em<lb/>ployment in December of last year at 30s. a week, subsequently raised to 35s., and amongst other duties had to draw cheques in accordance with insturctions received from Mr. Lees, the managing director, or from Mr. Kershaw, the secretary. On March 4 of this year Hayter was told to make out a cheque for £2 payable to Miss Benjamin, the cashier, but after the cheque had been signed altered it to £12, obtained the money, and put the £10 into his pocket, the same system being adopted in the other cases, and the total amount so obtained was £80. He afterwards doctored the pass-book to show only entries of the amounts for which the cheques were originally drawn, and also altered the cheques when they were re<lb/>turned from the bank. When arrested Hayter made the confession, upon which Schon was arrested. He had been in the employ of the company since June, 1906, until last February, and it was discovered through the statement of the first prisoner that cheques had been taken by him and the counterfoils filled in with fictitious amounts. These cheque appeared to have been paid to a man named Morgan, but the company had no customer of that name, and the cheques</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100054"/>
               <p>were cashed by a tradesman of Schon's, amounting in all to £56 2s. 3d. In addition, Hayter embezzled the sum of £42, moneys paid to him on behalf of the firm. Against Hayter there are two previous con<lb/>victions, but nothing was previously known against Schon, who is very well connected.</p>

                  </persName>, 208, Belsize Road. About 10 a.m. on August 6 I was driving an Atlas omnibus in Oxford Street, going west. At the corner of Harewood Place I noticed two little girls, a little to the west of the refuge, waiting to cross from the near to the off side of Oxford Street. I eased up to allow them to cross. I was then about 14 yards from them. There was a butcher's tricycle in front of me. The children, walking side by side, started to cross between me and the tricycle. I heard a shout from someone on an omnibus coming the other way. On looking a shout from someone on my offside I saw a motor car just level with my front wheel; in another second it had caught the two children; one was thrown on to the near side, and the other the car ran over. When the car passed me it was going at 18 to 20 miles an hour. I am confident that no horn or hooter was sounded. The car did not slacken pace before the children were struck. It pulled up in five to eight yards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The children were walking in a slanting direc<lb/>tion towards the refuge. Notwithstanding the shouting they did not stop. From the time he saw the children I have no doubt the driver tried to pull up, but it was no use at the pace he was going. Before the coroner I said that he pulled up in five yards; it was something like five to eight. Before the magistrate I said, "It had plenty of time to pull up after I shouted"; I meant that if it had been going at a fair pace, eight or 10 miles an hour, it could have pulled up. The catastrophe happened about a second after I first saw any sign of danger.</p>

                  </hi>. I was driving a Royal Blue omnibus, going east<lb/>ward. When I was nearly opposite Harewood Place, I saw two girls on the kerb on the opposite side of the road; they walked (if not arm in arm very close together) across the road to get to the refuge; when they were within three or four yards of the refuge the motor car came by and knocked them down. I saw the car before it reached and passed the Atlas 'bus; it was going 16 to 20 miles an hour; it did not slacken pace, and no horn was sounded. When I saw it coming and the children crossing, I shouted out; that would be just as it was passing the box tricycle; it would be then quite close on to the children, say three or four yards from them. I noticed that the driver of the car was talking to a man sitting beside him; but for that the accident would not have occurred; he was not looking where he was going. He did not apply hi brake until after he had struck the first child; when the car was stopped it was about ten yards from where he struck the first child.</p>

                  </hi>. of 15, Moore Street, Cambridge Circus (called by the prosecution, and left to be examined by Sir Charles Mathews). I have been a chauffeur for four years, driving on the Continent, and for a fortnight driving in England. I have known prisoner for a number of years as a chauffeur of experience on the Continent. On August 6 I was with him on the car in question in order to show him the way to the Panhard shop in Regent Street (where certain re<lb/>pairs were required to be done), and then to Folkestone. I was sit<lb/>ting next to prisoner in front; there were two other men in the body of the car. At the Regent Street shop we were directed to go to the Panhard Works at Acton. To get to Acton we proceeded along Ox<lb/>rd Street. The defects in the car would diminish its speed. On approaching this refuge we were going eight to twelve miles an hour. To pass the Atlas omnibus, prisoner took the outside line of traffic. When passing between the 'bus and the refuge, when the front of the car was about level with the 'bus-horses' tails, we first saw the two children crossing, and prisoner at once put on the brakes. He tried to turn on his right side, but was blocked by the refuge. After striking the children the car was brought to a standstill in about its own length—15 ft. It is untrue that the car was ever on this morn<lb/>ing going at 15 to 20 miles an hour. At my first examination before the magistrate (on August 6) I said that prisoner was driving at 15 to 20 miles an hour; I afterwards corrected that, because I meant 15 to 20 kilometres an hour.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Gill. When I first saw the children they were just passing by the 'bus-horses' heads. It is not correct that when the accident happened they were 10 to 14 yards in front of the omnibus. I did not see the tricycle. Before the magistrate on August 6 I was rather excited and confused. Afterwards when I thought about my evi<lb/>dence I looked in a book, and found that five English miles are equal to eight kilometres. I knew there was a difference between a mile and a kilometre, but I did not know the exact difference. The</p>

               <p>car in question was taken to Paris a fortnight ago; I do not know whether the police were informed that it was going to be taken away. The defects to the car on August 6 were such that great damage would have been done to it if it had been driven at a greater speed than 15 miles an hour; could have gone at 15 to 20, but that would have damaged it.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have been for five months chauffeur to Colonel Thompson, who is now in America. I have been a chauffeur for four years and have driven in France and in America. This is the first accident of any kind that I have had any<lb/>where. On August 6 this car had the main lever of the front spring broken, and the water pump was leaking; to drive the car at any speed in those conditions would have caused great damage to the engine. On approaching the refuge at the top of Hare-wood Place I was going at about 10 or 11 miles an hour. I had caught the Atlas omnibus about the middle of Harewood Place, and I proceeded to pass it, which there was plenty of room to do. As I got to the tails of the 'bus-horses I suddenly saw the two girls; they seemed to shoot out from the horses' heads; instead of crossing straight they came slantways on to me. I tried to give a turn on my steering wheel quickly on the right; at the same time I put both my pedals down, one applying the foot-brake and the other discon<lb/>necting the engine. I could not turn to the right; I could feel my wheel bumping against the pavement of the refuge; as I went on the girls came to me and the car struck them. I pulled up in about the length of the car. I did everything I possibly could be avoid the accident. It is quite untrue that I was talking to anybody on the car or looking in another direction, or that I failed to put the brake on until after striking the children.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My principal experience of motor-driving has been in America and in France. In France there is the general rule that you must drive at the pace you think right, but in some of the cities there are speed limits, even of five miles an hour. These two children "came to me"; they ran together right on to the car. At the speed of 10 or 11 miles an hour the car could be pulled up in about nine or 10 yards. It is true that I did not sound the horn; I had no time. It is not necessary to second the horn every time you pass a vehicle; it depends on the traffic. I never thought anybody would be fool enough to try to cross before the 'bus-horses' heads—so near to them. I did not slow up as I was passing the 'bus; I was not going fast enough to slow up. I heard no shouting; my motor makes more noise than anything else.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The road was pretty clear of traffic at the time. I am still in Colonel Thompson's employment. My intention is to go at once to France to do my military service, and afterwards I have Colonel Thompson's instructions to go to him in America.</p>

The children came right in front of the car as it was passing the omnibus, and it was quite im<lb/>possible for prisoner to avoid them; they were only three or four yards ahead of him.

While the car was passing be<lb/>tween the 'bus and the refuge the two girls came out in front of the 'bus, and it was impossible for prisoner to avoid the accident. He could not turn to the right side because of the refuge, nor to the left because of the 'bus. The car was stopped within its own length.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not speak English; at the station I made a statement, but not even partly in English. Ellis translated; it was taken down in English, Ellis read it to me in French, and I signed the English. According to the written statement, I said, "I cannot say what speed we were going, but the car stopped in two or three yards." What I said was that I could not tell exactly, but that it was 10 to 12 miles. I swear I did say that, though it is not in the writing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Bray in passing sentence said he took the jury's verdict to imply that they found that prisoner was reckless in driving as he did. The evidence showed that this car was driven along Oxford Street, one of the most crowded thoroughfares in London, at at least 16 miles an hour, although at the time, owing to the position of the Atlas omnibus, it was impossible for prisoner to see whether anybody was crossing the road or not.

At 11.30 p.m. on February 11, 1907, the windows and doors were properly festened, and I went to bed in the basement. At 5.50 on the following morning I was aroused by the burglar alarm, caused by the opening of the street door. I called Mr. Wertheimer, awoke the servants, and communicated with Mr. Berry, the custodian. I found that a number a snuff-boxes were missing from the smoking-room, and that two pictures had been cut from their frames in the drawing-room. About nine or twelve months before the robbery the snuff boxes were kept in a cabinet in the draw<lb/>ing-room. On February 12 that cabinet had been opened.</p>

                  </persName>(see p. 306), and after<lb/>wards made a statement to the police. I first knew prisoner in 1901 as a customer, when I was employed at Gargini's Restaurant in Whitcomb Street, Leicester Square, for about two months as a waiter. It was a very small restaurant, and I was employed without salary. I had previously been convicted. I met prisoner again in August and September, 1906. I had been out of employment three months and was rather hard up. I was married, had two children, and was expecting a third. Prisoner stopped me in Leicester Square, looked me up and down, and seeing me very poorly dressed said I seemed to be very low down in the world. I said I had been out of work for three months, and that I had been convicted for forgery—I knew they all knew in the West End; that is why I told him that—that is why I could not get a good employment. Prisoner told me to go and see him at 58, Studley Road, Clepham. I went the same evening. Prisoner said his wife had been ill for some time, and that althought he kept it from her he had been pawning everything he had in the place to keep himself going. The next day I met him in the "Leicester" public-house by appointment, and he gave me 2s. He said, "Of course, as you have been convicted it is no good your trying to get a living honestly—you will not succeed. If you like to risk doing a little job, I know where I can send you to some stuff which I can easily sell because it is in my line of business." I had then been six years out of prison and had mar<lb/>ried. I said, "It is a very risky thing. I know I have lost my character, but I have got a wife and children now to study. I should not like anything to happen for their sake." He said, "You need not be afraid of that. I will look after them if anything goes wrong." I afterwards went to his house several times, and he told me to go to 13, Hyde Park Terrace, where I stole a number of bronzes and other articles, nearly all of which I handed to the prisoner. This is the case in which I have already given evidence. He afterwards told me that Inspector Stockley was inquiring into that robbery. About February 4 prisoner first spoke to me about the Norfolk Street robbery. I was then in great difficulties, my wife had been confined, and there was another child. I was living in two rooms in the basement of Mrs. Barrett's house, 4, Lansdowne Gar<lb/>dens, South Lambeth, paying 7s. 6d. a week with my wife and three children. During January I had been going to prisoner's place nearly every evening because he had been promising me 30s. to go away, and he made several appointments which he did not keep. He said he could not find the money, he had been trying to get it.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100061"/>
               <p>I said, "If you do not want to let me have it why do not you say so?—I do not want to be humbugged here every day—I might have been trying to get it somewhere else." He said, "If you think of chancing another job I know a place where you won't get bronzes this time"—that is how he came to it. I said, "What is the use of doing jobs to let you get all the stuff and then we get nothing out of it?" He said, "Oh, no, I have been already in correspond<lb/>ence with some of my pals over the water"—he mentioned France and he showed me one or two letters—"directly the stuff is here you bring it to me and then you need not worry any more about it. When it is here I will bunk off to Paris at once; it is a matter of 24 hours, and I will let you have some money." I said, "Yes, it is all very well, you cannot keep on doing this sort of thing without falling one of these days—without getting into trouble." I men<lb/>tioned again my wife and children, and said, "What an awful thing it would be for them." He said, "Do not be afraid. If I am to sell my house out I will see to them if anything happens." That was about a week before the robbery occurred. After that I saw him, and three days before the robbery said, "Can you let me have some money to<lb/>morrow night?" He said, "I will try—you come here," and I kept going, and every night we spoke about this affair in Park Lane. I asked whose house it was. He told me it belonged to Mr. Charles Wert<lb/>heimer, and it was snuff-boxes. I did not know the gentleman, and I asked who it was. He said it was a gentleman who had heaps of money. "It won't be bronzes this time—something better—it is snuff-boxes." He told me they were in the drawing-room. Then I said, "They do not always keep that snuff in the same place." He said, "They do not always keep that stuff in the same place." He said, "You need not be afraid. If you get in there you won't go away empty-handed, and at the very worst"—he took up a knife—"with this knife you can cut out a couple of the pictures; they always fetch £5 or £10." I took the knife. I went to him every evening—it was the same thing, he could not let me have anything, so I tried a dodge to try him. I went on the Monday evening and met him as he was coming home with a lady, and said, "I want to speak to you." The lady went on and he stopped. I said, "I have got the snuff-boxes and the pictures, I have done the job." Of course, it was not true—I thought by saying that he would let me have the 30s. He said, "All right, you come up to the Prince of Wales public-house and wait for me outside." That was in the Clapham Road. I went these and he came up in ten minutes. He said, "So you have done it." I said, "Yes, I have got the snuff-boxes at home and two pictures." He said, "Well, that is good." We had a drink, and I said, "Can you lot me have the 30s. to-night. I want to pay me rent." He said, "No, you bring me one of the boxes to-morrow morning and I will sell it for you at once, in no time. You will get the money at once." I made an appointment to bring it at seven in the morning. I went home. I was in want of money for arrears of rent and to live, and went through the West End to try and get some. At about twelve I returned and went out again and walked about till 4 a.m. I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100062"/>
               <p>upset. I then went to Park Lane, got up on to some railings on a sort of shelf over the door of the next house, and on to the balustrade, forced back the catch of the window and got into the smoking-room. It was all dark, and I went straight for the drawing-room, ransacked the drawers, and could not find any money or the snuff-boxes. I cut two pictures out of the frames, went back to the smoking-room, struck a match, and then I saw the case containing the snuff-boxes. I then lit the candle, took the snuff-boxes, wrapped them separately in news<lb/>papers lying on the table, rolled the two pictures round them, went downstairs and out at the front door, causing the alarm bell to ring when I opened it, went down Park Lane, and got home at 6.45 a.m. I left the knife and candle in the house. I then went to prisoner's house, arriving there at 6.55 a.m., and knocked at the side door, which was opened by prisoner's niece. She said Mr. Morris was not up. I said, "Well, he ought to be—he has an appointment with me at seven o'clock." As I said that I heard him come downstairs, and I was let into the back kitchen. I told prisoner that what I said last night was not true—that I had not done it, but that I was just come from doing the burglary, and that I had got the snuff-boxes and the pictures. He was very delighted, gave me some coffee, and said, "We will not have to do anything more of this kind for some time, at any rate." Of course there was nothing in the papers then. He gave me a few shillings, and came to my place at 9a.m. To get to my rooms he had to come down the area and through the passage. I took him into the bed-room and showed him the snuff-boxes and the pictures. He said the pictures were not up to much—they were faced. I believed him, as I had a picture myself worth about half a crown that looked just as nice. He said he could get a few pounds for the things. He took the pictures and one of the snuff-boxes, because I told him I could hide the snuff-boxes from my wife, but I had not got a place for the pictures. He said he would let me have a few pounds during the say. He wore a felt hat with a flat top. When he was in the dock at Marlborough Street he had the same hat on. He made an appointment to meet me at the Oval at four p.m. that day, but did not keep it. I afterwards met him at seven p.m. with a lady. He sent the lady on, and said to me, "I could not get you much," and gave me £2. when I got home I found the landlady had made a bit of a fuss about his coming, and wanted to know who it was. I paid the rent that evening out of the £2. I saw in the evening papers very full particulars of the robbery, with copies and descriptions of the stolen goods. I met prisoner the next day. He seemed very much upset, and said he was being followed. I kept going to his place or meeting him outside for three or four days, and on Sunday he said. "We will never be able to sell any of that stuff. I have pasted the two pictures together with brown paper, and sent them somewhere safe, where they will not find them for years. The snuff-box I had to break up—it was not possible to sell it. I should advise you to do the same." I said, "No, I should never do that. It was bad enough to steal them without putting</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100063"/>
               <p>them in the melting pot; and, besides, if I was to be caught and the things had been destroyed I should cop it very stiff, whereas I" they are found undamaged I might get off with a little sentence." He said, "No, you won't; you will find yourself mistaken about that"—and so I have. He said it was impossible to sell the stuff because it had been made too hot the police had made too much notice about it—he thought when this burglary had been found out the prosecutor very likely would have sat down in the drawing-room and whistled a tune until the stuff came back. He said it was quite impossible to sell anything—he had broken the snuff-box up and advised me to do the came with the others. He told me not to come again to his place; he might have some money for me on the follow<lb/>ing Wednesday, to send my wife, and meanwhile to think about melt<lb/>ing the things down, and he would send me round the pots. I sent my wife on the Wednesday, and she came home with 12s. and a parcel containing two earthenware melting pots. I smashed them up. I afterwards met him at the Stockwell Tube Station, and told him I had been to his place, and his sister told me not to come any more. He said, "If you cannot take my advice to put the things in the melting pot I will wash my hands of it entirely." I said, "You cannot do that," and left him in a temper. I told him. "It is a nice way to treat anybody; now that you have brought the whole of Scotland Yard on me you wash your hands and you are off like a Frenchman." He said, "I cannot help it." I was entirely without means, and about a fortnight afterwards I got into communication with a man who turned out to be an agent of the police, to whom I sold some of the snuff-boxes, and was arrested with the remainder in my possession and the money that I had received from him. When in prison I told my wife to write to prisoner. I pleaded guilty to this case, and made a statement to the police with regard to this and the Hyde Park Terrace case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Before I met prisoner in 1901 I had been twice convicted for forgery and burglary; prisoner had nothing to do with those crimes, and I did not know him. Prisoner told me to take the pictures. He said there were plenty of pictures in the place, take a couple of them. He said he could always get £5 or £10 a pieces for them. I do not know of my own knowledge what prisoner has done with the pictures or the snuff-box.</p>

During my married life my husband has never been convicted. I had two children and was expecting a third in September or October. About that time my husband sent me to 58, Studley Road. Prisoner let me in at the side door, and gave me £20, which I handed to my husband. One night in February, 1907, my husband was away all night. On the following morning prisoner came, and was taken into the bedroom by my husband. He was warning a hard felt hat with a flat top.</p>

               <p>My landlady spoke to me about his calling. We then owed two weeks' rent, which was paid that evening. Shortly after I went to Studley Road when prisoner gave me 12s., and a paper parcel which my husband opened, and I saw it contained two earthenware pots.

In February they owed me two weeks' rent. On Tuesday morning, February 12, which was my washing day, at about 9 to 9.30 a.m., my attention was directed to a man leaving Rodini's bedroom. I only saw his back; he had white hair and was wearing a flat-topped, hard felt black hat and an overcoat. It was an exceptional occurrence—I had never seen any other man there. I spoke to my husband about it. They paid me the rent the same evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see the man's face. I am sure it is the prisoner from the back view I had of him. I do not think I said at the police-court, "I do not say prisoner is the man."</p>

                  </persName>, W. Division. I have been in charge of this case. After Rodini's conviction he made a statement with regard to the robbery at 13, Hyde Park Terrace, and Norfolk Street. On may 31 at 11 a.m. I arrested the prisoner in the Clapham Road. I said, "We are police officers, and I shall arrest you are feloniously receiving two valuable oil paintings and a gold enamelled snuff-box, the property of Mr. Charles Wertheimer, of 21 Norfolk Street, Park Lane, well knowing them to have been stolen." He said, "I know nothing about them; this is very awkward." I said, "I shall take you to Brixton Police Station." On the way he said, "I know the man you are speaking about—Rodini. He used to be a waiter at Gargini's, where I used to go. I am a picture dealer, and I should not touch them. I know a picture when I see it. These dammed Italians are a curse to this country." I had not then men<lb/>tions Rodoni at all. At the station he said, "Are you going to keep me all night?" I said, "Yes." He said, "I know Mr. Wertheimer, and have been to his house and done business with him." The next day I conveyed him in a cab to Marlborough Street Station. On the way he said, "You know that Mrs. Rodoni wrote to me after his arrest for assistance. I did not answer the letter. I suppose this Is the Italian vendetta." I searched at 58, Studley Road, with Ser<lb/>geant Ebbage, and we found a knife with "80, Harrow Road, upon it exactly similar to the one found at 21, Norfolk Street. When ar<lb/>rested prisoner was wearing a hard felt flat-topped hat which he wore when in the dock at Marlborough Street. He has been since in cus<lb/>tody, but would have no difficulty in changing his hat.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have been in busi<lb/>ness as a picture-dealer for many years in the City, West End, and various places. About 14 years ago I was at 5, Crosby Square, afterwards in partnership with Canini, in conjunction with whom I have carried through a large number of transactions with all the principal firms in the trade. I knew Rodini as a waiter at a res<lb/>taurant; after that I missed him for many years; one day he spoke to me and I asked him to have a drink; I also met him in August or September, 1906; 15 or 16 years ago I went with my partner Canini with a picture in a cab to Mr. Wertheimer's house, but no further than the steps. I could not pick out the house now. Rodoni's statements are all false. I never gave him the knife—he must have taken it from my breakfast room unknown to me. I never suggested any robbery to him. I should be simply mad to have anything to do with such pictures as he stole—nobody could have sold them. I agree with what Berry said. It is simply ridicu<lb/>lous for me to have said I could get £5 or £10 for such pictures. I have never given Rodini money for anything I bought of him—it is all false. I gave his wife £2 for him to go to Southampton to help him. I have never been to his house. If I had known of the robbery I think I should have gone for the £1,000 reward. I am quite innocent of the charge—I cannot understand how such a tale could be concocted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. For some time past my business had been carried on without any business premises, either in public-houses or in the street, or sometimes in gentlemen's houses. It would be an ordi<lb/>nary transaction for a man in a public-house whose name I do not know to give me something to dispose of. Rodoni's story is untrue. He has been to my house lots of times, in the evenings, and coming to the side door. I had nieces staying with me. When arrested I wore a hard felt hat with a flattish top, which I bought at Hope Bros. for 7s. 6d., and I wore it at Marlborough Street police Court. I gave it away to a prisoner at Broxton. Rodoni's wife has been to my house about twice. I never gave her £20. I gave her £2 in February when Rodoni was going to Sothampton. I never gave</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100066"/>
               <p>her a parcel with things that looked like flower pots. I have re<lb/>ceived one letter from her. I told Rodoni that my sister objected to his coming to my house because he pushed open the door. When I was in trouble over the bronzes I told Rodoni I was being bothered by the police, and I gave him the card that Inspector Stockley gave me. It was on the table, and I showed it to Rodoni; that is how he knew the name of Stockley.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. When at Brixton I threw the hard felt hat off and one of the prisoners took it. I had a soft one, and did not want the other. I saw the account of the robbery in the papers, the name of Smith, and the description of the property on February 13 and 14. I saw Rodoni on Easter Monday, April 1, on the plat<lb/>form at Waterloo Station. I might have seen him before. He may have come on the morning of February 12. I do not remember—he did come one morning. He did not come the day before I saw the account in the papers—I swear to that—I should have remembered it. He did come one morning about eight a.m., while I was having my breakfast, within a week or two of the robbery, before or after, I could not say which. He used to come to see me sometimes, and I used to give him a shilling or two when he knew of a cheap offer of goods or of men coming from the continent with stuff which he could put in my way, and I could pay him a commission. From the early part of February to Easter he may have come to my house once or twice—I could not say.</p>

                  </hi>, 40, Trinity Square. On July 25 last, about 4.50, I went to the booking office at Mark Lane Station and took my place in a line of people. When within three of the window I felt prisoner pressing me on the left-hand side. I turned round and said, "Steady there, pushing, why don't you take your turn with the others?" I also felt pushing on the right side. When the gentleman in front of me had taken his ticket, and the pressure was relieved, I saw my chain hanging down. The prisoner was walking to the door. I followed him, and saw him speak to someone at the door. Then a gentleman picked up the ring of my watch and handed it to me. When I followed prisoner he turned round, and I said, "What about this chain?" The man he spoke to immediately went off down Seething Lane. I then charged prisoner with steal<lb/>ing my watch. He said "Oh, nothing of the kind; you have made a mistake this time." I asked him to come to the station and be searched. He agreed, but went back, took a ticket and rushed downstais, I following as before he took his ticket I spoke to an I spoke to an inspector, and said, "That man has taken my watch; stop him. "He took hold or prisoner's coat and the train went off. went off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There were a good many people in the booking office. I did not have to wait long for a ticket. I do not know how many people were behind me. I was dressed the same way as I am now; my coat was not buttoned. I was not watching prisoner when I turned round to speak to him. I did not see anything in his hand. The Mark Lane booking office is a very inconvenient place. I did not know the man who picked up the watch ring; he was an ordinary City gentleman. I guessed the ring was mine. I was not much upset at the loss of the watch. The door is about 12 yards from the booking office. I do not know if anyone else saw my chain</p>

               <p>Re-examined. It was just after the ring was picked up that I noticed my chain hanging.</p>

Prisoner answered, I have already told you I have not got your watch," and was making towards the train just in, when I stopped him. He was not hurrying particularly.

                  </persName>, 881 City. I was in the Minories when Inspector Miller and Mr. Cross came to me with prisoner. Miller said, pointing to prisoner. "This man has stolen a watch at the booking office, Mark Lane." Mr. Cross said, "Yes, he has stolen my watch; he was in company with another man who has gone away." Prisoner then said, "I know nothing about it; I offered to let him search me at the station." We went to the police station, and when the charge was read over prisoner made no reply. When searched a metal watch and chain, 3s., and a ticket for West Hampstead (produced) was found on him. He gave an address. 260, Corporation Street, West Ham.</p>

                  </hi>, Post Office constable. I made inquiries with reference to the loss of a letter containing cheque produced. I went to Sergeant, Longstaff, and Co., and then to prisoner's wife, on June 13. Prisoner was present, and heard what I said. I told her who I was, and then I was making inquiries in regard to a cheque she had given to Sergeant, Longstaff and Co., I took her reply in writing, an fol<lb/>lows: "I am the wife of Alfred Bird, 69, Graham Street, and reside with him at that address. Some time ago, less than tow months, a woman came and made a purchase, asking me to accept a cheque, £3 in payment. She said she tried to change it in the neighbourhood but failed. I accepted the cheque and spoke to my husband about it. On April 16 or 22 I pay the cheque to Mr. Longstaff in pay<lb/>ment for coal. I have known the woman who handed me the cheque, as a customer, since the business has been carried on here, about five months. She has been here purchasing several times since the transaction. I know her well by sight, but not by name. I should describe her as about 30 to 40 years of age. 5 ft. 6 in., stout built, respectable appearance. I should identify her when I saw her. I should not have taken the cheque had I not known the women as a regular customer and respectable. I am of opinion she is living in the neighbourhood. I don't know the number of the cheque nor any particulars. I am willing to assist in finding the whereabouts of the woman, and will acquaint you when I find out. It was after cheque was accepted by Mr. Longstaff that I paid the women the balance of the cheque, which I cannot exactly remember." That was signed by Mrs. Bird and witnessed by prisoner. I did not know then that prisoner was a postman. I saw him again at the shop on July 19. I saw some postman's uniform banging up, and asked pri<lb/>soner whose they were. He said they were his. I then decided not to put any further questions, returned to the Post Office, and re<lb/>ported</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100070"/>
               <p>the matter. I went again to his house on August 12, and asked him to come with me to the Post Office, which he willingly did. In answer to questions, prisoner said that it was true the cheque had been given to Sergeant, Longstaff and Co., in payment for coals, that he was not present when it was paid, that it was taken in the shop in the course of business, from a women customer, and he should know her again, as his wife had given him a description of her. I do not know anything of the woman referred to; she has not been found. Prisoner's shop is a very small general dealers' selling pennyworths of coals, etc. In answer to the charge prisoner emphatically denied stealing the cheque.</p>

                  </hi>, travelling clerk, G.P.O. About the end of July I got some instructions regarding West Ealing Post Office, in consequence of which I made up a letter in which I enclosed three postal orders. 5s., 10s., and 2., and five penny stamps bearing my private mark. The stamps (produced) are the ones. I also enclosed a metal chain in a match-box (chain identified), and a written com<lb/>munication. It was addressed, "Master George Allen, St. Stephen's Schools, 77, Bloomfield Road, Uxbridge Road, London. N.W." That is fictitious. I put a penny stamp on the letter, and a post mark, and posted the letter at Drayton Green wall box about 10.30 on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100071"/>
               <p>August 3. At the time I gave certain instuctions to Overseer Dun<lb/>ton in reference to it. On August 5 (Bank Holiday), about eight a.m., Dunton handed me the letter, just outside West Ealing Station, and made a communication about it. The packet had been opened, and only contained the letter and postal orders. I went down to Uxbridge Road and saw prisoner shortly after 8.30. He was return<lb/>ing from his rounds, going home. I told him who I was, and asked him to go with me to West Ealing postmen's office, which he did, police-constable Johnson coming with us. I then told prisoner what was the matter, and cautioned him. I said, "I believe Bloomfield Road is part of your delivery ground; have you finished your delivery?" He said "Yes." Then I told him that I had posted the letter addressed "Master Allen," and had placed it among his packets for delivery that morning; and that it had been found open. He said, "I found it open in my place. I know nothing about the box or chain; the stamps I found round about the place; I don't know whether they fell out of the letter." He produced the five stamps from his pocket. The stamps were marked with an invisible fluid, which received on the application of another fluid. He had no objection to being searched, which was done, and Johnson took a metal obtain from between his sock and pants. The chain (produced) was the one I posted. He said, "The match-box was found in my place the name as the stamps; I put them in my pocket and didn't examine the con<lb/>tents till I got outside." Later on I suspended him from duty. On August 6 he was given into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I get £350 a year. The articles were mine before I put them into packet. I paid for the stamps out of official money entrusted to me for the purpose. I identify the stamps by the marks on them. I put the obliterating stamp on the letter before I posted it from a stamp I carry with me. I am authorized to do that. It is also part of my duty to write fictitious letters if necessary, as in this case. I wrote the notes of what prisoner said at the time. I would not pretend that I know all the regulations for postmen; I know some of them. Prisoner gets 12s. 9d. a week. Dunton was close to me when I posted the letter on Saturday night. Prisoner had his uniform on when I searched him. I would not the myself down to say what shirt he had on. There are two keys to a letter-box, as a rule—there may be more. A postman could open a box without a key, but he should not unless he were collecting. Or was authorised. There would be a number of collectors making collections from the box during the day.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I instructed Dunton to collect from the box imme<lb/>diately after the letter was posted. The next time I saw it was about eight o'clock on Monday morning, when Duton brought it.</p>

                  </hi>, overseer, West Ealing Postmen'ss Office, where the prisoner was employed. On August 3 Mr. Shinner gave me cer<lb/>tain instructions, on which I went to Drayton Green wall-box, at 10 p.m. I opened the box and took a letter there from, addressed to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100072"/>
               <p>"Master Allen, St. Stephen's Schools, 77, Bloomfield Road, Uxbridge Road, N.W." That is the envelope produced. I kept the letter till Monday morning, when I placed it with other packets that prisoner would have to deal with in the course of delivery. The letter was then infact. Prisoner came on duty that morning at a quarter to seven. The letter would be put into prisoner's delivery for trial, as there was a Bloomfield Road in West Ealing. If prisoner did not know where the address was he would endorse it "insufficiently addressed," and dead with it as a mis-sort, putting it by the side of his desk or on the mis-sort table. On this morning, prisoner, after sorting his letters, went out to the lavatory at 20 past seven, being out between six and seven minutes. When he had gone out. I went to his place, and the letter was missing. About a quarter of an hour after his return he brought the letter to me. It was then open and the envelope in the state it is now. He had endorsed it "insufficiently addressed, for West Ealing." He asked me what he was to do with it, and said, "Look, it has been broken open." I afterwards communicated with Mr. Shinner and handed him the letter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined: I have been an overseer for nearly three years, getting £186 a year. It is my duty to supervise the postmen. I know the rules for postmen. There is a rule that "A postman has to arrange letters in the order of delivery. A postman must not under any circumstances leave the office until they are so arranged." It does not say he is not to go to the lavatory. I do not construe that as leaving the office. Another rule is that mis-sorted letters must be handed at once to the proper officer; that would be the overseer. The prisoner would be supplied with a uniform, a tunic, trousers, overcoat, lamp, collecting book, waterproof cape, and cap. It was about 10 p.m. on the Saturday when I took the letter out of the box; it may have been a little after that. I did not say the prisoner left the room with the letter. I did not see it in his possession then. It was not my instruction to ask prisoner why he had opened the letter; it was to obtain possession of the letter.</p>
               <p>Re-examined: There is a rule that, when postmen find loose articles like postage stamps, they shall take them to the superior officer. Prisoner did not hand me any stamps or any other article.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). My wages from the Post Office are 12s. 9d. a week; I earn as a gardener about 12s. a week. On August 5 I went to the office at quarter to seven, and put my hat and bag on my seat; then I went to another part of the office, and was sorting there for about 25 minutes. On returning to my seat I found a number of letters ready for me to deal with, among them the letter in question; I placed it on one side with other mis<lb/>sorts. Going on dealing with the other letters I found the match-box and five penny stamps. The match-box being like the sort I gene<lb/>rally carry, I thought I had probably pulled it out of my pocket with some string; I occasionally carry a few stamps on me, and I thought these might be mine. As I was just ready to go out on delivery, I got the mis-sorts together in the ordinary way, and put them on the mis-sort table. As I was endorsing this letter, "not West Ealing," I noticed that one end was open. I took it to Dunton and pointed this out, and he told me to endorse it, "No such num<lb/>ber in Bloomfield Road"; I did so, and then went out on delivery. After finishing my delivery I was about to light a cigarette; I then found the chain in the match-box. I put the chain in my waistcoat pocket, and thought I would report that come of the man in the office had been playing a trick with me, or speak to Dunton about it I was stopped by Shinner, and we went back to the office as he has described. I find that there is no bottom to my waistcoat pocket; I can only suppose that the chain fell through the pocket, and worked itself down my pants; I did not deliberately put it in my pants. When Shinner was questioning me he said nothing about the chain until after it had been found in my pants. Dunton is wrong in say<lb/>ing that I left the office to go to the lavatory; I swear that I did not leave the office at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When I put this letter on one side on a mis-sort I did not notice that it was open. There were a number of letter lying scattered about on my table, and I did not think it funny that my match-box should have got amongst the letters; it might wall have been pulled out of my pocket, without my noticing it, when I was pulling the string out. I had a match-box of my own in my pocket; I did not notice when I put this other one in that there was already a box there; I did not notice any rattling of the chain inside the box. I have had the waistcoat about two years; I had never noticed that there was a hole in the pocket. This was the first time I had ever found loose stamps in the office. I was not aware of the rule that "Any postage stamps, whether obliterated or not, found anywhere in the office by a postman, must be given to his superior officer."</p>

                  </hi>, manager to Edward Hayden, 397, Harrow Road, jeweller. I sleep on the premises with my wife and child. On August 19, at 11.20 p.m., I went to bed, leaving the house secure. I heard no noise in the night. At 8.55 I opened the shop. I found the back window of the workshop had been forced and the shutter forced, and on the bench in front of the window I found brace, electric lamp and knife, on the floor a handkerchief, and behind the counter in the shop a jemmy (produced). The shop was in confusion, with cases thrown all over the counter and floor. On taking stock I find that articles of jewellery to the value of £600 have been stolen; 40 watches, 168 rings, gold chains, bracelets, scarf pins, lockets, etc., I identify four rings, one bracelet, one locket and necklet (produced), value £15. I immediately gave notice to the police, without inter<lb/>fering with the premises. On Monday afternoon, August 19, Coombes came into the shop and asked for an estimate for replating a silver watch. He was there about 10 minutes; I gave him the estimate, and he said he would consider it. The workshop window looked out on to our private garden.</p>

                  </persName>, X Division. On August 20 I was communicated with, arrived at the house at 9.15 a.m., and have since had the conduct of this case. Entry had been gained by climb<lb/>ing over the railings of St. Emmanuel's Church, in Fermoy Road, get<lb/>ting on the roof of the school, passing across the roof of the Penny Bazaar, which adjoins the church, fastening the sash-cord (produced)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100075"/>
               <p>round the stack-pipe and dropping down into the garden about 12 ft., the rope being 15 ft. long. The garden is 20 ft. by 30 ft. I found a number of boot-marks in the garden corresponding with the rubber heeled boots produced which were found in the room which the two Murphys occupied. The catch in the back window of the workshop had been forced down by knife produced and two old-fashioned shutters made to pull up and down had been forced with a jemmy corresponding with that found in the shop (produced). The promises were well secured. I found in the shop the articles mentioned by handkerchief. The thieves had broken open the window, taken the property, and left in the same way, the front door being untouched. The rope is knotted. The handkerchief is stained with snuff and tobacco juice. Coombes was arrested by my orders oh August 23 at 9 a.m. coming from the area of 43. Ashmore-road, about 600 yards from Hayden's shop. I saw a stained handkerchief in his pocket and took it from him and found a snuff-box on him. I said, "I shall keep this handkerchief, as I was sure the one left behind at Mr. Hayden's shop was identical with it." He said, "Yes, unfortunately that was mine which I unfortunately dropped there." Before that I had seen Mrs. Creek. At 9 p.m. he was placed with a number of other men and identified by Mrs. Creek and Margetts, her maid. Mrs. Creek touched him and said, "Yes, he is the one that offered to sell me some spoons." He said, "No, madam, I did not offer them for sale—only to see." She said she had seen him visit the Murphys in the room where she had seen the revolver, chisels, and rope. The two Murphys were brought in on Saturday, August 24, at 2 p.m., and charged with being concerned with Coombes in custody and another not in custody in breaking into Hayden's shop. They said, "What do you mean?"</p>

                  </hi>, 10, Elgin Avenue, Maida Vale. I am the tenant of 43, Ashmore-road, Paddington, which I let out in furnished apart<lb/>ments. About the end of July Norman Murphy took a bed-sitting room in the name of Smith at 7s. 6d. a week, and, with his brother, occupied it till August 23, when they left at my request. I have seen Coombes there several times when I have been to see to the rooms. I have not seen Smith there. I have seen the rope, jemmy, and lamp produced in the drawer in their room. On one occasion, when the two Murphys and another man who I think was Coombes were in the room, they showed me about 33 electro-plated spoons, forks, and knives similar to those produced and offered to sell them for a sovereign. I said, "How did you come by them?" Murphy said they were the remains of his former home when he was selling off. I said, "I think they are too good for me; I do not want them." (To the Judge.) They were offered at a very reasonable price, but they were too good for my house. I did not want them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was not Coombes who offered the spoons, etc., for sale. I believe he was there. Rope produced is the one I saw—</p>

                  </hi>, widow, 28, sandringhm Road, Forest Gat. On August 2 smith and his wife rented the lower half of my house. On Sunday, August 4, the two Murphys called. I answered the door and told them the smiths were out. On August 22 I saw them in Smith's kitchen. About that date Smith asked me if I would take care of a box and a few things for him and he would give me 2s. a week for the room, to which I consented. He brought up the large box, basket, and leather bag which I see in court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never saw Normal Murphy bring anything there. Smith paid 6s. 6d. a week for the bottom flat. His bedroom contained a bed and was nicely furnished; the front room was nearly empty. I saw him repairing a bicycle, and I think he sold bicycles to the Murphys. There is only one lavatory to the house, which is in the garden.</p>

                  </persName>, X Division. I was present at Harrow Road Police Station when Coombes was brought in and identified by Mrs. Creek. She said, "He tried to sell me some spoons at 43, Ashmore Road." Coombes replied, What is it I offered to sell you? I never lived there." He was told he would be charged, and said, "I suppose I shall have to suffer for the lot. I did not know I left my pocket handkerchief behind." On August 24, at eight or nine p.m., I went to 28, Sandringham Road, and saw Smith. I told him I should arrest him on suspicion of being concerned with other men in breaking into 397, Harrow Road, and stealing jewellery. He said, "I was never at Harrow Road." I told him I should search the premises. He did, "You can search, there is no property here." In his jacket pocket I found envelope addressed, "Mr. H. smith, 11, Tavistock Crescent, Westbourne Park." I asked him to account for that. He said, "Well, to tell you the truth, I do come from there." I took him to Harrow Road Police Station; he was formally charged, and said, "I never broke in or stole anything." Before leaving Sandringham Road I searched the house and found the port<lb/>manteau (produced) containing only a few fittings and two bags; in the kitchen knives, spoons, and forks, cruet stands, and a number of things which have not yet been identified; bottle of aqua fortis for testing silver, and jewel scales (produced). On August 27 I went to 11, Tavistock Crescent, the door was opened by Miss Smith, and is consequence of a communication by her I found in a drawer the necklet and locket (produced) which have been identified by Romsay.</p>

               <p>There was no bed in the front room at 28, Sandringham Road. Pri<lb/>soner stated that the bags were brought by two men who had been lodging there for the past fortnight, whose names he thought were either McDonald or Murphy. There was no sleeping accommodation in the room where he alleged they had been sleeping. There was only one bed occupied by the prisoner and the woman he has been living with.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">MERCER</hi>, X Division. On August 26 I, with other officers, searched rooms at 28, Sandringham Road, and found the bags and box, astrachan jacket, and two pictures cut from the frames (produced). Amongst the articles in the box were a large number of Chinese card counters.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">WINGBOURNE</hi>, X Division. I have seen assisting Inspector Pollard in this case. On August 24, at 9.30 a.m., in the Great Western Road I arrested a man named Montague, who has since been discharged. At 12.40 p.m., in company with Pollard and Police-constable Mander, I saw the two Murphys with Smith in Westbourne Grove near Archer Street. Smith's brother has a bicycle shop in Archer Street. The two Murphys were shortly afterwards arrested by Mander and myself. I told them they would be charged with three other man for breaking and entering 397, Harrow Road, and stealing a quantity of jewellery. Norman Murphy replied, "Where is your warrant? I suppose you have got my pal Montagu?" I took them to Harrow Road Station; they were formally charged, and made no reply. On Gilbert Murphy was found a revolver (which is the subject of another charge), policeman's whistle, a pair of goggles, kid gloves, return ticket from Forest Gate, £6 in gold, £1 12s. in silver and 2d. in bronze; on Norman Murphy £6 10s. gold, 19s. 6d. silver, and 5d. bronze, and a latch key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I told Norman Murphy I had no warrant. (Gil<lb/>bert Murphy stated the whistle was not a police whistle at all. The Recorder: We will withdraw it from the case.) Smith told me the man who had been living with him, named Glover or Donald, was the man who had been pledging articles in Reading.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">RUMBOLD</hi>, X Division. On August 27 I went to 28, Sandringham Road, dug in the back garden, and found tin cocoa box produced, containing three chains, four rings, a kerb pattern bracelet; and these weights, which apparently belong to the scales produced; also a written paper, apparently in Gilbert Murphy's writing con<lb/>taining in slang terms a list of property.</p>
               <p>To Gilbert Murphy. I found teapot and dish produced at 234, Westbourne Grove, a coffee-house, where you had taken a room two days before the arrest. The teapot has been identified by Mrs. Lock<lb/>yer. I found also a quantity of seaman's and private clothing. Those things have no connection with this case. I also found a piece of mother-of-peral counter and a pair of boots, with which the marks in the garden have been compared.</p>

The rope produced was never in the Murphys house, because just before I was going away to Portsmouth to go to work I had an old suit of clothes given me, and I asked them for a rope to the up the parcel, and they only had an old knotted there-stranded rope, which is the one Mrs. Creek speaking of. As regards the handker<lb/>chief, I never said what the officers say, nor is it mine. I admit using snuff occasionally, but not tobacco.</p>

                  </hi>, 43, Ashmore Road, artist in black and white. I occupied the parlour floor since February, 1907. About two months ago I first saw Gilbert Murphy in the garden of 43, Ashmore Road—n July. On the night of the burglary in Harrow Road there was some loud conversation going on downstairs at about 8.30, which dis<lb/>turbed me, and I went down to see what the noise was about. It was not a great noise, but my wife spoke of it and I went down. I could not say I saw Gilbert Murphy that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have seen Coombes with Norman Murphy at 43, Ashmore Road. I saw him in their room when I went down-stairs at about 8.30 p.m. on Monday, August 18. I have twice heard footsteps coming down the area stairs between three and four a.m., and have heard the noise of a window closing.</p>
               <p>To Coombes. I remember you admitted making a bit of a notice ever the pawning of a pipe.</p>
               <p>Coombes and Norman Murphy both stated that this was three days before the burglary took place.</p>

                  </hi>, 26, Knowle Road, Brixton. I am motor-cab driver No. 497. I remember the early morning of July 11. I was in Trafalgar Square. At about half past 12 five men came to me and asked me to drive them to Euston. There were four inside the cab and one out. Prisoners Metcalfe, Pyle, and Dowling were inside. In the Euston road they told me not to go to the station, and directed me where to go—round here and round here, and round here—so of course I went on. They told me to pull up at a coffee stall but by the time I pulled up I was 15 years or so in front of it. They all went to the coffee stall. The man who sat beside are on the box asked me if I would like a cup of coffee? I said, "Yes," and he brought it to me and fetched the cup back when I had drunk it. I sat on the cab white they were at the stall. After a time they came back to the cab, directed me again where to drive, told me to pull up at Pettit's Yard, and told me to wait. I waited until a man in his shirt-sleeves, who had not been one of the party, came up the yard and said, "Governor, we shall not want you any longer. Will you come down for the money," I went down the yard, and just as I was going into the door of a stable I received a heavy blow on the jaw. I do not know who struck the blow. It felled me to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100081"/>
               <p>ground. Then I was struck and kicked, and all my money was taken from my pockets, about £3; I could not say the exact sum. After a struggle I got up, went out of the stable, and run up the yard an first as could, jumped on my cab, and drove down the road until I saw two police officers under a railway arch at St. Pancras. One of the officers got on to the cab and told me to go to the station. There I saw the police inspector, who sent two officers with me in the cab and followed on himself. We went back to the yard, and I pointed set where the assault was committed. In locking round with a latern the police inspector found my cap, and from the men in the yard I picked out the prisoner Drabwell. The same morning I re<lb/>ceived a telegram from the police to identify another man answering the description I had given. That was Metcalfe, and I picked him out of nine others. Pyle I similarly identified on July 14 at Somers Town Station, and Dowling I identified four or five days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Rooth I am an Englishman, and my parents were born in England. I have been driving motor cabs since they have been on the streets. I have never previously been a party in a case. I had been out on the 10th since half past one. It is not true that I had had several drinks or that on the way to Euston I narrowly avoided two collialons, Metcalfe, was a perfect stranger to me; they were all strangers. There was no bargaining; they simply entered the cab and sat down. There was a light in the stable, but I did not take stock of what or where it was. As I entered I was immediately floored. I was not rendered partially in<lb/>sensible by the blow, but it shock me up a bit. I swear that I saw Metcalfe go down the yard. I swear that my money was stolen. I had not a halfpenny-piece when I got to the police station. I know that no money was found on the men except what could be accounted for. I was not attended by a doctor. There were two men concerned who have not been arrested. I have given, a description of them to the police.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Warburton. The lighting of the yard and of the stable was poor. I am certain that Pyle and Dowling went down the yard.</p>
               <p>To the Court. I saw Drabwell in the stable. The man in shirt sleeves who asked me to go down the yard I did not see again. Constable <hi rend="smallCaps">WALKER</hi>, 841 Y. On July 11 I was on duty near King a Cross, about two o'clock in the morning, when Petzing made a state<lb/>ment to me. I went to the station with him, and afterwards to Pettit's yard, Drummond Crescent. The Inspector asked Drabwell about some men going down there, and he said he had seen no men. The Inspector handed him over to my custody, and I took him to the station, where he was charged. He had on him £3 6s. 6d. in silver and 10 1/2d. in bronze, which he stated was money he had taken for his employer and produced a book.</p>

                  </persName>, Y Division. On July 11 Petzing came to the somers Town Police Station and made a statement, and I went with him to the cab yard in Drummond Crescent with two con<lb/>stables. He pointed out a stable in the right-hand corner of the yard. Drabwell came out of another stable and said, "What's up?" Prosecutor said, "That is one of the men who assaulted me." I asked him if he was sure, and he said, "Positive. He placed his wet hand over my mouth." I directed a constable to take Drabwell into custody, who then said, "I know nothing about it, governor." To prosecutor he said, "You said nothing to me when you went out of the yard. I saw you come down with four or five other men." I asked Drabwell if he could give me any information about the four or five men he saw, and he said he did not know any of them. He thought they had all come down the yard to have a stale off. I then searched the stable referred to an found the uniform cap of a meter driver, which prosecutor indentified.</p>

                  </hi>, hackney carriage driver, No. 14,786. On the early morning of Thursday, July 11, my horse had a fit of the gripes in Shaftesbury Avenue, and I led him to Pettit's yard. While I was down the yard I heard a motor cab come up. I left the yard at quarter to two, or something like that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I got to the yard about half-past one. I did not see anybody there except Drabwell. I saw the motor man come down the yard with a fellow named Notteridge and go into a stable on the right. At that time Drabwell was in the stable looking after the horse. I afterwards saw the motor man going up the yard with<lb/>out his hat. I did not hear any disturbance. Drabwell was with me all the time. Notteridge used to be a horsekeeper in one of Pettit's yards.</p>

They got out of the motor and went down the yard. Amongst them were the prisoners Metcalfe, Pyte, and Dowling. I heard the motor man halloa out, and he came up the yard without his cap, jumped on his motor, and rode away.

                  </persName>, E Division. On July 11, is the evening, I saw Metcalfe at 16, Hunter Street, where he lives. I told him I was a police officer and should arrest him for being concerned with a man named Drabwell and otehrs not in custody is stealing £3 from a motor cab driver. He said, "Oh, am I put away?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100083"/>
               <p>I conveyed him to, Hunter Street Police Station, where he was de<lb/>tained, and he was subsequently taken to the Somers Town Police Station by Sergeant Goodchild.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Rooth. I did not notice that Metcalfe had what is commonly called a "game" left. He did not say he knew nothing at all about it. Coming from Trafalgar Square, Metcalfe would have to come back from Drummond Crescent to get to Hunter Street.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">GOODCHILD</hi> deposed to taking Metcalfe from Hunter Street Police Station to the Somers Town Police Station. Metcalfe said when charged: "I know nothing about it. I was not there. I was at home in bed at the time." At Somers town Station he was placed with nine other men and prosecutor at once picked him out and said. "This is one of the men who kicked me." Metcalfe said. "I did not strike you or kick you". On July 14 witness arrested pyle at his address in Ossulston Street. He said, "You have made a mistake. I was never there, and know nothing, whatever about it." Placed with nine other men in Somers Town Police Sta<lb/>tion prosecutor at once picked him out. When charged he said, "I did not strike you or have any of your money. I cannot help what other people did." At 11 a.m., on July 19, witness saw Dowling in King's Cross Road, outside the police court, and said, "You are John Dowling?" He replied, "Yes," and witness thereupon arrested him. Dowling replied, "I was going to give myself up this morn<lb/>ing. I did not assault the driver or steal say of his money. I am one of the men who rode in his cab from Shaftesbury Avenue. We all went down the cab yard, as I thought to pay the driver. There was a bit of a row there and I went away." He was taken to Somers Town Police Station, where he was identified by prosecutor.</p>

                  </persName>, V Division. I was out making inquiries on the early morning of July 11. At about 20 minutes to three, as I was passing through Judd Street, I saw prisoner Metcalfe at the corner of Green Street, going in the direction of Euston Road towards where he is living in Hunter Street. On the evening of the 10th I arrested two men for stealing motor fittings and that kept me out and that is how I came to meet Metcalfe.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a cab washer, and at half past nine on the evening in question was left in charge of the yard. I am innocent of this charge. I was with Swift in the stable at the time attending the sick horse. When the horse was a little easier I came out of the stable and saw prisoner Metcalfe and Net<lb/>teridge walk out of the yard and the motor man following on behind. Shortly afterwards I sat down in the stable and had what I call my breakfast. While I was sitting there I heard somebody come into the yard, so I got up, and I saw prosecutor with an inspector of police,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100084"/>
               <p>who said to me, "Come up here, and let us see you in the light." What light I had was not much of a light, just enough to see what money was brought in by the cabs. The inspector asked prosecutor was I one of the men and he said, "Yes," and with that the constable took me to the station. I did not hear prosecutor say that he had been robbed. When I saw prosecutor going our of the yard I did not notice whether he had a hat on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is not true that I said to prosecutor, "I saw you come down with four or five other men." When I first saw him he did not say he had been robbed, and I did not know what was the matter till he came back. I told the inspector I did not know any of the four men and that I was innocent. All I know about Notteridge is that he has done some work there. I know Pyle and Dowling, but I had not seen them that evening.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Metcalfe was leaving the leaving the yard as if nothing had happened.</p>
               <p>To the Court. Pyle and Dowling were both in the habit of having cabs from the yard.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I live at 16, Hunter Street, with my wife and children. Have been employed as porter by Messrs. Isaacs, fruit salesmen, Covent Garden, for two years and ten months. On July 10 I had a bad leg owing to a ruptured blood-vessel just above the knee, and that prevented me doing porterage work. I had been to the hospital, and had not been working on that day. I went out in the evening about eight o'clock, and met some friends, Dowling and Pyle. We had several drinks, and about half past 12, with two other men, Notteridge and Itter, took the prosecutor's en-meter cab in Trafalgar Square. "frenchy" (Itter) rode on the box. In driving to Pettit's Yard the cab would not pass my place. I walked away from the coffee still because Notteridge had had a row with the coffee stall man, while proceeding through Clarendon Square in the direction of the church opposite Euston Station I saw the cab again with "Frenchy" on the box. He asked me to get in, which I did, and we went to Pettit's yard. I got out of the cab first, and went to a cab at the top of the yard to make water. Dow<lb/>ling and the others said "Good-night," and away they went. I did not go into they yard, and I was no party to attacking prosecutor. I went from the yard up Seymour Street, turned to the left into Woburn Place, and down Tavistock Place to my house in Hunter Street. It took me quarter of an hour or 20 minutes to get home. My wife was awake because one of the children had just woke her up. It was then 20 minutes to two o'clock. The time was correct, as I wind the alarum up every morning to go to work. It is not true that the police officer Joslin saw me. I was not where he says he saw me at the time he says he saw me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. To-day is the first time I have mentioned getting into the cab again in Clarendon Square. It was then going towards my home, and it turned away, I think, in Charles Street. I hal<lb/>loaed</p>

               <p>out for them to stop, but they would not. I heard Drabwell say that Notteridge and I walked up the yard; that is a lie. I heard the constable say that Dowling said we all went down the yard; that is a lie. Petzing's story is also a lie. I did not say when arrested, "Oh, am I put away?" That is another lie.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on catch). I am a licensed cab driver, No. 9,265, and have held a license eight years. I have been driving for Mr. Pettit for three years. I was not driving on the day in question because the young mare I was driving was taken with the spangles. On the evening of the 10th I went round to the yard, where this assault is supposed to have taken place. I afterwards went into a beershop in Seymour Street with Sam Savory, my horsekeeper, and another man called "Long George." After that I went down to Shaftesbury Avenue to try and find a man who own me some money, but as I could not find him I came back again. I went and had a drink with my wife, and then went to the Royal Music Hall, Holborn, where I met the prisoner Dowling and the others. We had several drinks and afterrwards went down Shaftesbury Avenue and entered the motor cab Trafalgar Square. Prosecutor was an entire stranger to me. There was a row at the coffee stall over a sandwich, and Metcalfe and Notteridge walked away, but got in again at Clarendon Square and went on to Drummond Crescent. When we got out of the cab me and Dowling, Metcalfe, Notteridge, and the other man ("Frenchy") went down the yard and the motor man followed. Dowling looked at the register to see what was to pay, as we were to share slake. Then Dowling said to me, "There will be a row here. We are licensed drivers; we had best get home." We had not paid our share, but we could easily have found the driver in Trafalgar Square, and it was only about sixpence apiece. From there we went straight home. I never went down the yard at all, and took no part in the assault.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see Metcalfe go down the yard. I saw him standing against a cab. Notteridge went down the yard. I saw Metcalfe go down the street. I do not know whether he came back or not. I did not hear any row. There was no row at the top of the yard. The row at the coffee stall had nothing to do with petzing, the driver. It is not true that there was a row at the yard before Dowling went away. Notteridge is the only man I saw go down the yard, but whether he went right down I could not say because it was dark. When I got out of the cab at the top of the yard I was going to pay my share towards the ride. Dowling looked at the taximeter and said, "This is no place for us. Let us get home There will be a row here". As to who was to pay for the cab we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100086"/>
               <p>would, have paid our share the next morning. There was a man in his shirt sleeves who did come up the yard and the carman went down. We had all five of us been to the Royal.</p>

With the exception of two charges of drunkenness, one eight one five years ago, I have a perfectly clean record. I live at the Jockey's Fields, Gray's Inn. On the day before this occurrence I had not been out with my cab, which was "in docl." I generally go back from the yard to Gray's Inn by train. At the coffee stall there was a bit of an argument. After I had looked at the taximeter I said, "Let us pay. It won't come to more than 6d. or 8d. apiece." I saw Metcalfe against a cab. Notteridge and Frenchy went down the yard. Notteridge afterwards called the driver and he went down the yard. I said to Pyle that Notteridge had had a drop of been and it looked like being a row. Let him settle for the cab, and away we went. We were thinking of our licenses; we did not want to be in any row. We were ready to contribute our share next day. The driver was an entire stranger to me, and I could have had no possible grudge against him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is true that I was going to give myself up the morning I was arrested. I heard there was a job of this kind, but I did not think it was so serious. I thought it was only about a cab fare.</p>

I crossed the road and noticed something pro<lb/>truding from the back of Critchell's coat. I followed them into Cal<lb/>lum Street, and, seeing they were watching me, I went to them, said I was a police officer, and asked what had they under their coat. Critchell then pulled out one of the candlesticks produced and struck Critchell then pulled out one of the candlesticks produced and struck me with it on the right jaw. I caught hold of the prisoners, and in the struggle we all fell in the road. Critchell then kicked me in the left knee while on the ground. I then received a kick on the left thigh, and on looking round saw Steer standing over me with a candlestick in his hand, with which he struck me two or three times in the head. Critchell got away for a few yards. I ran after him, caught him, and took him into a chemist's shop, whence I sent for caught him, and took him to Middlesex Hospital. Critchell said, "It was not me that struck you with the candlestick. I was the other and who ran away." The candlesticks were afterwards picked up in the road.

Seymour was bleeding very profusely from the head—he was smothered in blood. He said, "Take hold of this man; he has stolen two candlesticks, struck me with one and kicked me." The prisoner said. "I may have struck him. I do not know if I kicked him in the struggle."

                  </hi>, divisional surgeon. On August 23, at 6.30 p.m., I saw Seymour. He had a swelling on the right lower jaw the size a hen's egg due to a violent blow, two cuts on the top of his head extending to the bone, one two inches long and one parallel with it one inch in length. His clothing was saturated with blood. There were bruises on the left knee and the left thigh. He was in a condi<lb/>tion of collapse. He is still under my care; he may be able to return to duty in three weeks or a month. He will have to go to a convales<lb/>cent home. His condition is very bad indeed; he is very nervous, and there may be injury to the brain, which may reappear five six years hence. The injuries to the head could have been caused by the candlesticks produced. There must have been great violence used.</p>

                  </hi>, Woodlands, near Leeds, civil engi<lb/>neer. On July 7, 1907, I was travelling to Victoria from Switzer<lb/>land, having registered a Gladstone bag, box and bicycle at Borne. Arriving at Newhaven the bag was intact, was inspected by the Cus<lb/>toms officer and relocked and put in the train for Victoria. On arrival I sent a porter from the Grosvenor Hotel with ticket (pro<lb/>duced) to get my luggage, and he failed to get the Gladstone bag, which I have not seen since. Articles produced were brought to me at Leeds and identified by me, many of them being marked with my initials. The value of the bag and contents is about £25.</p>

Osborne has been to my place about 20 times during the last six months. I did not say at the police court he had only been there twice. Osborne told us some man had given him the things. The last time he came was about a month or six weeks before the arrest. I should be aware of it if my husband had a new shirt; he has not ask bought one in petticoat lane. Osborne gave him this I did not ask Osborne any questions—my husband told me not to—that that was his business not mine. I had no suspicion. On August 12 I told Goodchild I had broken open my husband's box. I did not say I had removed any goods. The letters produced, which have been handed to Osborne, were among dirty things in my tin box. I did not say to Goodchild it was no good look<lb/>ing in that because it only contained dirty linen. The only pawn-tickets I had were given to Goodchild. I had not removed any when I broke open my husband's box.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk in the Confidential Inquiry Branch, G.P.O. In consequence of complaint of the loss of a letter through the Northern district Office, at which prisoner was employed as an auxiliary postman, I saw prisoner there on august 3. I told him who I was and cautioned him. I said, "On May 25 last a letter posted at Highbury, addressed to John Bedford, The Colony, Hol<lb/>lesley Bay, Suffolk, passed through the Northern District Office at the time you were on duty, and you could have had access to it; it contained a postal order for 1s.; the order was cashed at the Railway Hotel, Hornsey Rise, by a postman whose description, as given by the publican's son, agrees with yours; have you anything to say?" He said, "I have no knowledge of the matter; I admit I have changed one or two orders at the Railway Hotel for my wife; they were sent to her from Fulham, either one or two, by a Miss Davis, also one or two from somewhere else, I don't know where." I asked him, if he had no objection, to turn out the contents of his pockets, and he did so. Acting on instructions, I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner has been in Post Office employment for about 15 years, and so far has borne a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist my father in the business of the "Railway Hotel," Hornsey Rise. I recognise the postal order (produced) as one that was cashed by me for the prisoner on May 25; I paid it into my father's account between the 25th and the 30th. Prisoner brought it to me in the saloon bar; I knew him as a cus<lb/>tomer of the house, but not knowing his name I endorsed the order, "Saloon, postman." I went to the G.P.O. on August 3, and picked out prisoner from 10 or 12 other postmen. I had cashed orders for him on previous occasions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was between six and eight at night when pri<lb/>soner brought me the order; that is a fairly busy time with us. It has not been my custom to endorse orders that we change, but we had had some stolen and that was why I endorsed this. I cannot say whether prisoner was in uniform or in private clothes. I knew him as a customer; if it had been any to the postman I should have asked for his name and address. I think I have not made any mis<lb/>take in the many other postmen come to the house, but this is the only one that used the saloon bar. I have not cashed an order for any other postman.</p>

                  </hi>, Overseer at the Northern District Post Office.

               <p>Cross-examined. The men working at the table where the letters were shot out would have access to this letter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's statement to the magistrate: Sir, I am charged with stealing a letter, which I did not, and also changing it at the Rail<lb/>way Hotel, which I did not. The said letter was not found on me. I think it hard to be accused of stealing when you have not. I am a regular customer at the hotel; I go for my beer for dinner and supper for my wife and me. I have also changed several postal orders for my wife at the same hotel. There has been a greet mis<lb/>take there. The shilling postal order has been taken over the counter from a postman and put aside. me being a regular customer I got the blame, which I tell you on my oach I did not, as a men to a gentleman. It is hard that I should have the stain on my character which I have not got. I have been 15 years in the Post Office as an auxiliary postman. I have never taken one farthing piece from them or anyone else."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have at 417, Hornsey Rise. I have been an auxiliary postman for 15 years, and, as far as I know, hold an excellent character. Previously I was for 12 years in the Army as a musician, leaving with a very good character. My wife has from time to time received postal orders for 1s. and 1s. 6d. I often changed them at the "Railway Hotel," which is just across the road from my house; I think that is nearer than the post office. I was well known in that public-house. I often went in my private Dress and sometimes in uniform at night on my home I have never seen the postal order, the subject of the charge. I did not change any postal order at the hotel on the day in question. I might have been in there that night but not in uniform. I am not in uni<lb/>form after four on Saturday. When I get home on Saturday, which is about four, I go upstairs and play the violin. On this Saturday I had my tea and changed my clothes. Then I went and had some practice on the violin. I never go out before about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The nearest post office to my house is 148, Marl<lb/>borough Road, about five or six minutes' walk. There is an office at 516, Hornsey Road, further up than the hotel. I pass a post office on my way home from delivering letters, but I do not have the orders then. I get them from my wife when I get home. I generally change them at dinner time when we want a drop of bear. We do not get many of them. I go into the ordinary bar for my beer;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100094"/>
               <p>sometimes if I meet a friend I go into the saloon bar. I always go to this public-house on Monday nights in uniform about 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. There are several cross-roads between my house and 516, Hornsey Road. If I go to the hotel it is on Saturday night between nine and 10, or Monday about 11.</p>

He always changes his clothes as soon as he comes in. He generally helps me with the children. He could not go out without my knowing it. I do not re<lb/>member May 25. I first heard of this affair when a gentleman called on me on the day before August 3. I could swear that my husband was at home every Saturday in general; I could not swear to dates. I have received postal orders, some from Fulham and Lower Edmon<lb/>ton. I keep a house and let unfurnished rooms. Sometimes my lodgers leave without paying, and then send postal orders for 1s. or 1.s 6d., which I sometime give to my husband and other times change myself. I have been married 13 years, and have never heard my husband accused of anything before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have some letters enclosing postal orders. (Same produced.) I have destroyed the envelopes. I do not remem<lb/>ber whether my husband went out on May 25. He would not have gone without telling me.</p>

Prisoner had been on his way home just before this; between eight and nine a.m., He produced this paper cover, torn in two, and a tin of tobacco, and amongst other things a torn cover of another packet, with the address, "Richmond Road, Barnsbury." Prisoner said, "That is my tobacco."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am sure prisoner said, "That is my tobacco." He had one packet "over" in his bag, which he said he wanted to endorse and re-post. The tobacco tin came out of his tunic pocket; he brown paper out of his trouser's pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's statement before the magistrate: "On Saturday, the 3rd, I took out in mistake a packet which did not belong to me, in a hurry, the morning being wet, and my bag got wet; also I found when I had half finished my duty this packet, which was undone; the wrapper came off, which I folded and put in my pocket; then I finished. The said pocket contained tobacco, which I did not smoke a pipe, which I was going to see to when I finished my duty. When I had finished, and was going home, and to have the said packet seen to, I was stopped by two detectives of the Post Office, which I thought it was very hard on me, and not giving me a chance of having the packet seen to. On the morning of August 3, at the Northern District Post Office, about 6.50 a.m., I was going to the livatory when I picked up a piece of brown paper rolled up, and put it in my pocket thinking there might be no paper there. When I got there I found some, but not thinking any more of it—if I had looked at it I would have put it where I found it. I think it is very hard to be punished for the crime I have not done. I am telling you on my oath the truth. I have a wife and four little children at home, and to think that I should lose my character and situation and have the stain on me."</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100096"/>
               <p>pocket for safety, and also the cover, which was torn. It is my duty to have it seen to when I finish delivered. When I had done so I was stopped by two detectives in Ball's Pond Road; they would not let me see to the packet, but took me to the office, when I was searched, and gave them this packet, as well as my own things that were in my pocket. I had not intention of retaining possession of the tin of tobacco. In regard to the brown paper found on me, I picked that up as I was going to the lavatory, at about 6.50 in the morning, thinking there would be no paper there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. On the Saturday in question I started my de<lb/>livery about 7.5 to 7.10. I was supposed to finish at 8.30. I do not know how the packet and paper got in my bag; being Saturday morning we were very busy. If these things had been in the bag before I put the letters in I should have seen them. There was no string round the packet when I took it out of the bag. I put it in my pocket to keep it dry. My bag was wet, too. There was another pocket it my bag—a mis-sort—which was too bulky to put in my pocket. When I met the detectives I was on my way home to Hollo<lb/>way. The office is in Upper Street. I call at the post office on my way. On this occasion I was going to call at another office to leave this packet—the Receiver's in Highbury Grove. That is the usual thing if I am on my way home. When the detectives stopped me I told them I had some correspondence in my pocket to deal with. They did not give me time to tell them I had anything in my bag. It was about 20 minutes walk to the office from where they stopped me. They told me to keep my hands out of my pocket.</p>

               <p>I know him by working on the same ship. We were passengers by the 12.15 a.m. train from Paddington to Liverpool. I was fighting with a man named Marsden, and prisoner came to Marsdon's assist<lb/>ance. Prisoner drew a knife and hit me outside the hand. I got away from Marsden, and then prisoner cut me on the right side of the head. The train was stopped at Acton. I do not suppose it had been more than five minutes on its journey before prisoner came into our compartment. I was taken to hospital, but only remained there an hour or two. Prisoner and Marsden came into the compartment and asked who was looking for bother Marsden came up and hit me on the side of the face and I hit him back. I had not previously said that I was ready to fight. We were getting ready to enjoy our<lb/>selves during the journey when these men came along the corridor. They were both drunk.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. There were about six men in my compartment, mates whom I had been working with, amongst them Kelly and Nesbit.</p>

Then I saw prisoner draw a knife and make quick gashes with it. I saw him stab Reardon in the side of the head, but not on the arm. I was cut in trying to get the knife away from prisoner. When the train stopped at Aston I made a statement to the police and gave evidence the next day at the police court.</p>
               <p>To the Court. We were all sitting quickly in the carriage enjoying ourselves. The other men were singing, and I was playing the melo<lb/>deon. I was sitting in the further corner of the carriage. Of course, those who sat near the door would have a better chance of seeling.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I think Reardon was sitting near the door. I am not quite sure.</p>

I had him removed to the Cottage Hos<lb/>pital, where I stitched up the wounds and did what was necessary. I did not think it was necessary he should remain in hospital. The wounds could not have been caused by the fist. The wounds are not of themselves serious, but, of course, complications might arise.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I know this happened after leav<lb/>ing the Great Western Paddington Station for Liverpool, but I do not remember seeing anything of the first three witnesses there. The last I saw of Marsden was when we left Woolwich, and we were get<lb/>ting out kit bags together. Of course, I was the worse for drink. There was fighting all over the place. We had drink with us in the compartment. We had three gallons of beer, and I think everybody in the train had beer or whisky. I do not think there were two man sober amongst the whole lot.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul. Were you drunk when you went on to the train?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes. It was a quarter-past 12 in the morning when we got on to the express, and we had had about five hours in London. I had no knife in my possession. I had not got a knife on me. It is true that most seafaring men carry a knife. I had a big knife, but lost it coming from New York two days out. A gentleman from St. Katharine's Dock took out tickets the previous evening about six o'clock. We had been six hours drinking.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul. You do not know whether any of the officials saw you going on to the train. The question is, how far this statement is true, that a number of men madly drunk would be allowed into a train at all by the porters at the station or railway officials. It is a matter for the railway company to look into.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I know Marsden through him being in the same watch as me as A.B. I remember getting into the train at Padding<lb/>ton, but I do not remember anything else. I remember getting into some train, but I do not know whether it was this one or not.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul. Then you do not remember whether you stabbed a man or not?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do not think I did. I do not remember it. I deny having a knife at all; I lost mine on the voyage and you cannot get one on the ship.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kent, for the railway company, pointed out that the precau<lb/>tion had been taken of putting these men into a separate corridor carriage, and none of the other passengers were inconvenienced by or knew anything of what was going on. The tickets were not taken by the men themselves.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul. If six drunken men were put into a carriage alone would be an awkward business. It looks rather strange if they were in this state of intoxication that they should have got on to the train. The company might have refused to allow them there at all.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100099"/>
               <p>Mr. Kent. There is only the statement of this man in the witness box that they were all drunk. We have not had it from the others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Scotaman, and was born in Glasgow. On the morning of August 27 I was a passenger by the 12.15 a.m. train from paddington to Liverpool, and prisoner was a passenger by the same train. When we left the docks where we arrived from Bremerhaven we came to Paddington, where we arrived at half past six in the evening. I came back about quarter to 12 with my young brother and we selected a compartment. One of the follows get playing a mouth organ when "Ginger." (prisoner) made his appear<lb/>ance at the carriage door. I told him to go back to his own com<lb/>partment and shut the door. We knew he was of a quarrelsome nature from previous experience, and he was all for fighting. We were for enjoying ourselves and did not want no fighting at all. Jones was sitting second from the left where "Ginger" was standing and he got up, I do not know whether with the intention of forcibly shifting him or of advising him to go away, but before we know what had happened there was a fight. Prisoner struck me and I struck him. I felt Saunders strike me on the arm, and shortly afterwards I saw blood running down. Shortly after I felt dizzy, and I do not remember the train being stopped at Acton Station. I never saw any knife in prisoner's hands. It was two or three seconds before I felt myself stagger. Prisoner got me a sent and said, "Oh! Scotty, I did not mean to do that," or "I did not intend to do it." As I was falling he supported me.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I was not sober. There was not a sober man on the train, not one, but I knew what I was doing.</p>

                  </hi>, divisional surgeon. On the morning of August 27 I was called to the Cottage Hospital, where I saw William O'Neill. He had an incised wound on the right arm over the biceps about three inches in length. The wound was gaping very much. The muscles had been cut and torn. I stitched the wound up. He had lost a great deal of blood. His clothes were satured with blood. He was in the hospital about a fortnight. The wound must have been caused by a knife a sharp instrument. There were two tiny the point of a knife, but could not have been caused by the point of a knife, but could not have been caused by the fist. I did not see the clothes which had been removed.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">INSTANCE</hi> said the coat was in such a filthy condition that it had to be destroyed, being saturated with blood. It had to be cut off him, so that it could not be examined for cute afterwards. I do not think the wounds could have been inflicted by broken earthen<lb/>ware or broken glass. It is very unlikely that glass would have cut through the coat.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). When I got into the car<lb/>riage of this train I was not drunk. I knew what I was doing. There was no one with me in particular because we were fifty together, all in one shift, all more or less drunk, and all carrying bottles and jars. I deny striking "Scotty" at all. The first time I see "Scotty" he was lying down on the floor of the carriage. I turned round to a fellow and said, "Scitty's arm is bleeding. Can you lend me a handkerchief?" I got him into his own compartment, which was then empty and laid him on the seat. Somebody pulled the commu<lb/>nication cord, and I stopped by him until the police came into the carriage at Acton and helped him out on to the platform. I heard no more until next morning, when the inspector charged me on "Scotty's" statement. Another thing; my knife was found in my bag at Acton Station. The bag was thrown to me out of the train window by a young man named Best when he saw me detained by the police-sergeant.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">INSTANCE</hi> said he saw the prisoner's ordinary sailor's knife with his other property in the bag.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100101"/>
               <p>Prisoner. I deny using the knife at all. I was not fighting with O'Neill at all. O'Neill was blind drunk and did not know what he was saying. I never said, "I did not mean it." My bag was in another compartment on the rack. I was not in the same compartment with O'Neill, but four or five compartments higher up towards the rear of the train. I shall call Reardon, Nesbit, and Kelly if they are hare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">REARDON</hi>, in answer to the Court, said he did not see Saunders at all, nor anybody strike O'Neill. There were 30 or 40 men there also to<lb/>gether.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a knife and a belt and a sweater found in the train.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul, in summing up, pointed out that the case against prisoner depended on the evidence of O'Neill alone. This was a very serious matter; he said deliberately that it was one that should he looked into by the railway company, for according to the evidence of several witnesses, a large number of men were put into that night train, which was to run a great distance, in a state of drunkenness, so that there might have been a murder, or several murders, committed. He was sure the jury would agree that that was a thing which should so have happened, and that somebody was very seriously to blame in regard to it.</p>
               <p>Verdict,

               <p>Mr. Grain said he would take care that his lordship's obervations should be brought before the directors.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul remarked that to put 40 or 50 people all drunk into a train which was not to stop for several hours and was running in the middle of the night was about the most desperate thing one could conceive a railway company doing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Eustace Fulton prosecuted; Mr. Burnie appeared for prisoner. It was stated that prisoner earned about 10s. a week as a pedlar; her husband earned considerable wages, most of which he spent in drink; there were frequent quarrels between the pairm the man con<lb/>stantly assaulting his wife. There were two children of the mar<lb/>riage, and prisoner was now pregnant. She did not deny that she threw vitriol over her husband, but said that it was done under great provocation. No permanent injury was done to the man. Prisoner's mother undertook to look after her during her confinement, which was expected in a month's time. She had been in prison since August 24. Mr. Justice Bray considered that in all the circum<lb/>stances he was justified in treating prisoner with leniency, and secur<lb/>ing, at any rate, that the child should not be born in prison.

                  </persName> 4, Southolme-Street, Battersea. Prisoner, with her husband and three childern, occupied the ground floor of my house since February. On August 28, as I was leaving home, I noticed the child Anne (who is 3 years old) crying for nearly half an hour, which was unusual. On returning home at half-past two, I heard the child moaning. I knocked at prisoner's door and pushed it open; a great smell of gas came out and made me stagger. On going into the room I found the gas was full on; I shut it off and opened the windows. Prisoner was lying on the bed unconscious; the child was moaning and seemed dazed. A constable and a doctor were fetched. I heard prisoner say that "she could not see her chil<lb/>dren starve; better die." Prisoner had been worried and strange for some time, and complained of her head. She was always kind to the children.</p>

Prisoner was lying on a bed unconscious and foaming at the mouth. On the arri<lb/>val of the doctor artificial respiration was resorted to and prisoner came round. She said several times, "My children!" when she seemed in a fit condition to be questioned I asked her "How did this occur?" She cried out, "My children, I could not see them starve; I want to die!"</p>

Prisoner was lying on a bed, unconscious, suffering from as poison<lb/>ing. I applied artificial respiration, and in about half an house she came round. The child soon recovered from the effects of the poison<lb/>ing. Prisoner herself had inhaled a large quantity of gas and nar<lb/>rowly escaped death. I had no conversation with her.

                  </hi>, divisional surgeon. I saw prisoner at the station about five p.m. on August 28. She was in a collapsed condition. On examining her I concluded that she was revering from an epileptic fit. Her tongue was bitten through. She appeared dazed and only partly sensible. I administered some restoratives and she recovered herself. Then her husband in her presence said, "She has suffered from her head for some time. She has had fits, foam<lb/>ing at the mouth, and has fallen." This was interpreted to prisoner but she appeared to have no clear understanding of what was said.</p>

                  </hi>, 7, Waterloo Place, quantity surveyor, I am a member of the United Empire Club, and in January, 1905, I there met Quill, who I understood was a Militia officer. Towards the end of April, 1907, I met Quill at the Hyde Park Hotel. He said he had just come up from Windermere, and that he had made a lot of money, enough to last him to the end of his days. A fortnight after<lb/>wards I met him in Regent Street and he asked me to come to tea at the Carlton Hotel, which I did, and he introduced me to some other gentlemen, not the prisoners. About the beginning of June 1907, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100106"/>
               <p>met him in Piccadilly with the other two prisoners, whom he intro<lb/>duced to me as Mr. or the Hon. Pleydell Bouverie and Meggs. It was a simple introduction. Quin knew I was a quantity surveyor. About a week afterwards he called at my office and said the friend of his whom he had introduced me to was looking for a site to build a theatre, hotel, and garage on at some seaside place; he mentioned Burnham-on-Crouch and Felixstowe. I said I did not know of any<lb/>thing there, but I knew of some land that might suit at Bognor. He asked me to go round to the Carlton Hotel and talk it over with Meggs. I was to act as quantity surveyor, and he asked what I could give him for introducing the business. I suggested 10 per cent. on my fees, which he agreed to. He asked me not to tell meggs. He suggested that an architect would be required, and asked what com<lb/>mission he would give. I suggested that if I introduced the architect he would also give him 10 per cent. commission. I went to the Carl<lb/>ton Hotel with him and saw Meggs and Brown. Meggs asked when should we go down and see the place, and we agreed to take the train from Victoria at 10.33 in June 12. The next day Quill came again to my office and said that Maggs was very taken with the idea of Bongnor, was talking of spending up to £60,000 on the site, and sug<lb/>gested that I should introduce the architect as soon as possible in case Meggs might go else here. On June 12 I went to Victoria in good time, Quill arrived, then Brown, and then Meggs. Meggs went up the platform to look for a man with his bag, and when he returned the train had gone. We decided to go by the next train at 11.37 and Meggs suggested, as he had not had much breakfast, to have some re<lb/>freshment. We went to the dining-room and all had some sandwiches. etc., which Meggs paid for. Meggs then suggested that we should toss for the fares, which I agreed to. Quill was to stand out. Brown, Meggs and I then tossed; Brown was declared out; Meggs and I showed coins, and he declared I had lost. I accepted it, paid for four first-class tickets, £3 8s., and we went by the 11.37 train. Before the train started Meggs asked Bouverie (Brown) to get a pack of cards, which he apearentl you got from the bookstall. In the train Maggs told me he had £20,000 in the bank—it was no use leaving it in the bank, he wanted to spend it on a hotel and theatre scheme—that he had also £20,000 in Consols which he had bought at 97, and would lose con<lb/>siderably in realising. He said he knew 200 members of the Auto<lb/>mobile Club who would use the hotel, and that Mr. George Edwardes and Mr. Frank Curzon would be able to assist him to get good com<lb/>paries during the summer. He said he had a friend who could put £20,000 into the scheme with him, but he would sooner do it all him<lb/>self, he did not want a partner. As we passed Mitcham Meggs Sug<lb/>gested playing cards. I said I was not a card player—I could not even play bridge—I never had. They said. "Oh, let us have a game of nap—everyone knows nap." I said I had not played nap for twenty years. Meggs said, "Oh, come along—only 1d. points." We then started, paying as we went on, and played with varying fortunes until we got to Dorking, when I ran short of ready cash and suggested</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100107"/>
               <p>keeping a score. I had lost about 12s., and having paid £3 8s. for the tickets had not much change left. Brown then kept the score, and at Horsham I had lost a further 25s. we there changed into the Bognor train, and brown suggested we should play monte. I said I knew nothing about it. Maggs said there was nothing to know in it, it was purely luck, and he showed me. He said, "You cannot lose at it—only 1d. points." I then agreed to play, as I did not want to offend Maggs, and we played for a while at 1d. points Meggs then suggested 6d. points and 2s. on the last round, and we played several rounds. He then wanted to put it up to 1s. points and 5s. on the last round, and we played three or four rounds at that. I objected to the higher points, Brown supported me, and we went back to 6d. points and played for some time. As we got near to Bonger I sug<lb/>gested leaving off and that the score should be made up. Brown started adding it up. At the bottom of the first page he said, "There is not much difference between us." When he had partly added up the next page he said he though I owed about £30. We then reached Bognor, went down to the sea front and looked at some land on the cast and then on the west of the pier. Maggs said he thought the western site would suit him very well, and we discussed it. Quill said to me apart from the others, "I have told Maggs that you are a very rich man." I said, "Why did you do that, it is not so." He said, "It is well to let a man like Maggs think so." We went to the hotel and had some lunch. I then went to see the local architect, Mr. Bar<lb/>low, about the price but his office was shut. The lunch was paid for by the prisoners in my absence. When I returned they were in the smoking-room, and Brown handed me a statement of the score. It showed that I owed £26 15s. 10d. to Meggs, £23 15s. 10d. to Brown, and £7 17s. 10d. to Quill. I said I had not a cheque book with me, but I would send them cheques next day. They suggested my writing cheques on note paper, which I declined to do. Quil offered to settle with the others, to be my banker, and the I could settle with him. I said I would sooner settle separately. Subsequently it was arranged that I should pay Brown's and Meggs' amounts to Meggs and pay Quill in another cheque, and they gave me their addresses—Meggs, 24, Queen Victoria Street, Quill, 18, Drayton Gardens, and Bouverie, 19, Bolton Street, Piccadilly. I said, "It is about 20 years since I had played cards, and it will be about 20 years before I play again." We returned to London by the 5.10. As we waited at the junction Meggs said he came into a large fortune at 21. In the train Brown said he was a cousin of Lord Radnor, and that Lord Radnor had 700 houses at Folestone. Maggs asked me to go to Le Brasseur and Oakley, the solicitors in London, to find out the price of the land on Saturday, and we made an appointment to meet. Maggs remained outside, as he thought if they saw he was the purchaser they might ask a larger price. M. Le Brasseur was not there. We then took a cab to the Inns of Court Hotel, and on the way I gave Maggs a cheque for £53 1s. 8d. (produced), drawn to J. Meggs, Esq., which has been endorsed, and paid by my bank.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100108"/>
               <p>(Tuesday, September 17.)</p>
               <p>Examination resumed. I also sent cheque produced to Quil £7 17s. 10d., which is endorsed by T. Quill, and has been paid by my bank. At the Inns of Court Hotel I discussed the building scheme with Meggs. He said he had £40,000 available, and asked if I knew an architect with hotel experience. I suggested Mr. Houchin, said that he had prepared plans for two large hotels, and that I had known him some little time. Meggs said he was sorry that I had lost at cards, being a stranger to the party, but that doubtless we should have many more games of cards together. I said, "I think we have had our first and last game of cards together because I cannot afford to play at £60 an hour." He subsequently offered to toss me for the cheque £100 or nothing. I rejected that He then offered to toss me for £80 or nothing, which I refused. He then said, "Oh, I must make it up to you some other way." He said £60 was nothing; that he had played Bouverie a few days before and lost £400. On June 17 I saw Le Brasseur, the solicitor, in reference to the Bognor site, and looked over a plan of the estate, and told Meggs the price—£5,333 £and that I had arranged to receive from the vendor 1 1/4 per cent. commission if he bought the land. Meggs said, "That is nothing to do with me, what you get from the other side. I shall see that you are all right." At the Inns of Court Hotel I had told Meggs that I should possibly be able to get a commission from the solicitors, but that, if not, he would would have to pay me a commission of finding the land. I suggested 1 per cent., and he agreed. He appointed to go with me to the solicitors on Tuesday, June 18, and on that day he came and said he was going to Ascot, and wanted me to make a further appointment for Thursday, which I did. Calling on Thursday morning, he said he was again going to Ascot and wanted to make an appointment for Monday. As he had not kept two appointments, I suggested he should telephone from my office to Le Brasseur to make an appoint<lb/>ment himself, which he did for Monday, June 24. On Monday he telephoned to me and said that his theatrical friends advised him that Bognor was not suitable for a theatre. I said, "Why not go on with the hotel?" He said no, he would sooner have it all under one. I then telephoned Le Brasseur that we were not coming. Quill was with Meggs on the 18th and 24th. A few days before the 24th I had heard from Houchin of some property at Horne Bay and I told Meggs. He said he would like to see it, and I made an appoint<lb/>ment to see Houchin that afternoon. Meggs and Brown called for me in a cab. When in the office I suggested that possibly Meggs's friend who had £20,000 might take up the Bognor scheme for as hotel, and in the cab Maggs told me that Bouverie (Brown) had £14,000 available, and that he was thinking of taking up the Bognor scheme with his cousin, the Earl of Radnor. When we arrived at Houchin's he showed some sketch plans which he had prepared at my request at his own risk in order to save time. Meggs seemed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100109"/>
               <p>to think they were very suitable. I knew of Houchin's going to Horne Bay, and after his return I had conversation with him. He showed me a pack of cards. On Wednesday, June 26, Houchin, Meggs, and I discussed the Horne Bay site. Meggs said he thought it would suit him; he was going to purchase it. The price was £5,250, and we arranged to offer £4,500 to start with the owner, Mr. Ramsay, Maggs asked me to call and see his solicitor, Mr. Davis, 7, Union Court, Old Broad Street, about it, and we went the next morning. Meggs introduced me to Davis as his surveyor, and the draft offer was produced. Davis said he could not allow his client to sign it until he had seen the title-deeds, as he contempleted spending a large sum of money. Meggs said, "Yes, as I told you, about £60,000." I suggested that Davis might see the freeholder and obtain a view of the deed. Meggs then said he wanted it to he pushed through as quickly as possible—he wanted to have the whole scheme in working order in 12 months. Meggs and I then left, and at the end of Union Court he said he did not like it standing over till Thursday; he would go back and try and get his solicitor to see Ramsay that afternoon. A few days afterwards Meggs asked me to see him at the Carlton Hotel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gill said he did not wish to limit the inquiry, but he submitted that the only question in the case was whether there was cheating at cards.</p>
               <p>The Recorder: That seems to me to be the sole question for the jury to deter<lb/>mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. C. Mathews said that that point did not touch the question of conspires—the combination to induce persons to stake moneys by means of false statements.</p>
               <p>The Recorder said he had some doubt about it, but would not stop the evidence at this point.</p>
               <p>Houchin and I met Meggs and Brown on July 10 at the Carlton Hotel smoking room. We discussed the Horne Bay site, and I suggested to Meggs that Hulford, the agent for the vendor should call on Davis. The discussion continued as if the purchase of the property was really intended. By that time Mr. Houchin has seen the police, and on July 6 I was asked to make my statement. After July 10 I heard no more about the intended purchase. I believed the stories that were told me by the prisoners. On the journey to Bognor I suggested that Brown should keep the score as to the nap, and subsequently it was continued by him. I thought I had lost about the amount he mentioned—I knew I had lost a consider<lb/>able amount. The amount was consistent with the play as far as I could tell from the score. I saw the earlier part of the score. I did not reckon it up myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. This was not my prosecution in any sense. I was asked to go to Scotland Yard on July 6. On June 26 I had seen Houchin alone. Afterwards Scotland, a private inquiry agent, called on me. Houchin showed me some cards. I looked at them with a glass and though them marked. There were spote on the white margin on the backs of several of the cards. When I went to the police-court to give evidence I certainly thought the cards shown to me were marked. The prosecution was started on that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100110"/>
               <p>basis. (Cards produced, and handed to the jury.) (Statement at<lb/>tached to the deposition. The suggestion made by Kinder's evidence on August 13 that some of the cards used in the game played by him with the prisoners were fraudulently marked on the back was withdrawn by the Treasury on August 20.) My idea was that the low cards marked, so that a low card could be turned up. on July 26 Mr. Rowe, representing the Public Prosecutor, withdrew the suggestion. It had been stated that a boy would be called to prove that these cards had not been bought at the railway station, and that suggestion was also withdrawn. I was present when Hou<lb/>chin swore he information—before the Treasury had anything to do with the case. It was my impression that the cards were marked when I gave evidence. Had I had the further information I should given it in the same way. I had known Quill two and a half years, and had had conversation with him about his earning a commission, and with regard to the Swiss Hotels Company with which Houchin was connected. I made the suggestion to him about Bogner with a view to making a commission. Beyond seeing a notice on a piece of land there, I had nothing to do with Bognor. When we got down there that particular piece of land was being built on. The day after I had seen the spots on the cards, when I thought it was not straight play, I sent Meggs an account for £63.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I certainly believed in the genuineness of Meggs's inquiries into this land at Bognor for the purpose of the hotel and theater, and that he intended to carry on the negotiation in the ordinary way.</p>
               <p>The Recorder: The witness relying on the truth of the representations parted with his money, because he lost at cards. It is necessary not merely that the pretences should be false in fact, but that the money should be parted with as a result of those false representation. It may be there is ground for conspiracy to defraud, but as to the count of obtaining money by false pretences, there is no evidence to support that, but on the contrary evidence to contradict it, and therefore, I must withdraw those counts from the jury.</p>

                  </hi>, Hart Street, Bloomsbury, architect. In June, 1907, Kinder saw me with reference to the site at Bognor, and I got out some rough plans of an hotel, theatre, and a garage. On June 24 he introduced me to Meggs and Brown (in the name of Pley<lb/>dell Bouverie). Meggs said that he had seen the Bognor site, but that he was advised by Mr. Curzon and his friends that it was not a suitable place for a theatre—he would therefore hand that scheme over to Bouverie, who would undertaken for an hotel and garage only, and that he would go in for another site at Horne Bay. Brown was there, and he said, Yes, he would take that up, he should go into it with his cousin. the Earl of Radnor. I knew there was some property at Horne Bay. Mr. Hulford came in and the plan was laid before them. They said they would like to see the land, and Meggs asked me to visit the land with him, and it was arranged we should go down the next day. I asked Meggs if he was satisfied with the plans and if I was to be the architect for him. He said, Yes—for both himself and Bouverie, at Horne Bay and Bognor. I advised him that I did not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100111"/>
               <p>think he would find a place where both a theatre and hotel would be wanted, because if the people were there probably the hotels were there, and that therefore it would be very difficult to find such a place, is my opinion. Meggs said that he could do the hotel himself, he did not care whether the people were there or not, he could fill the theatre and the hotel, too, if necessary, that he was connected with the Auto<lb/>mobile clib, and he could take people down by car and his guests would go down, Bonverie said that he was the Earl pf Radnor's cousin who would join him in this scheme, and that he knew a great many people in my county, Essex, that Mr. Tindal White was his tenant that his property there was freehold, that he would take me down the following Friday on his motor to his property at Stanton; and go round by my house, and that he would buy it that he the light £3,000 very reasonable from the description, that he thought he would like it £3,000 was the price I was asking. We then arranged to go down from Victoria by the 10.45 train the next day, Tuesday, June 25. I was at Victoria at 10.15; Meggs came at 10.30 and said, "Hullo you are her, what do you think has happened, who do you think we met in the waiting-room?"—Bonverie was there and had arranged to com—"We have met Quill in the refreshment-room. Quill was going to Margate, but I told him he must give up Margat and come with us to Herne Bey, and he has agreed to do so. We went to the refresh<lb/>ment-room and I was introduced to Quill, whom I had not met before. We had something to drink, and then Meggs said, "We will go Tommy Dudd for the fares." We then took out coins and showed them, and Meggs said, "Houchin has lost," and they said "houchin pays." I Was not satisfied that I had lost, because I was not able to see their Coin I then bought the tickests, £2 16s. meggs had a telegram to need and asked us to wait for him; then Brown went to look for him and then came back and said, "What are you waiting here for; we here lost the train. Meggs is waiting on the platform all the time." The next train was at 1.30. They saw the officials about having a special train. The official said it would cost £30. They said they should not mind that, but after consideration they suggested to go down by Meggs's motor car. Bouverie apologised for letting his go in the morning, and Meggs said he would ring his up from the garage. We then went to my office to telephone from there and also to get a coat of mine, as Brown did not feel he had sufficient on for the car drive. While we were at the office Meggs recollected that he owed Brown £75, and he wrote out a cheque. He said, "By the way Brown old man, I owe you £75, don't I? I will give you a cheque for it now." Brown said, "Oh, yes, old man, thank you, I will have it, and put it in his pocket. We arranged ultimately to catch the 1.30 train, first having lunch at Victoria Station, which we did, prisoners paying for it. On the way to the station in the cab Brown said he had on important appointment that night, the Duke of Norfolk's ball—the King was going to be there, and that a command from the King to he present at a ball meant that he was bound to be there. He said there was a reception in the afternoon he ought to get back for, and he would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100112"/>
               <p>see if he could—he must get back as early as he could. We caught the 1.30 train, changed at Horne Hill, and had some refreshment. After we had got into the carriage they spoke of playing cards. I got out to get some magasines, and Brown said, "Bring 5s. worth of coppers." I got a 5s. packet and gave them to Brown. He said. "You will want some yourself." I said, "No, I shall not, as I do not play cards." As he did not give me the 5s. I put the coppers in my pocket. They then pressed me to join in a game of cards and suggested penny nap. I said I did not play, and would rather do so. Brown said, I tell you what we will do, we will play monte, that is an old women's game." I had never seen the game, and said so. Meggs or Brown said, "We will teach you it." I said, No, I should not play—I should not play for money, and they said, "We will just play without money; we will teach you the game." So I agreed to that. It is a game of chance similar to banker. They thought me the game, but I did not follow the scoring. After a short time Meggs said, "This is 6d. points," and we played for money. The points were raised, and as we got near Faversham they called them £1 points, and the points or £5 the round. I do not know whether that mean 15 brown kept the score on two sheets of news<lb/>paper. I could not see what he was putting down. At Facerthem, where we got out, Brown gave me the first sheet, which I added up and thought I was third. He said I had made a mistake and that I was really second and had won, but he did not say how much. We then returned to the train and did not play further, Brown going on adding up the score. When we began they said it was a game it was impossible to lose on; that you would be bound to stay just about where you started. Later on Meggs was telling me that one could lose a good deal at a game of this kind and appealed to Brown and Quill. Quill said he did not care what he lost, he would pay, and Brown said he had lost, I thin, £800 only a few days before and in course of a very few days he had won it all back—that it was a somewhat risky game. At Horne Bay I asked Brown how he thought the score stood. He said he reckoned I had probably lost £50. We arrived at Herne Bay, met Hulford, and inspected the size Meggs said he liked it very much and he should have it. We had the son of the owner there who went into various particulars. We went to the Connaught Hotel. Brown had some tea and bread and butter and Quill, Meggs, and I had some whisky and seltzer. I went to call on Hulford's wife and family and met the prisoners again in the road. We looked up the trains for return, and I suggested to Meggs that I could make some inquiries for him about the place as to the possibility of having a theatre and would stay later. He said he considered that a very wise idea and that he would stay with me. Brown said he must communicate with the Duke of Norfolk about the ball. He went to the office and he sent off a telegram. We went to the station to catch a later train and lost it. Brown inquired of a porter about a special train, and said it would cost £20.</p>

               <p>We then decided to stay the night at the hotel. Brown telephoned to take Duke of Norfolk. It was about 8.30 p.m., and after ringing the Duke of Norfolk up he said, "I am Pleydell Bouverie. Please explain to the Duke that I am unavoidably detained her on im<lb/>portant business at Herne Bay. I have already wired postponing, but now I am quite unable to attend." Bourverie then said, "By the way, I will finish adding up that score; we will settle that," and he sat at the table and said that I owed each of them something amounting altogether to £201. Quill owed to Brown and Meggs, and Brown included his loss to Meggs in a cheque to Meggs, then Quill gave Brown a cheque for £12, being what he owed him and the other together. I said I had no cheque there, the matter would have to stand over. They agreed. I did not see the score. Meggs and I went into the town and talked about the site. We called at a place where a man was extending his hotel. Meggs said, "That poor fellow has probably only got about a paltry £10,000. I have got £20,000 lying idle at the bank." I then spoke of the cards, and said, 'I do not understand about these losses at cards, and I do not like it. I shall not be able to pay you. You own me money now, and I shall want some on account. You had better let me have some, and probably Mr. Kinder will be wanting some on account, too." He said that would be quite agreeable to him for both of us. He said I must not speak to Bouverie as I had spoken to him about not being able to pay, because it would appear to Bouverie that I was not substantial man, that it would never do, that I must remember his position with regard to the Earl of Radnor, that he objected to my discussing any financial matters with Bouverie, and that he did not like business and sport being mixed up together. He said, "If you settle with Bourverie within the next few days, you shall have what you like from me within a week." We want back to the hotel, and it was too late for dinner and we went to bed. Meggs came to my bedroom and started discussing the site again. Bourverie (Brown) came in, and after he left I said, "You do not want to discuss this before Bourverie, but I must tell you I do not understand about these cards and I do not like it. I should like to know some thing about it. We must talk it over." The next morning we want to the station, and on the platform I said to Meggs and Brown to<lb/>gether, "Now, what about these card losses? You want some money, Mr. Bouvarie, and you look remarkably like getting it: between our<lb/>selves I cannot do it." Meggs pulled me away from Brown and said, "I told you not to mention such things to Bourverie, you must not do it—if you want to say anything, speak to me." I said, "I do I want to tell you that I cannot do this £201—I cannot understand it. Yes owe me now a fair sum, and if you like to pay me, this £201 shall stand out of it." He said he could not mix sport with business, that Bourverte must be paid, and it would very unpleasant for him if Bourverie was not paid. I suggested, "Suppose I pay Bourverie, then you and Quill can wait." He said, "No, if you like within a week." When I spoke to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100114"/>
               <p>Brown he said, "My dear fellow, you were introduced to us by Kinder, who is a friend of Quill's. If I had not taken you to be a gentleman I would not have played with you." We returned to town and did not play on the way. At the station Meggs said he was going to his solicitor, Mr. Hyam Davis, 7, Union court, about the land, and said, "Quill, you are going to the Hotel russell, you will be passing Hon<lb/>chins," and Brown said, "I will go that way, and we can cill at Hon<lb/>chin's office and settle up." Quill and Brown came to my office and were there 20 minutes, ultimately I gave them a cheque payable to H. Pleydell Bouverie for £201, post dated to June 30. This was Wed<lb/>nesday, June 26. He said that would be all right. After they left Kinder came in, I had conversation with him, stopped the cheque, and consulted a private inquiry agent. On June 27 I wrote to Brown asking him to retain the cheque till he heard from me again. On July 2 he telephoned me and said, "I do not understand about your letter, it seems funny, what does it mean?" I said, "It means what it says, that I want you to hold it in your possession." He said, "Can I meet you in any way?" I said, "No." He said, "Sup<lb/>pose I take £100 instead of £200 from you." I said, "No, I prefer to deal with the mater as a whole. Keep it as the letter says." He said, "Would it be all right on Thursday or some future day?" I said, "We will see. You had better come and see me." Then we made an appointment for him to come to my office on Thursday, which he did. I was acting under the advice of the police. He called again with Meggs on July 5, and I refused to see him. On July 1 I saw Brown at Kinder's office. He said he probably would only he in<lb/>terested in the Bognor scheme to about a quarter, that Lord Radnor would put in the rest, and that he was going to Taplow, the East of Radnor's place, the following day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have been an architect and surveyor 17 years. I might have taken the money if I had won, and I should very likely have paid when I lost if I had had it with me. I should certainly have paid £25. When I gave the cheque my bank account was in credit £2 8s. 9d. I had no land at Herne Bay, but went to see if the site was suitable, and had appointed to meet Fulford, who lived there and who was in my office. The land we saw was at the end of the town. I had prepared a set of plans for hotel, theatre, and garage, to coat about £60,000 before seeing the land. I was entitled to be paid when Meggs approved the plans—about £600, according to the scale. There were eight inch scale detail drawings. The full scale charge up to getting the tenders in 3 1/2 per cent.; for sketch plans about 1 to 1 1/2 per cent. I had possession of the pack of cards, and thought they were marked. I swore the information charging the prisoners with cheating at cards. I suggested that they had pretended to buy a pack of cards. I heard Mr. Rowe withdraw those suggestions at the police court. I thought the dealer might turn up any card he liked. I did not understand the way the points were made or the score. I dealt in turn with the others. I could not follow the game. I never asked to see the score.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100115"/>
               <p>Re-examined. We sat up the whole of two nights on the plans and put whatever work we could into them for the purpose of making them serviceable. I believed they related to a real undertaking imme<lb/>diately contemplated by Meggs and Brown.</p>

                  </hi>, Palmer's Green. On July 6 I was staying at St. Ive's Hotel, Broadetairs. Meggs and Quill were there. On July 9 Meggs left, saying he was going to bring down a friend named pleydell Bourverie. He returned with Brown. On Saturday evening July 13, Meggs suggested playing cards, and after some persuasion I agreed to play with the prisoners and a friend of theirs named Oscar Obermeyar. Nap was suggested. I said I was not a card player. Eventually Obermeyer stood out, and the prisoners and I started penny nap. I lost about 20s. The play varied, and we paid as we went on. After a time I had exhausted my change, and I think Brown suggested keeping a score; he did so on slips of paper. The points were raised to 6d., and then to 1s. We played for 10 or 15 minutes at penny points and continued for about half hour at 6d. and 1s. points. For a time the prisoners paid their losses to each other. I think Meggs paid about £30 to Brown in that way. As one time there was as much as £1 on the nap. At 9.15 we left off and the score-sheet was produced by Brown. He said the three of as owned him certain sums—I owed him £60, Meggs £30 or £34, and Quill a smaller amount, which I do not recollect. I saw the score-sheet at the end of the game, the figures were crossed out and altered to that it was impossible to follow them. I afterwards said I would prefer to leave it over until the following month. I had no money with me. They said that would be all right. On the next day, Sunday, Quill said that as Bourverie was very particular as to the payment of card debts, he would be willing to make me a loan for a month or so, so that I could pay it. I said, "No." I remained at the hotel till July 20, when I left, leaving the prisoners there. On July 27 prisoners called on me and suggested they should take me out—that is, have dinner at the club and go to the theatre—the following week. I understood Quill was a member of the Junior Army and Navy Club, but the name of the club was not mentioned. After they left Detective Saunders called on me. On Monday, July 29, the prisoners called at my office and asked me to go out with them. Brown suggested he should drive me to the Goodwood races in his motor car. They had come in a taximeter cab. At the hotel Brown said he was related to the Earl of Radnor, who was the owner of the bulk of the property in Folkestone, that his mother had property it Kent. He also carried a handkerchief with a coronet, which he showed to most of the inhabitants of the hotel, and a ring with what were supposed to be the Radnor arms or crest upon it. Quill said he was a native of Ireland, that his father had a big estate of some 1,500 or 1,600 acres and a castle, and that he was inviting some 20 friends of his to go down there in September, and invited me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100116"/>
               <p>to join them. He said he was an officer in the Army or Militis, I am not sure which. Meggs said he was connected with the boat-building trade and a partner in Meggs, sons, and Co., Liverpool. They changed their clothes three or four times a day. They all had several suits of clothes and six or seven pairs of boots each.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have not made any charge in this case. I mentioned my suspicions to my solicitor on the Saturday when I returned from Broadstairs. There was one game of cards during the fortnight I was there, to my knowledge. I believe other games were played. We played in the smoking room. I think it was sug<lb/>gested to have the blinds lowered. I think they suggested leaving off.</p>

He was visited by Quill once or twice and by Meggs oftener. On January 29 during my absence Brown left with his luggage, owing me £12 17s. 6d., and taking his latchkey. About a fortnight afterwards Quill brought the key back.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100118"/>
               <p>on the information of Houchin. On July 9 I saw Brown enter Hou<lb/>chin's office. On July 10 at 3.30 p.m. I saw Brown and Meggs leave the Carlton Hotel with Hulford and Houchin, go to the Grand Hotel come out, and separate. On July 29 I saw Meggs and Quill leave the "Bodega," Ludgate Hill, with Cork. I followed them to a refreshment house in Shaftesbury Avenue, with other officers, and arrested them. I said to Brown, "You know me, Brown. You are not Pleydell Bouverie." He said, "Yes; quite right." Meggs said, "That is news to me." They were taken to Bow Street, charged, and made no reply. Quill was bailed the same day.</p>

                  </persName>. I have kept observation on the defendants from July 9, and arrested them with the last witness on July 29. I searched Meggs, and found on him 10 paid cheques (produced)—June 19, Quill to Meggs, £4; March 1, 1907, Quill to self £130, Quill to Pryke £160, Quill to Meggs £100; March 9, Quill to Meggs £10; March 26, Quill to Meggs £1; April 20, Quill to Meggs £10; May 2, Quill to Meggs £1; June 17, Quill to Meggs £15; July 2, Quill to Meggs £6. In Quill's room at Drayton Garden I found cheque March 11, Quill to Pleydell Bouverie £5 10s. I also found on Meggs a slip of paper containing "Cork, 5,581 Bank telephone No." I showed him the cheques, and he said, "They are cheques I have cashed for my friend Quill." With regard to the slip of paper, he said, "That is the telephone number of a friend of mine in the City, a paper merchant."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. All these cheques are by Quill on his account, which have been honoured by his bank. F. E. Pryke I believe to be a bookmaker. (To the Recorder.) The cheques were found in Meggs's pocket. I have not been able to find out that Meggs had a banking account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gill submitted that there was no case to go to the Jury upon the conspiracy to commit an indictable offence, namely to cheat at cards. It was no offence to win or lose money at cards, nor any offence to induce persons by false representa<lb/>tions to play at cards, there being no evidence of cheating.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles Mathews said there was strong evidence for the consideration of the Jury whether there was not between the three prisoners an unlawful agreement to induce people to play at cards with the certainty of winning. It was not a charge of conspiracy to commit a criminal offence but that the prisoners entered into a combination to secure for themselves the money or cheques of other persons whom they might induce to play.</p>
               <p>The Recorder said he must leave the case to the Jury on the general charge of conspiracy, but he entertained considerable doubt as to whether there was anything more than grave suspicion that the score was not properly kept.</p>
               <p>Sir C. Mathews submitted that the bankers evidence and the equal division of the £60; the uniformity of loss having regard to the time occupied in card playing; and the presence in all cases of Brown as the scorer, were evidence for the Jury.</p>
               <p>The Recorder agreed that that was certainly evidence which the Jury must deal with.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of Alexander Harvey, clerk, 11, Norfolk Road, Clapton. On July 27 about one o'clock in the afternoon I was walk<lb/>ing along Brook Road, between Stole Newington and Clapton. A man came towards me, passed me on the right hand side, then passed behind my back and snatched my bag from my left hand. The man was a stranger to me, and I should never have noticed him if he had not done something. I watched him across the road with a bag in his hand, and saw him distinctly. I followed him as far as I could, but not very far. I asked several people to stop him, but he went past them all. At the police station I recognised prisoner as the man who had snatched the bad (produced). It contained at the time a purse with £1 6s. or £1 8s., a latchkey, and a tram ticket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There were few people about at the time of the robbery. As prisoner walked across the road, the handle of the bag dropped in the middle of the road. He made a sort of stop and looked, and it was then I saw his face, that is all I saw of him. After that I lost sight of him altogether, and did not know he had been ar<lb/>rested until much later. I certainly think he is the man.</p>

Prisoner dropped the purse in Rendlesham Road about 200 yards away. I stopped prisoner, and a little boy picked up the purse and brought it to me.

In consequence of that complaint I went to Hackney Police Station, where I found prisoner detained. I took him from there to stoke Newington Station, where he was charged. He made no reply, but on the way to the police court he made this statement: "I have a wife and four children at home starving, and it was a great temptation."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath). For the last 10 or 11 years I have worked at 48, Upper Thames Street, as a waterside labourer, and have been in regular employment all that time except during 18 months when I left to go to the Shoreditch Lighting Station. I will</p>

               <p>swear I was not in the Brook Road at about 1.30 on the day in ques<lb/>tion. I was never near Brook Road. I was at the side of Hackney Downs. When I left my home I said I would not be long, as I was only going as far as the Lea. I went along Dalston Lane till I got to Hackney Downs, and I got no further, when there was a hue and cry coming out of a turning into the main road. The man who stole the bag ran for about 100 yards, some children running after him and crying "Stop thief!" and then jumped into a van and fell flat on his back and the children lost sight of him. When the children came round the corner I was walking along smoking a cigarette. I have never handled the bag. It was carried by a bigger youth of from 16 to 18, and it was handed to the constable. It was not given to Raymer at all. It was never in his hands. It is a case of mis<lb/>taken identity. I never saw the woman till I saw her at the station at Stoke Newington.</p>
               <p>To the Court. I did not hear Raymer say he caught me with a bag in my hand. The sergeant told me I should be charged with stealing it, and I said, "I know nothing about it." On the way to the North London Police Court he said to me, "Have you ever been locked up before?" and I said, "No, and I never ought to be locked to this time." Then he said, "Have you been a soldier?" and I said, "No." Then he said, "Are you going to plead guilty or not guilty?" I said, "Certainly not. I have not done this thing, and therefore I am not going to be made to say I have done it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had not been to work because I had buried my mother-in-law on the previous day (Friday), but I told my missis I was going again on the Monday. I say emphatically that I was not near Brook Road that day. I was arrested at the side of Hacknay Downs, and they had only to take me across the Downs and I was in the station. I do not know whether Rendlesham Road is a turn<lb/>ing out of Brook Road. Brook Road is quite a mile from the side of Hackney Downs, where I was. I do not remember saying to the officer that I had a wife and four children at home starving, and it was a great temptation to me.</p>

I was alongside the gangway when I heard a shout from my senior officer, and, turn<lb/>ing round, I observed an object thrown from the Embankment to the river, and on looking at the object I discovered it was a little child, a I saw its legs.

I applied artificial respiration, and landed the child at the Fire Float, handing it to Constable 107. We then drove to St. Bartholo<lb/>mew's Hospital. The child was about five months old.</p>

After a while prisoner called Newman out, and he went; presently someone came and fetched me out, and I saw Newman lying on the ground unconscious. Both Newman and prisoner were sober.</p>

Wilcoxm with his left sleeve up, was swinging his left arm with his left muscle in his right hand. Directly Newman came to the public-house door, when he had one leg on the step, Wilcox punched him under the right jaw. It was a cowardly blow, because Newman had his hands in his pockets at the time and could not defend himself. He fell against the parti<lb/>tion and then on to the pavement.</p>

                  </hi>, house surgeon at the East London Hos<lb/>pital. On August 24, at a quarter to seven p.m., Newman walked into my surgery. He smelt strongly of alcohol. He told us about having received a blow. We examined him; externally there was no evidence of any blow, except a very small bruise behind the left ear. We told him to come again next day, which he did. There was still no sign of any injury. I did not again see him alive. At the post-mortem examination we found a fracture of the vault of the skull and there was a large inter-cranial hemorrhage on the left side, which was causing the paralysis from which he died. In my opinion the cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage, secondary to the frac<lb/>ture. He must have, as the result of the blow, bounded up against the partition and then rebounded on to the pavement and fractured his skull. It was the fall, not the blow, which caused the fracture.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined: I do not know the names of the women; I did not ask. I have seen them accosting persons in Euston Road. They have not been convicted. I cannot mention any particular occa<lb/>sion when prisoner came out and looked up and down the street.</p>

He had not seen anyone go to the house with luggage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I knew the women, but not their names. I do not suppose they would give their names. I could not tell you where I was standing when I made the observation; I was dodging all over the place. Miss Bowen frequently came out on the doorstep when the couples left.</p>

                  </persName>, 29 E. Between June 28 and July 4 I kept special observation on 13, Chesterfield Street, at various house of the day. (Witness gave details of the times at which he had been 23 couples enter and 20 leave the house—the women, with one exception consisting of three prostitutes; the men being different in each case.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not ask the women their names. There are two male lodgers in the house; I should be sorry to say that they are not respectable. I have seensingle persons, men and women, who were unknown to me, enter the house, and leave.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. There is no bar in the house. During the work that I watched, I saw seven men enter the house singly, and eight leave; nine women entered singly, and eight left. One man went there on July 1 with a bag, at 3.45, and left at 5.50 without the bag. He was not seen to go there again.</p>
               <p>Further cross-examined. The description of the women in my book are the descriptions of the three prostitutes, A, B, and C. There was another one, shabbily dressed, who was turned away, on july 1 she was with a man, and I passed them I heard the man say; she wants too much, On June 29, at 4.3, the woman who had entered at 3.30 came to the window on first floor and pulled down the blind the upper part of her body being naked.</p>

                  </hi>, 324 E, deposed to keeping observation at the same periods as last witness, and corroborated him as to the entries as exits of couples in every detail of time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I made my notes seperately from the last witness. I saw the woman come to the window and pull theblind down; she was partly naked. The three women, A, B, and C, always wore the name dresses. Miss Bowen sometimes came and looked up and down he street; also the servant. I used to be with Sergeant Brand when watching; we were in plain clothes. On the night that the shabby couple came to the house, a traveller also same; he had a bag and Miss Bowen gave him a key. There was another man with a bag on June 29. On Sunday, Miss Bowen, I believe, sat at the window with the blind up and a light on.</p>

                  </hi>, 5, Chesterfield Street, caretaker of Liverpool Street Wesleyan Chapel. The entrance to the school-room is right opposite No. 13, During June and July I have seen prostitutes taking men into No. 13. I know the women by sight very well; they have stopped some of our young men connected with the chapel. I have seen the couple two or three times a week. After they have gone is. I have also seen women partly dressed come and open the window and pull the blind up. That was in the afternoon. I have also seen travellers go to the house with luggage, and they have been turned away, but I have seen some admitted. some of the prosti<lb/>tutes have been alone, and some with men; sometimes the men go in afterwards.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100126"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. This is not the first time I have given evidence with regard to prostitutes. I have seen women at the windows partly dressed several times. I have not taken notes of the occasions. I do not think I said that I saw six travellers with luggage turned away in one afternoon. I do not remember whether I have seen it; it might be a bit of an exaggeration. I gave evidence against prisoner before the magistrate on a previous case. It is true that until two weeks before May 23, the date I gave evidence before the magistrate. I had not seen travellers admitted to the hotel. I knew there was two gentlemen staying in the house. The improper conduct of the house has been existing (off and on) since prisoner has been there—about 12 months. I am at the chapel in the evening from 6 to about 11. I do not know the names of the women who speak to our young men. This case was reported by Rev. William Wheatley, who is at present in Ireland.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I have given evidence before against Miss Bowen.

                  </persName>, S.D., E. Division. On July 19 I went to prisoner's house, 13, Chesterfield Street. It has a board outside, "Bowen's Hotel." I read the warrant to prisoner, and she said, "Well, I let my rooms, I cannot say I don't let them, but I do not let them as a brothel. I have some lodgers now. They have been with me four years, man and wife, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, and Mr. and Mrs. Braford." I went to the first-floor front—this was 5.15 is the evening—and saw a man and woman in bed. They gave their names as Robinson. Mrs. Robinson said, "We are staying here for the night; came about 12 noon, went out and came in again." The man had a collar and tie on, but kept under the clothes. The woman also kept under the clothes, but her clothing was lying about the room. There was no luggage. I then went into the first-floor back with defendant. As we entered together, defendant said, "Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Bradfor." There was a man and woman in bed, the woman sitting up, with her leg outside. She pulled a sheet in front of her, as we came into the room. The man kept himself covered up with the sheet. I asked them for their names and addresses, the woman said, "Mr. and Mrs. Bradford." They refused to give an address, or to answer questions. I explained that if they gave their address it would be for the benefit of Miss Bowen; they still refused. There was no luggage in the room. there were four other bedrooms; nobody in them. I saw the visitors' book, but there was no entry</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100127"/>
               <p>for that date. Prisoner said she was out when they arrived. When charged at the station prisoner made no reply.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The couples in the bedrooms blamed Miss Bowen for not telling them the police were coming. I explained to them that Miss Bowen did not know we were coming. Mr. and Mrs. Robinson gave their address, "36, Queen Margaret's Grove, Birming<lb/>ham. I did not give that in evidence before. The letter of the 19th from F. Bradford engaging a room for the afternoon was pro<lb/>duced at the police-court; that was the first I had seen of it. My attention was called to entries of "F. Bradford" in the visitors' book. I did not take possession of the visitors' book; Miss Bowen asked me to leave it with her, as that was her only protection. I went all over the house, and saw no luggage. Both the couples dressed and left the house, and saw no luggage. Both the couples dressed and left the house (without any luggage) before I did. They said they would not come back. I did not know the women. Before raiding the house I had not heard that two couples had just entered. I do not choose my time for raiding.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath). I started business in 1862, at 4, Warren Street, Clerkenwell; then I was at 4, Swinton Street, which I took off a magistrate; after that at 30, Argyle Street, where I stayed for 30 years. Then I went to 67, Euston Road. I took 13, Chesterfield Street in June, 1906, but remained at 67, Euston Road, where I had been for sixteen years, untill September, 1906, when I removed to 13, Chesterfield Street, which I furnished properly. The furniture was insured for £800; it is very old-fashioned furniture. I have a lodger, Mr. Osborne, who has been with me nearly 40 years; also Mr. Boor and Mr. Marshall, an Australian barrister. I have some of the clergy who have been lodging for twenty years. I have had a Mr. and Mrs. Crawford for years, staying a week or ten days at a time. Mr. and Mrs. Bradford I have regular; they were Manm<lb/>chester people. The lady only came twice a year, but he always stopped there. Canon Garrett and his wife and daughter have stayed with me in Euston Road. Rev. Charles Williamson has stayed this weeek at my house. I have told him about this affair. Canon Miles stayed at the house last night; he always stays with me when he comes up. On the day the police came Mr. and Mrs. Robinson arrived at nine in the morning. They did not write that day. They came about every fortnight or three weeks. I cannot read or write; I get some of my gentlemen to do that. Mr. and Mrs. Robinson only came to the door in the morning, with two bags, which I put in my sitting room under the dining-table. They came again about 12, but I was not in; they went out again, and came back for tea, and had a rest. I was lying down myself when they came in; they ordered tea for five o'clock, but the polices came at a quarter to five. I told the Inspector there was a man and wife in the house, who were quite respectable. He told me the charge, and I said, "Not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100128"/>
               <p>that; I am not dealing in that way." I denied it. When I went with the Inspector into the Robinsons' room, Mr. Robinson said, "What do you want? God out of my room." When asked their names, both said, "Robinson." The Inspector told them about the matter, and Mr. Robinson said it was too bad. "Miss Bowen, how dare you keep a thing like that from us, what is it for?" The Inspector told them that I did not know the police were coming. Mrs. Robinson was very distressed about it; I think she thought I owed money. Then we went to Mr. and Mrs. Bradford's room. The letter produced is from them, "I shall be glad if you will reserve me room for to-morrow Thursday night; my wife will call about nine o'clock, and I shall be greatly obliged if you will have a fire." That is the same kind of writing as I used to get from them. The letter did not come till I was arrested; it was brought to the Court next morning. They would very often arrive before the letter. Mr. Bradford said, "Didn't you get a letter?" I said, "No." His letters always go wrong. I do not know where the Bradfords live; I forget. I think Mr. Bradford wrote his name in the book. The magistrate advised me to keep a visitors' book, when I asked to be allowed to appeal. I came here use I wished to be tried before a judge and jury. I have never received prostitutes at all, knowingly or not knowingly. I have a lot of nieces and nephews, and I reviver them, but no bad people. Many people come to the house, but I say "No, I never take people I do not know of, or never heard of." I have plenty of people recom<lb/>mended; the railways bring me people and son them. I charge 3s. 6d. each person for bed and breakfast. the regular lodgers—I have only gentlemen—have their dinner there. I have a little private income. Mr. Boor is in and out most of the day; he has no occupa<lb/>tion; and Mr. Marshall has been a lot in. I wrote and went up to the Borough Council, and told them about all this; they said they were sorry; there was a Parliamentary Committee going to sit. I have never been convicted in all the 48 years. I have been a land-lady, except in these proceedings. I told most of my visitors about this affair; all the gentlemen know it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Inspector Bryson did not caution me with re<lb/>gard to 67, Euston Road. He brought a letter which said that same woman had robbed a man in my house. I said it was not true. I was convicted in January and fined £3 and costs. The same kind of evidence was given by the police as to-day. When the police came on January 3 there was an old gentleman, about 50, and a lady about 40, in bed, strangers to me; they took the bed till five the next morning. I charge 3s. 6d. bed and breakfast for a single gentleman; for a couple, 7s. It is true the couple mentioned paid 5a.; they were going away before breakfast. I was convicted again in May this year, and fined £20 and £10 costs. I did not know of a petition to the vestry by my neighbours against me. There was a petition of my own to the Borough Coucncil. I applied for a summons for perjury against Mr. Bryson. I do not know anybody named Louise Hicks, 10, Chesterfield Street, nor Louisa Temple, of the same</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100129"/>
               <p>address, nor John Bateman. Curry and palmer are in the con<lb/>spiracy; it is all a conspiracy. When Bryson came to the house on April 4 there was a couple in the bedroom. They had been coming for two years. The man was standing at the foot of the bed when we entered the room. I thought he was partly dressed. The woman was in bed. They always brought luggage. They gave their address to the inspector. It is not true that they paid 5s. for the room. The gentleman came for tea and breakfast and the lodging, at 11 o'clock in the morning. He used to come regular once a fortnight, and pay the rent in the morning, and then he would say the wife will be coming at about two, may be later, and sometimes I never saw her till four. He always brought his bag, and the lady hers. I can't think of his name for the minute. He did not engage the room by letter. I did not tell the inspector so, nor say that I should not produce the letter, when he asked me. A man and women did call when Bryson was there, and the man said "Good evening" to him. I said, "How dare you?" That same man came four days before and asked for a room, and I refused him. I said to Bryson, "You told him to come," and so he had; I could tell it. Mr. Bry<lb/>son asked him if he had ever been here before; he said, "Oh yes, three months ago"; and he had not. Mr. Bradford always writes from the East End of London, and the wife comes from the North I let rooms for the afternoon; they come as early as they like. The Bradfords had a bag; they keep one in the house; I put it in their room; I generally put it under the dressing table. Directly I get letter I always arrange the things. I have other people's bags as well. I have about four bags in the house now of different people. I have known Mr. Bradford nearly three years. He has always the same wife. I can't remember Mr. Bradford's address; it was somewhere in the East End—Streatham way. A lot of people do not put their address on the letters. I never let my rooms late; I always go to bed at 11 and open at seven. The Robinsons come from Birmingham. When Mrs. Robinson wrote the letter with the London post mark she was staying in London with her sister. I do not know where the sister lives. Sometimes when a lady is in town she writes and says she will call and have a cup of tea; my lodgers make a friend of me as well. I put the Robinsons' bag in their bedroom the very day the inspector came—about three o'clock. Mrs. Robbinson was in bed lying down when the Inspector went in, completely covered with a street; it was a very hot day. Mrs. Bradford was sitting by the side of her bed with a white lace blouse on. Mrs. Bradford brought a little bag with her. I did not say when I went into Bradfords' room, "Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Bradford!" I might have said, "I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Bradford, for this affair." It is not true to say Mrs. Bradford was naked except for her stockings. Mr. Robinson ordered the tea, and he had pay me 10s. at the door in the morning, which he never had a receipt for. He never got tea, because the In<lb/>spector came and everything was upset. The latter came about four and stopped two hours. I had a deaf and blind gentleman there, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100130"/>
               <p>the Inspector let me stop and have tea, and send the blind gentleman home. Mr. Robinson could have had his tea; it was ready; we were only waiting for five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I think Mrs. Bradford pulled a sheet in front of her when we went in; she was reading a novelette.</p>
               <p>To the Common Serjeant. My ladies did not usually go to bed in the afternoon. The Bradfoprds and Robinsons went out before the Inspector left in order to get their teas; I could not attend to them as I was in custody; the maid went to take the blind man home. Mr. Mason, the writer of the card produced, with no address, stays with me overnight if he is going to catch a train in the morning; some<lb/>times people do that.</p>

                  </persName>, Vicar of Robbington, Staffs. I have known Miss Bowen for 23 years. I have stayed at her house, as also have my relations. I am staying there now. I have gone into the house at various times, coming up suddenly to town on busi<lb/>ness and giving no notice. I have always found it properly con<lb/>ducted, as far as I know. I have noticed people coming with lug<lb/>gage, and seen them admitted. I could not believe prisoner would be likely to keep a brothel. I have been in prisoner's house several times this year. I gave evidence at Clerkenwell in May. I have not noticed any couples arrive without luggage or go to bed in the after<lb/>noon. I should think that rather strange, because I have been in the habit of having afternoon tea there.</p>
               <p>To the Common Serjeant. I brought a bag with me and left it is the bedroom generally. I wrote my name in the visitors' book. I know several of the people who have stayed at Miss Bowen's house. I do not know anybody of the name of Bradford or Robinson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Colonial barrister; at present secretary to a public company. I have lived at Miss Bowen's house for over seven years and have never seen anything objection<lb/>able going on. I am acquainted with some of the people who come to the hotel. I have the use of the front sitting-room, which gives a full view of everything that goes on. I have known person of doubtful character turned away by prisoner. In regard to the police evidence, I was at home for two or three weeks before and for a couple of weeks after that particular one—June 28 to July 4. I came home sometimes at four and sometimes at six, and I am in a position to contradict absolutely that prostitutes were admitted at these times, and I say they did not come in, because I could have seen them—neither on those nor any other occasions. I can over<lb/>hear what prisoner says when she receives any couples, and she is very indignant, in fact rude to them, if she thinks they are wrong people. I took special notice of these things in consequence of the convictions at the police-court. There were some people opposite who made it their special business to spy when anybody of the highest respectability came in; they seemed to make it their busi<lb/>ness to run about, like ants in a heap, making notes. I said to pri<lb/>soner, "Well, it seems an extraordinary thing; there seems some more mischief brewing against you." I went with Mr. Boor to the Borough Council, at prisoner's request, and asked them to send a representative any time without notice to see how the house was conducted, and the town clerk told off Mr. Miller to do it. He never came to my knowledge. I regard it as absolutely impossible the prisoner could be the kind of person to keep a disorderly house.</p>

                  </hi>, retired deputy-superintendent registrar. St. George's Hanover Square, said he had lodged with prisoner for about 14 years, had never seen any persons of a doubtful character admitted to the house, and had been in and out at all times. He corroborated the last witness as to the interview with the town clerk of St. Pancras, and said it was utterly impossible that the police evidence as to the week from June 28 could be correct; he had made special observation at that time. He was still living in the house, and was thoroughly satisfied with prisoner's respectability. He had noticed on one occasion, when some respectable people came to the house, that a man opposite made some notes in a book as they left and also spoke to them.</p>
               <p>(Thursday, September 19.)</p>
               <p>On the Judge taking his seat the Jury intimated that they were satisfied with the evidence heard so far.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant, taking this to mean a verdict of acquittal, was about to direct the prisoner to be discharged, when the Jury said that that was not their verdict.</p>
               <p>His Lordship then asked Mr. Muir whether he thought he ought to pursue the prosecution any longer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir signified his willingness to submit to his Lordship's view, and ask that the Jury be directed to return a verdict of as quittal.</p>
               <p>The Jury said that their opinion was in the opposite direction.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. I think the verdict would be wrong, but the verdict will be yours. I am not going to dictate to you. I understood you stopped the case in the middle of the evidence for the defence because you were satisfied, otherwise I should not have stopped it.</p>
               <p>The Foreman of the Jury. If the defence have any more sub<lb/>stantial evidence to produce the Jury would be willing to listen to it.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. I do not think they would be wise to put it before you after what has passed.</p>

                  </persName>, 827 V. On August 4, between 12 and one a.m., I was on duty in uniform in Faloon Road, Batterses, near Battersea Park Road. My attention was directed to a gang of youths, amongst them the prisoner, behaving very disorderly, knock<lb/>ing at shop doors and trying to his lamps outside the shop. I spoke to prisoner and told him if he did not behave himself I should take him into custody. He answered, "All right, guv'nor," and they walked down towards the "Prince's Head." I followed down behind them, and he turned the corner at the "Prince's Head" into Yerk Road. About' 10 yards down the road he crossed over to a coffee stall at the corner of Winders Road. The next thing I heard cries of "Murder" a little way down High Street, the next turning to Winders Road. Going down to see what was the matter, I saw a crowd round three or four men fighting on the ground. I shone my lamp and bent over. There were 40 or 50 people there, and whilst I was looking at the men on the ground I felt something hit me on the head, and that is all I can remember. When I came to myself I saw prisoner in me custody of Sergeant Waterman, who was in plain clothes. I am still under the charge of the divisional surgeon, and have been on the sick list ever since.</p>

                  </persName>, 42 V. On the morning of Saturday, August 4, about quarter-past twelve, I was in High Street, Batterses, in plain clothes. I produce a plan of the neighbourhood which I have made. I saw a gang of lads coming down Falcon Road and I saw Police-constable Heal speak to them. As they came down prisoner went up York Road to the left, and 9 or 10 went in the direction of High Street, several others going across to the coffee stall at the corner of Winders Road. After a few minutes had elapsed the prisoner and the other man who had gone up York Road joined the others at the coffee stall, and a few minutes after that a disturb<lb/>ance took place in High Street. Police-constable Heal, who was standing at the "Prince's Head" corner, walked up to see what the disturbance was. I also walked into the crowd, and leaning over saw prisoner rush in from behind and strike Heal down with a blow of some instrument in his right hand, very much like the padded life preserver produced. I could not see distinctly what it was. I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100134"/>
               <p>not more than three yards away. I immediately put my hand on someone in front, jumped over, and caught prisoner by the collar, my feet being on other people's shoulders when I arrested him.

                  </hi>, 25, Gwynne Road, Battersea, mechanical en<lb/>gineer. On the early morning of August 4, shortly after 12 o'clock, while standing a yard from the constable I saw prisoner reach over by putting one hand on the next person and deliberately bit Heal across the head with the instrument produced. I turned and seized prisoner with both hands round the throat. Within a second Ser<lb/>geant Waterman had climbed over the backs of the people to my assistance. I did not let go of prisoner till he was at the station steps. When I seized prisoner he said, "What have I done?" and I said, "Nothing, but I am going to stop you from doing anything else." The moment I seized him his right hand dropped and he dropped the life preserver.</p>

                  </hi>, divisional surgeon. On the morning of August 4 I saw Constable Heal at the police station. He was suffer<lb/>ing from the after effects on concussion of the brain, and there was a discharge from his left ear consequent upon injury to the skull bone. He appeared very queer at the time, and his clothing was all dirty, as if he had fallen on the ground. I sent him home and ordered him to be put on the sick list, and subsequently attended him at his own home. Three days afterwards he had an epileptic fit, which I associate with the injury he had received. There was a large red swelling at the right side of the head over the ear and a large dent on the side of the helmet corresponding to the swelling. Very considerable violence was required to cause the swelling on the head through the helmet. It must have been a very violent blow indeed. It was such a blow as might have been inflicted by the padded life preserver produced. You might kill a man with an instrument like sand to injury without leaving any mark. They hit you on the hand; you fall down; sometime they kill you outright. Sometimes it does not even leave a bruise; sometimes it leaves a livid red mark, which disappear. On this occasion it left a large red swelling, which would disappear without leaving a bruise. In this case the red swelling disappeared after three days. Heal is still on the sick list and has epileptic symptoms, and he will probably be on the sick list some considerable time, even if he is ever able again to perform police duties. In my opinion he probably will not, but as yet I have not formed any decided opinion.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). It is not true that I assaulted or robbed prosecutor, or had anything to do with the assault. I had just left a young woman about 120 yards from the top of Suffolk Street and was on my way home. As I happened to pass pocock street I saw two men struggling with a third man on the ground. I do not know who the two men were. They were both about my height. They wore caps. They ran away, and the third man got up and directly he saw me he said, "There's one of them." His son came towards me. I had had a drink or two, and did not want to give myself away, so I started running. I was stopped by Green. I was searched, and nothing was found on me. Directly I was spoken to I denied that I had had anything to do with the matter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is true that Jones knows me well; that is why she thinks she recognises me in this job. She is mistaken when she</p>

               <p>says she saw me stop and pick up my cap. The reason I ran away was because I was afraid that the blame of what the two men had done would be put upon me.</p>

                  </hi>, salesman to John Charles Moore, and others, trading as Tiffany and Co., 221, Regent Street. On February 25, 1907, between one and two p.m., Greene entered my shop and asked for a single stone diamond pin, which we had not got. He was shown some diamond pins, brooches, and rings, and selected a dia<lb/>mond circlet brooch value £24, and a three-stone diamond ring, £14 10s., which he paid in £5 notes and gold, and took on approba<lb/>tion. Our stock has little tabs attached which are invariably re<lb/>moved on sale, but as these were taken subject to return prisoner asked that the tabs should not be taken off, which was not done. He gave the name of C. L. Lowndes, of the Carlton Hotel. I took him to be an American from his voice. About four p.m. Greens came into the shop and said to Mr. Fox, the manager, who had recently returned from America. "Who would have thought of seeing you here?" Minton, a salesman, attended to Greene, who asked to see cigar-cutters, and selected one. He was then shown some diamond brooches in a tray, and a tray of diamond rings, but did not buy any. The next morning, on checking the stock, I found missing a diamond ribbon brooch, value about £94, a diamond crescent brooch, about £100, and a five-stone diamond ring about £135. The crescent brooch (produced) is the one taken. No other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100138"/>
               <p>person was shown these articles on that day. I found amongst the stock the two articles I had sold to Rorer with the same tabs on. I gave information and a description of the prisoners. I found it very difficult to describe Rorer. I cannot now say whether he had or had not a moustache. In April I was shown a number of photos, and picked two out as those of the prisoners. I am not certain if I sw both the men in the final lot of photos. I am quite sure the first photo I picked out was that of the first man who came into the shop—it was a photo of the prisoner Rorer; that is fixed in my mind. He had a moustache in the photo—I think not a hat. On the same occasion I picked out the prisoner Greene. At a later date I was shown other photos. I cannot be certain whether I recognised Rorer in the first lot of photos or the second—I am sorry I cannot make it any clearer. I do not know whether it was the first or the second. the first lot of photos were yellow and the second lot brown. Looking at the photos (produced) I picked out the prisoner in the second lot. I remember the photo as that of a man partially bald. He wore a bowler hat while in the shop. In July I went to Marlborough Street Police Court, and out of a row of men I picked out Greene instantly. I then became frighfully nervous, and kicked out a short man, not Rorer, as the man who came in first. I afterwards saw the two prisoners in the dock. I am now emphatically certain Rorer is the man who came in first hrs. on February 25. I recognised him as he came into court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had never seen Rorer before February 25. I gave a description on the evening of the 26th: "Aged about 50 years medium height and build, complexion dark, hair dark, turn<lb/>ing grey, broad face, clean shaven." I gave that description hes<lb/>tatingly. I repeated that description in the information. I swore on March 22. I saw the first lot of photos before March 22, and was told when I had identified them that the two (produced) were the photos of Greene and a man named Tunica. Inspector Bower afterwards showed me photos. I cannot say whether he told me that two of them were of two men the New York police had in custody. Two or three weeks afterwards I swore a second information. I could not say if that was the first time Rorer's arrest was asked for. In July I saw eight or ten men and unhesitatingly picked out Greene. I then touched a man other than Rorer, and very unlike him, as the man who first came into the shop. I was completely upset by picking out Greene, and was ready to faint. When they were called into court before the magistrate I first identified Rorer as he passed into the dock in front of Greene. It took me about half a minute to identify him, and about half a minute to pick out the wrong man at the police station.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. At the police station I picked out Greene at once, then looked down the row and picked out the man who stood next to Rorer. I had great difficulty in describing the man who first came in—I thought he was probably clean shaven because I thought</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100139"/>
               <p>I should have noticed a moustache. I recognised Rorer in court by the set of the head and the glint of his eye—it was the picture that I had in my mind of the man who came into our place. I saw him enter and walk slowly up to where I was standing behind the counter. His head was set forward—I could see it in my mind's eye and I saw exactly the same thing as he came into the police court. I knew that was the man. (To the Jury.) I identify the brooch by the private mark.</p>

He then asked to see some gold cigar-cutters. I showed him some, and he purchased one under £2 and paid for it. He asked to be shown two other small gifts. I showed him about a dozen brooches and pen<lb/>dants, and then he asked to see a tray with about 50 brooches and a tray of about 27 rings, which I got out. He did not see anything he liked, so he asked me to get some designs, promised to call in a few days, and left. On the following day when the stock was ex<lb/>amined by Parslow, there were missing brooch (produced) value £90, and another brooch and ring value £300.</p>

He is very much like him, but I do not think he is the man. I did not do very much for them. I went in every morning when they were in bed. They left on February 26, at about 7.45 p.m. I had instructions to pack their clothes up at 7.30 p.m. The one who occupied No. 178 room (not Greene) was a little bald in front.</p>

                  </hi>, milliner, Aldershot. On Sunday, February 24, 1907, at about six p.m., I was with Margaret Fulton, near the Popular Cafe, Piccadilly, when we met the two prisoners, who spoke to us, and we went for a walk. Rorer was with me. He said he was staying at the Hotel Cecil. Rorer and I had some refreshment, went for a drive, and appointed to meet the next evening at eight p.m. at Princes Street, Oxford Circus. He arrived in a four-wheeled cab with Greene and Fulton. I got in, we drove to the Hotel Cecil, where some luggage was put on, and thence to the Grosvenor Hotel. We went into the Grosvenor and stayed till 10.30 or 10.45. Rorer asked me to write to him at the American Express,</p>

               <p>Paris, which I did and received two letters from him (produced), one written from Paris dated February 29, and the other from the as. "America," dated March 8, signed Charles Lewis Rorer. He was wearing a moustache—I could not say what colour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not remember what kind of moustache Rorer was wearing. If I said before the magistrate he had a large dark heavy moustache, as far as I remember it was so. The yellow photograph is not a good likeness of him; the grey photograph is better.</p>

                  </hi>, 9, Killarney Terrace, Dublin, milliner. On February 25, with Florence Brown, I met two gentlemen in Piece dilly named Greene and Rorer. Greene paid attention to me, we spent the evening together, and I met Greene the next evening at 6.20 out<lb/>side the Hotel Cecil, when we were joined by Rorer, whom I iden<lb/>tify as the prisoner. We went to the Savoy Hotel and to "Simp<lb/>son's Restaurant, where we were joined by another man whose name I do not know, and whom I recongnise as the original of the brown photo (produced) (Tunica). Greene and Rorer said they were going to Paris. We got a cab, drove to Oxford Circus, picked up Miss Brown, took some luggage from the Hotel Cecil, and drove to the Grosvenor Hotel, where Brown and I stayed about two hours with the prisoners. I have not seen them since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Rorer had a heavy dark moustache.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The grey photo is Rorer—that is the sort of moustache he wore.</p>

We drove to Oxford Circus, took a lady up, came back to the Cecil Hotel, received luggage, and proceeded to the Grosvenor Hotel. I picked both the prisoners out from among others at Marlborough Street Station.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I swore an information on March 22, stating I was positive Greene was one of the men, and, to the best of my belief, Tunica was the other. The yellow photo is Tunica—that is not the</p>

               <p>man who was in the cab. That is the man I thought it was, because the moustache misled me. In the courtyard at Marlborough Street in July, 1907, I became sure it was Rorer. I did not identify Tunica in the yard because he was not there. The man drove was in the yard, and that is the man I picked out. There is a resemblance be<lb/>tween the two about the eyes. The man I drove had a moustache. The man I identified was clean-shaven.</p>

                  </hi>, son of George William Ryder, of London and Ryder, jewellers, 17, New Bond Street. On Tuesday, February 2, the prisoner Greene came into my shop and asked to see some brooches and other jewellery. He selected a pendant and chain, value £11 15s., which he paid for. He asked me to leave the stock tickets on, but I removed them. He gave the name of "A. Preston Greene." After he left another man, not the prisoner Rorer, came in, whom I now know to be Tunica. He was shown some rings and brooches by Fletcher, who asked he had left made a communication to me. I then examined the stock, and found missing a diamond bar, brooch, value £14. I have not now a clear recollection of this man. Fletcher identified him, and I have learnt subsequently it was Tunica, and I saw a photo which I recognised. At about 4.30 p.m. Greene returned and wanted to change the article he had bought. He was shown brooches and rings—seven or eight trays of brooches and about six trays of rings were placed before him, some of which I got form the window. On on occasion, on turning to the window to get another tray, I noticed one ring tray put on a brooch tray right in the middle of it. Greene eventually selected a brooch value £21 10s., returned what he had bought in the morning, paid the difference, and left. I then proceeded to put the trays straight, and found missing an emerald and diamond brooch, value £450 (the one produced), a four-leaf shamrock brooch set with rubies and other stones (not re<lb/>covered), a diamond gold brooch value £82 (produced), and a dia<lb/>mond brooch value £70 (produced). The bar brooch (value £14) taken by Tunica is also here. The total value of the property stolen is £662, of which there has been recovered £546 worth. I next saw Greene in custody. I went to Paris to make inquiries, reported the result to the police, and after Inspector Bower's return from America I identified the articles produced.</p>

                  </persName>, C Division. On February 20 I received in<lb/>formation from Tiffany and Co. and London and Ryder. I made in<lb/>quires, received information from Ryder after his visit to Paris, com<lb/>municated with the New York police, and extradition proceedings were commenced. I got into communication with Bresinaki, a spe<lb/>cial agent of the United States Federal authorities, and finally went out to New York, and in the Tombs prison I saw the prisoners in Bresinski's company.</p>
               <p>Sir C. Mathews, citing R. v. Smith (18 Cox. p. 479). submitted that the statement made to the prisoner by Bresinski as described in the depositions and not assented to by him could not be given in evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bodkin said it was for the Court to arrive at a conclusion by examining this witness as to the circumstances, in order to see whether the denial was really intended.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100142"/>
               <p>The Recorder: I am not prepared to say that it may not be too wide a rate in some cases, but I am quite clear in this case that the statement made by the other Bresinski, disputed at the time, is not admissible in evidence.</p>
               <p>(Examination continued.) I received from Bresinski the jewellery (produced). I showed Rorer a brooch not connected with this case, and in respect of which no charge is made. Rorer said. "I took that away from New York with me, and you will be able to prove it. I wore it one the s.s. 'Baltic' when going over. Greene and I sat together, and the chief steward must have noticed it." Extrad<lb/>tion was granted; I brought the prisoners to England and charged them at Marlborough Street. They made no reply to the warrants. On July 18 the prisoners were put up for identification. Rorer was wearing a panama hat with the brim turned down in front, and blue jacket and vest when Parslow went into the yard. Shortly after the robbery I received photos of Greene and Tunica. The yellow photo of Tunica with the hat on was shown to Parslow; he would not identify it as a photo of the man who first came into the shop; he said it was not that. I then took it up, and called his special attention to it, and he said positively it was the man. He said to the best of his belief he was clean-shaven, but he was not sure. He described him as stated in the information. Later on, on June 28. I received the grey photo (produced) of Rorer, which was placed with a number or others, and positively identified by Parslow. Rorer was not wearing a moustache when I got to New York, nor has he since, so that the grey photo must have been taken before I arrived there. He was not bailed in New York.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. In the first instance I assumed Rorer and Tunics to be the same. The photos arrived on March 4, and on March 7 and 22 I applied for warrants for the arrest of "Charles Rorer a has Arthur Tunics," and another alias. At that time Parslow, Johnson Constantine, Abbey, and Hollitt has seen the photo of Tunics and made statements on oath with regard to it, and it was upon their identification of that photo us the man who been in Tiffany and Co.'s. at the Cecil, and in the cab that the warrant was asked for Shortly after March 22 a photo of Rorer arrived, was submitted to the different witnesses who has sworn to the photo of Tunics, and then for the first time selected as the photo of the man who had been in Tiffany's shop. Rorer arrived here on July 11 and was put up for identification on July 18. Parslow picked out Grsene first, and as the second man he picked out someone else distinet from Rorer.</p>
               <p>Sir C. Mathews submitted that upon the question of identification the case ought not to go to the jury.</p>
               <p>The Recorder said he considered it would be highly dangerous to convict on the evidence. He would ask the jury if they thought there was any evidence on which to cill upon the defence.</p>
               <p>The Jury. We are of opinion that there is not sufficient evidence of identification.</p>

               <p>The Recorder said Inspector Bower was deserving of the highest commendation. He was sorry Bresinski had not been brought over. If he had been, and the jury had believed his statement, the result with regard to Rorer would have been very different.</p>

                  </persName>, 858 V. On Sunday, August 4, 1907, I was on duty in Garratt Lane, Wandsworth, near the "Jolly Gardenors" beerhouse, at 12.15 a.m. A crowd of some 25 or 30 people were quarrelling and using obscene language, including all three prisoners, whom I knew well. I was in uniform. I several times requested the people to move on; they went down Liddon Road and challenged me to come down, threatening to rip me up. Finding I did not go down they came back and circled round me, saying several times that I had got to go through it. Fuller then struck at me. I warded the blow off and arrested him. I was then struck in the face by Hearn and Pullen, still holding on to my pri<lb/>soner, until I was knocked to the ground. I could not draw my truncheon or blow my whistle. As soon as they got me on the ground Hearn and Pullen started kicking me. Fuller was got away by the other prisoners. I was kicked on the head, very badly on the right ear, and am still deaf in consequence. Police-constable Coles then came to my assistance and enabled me to get up. I then got my whistle out and blew it and drew my truncheon. Coles was knocked down and kicked by the three prisoners. He was in uniform. They were shouting, "Kill the dirty f—." As soon as they saw me with my truncheon they dispersed, which enabled Coles to get up. I could then see Hearn amongst a number of men and women, and forced my way through the crowd with Coles and arrested Hearn. He be<lb/>came very violent, and threw himself to the ground. He was not drunk. Pullen then came to his assistance and tried to rescue him. I knocked him on the ground and kept him there. I had my truncheon in my hand, but I think I caught him with my wrist. Sergeant Gent then came up. I pointed out Pullen, who was on the ground, and he arrested him. Coles and I took Hearn to the station; he was very violent all the way; Hearn and Pullen were charged at the station. Hearn was kicking me when on the ground, and kicking Coles when on the ground. It took four or five officers to get the prisoner to the station. When charged Hearn said, "All right. I will see about that later on." Pullen made no reply. At 2.50 a.m.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100144"/>
               <p>that morning I went to Fuller's address and found him sitting in the kitchen. I told him I should arrest him for being concerned with Hearn and Pullen in assaulting me. I had recently had him in cus<lb/>tody for disorderly conduct and using obscene language. He replied, "That's all right. I suppose you will wait until I get my boots on." At the station he said, "It is no use my saying anything here." Later that morning the Divisional Surgeon saw me. I had a swollen eye and face, a deafness in the left ear, and pain in the body. I was in bed three weeks, and have been on the sick list ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have been eight and a half years in the force. I was previously in Chatham Dockyard, got married, and was trans<lb/>ferred. On this night a number of people has come out of the "Jolly Gardeners"; there was no fighting then. Most of the people down there have a grudge against me because I have summoned several of them. I had not summoned any of the prisoners. I was not pushing the people about. I did not push Fuller down. After I was injured there was a very large crowd—100 to 150 people. They had had drink, but were capable of understanding what they were doing. Fuller was in the crowd; he was the first man to attack me. He came back again after he went down Lydden Road for twenty-five or thirty yards. After he was rescued from my custody I did not see any more of him. Pullen was one of those outside the "Jolly Gar<lb/>deners." He was not with a woman and child; the all ran down Lydden Road together. When I had Hearn in custody two drunkes soldiers came up to my assistance, and I refused it for the simple reason that they were the worse for drink. I knocked Pullen down—not one of the soliders. Hearn and Pullen struck me; there were others behind me whom I did not see. I cannot say if there was a woman with a baby knocked down; I never heard of it until it was mentioned in court.</p>

                  </persName>, 392 V. On August 4, at 12.30 a.m., I saw a number of people at the corner of Lydden Road, near the "Jolly Gardeners," surrounding Reader, who was on the ground struggling with Fuller and was being kicked by the three prisoners Hearn and Pullen struck him in the face. I went to his assistance, when the prisoners turned round, knocked me to ground, and kicked me very violently about the body. Reader came to assist me; I got up, drew my trucheon, and helped to arrest Hearn. Pullen rushed up to because Hearn. Reader knocked Pullen to the ground, Police-constable Brown came up, and we got Hearn and Pullen to the station. I was seen by the doctor, have been on the sick list ever since, am suffering great pain in the ribs, and am quite unfit for duty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There is a lamp at the corner; it was rather dark where this happened. There was a row going on the prisoners started it. I just came up as Fuller was arrested, and when I got up he was on the ground with Reader. Pullen and Hearn were in the crowd. I saw no one strike us except the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. No one out of the crowd came to our assistance. It is a very rough neighbourhood indeed.</p>

                  </persName>, 87 V. On August 4, at 12.30 a.m., I heard a whistle and went to Garratt Lane, where I saw Pullen in cus<lb/>tody, behaving very violently, and trying to escape. The crowd was very turbulent and hostile. I received a kick in the stomach from some person in the crowd, and, as the result of the injury, have been on the sick list 20 days. I still feel the effects of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The crowd was behaving in the most violent manner when I came up. Pullen was violently resisting apprehen<lb/>sion. We had to take him through the crowd; he threw himself down and tried to escape. He was quiet when we got him into the main road. I do not think he smoked a cigarette as he went to the station. I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">GENT</hi>, 54 V. On August 4 I heard a police whistle and vent to Lydden Road, Garratt Lane, where I saw Hearn in the cus<lb/>tody of Reader and Cole and struggling very violently. Pullen was lying on the ground and kicking. Reader said in Pullen's hearing, "Bring him in, sergeant; he was one of them." I assisted in taking Pullen. He was very violent, and called on the crowd to assist him and someone in the crowd caught me round the neck. I drew my truncheon and used it on the crowd. Pullen called out, "Down with him. Jump on him." Sergeant Brown came up, we got Pullen to the station. He was charged and said nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There was a lot of shouting and noise from the crowd.</p>

                  </hi>, divisional surgeon. On August 4, at about one a.m., I saw Reader at the station. He had a black eye, his face was generally bruised, he had a large swelling on the right ear, which might have been caused by a kick behind the ear. He had lost his sense of hearing in the left ear. He will have to be sent away to a convalescent home. His right ribe were bruised, and he has deve<lb/>loped pleurisy there, causing him pain. He is very depressed and ill—more seriously than Coles. Sergeant Brown had a few days be<lb/>fore complained of injury to his stomach, and he was kicked in almost the same place; that would make his condition very much worse.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On August 4 I left the "Jolly Gardeners" a little before 12. Reader said to me, "Go on—get down." I said, "All right, I am going." He followed me down the street. There was a bit of a row. Somebody said something to Reader, and he hit one of them on the had with his staff, knocked him down, and knocked a woman with a baby down. I picked up the baby, gave it to a woman, and went on. Two soldiers came up who were perfectly sober. They said, "Cheer up, you are all right. Go on quiet." I said. "All right." I went quite quiet. All the harm I did was to pick up the woman and the baby. Somebody hit the policeman; I saw him fall; I did not go to his assistance; I did not kick him. I own I was there. The street was as light as daylight—there are plenty of lamps, especially on Saturday night.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I live at 28, Ltdden Road, Wandsworth, I am a carman, and have lived in Wandsworth all my life. I have never had a charge of any kind against me before. As I came out of the "Jolly Gardeners" Reader was standing at the corner, and I was standing in the road. He walked up to me and said, "Now, which way are you going—down home have I got to take you down the road?" I said, "I am going home," and went on. With that he followed me about ten yards and gave me a push. I fell into the road, got up, and went straight home and did not go out again. He came to my house between 2 and 3 a.m. I am sure the officers were wrong in saying I remained there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. About 150 people were round the public-house. I know the other two prisoners; I was not with them. I had not drunk much that night—a pint, I daresay—not more. The con<lb/>stable came to me and told me to go home or else he would take me down the road. When I got home I sat indoors with my wife and children. I said, in answer to the charge, "I have nothing to say here"—it is not my place to speal at the police station when I am charged. I was not there at all when the row was taking place.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a labourer, live at 112, Lydden Road, and have lived in the same street all my life. There has never been any charge against me before. I am wearing four medals—one for the Soudan, two for South Africa, and the Khedive's medal. I was all through the war in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and left after 12 years service on July 24 last, discharged with a very good character. I am 33. On August 4 I was in the "Jolly Gardeners," where the other two prisoners had been. I came out at closing time with my wife and child. She was talking to her mother, and I walked on towards my house because I do not speak to her mother. As I got towards my house I heard a whistle blows and turned in that direction. I heard that Mrs. Pullen had been knocked down with her baby in her arms, and ran among the crowd to find her. There were about 200 people there, very violent, and a lot of them drunk. I was sober. There were two soldiers who were under the influence of drink and who rolled against me and knocked me down. I regained my feet, and as the crowd was moving got knocked down again, when Sergeant Jones seized me by the collar and took me into custody. I walked along the road, lit a cigarette, and smoked it going to the station. The police officers are mistaken about my striking and kicking them. There was a disgraceful scene going on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I know the other prisoners by sight. I was not in their company or in the public-house with them. I had had a drink. I asked my wife to come home. She was talking to her mother, so I left her and went home by myself. I did not see the other two prisoners outside the "Jolly Gardeners." I have not</p>

               <p>seen Reader above twice in my life. When I saw him that night he was standing underneath Jerrard's, the pawnbrokers—after that I never saw him until I got to the station. I never insulted any<lb/>body or used violent language. Sergeant Jones arrested me. I did not become violent, or call out to the crowd to assist me, or say, "Down with him. Jump on him." When arrested I behaved very nicely. I walked to the station smoking a cigarette. When I got to the station and was charged with the assault, I was dumbfounded at the charge; I did not know what I was arrested for. I did not see Reader and Coles being assaulted on the ground and being kicked. I never saw Reader after I saw him standing at the pawn<lb/>brokers. I never saw any assault at all.</p>

He has been out of the Army some considerable time—when the war broke out he went back again. I have seen him back during the time and on furlough—I could not say how long he has been out of the Army. I cannot say as to his being a peaceable man—he is at times quarrelsome when he gets a drop of drink. He is an honest, hard-working man, but he is apt to be quarrelsome if he gets a little liquor.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath). Exactly eight weeks ago to-day, about one o'clock, I left the workhouse, where I had been employed for the past eight years, to go to the bank. I had been there some dozens of occasions before. In this case I went with about half the usual amount. I should have been back in about an hour or hour and a half; I should have been missed if I had not been back in that time. I went to the bank, I admit that; I had the cheques and cashed them. Then I repaired to a house we usually went to to meet others. I had a glass of bitter. After that I remember nothing; I seem to have lost my memory altogether till I found myself in a train and being asked for my ticket. I asked where I was and was told Sheffield. I eventually found myself in Manchester, where I must have remained for two days. I cannot say what I did. When I came to my senses on the Monday I realised my position, and, thinking what best to do, I came back as far as I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100149"/>
               <p>could to Birmingham and walked straight into the police station and told them the whole facts of the case. I may say that I did not evi<lb/>dently want the money, because as soon as I got it I commenced to spend it. Why should I go to Manchester? I haven't been there for 20 years. As regards going to Birmingham, of course, I came back as far as I could. I had no money left or I should have come to London. Before my present position I held a warrant for four years; before that for six years. I had a comfortable situation and was paying for a pention, which I had done for nearly 10 years; I have a wife and family and comfortable home and was perfectly satis<lb/>fied. I cannot plead guilty to wilfully taking this money, especially from my own colleagues; I had no need to rob them.</p>

                  </hi>, kitchen porter at the Langham Hotel. At 11.15 p.m. on July 21 I went to a club at 35, Old Compton Street with a friend and his wife. We stayed till a quarter to one next morning and had drinks. Prisoner was at the bar. I said to my friend, "Good health. I hope to have another drink with you some other time." We were conversing in Italian. Prisoner turned round and said, "What is the good of hope?" I said, "It is better than nothing." He surprised me by saying that, as he was a stranger to me. I went into the next room to get my bicycle, and outside the club door I saw prisoner. He said, "If anyone comes near me I will open him." (Si qualamo mi viene vicino, lo apro.) I took no notice of that. When I was about three yards away from him he came behind me and gave me a hard push, and I nearly fell to the ground. Turning round, I saw it was Artilia. At that time I was wheeling my bicycle. I looked to see if I could find a policeman to give him in charge. My friend took the bicycle from me and we followed prisoner down various streets to the bottom of Wardour Street in the direction of St. Mar<lb/>tin's Church. I found a constable in Pall Mall and made a complaint to him, in consequence of which he returned with me to Wardour Street. We found the prisoner in St. Martin's Street, opposite the Italian Club. St. Martin's Street lies between Pall Mall and Leicester Square. When I got near him he went to strike me, and did strike me two or three times. I got hold of him and we fell to the ground. We got up at once, and when we were both up I saw that he had an open knife in his hand and told the policeman so. He must have had it before he struck me, because my missus discovered two cuts in the arm of my coat. When I first got near him I thought he was striking me with his fist. Prisoner then stabbed me twice on the inside of the left leg. I told the policeman I had been stabbed, and prisoner then ran away, but was stopped by another constable. I was taken to the Charging Cross Hospital, and subsequently attended at Vine Street Station and charged prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I had had no querrel with prisoner. The knife I was injured with was not my own knife. I never wear one. I have heard that prisoner's left little finger was cut down to the bone. I deny that that was done in wresting the knife from me. I received the two stabs in the leg after I was up.</p>

                  </hi>, 30, Upper Charlton Street, porter. I work at the Langham Hotel. On the night of July 21 I was in Old Compton Street with the prosecutor. I went out with him about a quarter past 12. He had a bicycle with him. I heard the prisoner say, "If anybody comes near me I will open him." I did not hear anybody make any reply to that. Four or face yards away from the club he gave a push to my friend. Then my friend said to me, "You just hold the bicycle, I shall give him in charge." Prosecutor and I fol<lb/>lowed prisoner through various streets. When prosecutor returned with the constable prisoner struck at him and they fell to the ground and I heard my friend say, "He has got a knife." Soon after he said, "I am stabbed!" and prisoner ran away. A knife was after<lb/>wards found a yard or two away from the place.</p>

St. Martin's Street is at the back of St. George's Barracks, and runs from Wig<lb/>more Street into Leicester Square. After what prosecutor had told me I went with the intention of getting prisoner's name and address to take proceedings against him by summons. When I got there I did not know which was which. Prisoner and prosecutor began scuf<lb/>fling together. When they got up off the ground prosecutor said, "He has got a knife," and I said, "Take it away from him." Prose<lb/>cutor afterwards said, "He has stabbed me," and prisoner ran away I afterwards found that prosecutor was bleeding from a wound in the left thigh.</p>

                  </hi>, house surgeon at Charging Cross Hospital. I examined prosecutor on the morning of July 22 and found him bleeding from a wound on the left thigh. The wound itself was not dangerous, although it was in a dangerous situation. About 1 in. or 1 1/2 in. to one side it would have cut the femoral artery and the man would have bled to death. The would did not pierce the muscle at all. I think a fair amount of force must have been used. The wound might have been caused with a knife life that produced. There is a stain on it which looks like dried blood, but I have not examined it under the microscope. I found a cut in the prosecutor's trousers corresponding with the wound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did say before the magistrate that the wound was at no time a serious or dangerous one.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100152"/>
               <p>one side it would have several the femoral artery. I also examined the prisoner, who was suffering from two cuts on the left hand, one on the little finger inside, an inch long, and extending to the bone, and the other a superficial wound on the ring finger between the second and third joints. I think the wounds were probably caused by the knife being closed, which would make that kind of semi<lb/>circular wound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not think the wound on the little finger could have been caused by rubbing against a knife in somebody's possession in attempting to take the knife away. It is a very pecu<lb/>liar wound, and from the position of the wounds I think they were inflicted by the closing of the knife. A stab would have inflicted a wound like that on the ring finger, a mere superficial cut.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath, examine through an interpreter.) I am porter and vegetable man at the Charing Cross Hotel. I have been England 28 months, and come from Piedmont. On the night of July 22 I was in a club at 35, Old Compton Street, with a couple of friends. I saw Rissone in the club. He asked me about hope, and I answered him,. "He who hopes dies." I left the club at half past 12. My friends and myself went out together, leaving Rissone in the club, and went down War<lb/>dour Street. I next saw Rissone in Wardour Street. He came after me and insulted me. He said he would do for me, using an expres<lb/>sion which (said the interpreter) it is impossible to translate. (Ti arrange per le faste.) It is not true that I said, "If anyone comes near me I will open him." He tried to quarrel with me. I never saw him before this night. I said to him, "Go to bed if you are drunk. We are not looking for you. We do not want you." It is not true that I pushed him as he was wheeling his bicycle. I went into St. Martin's Street with my friend. We wanted to go to the club. Prosecutor came up to us with a policeman. I was lighting my cigarette. He gave me a blow in the head and threw me down. When I got up I saw a knife in his hands, and jumped at him and threw him down. We both fell to the ground and I took hold of the knife; then I heard him shout, and I ran away. I stabbed him with the knife I took from him. I never had any intention of doing him any harm. My own hand was injured. I got wounded when I took the knife from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had never seen prosecutor before he came into the club that night. I did not hear prosecutor say to his friend. "I hope to have a drink with you another time." I did not there-upon turn round to prosecutor, and say, "What is the good of hope!" He addressed me, "Hope is better than nothing." I answered him: "Who hopes dies." I left the club before prosecutor. I will swear I did not say: "Si qualamo mi viene vicino lo appro." Prisoner fur<lb/>ther cross-examined gave a categorical denial of the whole incident.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100153"/>
               <p>Re-examined. I never had a knife like the one (produced). I took a knife from Rissone, but I cannot say if that is the one. The knife dropped when I ran away. I ran away on the impulse of the moment. I had never been in such an affray.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk to Potton and Son, builders, 98, Gainsford Street, Horselydown. I recollect the bill produced being left at the office by Mr. Phillips. I remember prisoner coming in in the after<lb/>noon. I had never seen him before. He said that Mr. Phillips had sent in for his coin. I then gave him the bill produced and the money, 10s. He signed the bill "G. Clark." I know that Phillips had a man named Clark. After Phillips had signed the bill he took the money and went away. In about a couple of minutes afterwards be came back and said, "Mr. Phillips says there is 27s. due." I showed him the account, and he left the office again. On the follow<lb/>ing Monday. July 15, I was going along the Old Kent Road on a bicycle and saw prisoner with a group of others standing outside the "Crown and Anchor" public-house. I turned back again just to make sure it was him. Afterwards I identified him at the police sta<lb/>tion. Very shortly after prisoner had got the money the real G. Clark turned up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My employer was present when I paid the man. When Mr. Phillips's man came we were all surprised that we had paid the wrong man. Prisoner had on a reddish choker similar to the one he is wearing now, but he had a white choker on when I identified him. The man I</p>

               <p>paid the money to was dressed like a horsey-looking man, and had on a high-cut waistcoat such as prisoner is now wearing. I could not say that the other men put up with the prisoner at the identification were horsey men. I identify prisoner by his face. I paid prisoner through a little window, and I could not say whether he wore tight trousers. I did not give a description of the prisoner to anyone. The only opportunity I had of seeing the man was through the win<lb/>dow, which is about 18 inch by 12. The "Crown and Anchor" is about 40 minutes walk from the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I work for Mr. Phillips, and it is part of my duty to collect accounts. I went out on the afternoon of Friday, July 12, to collect some. I remember meeting a fellow named Harrison near the "Crown and Anchor" public house a little before three o'clock After Harrison left me I saw him speaking to the prisoner. When I went into the "Crown and Anchor" I left Harrison and prisoner outside. Later on I went to Mr. Potton's place. The receipt pro<lb/>duced is not in my handwritting, and I did not get 10s. from Mr. Potton's clerk that day. I never told prisoner or anybody else that he might sign my name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner works at the "Crown and Anchor," but he was not at work that day. I saw him early in the day sitting on the water trough at the "Crown and Anchor." I told Mr. Phillips I had seen him after I came back from Potton. I heard Harrrison say at the police court that he did into speak to prisoner on that day, and also that he did not know that money was owing to Phillips.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I have known Harrison, I should think, about six or seven years. Phillips called to me on the 12th and asked me to go to Potton's after a little account for him. He said, "You have not got to get there before five o'clock," so I said, "All right," and left. After that I saw Harrison speak to Bridge.</p>

                  </persName>, R Division. On July 23 I was outside the "Crown and Anchor" public-house about a quarter to four. I there saw prisoner, a man name Harrison, and two others Between the 12th and 23rd I had seen Harrison and prisoner together several times. I am on duty in the neighbourhood. I told prisoner I should take him into custody on suspicion of forging a receipt and obtaining 10s. from Messrs. Potton, of Horselydown. Prisoner replied. "I know about the job. You have made a bloomer if you think it was me." I took him to the police station, and he was placed amongst eight others, similar in build and dress and height Prisoner was asked by the officer in charge if he was satisfied with the identification, and he said he was perfectly satisfied. I had not a warrant for prisoner's arrest, and I had no description of him but from something I heard in a public-house I made a communication to Mr. Phillips and Mr. Potton. That would be three or four days after the 12th. Mr. Phillips had been round to me and made a complaint. All the men had mufflers on. I do not quite know what</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I live at 12, powers Place, Pomercy Street. New Cross. For the last six months I have been employed by Mr. Alfred Steele, horse dealer, as carman. He has stables at the back of the "Crown and Anchor." On this particular Friday I was employed chaff cutting, and commenced work at half past six in the morning and left off at half past seven at night. I did not leave the premises except for my breakfast and dinner. I did not go to Potton's that day, and do not even know where the place is. The receipt on the bill (produced) is not my signature. (Prisoner wrote the name G. Clerk on paper for comparison with the name on the account.) I saw Harrison in and out of the yard, but I did not take much notice. I did not see George Clark speak to Harrison. I was only out of the yard to get my meals. It is not true that I was with Harrison when I was arrested. When arrested I told the sergeant that I had heard about job. I had heard people talking about it on the day of the occurrence. I did not tell Mr. Phillips I knew who had done it, but I told him I had heard all about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. This thing was being constantly talked about amongst the men. Nearly everybody knew about it.</p>

                  </hi>, foreman of Alfred Steele, horse dealer, said that prisoner had been employed at the "Crowen and Anchor" yard for the last six months. He remembered July 12, because on that day Mr. Steele had 12 horses come from Staplehurst. That would occa<lb/>sion extra worm for the prisoner, as there was an extra lot of chaff to be cut. Prisoner came to work about half past six in the morn<lb/>ing and worked till half past seven at night, and was under witness's observation practically the whole of the day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Harrison was at the yard on July 12.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. When prisoner was arrested the officers came and asked me if I remembered him being at work for me on that day and I recollected that he was.</p>

In his van was a pad of potatoes (112 lb.); he brought this pad back, as the consignees did not take delivery. I toll him to put the pad on the stand and go with his wan to King's Cross. As he left the yard I noticed that the pad was on his was conversed with sacks. I instructed Pope to follow Smith and see where he went. Later on I went to prisoner's shop, and there saw a pad, which I identified as mine; it bore the mark of the wholesale dealers from whom I get my potatoes. The value of the potatoes is 5s.; the pad is worth 1s.; the dealer allows the 1s. back on the return of the pad. Smith was charged along with Brown and convicted of the theft.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is the practice of some merchants to give tickets when they take 1s. for the pad, and without the ticket they will not refund the 1s. It would be possible for me to get back the 1s. without the ticket, whereas a small man could not.</p>

                  </hi>. On instructions of my employer (Lefevre) I fol<lb/>lowed Smith when he left the yard. He went straight to Aldersgate Street, where prisoner keeps a greengrocer's shop. I saw Smith take the sacks off the pad of potatoes and take the pad into prisoner's shop; he came out after five minutes without the potatoes; prisoner was with him, and they went to a public-house together; in a short time the two returned to the shop; Smith picked up two empty pads and put them on his van and rode away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Smith did not pull up his van outside prisoner's shop, but a little distance away. I have known and worked with Smith for some time; I cannot say whether he had been on the drink lately.</p>

                  </persName>, City Police. I arrested Smith at 3.30 on August 14, and he made a statement to me. An hour later I saw prisoner at his shop. I told him who I was, and said, "I have come to see you about some potatoes which have been brought here." He said, "I have had no potatoes." I said, "Wait till I have told you everything and be careful what you say. A bag of potatoes was seen to be delivered to you at this morning; they were brought here by a carman of Mr. Lefevre's named Smith; after you had received the potatoes you had drinks with him at a public-house, and you handed Smith tow empty pads; I have arrested Smith, and he has told me that he brought the pad of potatoes here, and you gave him 2s. 6d. for them." Prisoner replied," Yes, I did have the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100157"/>
               <p>potatoes," and he produced the pad from the back of his shop." He continued, "A carman of Mr. Lefevre's called here about 12 noon and brought with him a pad of potatoes; he said to me, 'I want to leave these potatoes here; he said he had had too much to drink, and he did not feel up to bothering with them, and asked me if he could leave them till the afternoon; I said 'Yes, provided you will call for them this afternoon.' He then brought the pad inside the shop, and we both went to the 'Star' public-house and had a drink together; we each paid for our own drinks. Before we had the drinks I gave the carman two empty pads, as I had no use for them. He asked me for them and I gave them to him; it is not true that I gave him 2s. 6d. for the potatoes; I have not bought any potatoes from Mr. Lefevre for some months." At the station in reply to the formal charge, he said, "I plead not guilty; I did not know it was stolen."</p>

The windows and doors were then all closed up. About five next morning I heard a window open on the first floor. I got out of bed; while dressing I saw the handle of my door move. I at once opened the door and saw prisoner running downstairs. I gave chase and caught him on the first floor. I asked him what he was doing. He said, "All right, guv'nor. I haven't got anything belonging to you. I have just come in from next door." I sent for the police and prisoner was arrested. On searching the premises we found nothing missing.

                  </hi>. I am Inspector to the Royal London Friendly Society. I was previously a collector to the Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society. I have known Pickering for 12 years and Aston for two years. Pickering was at one time employed in the Liverpool Society, and has been acquainted with Aston for about three years. I introduced Pickering to Calcott, James, and Ayling, three collec<lb/>tors in my district.</p>

                  </hi>, collector in the Royal London Society. Our col<lb/>lectors receive a commission of 10 per cent on new business and 25 per cent. on renewal premiums; they at times employ canvassers to assist them, paying the canvassers twelve times the amount of the first weekly premium. Pickering's name was given to me by Hill. On June 17 I wrote to Pickering. On the 19th he called on me, and said that if I would go with him to Kennington he would introduce some business. He took me to 2, offord Road, Kenning<lb/>ton where he introduced me to female prisoner (under the name of Mrs. May) as the gentle man who had called about the insurance. I produced some proposal forms and took particulars from her. While writing down particulars of the children Pickering asked her if she had any other childern. She said, "No, only those three," and asked him how many he had. From this I concluded that they were strangers. The four proposal forms produced are signed by Aston in the name of Emily May, and witnessed by Pickering. Eight lives were insured, the total weekly premiums being 2s. 3d. She paid me there and then 2s. 3d., the first week's premiums. One of the insurance was for £12 on the life of Peter W. Chivers, described as the father of Emily May. On leaving the house I paid Pickering 27s., his commission on the business. On July 5 I called at 2, Offord Road with Ayling and James, Inspector Bradford, and Inspec<lb/>tor Hill. I asked Aston for the two weeks' premiums then due. She said she was not going to keep the thing up, she had altered her mind. Ayling and James asked her for their contributions. She said she was not going to continue. "Let'em all come, the more the merrier".</p>

                  </hi>. On June 20 Pickering called on me and said he could introduce some business. We went to 2, offord Road, and I there saw female prisoner, under the name of Mrs. May, who gave me particulars from which I filled in the proposal forms produced. (This set of forms was identical with that in the Calcott case.) She paid me 2s. 3d. for the first week's premiums. On the same day I paid Pickering his commission of 27s. On the proposals being sent to the head office, it was found that they were identicals with others, and the policies were not issued. On my calling for the re<lb/>newal premiums, with Calcott, on July 5, Aston said she was not going to bite—"How many more of you, let them all come."</p>

                  </hi>. On June 21, Pickering called on me, by directions, he said, of Hill, who wished me to go to see about some new business. We made an appointment to go to Kennington in the afternoon; I went, but Pickering did not turn up. He sent me a postcard saying he would call on me on the 22nd. I saw Calcott and James in the meantime, and we arranged to adopt a certain course. On the 22nd I met Pickering at Kenninggton; he referred me to 2, offord Road. I went there and saw the female prisoner, under the name of Mrs. May. (The proposal forms produced, filled in by witness at her dictation, were identical with the others.) She paid me 28s., the first week's premiums. When I left her, Pickering, who had been waiting for me outside, asked me for his remuneration; I said I must keep him waiting a little. (Witness corroborated the story of Calcott and James as to their interview with Aston on July 5.)</p>

                  </hi>, divisional surgeon, B Division. On August 27, 1907, at 11.35 p.m., I was called in to see the prosecutor. He had a wound in the right arm, which had just missed the large artery—it had been bandaged by a nurse in the hospital, but was still bleeding. I also examined the prisoner at his own request the next day at the police court. He said he had a bump on his head. I found a slight swelling; the bruite was not very marked; it might have been caused by a fall. Prosecutor's wound was in a dangerous situation; if it had not been attended to he might have bled to death; it was cuased by a sharp instrument. It penetrated to the bone and was an inch long.</p>

I saw the prisoner turn round to face the prosecutor, Foster, lift his left arm, and strike Foster right underneath the right arm. His fist was clenched—I could not see anything in his hand. Prisoner ran in the road and I half to dodge him; he appeared mad. Foster called cut, "I am stabbed." I followed prisoner down the road; he truned the corner and put something up his right sleeve, when a man with no coat on ran out and tripped him up. As I came up they were struggling on the ground, prisoner on the top of the other; the con<lb/>stable then came up and I helped to secure him. I never lost sight of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>, labourer, 12, Cottage Road, Batterses. On August 27 I had had a drink and was walking towards Queen's Road, some 30 yards behind the prisoner and two other men, who had come out of the public-house. I passed two or three yards in front of them, when prisoner turned and said, "Here is one of them." They had been having a row with some people the night before, and round the other side were a lot more men, who were going to attack them. As I walked two yards behind prisoner said, "He is one of them," and as these other men were going to set on him he gave me a punch. I did not see the knife, but some sharp instrument cut me under the arm. The prisoner and his two friends then made off. I did not know I was stabbed till the blood was pouring round me arm. I then said, "Stop them, they have stabbed me." Prisoner ran down where there is no thoroughfare, and as he came back the policeman ran after him. He was still flourishing a knife. Some fellows gave chase and tripped him over on the tram lines and held him till the police came. The police took me to the hospital. My hand in use<lb/>less as the result of the injury. Three doctors at Brixton Prisoner, where I have been remanded three weeks, say I must go to the Lon<lb/>don Hospital.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had come out of the public-house. I had never seen the three men before—prisoner took me for another man. I am about to be tried for an attempt to break and enter, of which I am innocent. I was convicted of assault in November, 1901, when I came home from the front in South Africa, and sentenced to two months' hard labour. In February, 1902, I was convicted of being a deserter and received three months. I have been three times a deserter. In August, 1905, I was convicted of street betting. In December, 1905, I was charged with assault and discharged the prosecutor did not appear. I am a labourer, not in employment. I was alone that night. I had nothing to do with other men who were there. I and others did not attack prisoner and his two friends, and no scuffle ensued. Prisoner attacked me in mistake; he had a knife open and intended to stab somebody, and he interfered with me. (To the Recorder.) There was not a gang of men there that I know of I was alone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 13 years of age and live at the "Royal Arms," Battersea Park Road. On the night of August 27 I saw pri<lb/>soner and two other men enter the bar and go out, followed at some distance by Foster. I followed them about five yards behind. The three were the worse for drink and were refused drink at the public-house in consequence of their condition. When about 30 or 40 yards from the public-house prisoner lifted his hand and struck Foster in the arm. I saw a brown-handled knife in prisoner's hand. I was five yards behind. The three then ran up the road. I saw a man run after prisoner. I am certain prisoner struck the blow.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100163"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was standing in the entrance to saloon bar, and the three came to the private bar, looked in, and went round to the other bar and came out. One of them was drunk, and I formed the opinion that they had not been served, and my father told me so when I came home. I thought there would be some mis<lb/>chief, because they were looking for somebody in all the bard, so I followed them. Prisoner stabbed with his left hand. He held the knife near the blade open, and I saw the handle sticking out. There were a number of people down the road when prisoner was caught.</p>

                  </hi>, aged 13. On August 27 I saw two men come from the "Royal Arms," and the prisoner had a knife in his hand, and suddenly he turned round and hit the prosecutor and ran on the tram lines. Prosecutor holloaed out, "I am stabbed." Prisoner was tripped over and was caught on the pavement. I saw the knife on the tram lines and went to pick it up when I was pitched over. I did not see any other blow struck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see the prisoner strike the prosecutor. The first I saw was the man running away, some man ran after him, and then I saw the knife on the tram lines. I saw the two men together, and one of them stab the prosecutor; I am sure there were only two. I noticed the two come out of the "Royal Arms" as I was on the other side of the road. I saw prisoner stab the prose<lb/>cutor. I saw the knife very nearly in the middle of the road near where the prisoner was being held down. There were quite a lot of rough-looking men there.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">COLE</hi>, 823 N. On August 27, at a few minutes to 11 p.m., in the Battersea Park Road, I heard a shout, "Police—stop him," and looking in the direction of the sound I saw a crowd of about 200 people. When I got close I heard a man shout, "I am stabbed." I saw the prisoner in front of the crowd, who were crying, "Stop him." I tried to intercept him, he dodged under my arm, when someone jumped out, tripped him, and they fell down. I caught hold of prisoner. Foster then came up with his arm bleeding, and said, "That is the man who stabbed me in the arm." Prisoner said, "All right, constable, I will go quietly with you." When charged, he said, "Please examine my head—I have a lump on it where he hit me." He had a small lump which I do not think could have been caused by being tripped up, at it was too far on the top.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I should suggest prisoner was hit on the head. I was holding him when Foster came up and said, "That is the man who stabbed me"—after he saw prisoner was in charge. pri<lb/>soner has an excellent character for five years as a hard-working man. (To the Recorder.) Prisoner had been drinking, but was not drunk.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a labourer, and have lived at 23, Urswick Road, Battersea, for over two years. I have never</p>

               <p>had any sort of charge brought against me before. A number of friends in Battersea have subscribed for my defence. On August 27 I was with Reardon and O'Connor, and we went into the public-house for a drink. We had been drinking, and were going to have one drink and go home. We were not drunk. O'Connor asked for a drink, and when the barman came to serve the drink a short man in the bar said, "This is the man, we have him"—so they all jumped over at him. Reardon said, "Come out, this is no place for us." So we went out without having the drink. It is not true that the bar<lb/>man refused to serve us. We had not time to wait for a drink when they set about us. We walked up the road together towards Queen's Road, and the crowd followed us. We were on the right, side, and two came up on our left, and the first witness struck Reardon. I was going on the other side of the road to get away from the row when Foster came and struck me on the head. I turned back and knocked him down. There was a crowd of men around me drawing on either side. Foster cried out he was stabbed. I did not stab him. I had never seen the man before in my life. I never use a knife or carry a knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. O'Connor had been paying for the drink. We had had a few drinks at dinner time. I had been home and had my supper, and come out for a walk. I was struck on the back of my head 40 yards from the public-house by Foster. I never saw the knife. (To the Recorder.) I never had the knife in my hand open Everything the witnesses have said as to the only blow being that given by me to the prosecutor is untrue. I do not know why the boy should tell that story—I have had no quarrel with him or any<lb/>body in my life before.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I think the boy may have made a mistake. (To the Recorder.) I ran away because there were 10 men around to kill me. I had to run.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, working on the electrification of the tram lines. I was with the prisoner and O'Connor from about 10.30 p.m. We had not had much to drink. We went into the pri<lb/>vate bar of the public-house, as I usually do. I intended to go into the public bar. As we went in a man said, "How many more of you, the more the merrier—here you come one, two, three—the more the merrier." O'Connor called for three ales. The landlord said, "This is the 1 1/2 d. bar." We did not particularly care about that, but these men wanted to fight, so we walked out. We were not out of the public more than a second when the whole crowd followed us, and in no time there was up to 200 people in the street. We were together and he crowd rushed on us. I got struck, and so I expect the pro<lb/>secutor did. We all got struck. There were several people striking at us. We got separated. They caught hold of me and said, "You have stabbed someone with a knife." A constable came up and ar<lb/>rested me on suspicion of stabbing with a knife. I saw nobody stabbed. I did not see the prosecutor stabbed, or bleeding. I never</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100165"/>
               <p>saw him till I saw him at the station, when his wound was tied up. I was arrested within a minute after we came out of the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have known prosecutor over three years. He has been my mate and has been living with me for two years. I had not been with prosecutor all day—he was working night work. I had been working with the same contractor, but not in the same locality. I met him late in the afternoon. I did not think it safe to go into the bar with the crowd that were there—they seemed to have some<lb/>thing against us. We were near to the prosecutor, but I could not see what happened because of the crowd. I did not see anybody wounded. I am not in a position to say who wounded Foster. I could not say if it was the prisoner. Three or four women identified me as the man who stabbed the prosecutor. I did not strike any blow at all.</p>

                  </hi>, 135, Wick Road, Hackney, coal dealer. I stable in Crawley's yard, and on July 2 went to do the horse up at night. I had turned the water on, when Francis, who works on the same wharf with me, and whom I have known for 10 years, came round and said, "What is the matter?" I said nothing. He deliberately turned round and said, "I am going to have a fight"—he had had a drop. I said, "You had better turn it in—you cannot have a fight with me"—I did not want to have a row. John Webb, a greengrocer, then came up the yard. Francis said, "You will do as well," and there was a blow passed, I believe, by Francis. He said to me, "I am going to have a fight. As a mate will you look after me?" I said "Yes." So I turned round and said to Webb, "Is it agreed that I should look after him?" He said "yes," and they had a fair fight. Francis got beaten. He shook hands and said, "This fight will con<lb/>tinue</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100166"/>
               <p>on the wharf next morning." Crawley, who is a wheelwright, was standing about five yards away from the fight and saying "Go on." He had a lump of shaft in his hand. Francis went away to<lb/>wards Crawley's house, and about a minute after returned and went down to the other end of the yard, and I saw, as I thought, two men wrestling. James Webb came up the yard saying something about being stabbed. Francis came straight away from him, stabbed at me, and cut me in the hand with a pocket knife. I held James Webb up, and Francis popped it in my shoulder. I went to the other end of the yard and out into the street, and fell fainting on the ground. While Francis was wrestling or stabbing James Webb, Crawley was saying, "Go on, do for him." He was about five yards from me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jenkins. I do not know why Francis fought John Webb; he and the Webbs were friendly. All I heard Francis say was, "Have a fight." There is a game with flour the boys play. The boys collected pennies for flour and I gave one. I do not know to what boy. I do not know of Crawley's house being floured over; I only know of his shying bad eggs at anybody who came up the yard. the fight between Francis and John Webb was perfectly fair; Francis got knocked down once or twice; he was not kicked when down; there was no one there to do that; there were only me, Francis, John Webb, Crawley, and Mrs. Crawley there. It is wrong to say that James Webb came up, and that he and about 30 others would not let Francis go. It was Frederick Webb, the father, who said, "If you had hit me you would not go out of this yard alive, you would go in pieces."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doughty. Crawley did not strike any blow. After the first fight he went to his house. He was not drunk. He stood at his door holloaing and raving—he was not drunk; he is often like that when he gets a few glasses of ale; he was beating a bit of corrugated iron with a lump of wood. I did not see Francis use a knife; it was nearly dark, but you could see five yards away. I was five yards from Crawley and five yards from Francis and James Webb when they were, as I thought, wrestling. Crawley was then heating this corrugated iron and saying, "Go on—do for them."</p>

                  </hi>, 275, Wick Road, fruiterer and greengrocer, brother of the prosecutor. I have a stable in Crawley's yard which I went to on July 2. As I was in the stable I heard something said about fighting. I went out and saw Francis and Bristow standing against Bristow's stable. As I walked up Francis said, "You will do just as well," and struck at me. I retaliated, and we fought for five or six minutes. I took off my coat. It was a deliberate and fair fight. Francis then shook hands and said he would finish in the morning on the coal wharf, and went towards Crawley's house. Crawley shouted, "Go on, do for him." Francis came rushing back and caught had of my brother James round the neck and made as though he were punching him. I rushed to his assistance, Francis let go,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100167"/>
               <p>and James staggered into my arms and exclaimed, "I am stabbed." I led him out of the yard. Then I heard Francis rush up the yard and say to somebody—I could not see who it was in the dark—"You have got to have it next." Crawley was thumping some iron and shouting, "Do for them" at the top of his voice. I was very friendly with Francis; we used to go to school together. I had not quarrel at all with Francis.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jenkins. I had a quarrel with Crawley eight years ago; his son struck me down with a lump of wood. We have been friendly since, except when Crawley gets a drop of drink. I do not know what led to the fight. It is a common thing for Crawley to wish to fight me or one of my brothers. Francis said, "You are one of them" and struck at me—"You will do just as well." Bristow was his second. I calmly took off my coat and had a perfectly fair fight. He had much the worst of it. He was not drunk; he had been drink<lb/>ing. The thumping of the corrugated iron started just at the finish of the fight. Mrs. Crawley and many others came before James Webb came up. Francis had then had quite enough fighting and wanted to go away. He went round towards Crawley's house, and Crawley saying, "Go on, do for them," I suppose, riled his temper. James Webb, coming up, did not prevent him leaving. He made an absolutely unprovoked attack on James—I surmise he took James for me. By that time there were 12 or 13 there and a few boys. They had got some flour to flour each other—not to flour Crawley's house. We are friends with Crawley, rent a part of the yard from him, and give him work. He annoys us when he gets the worse for drink. My brother and others did not prevent Francis going away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doughty. Crawley was drunk. He was six or seven yards from where Francis was fighting. There were only a few there then. After the stabbing there were thousands there, you might say.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The stabbing was a minute or 1 1/2 minute after the fight was over. Francis did not go in the right direction to go out of the yard.</p>

                  </hi>, second medical assistant, Hackney Union Infirmary. On July 2, at 11 p.m., I made an examination of James Webb at the infirmary. He had seven wounds—one incised wound in the back of the left arm about 4 in. long, one punctured wound below the angle of the left shoulder blade, about 2 in. deep, running towards the right, two punctured wounds between the shoulder blade and the spine 3 1/2 and 2 in. deep, one at the back of the right neck about 1/2 in. deep, one below the arm about 1 in. deep. Those were all on the left side. He had one small wound 1/2 in. deep on the right of the spine. They were serious wounds. There was no important structure divided, but they got septic afterwards, due to the filthy state of the weapon. On the second day his temperature rose to 103 deg.; the wounds became very suppurated; I had to enlarge three of them, make an incision in one and make channels, so that the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100168"/>
               <p>pus should pass away. He is quite recovered now. The wounds could have been caused by either of the knives produced. One of them when shown at the police court had fresh blood on it, and it is now discoloured. I have seen the clothing, but have not fitted the knives to the cuts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. They are ordinary penknives. There was no im<lb/>portant blood vessel divided.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jenkins. It seemed to me there was a lot on to one—that Francis was being attached by the others, the Webb amongst them. I did not see James Webb at the first. Somebody was saying, "Up with your right" and "Up with your left, Jack." I heard Francis say, "I am all on my own." He wanted to get away and the others would not let him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doughty. I did not see Crawley there—if he had been I should have noticed him, knowing him by living eighteen months in his yard. I never heard anyone say, "Go for him." (To the Recorder.) I did not see the first fight. I saw they had been fighting, because Francis's mouth was bleeding.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of George Gardner, 13, Cowdery Street, green<lb/>grocer. My house backs on to Crawley's yard. On July 2 I heard a lot of noise and shouting. The first words I distinctly heard were, "I shall not fight you to-night, for you are drunk, Joe"—that is Joe Francis. The reply was, "we will fight it out to-morrow on the coal wharf"—All right." Then "Shake hands and have a drink, and we will continue the fight to-morrow." then Crawley shouted out from his bedroom window, "Have a cut at them now—out them—do for them"—he said he would find a sledge hammer in the shop. I think Crawley was drunk. He said, "Don't forget old Crawley is up here—I am coming." His wife said, "Don't you go doen," but he did. I saw him come out in the yard, shouting "Old Crawley is here, don't forget it." He took up a piece of wood and knocked on the corru<lb/>gated iron. He was drunk. Then he went further along to where the men were quarrelling, and I did not see any more till I heard, "My God, I am stabbed."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doughty. One of my neighbours brought a criminal charge against Crawley of exposing himself, and I was a witness. The magistrate gave him the benefit of the doubt. I do not think he made strong comments on my evidence.</p>

As I entered the yard Francis rushed past me in amongst a lot of children. He jumped on some boy, and the boy fell on his hands and knees. He then turned, caught hold of me, and punched me in the</p>

Francis said, "If that has not done for you, nothing has not." I put my hands behind me, and I was smothered in blood. I then fell unconscious. I was in the innrmary seven weeks and two days.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. H. Jenkins. It was too dark to see much. I cannot say if there were a number of people there. I heard Craw<lb/>ley's voice. I do not understand why it was done. I did not inter<lb/>fere in the disturbance at all. It is not true that I, among a number of other men, tried to prevent Francis getting away. Francis and I were not friendly, but there was no quarrel.</p>

One had fresh blood on it and had apparently been sharpened. I have compared the larger knife with the cuts in the clothing produced, and the cuts correspond to the size of the knife in the coat, waistcoat, and two shirts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have known both prisoners for the last six years to be of good character. Sometimes Crawley gets a little to drink and may be a bit troublesome. He is a very hard-working men and a very good man away from the drink. He has been in business for himself as a wheelwright for a great number of years. Francis assists his brother and father as a coal porter; he is a peaceable man. (To the Recorder.) When they go on the drink anyone is liable to make a mistake.</p>

               <p>Prisoners' statements (Francis): I reserve my defence. I have no witness here. (Crawley): On the day in question I was hard up and worried. I had had some teeth out. I came home and spoke to Francis; afterwards there was a noise at the door. My wife would not let me out. I could only get the window a bit open. I did not see Francis again till he came back smothered in blood.</p>
               <p>The Recorder said there was not a particle of evidence against Crawley, and he ought never to have been committed for trial on the charge of feloniously wounding, for which he would be liable to penal servitude for life. He was directed to stand down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Huntly Jenkins submitted that the case against Francis would be met by a verdict of unlawful wounding.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kyffin said the prosecution had felt difficulty in accepting that proposition, owing to the case against the other prisoner, but he would now be quite satisfied with that verdict.</p>

                  </hi>, 202, Whitechapel Road, labourer. On Sun<lb/>day, August 25, about nine p.m., I was outside "The Fox and York-shire Grey," Mile End Road, when I saw a mob of boys, whom I knew, come across the road. One of them came up and said, "Fitz<lb/>gerald, I want you." I never answered, but ran down Harlow Place, turning into Adelina Grove, when I saw prisoner (whom I knew) with his face against the wall, his back to me. As I ran fast he said, "Fitzgerald," and something else I didn't hear. I ran on for several yards when I heard a short, and felt a pain on the right side of my back. I could not tell how far I had got when the shot was fired; I should judge about 15 or 20 yards. I stood at the corner of Jubilee Street when some boys asked me what was wrong, and told me to go to the station, which I did, and was examined by a sovereign. Then I went with Detective Girdler to try and find the man who had fired the shot. I did not know prisoner as Mortimer; I knew him as Mr. Hall. As we went along I described prisoner to Girdler, and at about 11 o'clock in white Horse Lane I found pri<lb/>soner, and he was arrested.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I have known you for three years as near as I can judge. I have not known you to have a revolver in your possession; I never saw you fire; and did not took at you as I went by. I saw your trousers. You have never had a quarrel with me, nor used a threat to me.</p>

When told the charge prisoner said, "I have no revolver." I took hold of his right arm, and as I did so I felt something heavy in his right-hand jacket pocket. I put my hand in and pulled out this revolver. He said, "I took it away from a boy I do not know." I afterwards found it was loaded in three chambers with these three cartridges. It was a six-barrel pin fire. On the way to the station prisoner put his hand in his left-hand breast pocket and dropped something, which fell with a metallic sound. I then found it was this pin fire cart<lb/>ridge, which corresponds and fits the revolver. When charged pri<lb/>soner made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>. On the night of Sunday, August 25, I went to a lodging-house called Melbourne Chambers. When I had been there about 20 minutes prisoner came in. I then walked out and prisoner came after me. I walked across the road and said "Good night." When I got up Cartwright Street I heard something like footsteps at a running pace. I looked round and saw prisoner with a revolver which he pointed at me. I got hold of his wrist, and he said, It is loaded." I said, "Put it away; you might shoot me." I walked across the road and heard a report; then I found I was hit in the left thigh. I then saw prisoner going back the way he had come. I walked about 90 yards, and told the constable in Royal Mint Street that I had been shot. I was then taken on an ambulance to the Lon<lb/>don Hospital I am getting on pretty well, but still limping. Later on I picked the prisoner out at the police station as the man who had shot me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have known prisoner for five or six years, and never had a quarrel with him. I have seen him mess about with a pistol. I think this affair was an accident; I have never done pri<lb/>soner any harm. When I was shot I did shout out; there was no one near to hear me. I staggered till I got to Royal Mint Street. I had got some yards away from prisoner when I heard the report. My back was to prisoner when I was hit.</p>

                  </hi>, house surgeon, London Hospital, said he examined Hall on August 26, and found a small wound on the outer side of the left thing, with a smaller wound above it, and a good deal of bleeding. There was a hole through the trousers, which might have been caused by a bullet shot from behind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I should say that the man who fired would have been two or three yards away.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">LESSING</hi>, H Division. On August 27, about 3 a.m., I was in Leman Street, when prisoner came to me and said, "Are you the detective in the shooting job?" I said that I was. He said, "I have got some good information for you quietly." I invited him to the station, where he said, "The man that is shot is my brother and I can tell you who shot him. You will have to make haste or he will be off to Liverpool. He made a confession to me to night. Now did my brother tell you what the man was like?" I replied that he did. He then said, "Can he pick him out?" I said, "I think so." "What did he say he was like; a big man?" I re<lb/>plied, "No, he described him as a man very much like yourself, and I think you are the man." He said, "If that is all you think of my information I shall tell you no more; I am going." I said, "You cannot go yet; you will be detained while I make inquiries about you." He then said, "If that is so I may as well tell you the truth. I am the man who shot him; he is not my brother." I took his statement down, which he signed after he was charged: "About 11.45 I went to the Chambers, where I saw Harry Hall. We then had a conversation, and he left the house. I followed him about half way up Cartwright Street, and said, 'Look out,' and pointed a review at him. He said, 'Chuck it, don't fire at me.' He then took held of my hand, and in the struggle the revolver went off. I went away and he went the other way. Afterwards I heard the police were making inquiries, and thought I would give myself up. I have been to the London Hospital to see Hall, but could not get in. I make this statement perfectly voluntarily. I wish to add that I thought he was seriously ill, and wish to give myself up." Whilst searching prisoner he said, "You need not look for the cartridges; I only had three, and I threw them in the dock with the revolver."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I should say prisoner had already been to the station when he met me, by what the officer on duty told me. I believe prisoner intended to deceive me.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I had no grudge against Hall; we had always friends. We were in the lodging house on the Sunday night. Hall was sitting downstairs in the kitchen, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100173"/>
               <p>I came down and started larking. He says, "Here he goes larking about with that thing." That was the revolver, because I had it in my hand. Then Hall left the kitchen and went upstairs. I ran after him up Cartwright Street. He was a laughing and so was I. He says, "Mind it don't go off." When I got up to him I had the re<lb/>volver pointed like that, and he caught hold of my hand; as he did so drawing himself away. He would not let go my hand, and the thing went off. He didn't say whether he was shot or not, but want to the top of the turning, while I went to the bottom. He never ballosed or anything. I heard nothing till the next day, when I heard I had shot him. I inquired at the London Hospital, and I was told a man named Hall had been shot; then I knew I had shot him. I went home and told some of the fellows; then I went to the station on Tuesday morning as asked for Detective Lessing. I told him I wanted to give myself up for the shooting job on Sunday night. Then he took me in a room and told me to tell him all about it, which I did. I never told him there was a struggle; there was no struggle. I didn't run away; I walked. I was in the cell when they read over the statement, and never thought of contradicting any<lb/>thing in it. The pistol in question is kept in a locker at the lodging house, on the top floor; the locker is kept unlocked. Anybody can go there. It was a rusty old revolver, and anybody used to go and take it out, pointing it at one another and larking about. Most of the people in the house knew it was there. I have expressed a wish to make reparation, if I could, for this accident. I earn 4s. to 5s. a day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not know whose revolver it was. When I was told that I had shot Hall I slung it over the dock. I said, "Here it goes; there will be no more damage done with it." I took no notice whether it was loaded when I took it out of the locker. I had no cartridges for it. The next morning I found there were three cartridges in it, which I slung away with the revolver. When I got back that night to the lodging house I put the revolver in the locker again—that was about midnight on the Sunday. About dinner time next day I found the revolver in the locker when I went there to look for something else. I then took it out to sling it away. There were people who saw me take the revolver out of the locker, but they are not here to-day. I had never carried the revolver about before. I had larked about with it in the afternoon. They say shots have been heard in the lodging house, but I haven't heard them. Hall took hold of my wrist with his left hand, standing sideways. It is not true that I told the officer about Hall being my brother and that I could five information, etc., nor is it true that he said I was like the man and he would have to detain me. The revolver must have gone off when Hall let go my arm; that is the only way I can think it hap<lb/>pened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer's boy, 14 years old. On August 25 I was at the corner of Dupont Street, Limehouse, about 10.30 p.m., with two other boys, when I saw prisoner coming out of Carr Street. About that time I heard a noise. Prisoner said to me, "Look what some boy gave me," and showed me the revolver (produced). I said, "I don't believe it is a real one"; he replied, "Will you dare me?" I ran across the road and said "No." When I got across I put up my hand, and he fired and hit me under the arm. I put my head up because the pistol was pointing at me. I went home and told my mother, who told my father, and he took me to the Children's Hospital, Shadwell. They attended to me, and I went home the same night. When I was hit I told Potter so. He said, "No, I hit the wall"; then he went away. I have never had any quarrel with prisoner. He is 16. I had never seen him with that pistol before. Prisoner works at Batger's confectioners.</p>

The boys round about told me it was prisoner. The latter walked away to the corner of Dupont Street. After that I heard a second shot go off, and rushed up to Jones, who was crying. I asked him what was the matter, and he said, "Potter asked me if I would dare him. I said no, and ran away, and Potter followed me letting the pistol off." Potter was near enough to hear this. I said to him, "You have done a sensible thing; you are likely to get yourself in trouble." Prisoner replied that he did not think he had done anything like it.

On July 16, between 8.30 and nine, I met prisoner Wallace, who asked me to take a letter to Mr. Fisher, which I did, leaving it with the last witness. I was to meet Wallace again at the doorstep opposite. When I saw him he said, "Have you got it?" I said, "Mr. Fisher was not in, and the lady said, 'Was she really to open the note?" Wallace said, "Go back and tell her 'Yes.'" I went back partly, when Detective Hall stopped me. When the detective went up to get Wallace, Collins had just come up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not remember going to the police station some time after with another little boy. The policeman took me to the station on the same night, when I identified Wallace. When Col<lb/>lins came up he was then in custody.</p>

                  </persName>, G Division. Shortly after eight on the night of July 16 I was in New North Road with Detective Hall. I saw prisoner Collins with another man—Wallace—at the corner of Salisbury Street. We passed them and returned 20 minutes later. The two men were then standing opposite where we had first seen them. They walked along as far as the "Sturt Arms," just opp<lb/>site 63, New North Road. They stood there about 10 minutes, then returned to the original place. Collins then left Wallace and crossed the road twice, each time speaking to a boy. He again rejoined Wal<lb/>lace, and in a few minutes handed the latter a note. Wallace then removed his pince-nez, crossed the road, and stopped a boy, handing him the note he had received from Collins. The boy went off, and I saw him enter 63, New North Road—this boy was Victor Willis. Collins and Wallace followed. Collins stood right opposite the shop, while Wallace remained about 50 yards back in the New North Road. Willis then left the shop and walked to where Wallace had first met him. Collins then overtook Wallace, and both followed the boy. Some distance down Wallace crossed and spoke to the boy, we re<lb/>turned and went towards No. 63 again. Detective Hall was rather close behind the boy, and Collins noticed him, pointing him out to Wallace, who then went to the 'Beehive" public-house. I went there and called Wallace out. I told him who I was and asked him what the note contained that he had given the boy. He said, "I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100177"/>
               <p>don't know anything about a note." I took him back to where Hall had Collins detained. The boy was there and said (meaning Wallace) "That is the man who gave me the note." Both men were taken to the station. On the way Wallace said he would go quietly without my holding him. I stopped doing so, and he struck me a violent blow in the eye. I went and saw the young lady at 63, New North Road, who told me about the envelope she said received. She opened it, and handed me the cheque and note produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The night in question was a nice light one. The two boys whom Collins spoke to first walked away, and we did not see them again. When I said at the police court, "Wallace spoke to the first boy again," I meant the third boy, Willis. Willis did not see Collins before he was arrested. We kept the men under observation because their conduct seemed suspicious. We might have been about 15 or 20 yards from them during this time. I saw a woman join Collins just before he was stopped by Hall. Collins was not put up for identification by the boy that same night. I took the note of all this after I had been to see Miss Campbell at the shop. I say in my note, "One crossed the road and each time spoke to a boy"; that referred to Collins. I had not the men's names then.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Collins when searched had a fountain pen, blotting paper, and other things.</p>

                  </persName>, G Division. On July 16 I was in New North Road with Sergeant Pulle, when I saw Collins and Wallace. I stopped the lad Willis, and in consequence of what he said I stopped Collins and told him his movements were rather suspicious. He replied, "I haven't been with another man; I have just met a person by appointment." Sergeant Pulle then came up with another man—Wallace—and the boy who identified Wallace. I told Collins he would have to come to the station, on which he said, "If that is the case I will tell you now. I have been with that man" (pointing to Wallace). When charged, no reply.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The boy never mentioned Collins's name. Collins was talking to a lady when I stopped him. I am sure he said, "I have been with that man."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On the night of July 16 I met a lady friend at the corner of Wellington Street and Strand, about 7.30. She told me she had a call to make in Hoxton, and asked me to go with her, which I did. We walked to the corner of Chan<lb/>cery</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100178"/>
               <p>Lane, where we took a 'bus to the corner of Essex Road and New North Road shortly after eight. We walked up Essex Road for about quarter mile, when my friend went up a side turning and asked me to wait for her, saying she would be about 20 minutes. When she had been gone four or five minutes a man, whom I noticed walking up and down on the other side—now known as Wallace—crossed and asked me for a light. I had never seen him before. I gave him a light, and he stood talking, though he must have seen that I did not wish his company. Then he walked away, returning in about 10 minutes. He asked me if I was waiting for anyone. Before I had time to reply my lady friend re-joined me, and allace walked off in the direction of Essex Road. We then went into a public-house, where we stayed about 20 minutes. Then we walked in the direction of City Road, and ere long Detective Hall and an inspector in uniform stopped us. Hall called up a boy who was wish them and said, pointing to me, is this the man. The boy said "No." The detective then said, "Didn't I see you talking to a man wearing a bowler hat?" I replied that I did speak to a man, or rather be forced his conversation on me. Then Detective Pulle brought up Wallace, and the boy said, "That's him." Wallace was taken off, and the inspector in uniform said to me and the lady that we had better go to the station, as they would want our name and address. When we had gone about 50 yards there was a struggle between Wal<lb/>lace and the detectives, and the lady with me, getting terribly frightened, walked away. I then went to the station.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The lady is not here; I have not seen her since. Her name is Wilson. I don't know where she lives; I had only seen her once before. I could not tell you the name of the public-house we were in. I do not know "the Sturt Arms." It is wrong to any that I handed a note to Wallace. Hall must have misunderstood what I said. I did not say to him, "If that is the case I will tell you. I have been with this man." When Wallace was brought up I said, "That is the man I have been speaking to." When I was searched some life insurance papers were found on me. I was an agent for the Wesleyan and General Insurance Company, and also for my brother's business in the Strand, the Licensed Victuallers' Employment Association. I kept receipt books, one of which was found on me. I know nothing whatever of this crime.</p>

                  </hi>, 27, Cleaver Road, Custom House, shop assistant to Messrs. Pearkes, at 12, Freemason's Road. On August 31 I was engaged at that shop. I was 16 last May. Prisoner is also a shop assistant, and had been in the employment of the firm about 12 months. At quarter to five I was cleaning out the warehouse when I saw two plums on the window sill behind where prisoner was sit<lb/>ting. He said, "You can have them if you can get them," so I reached out with my left hand to get them and he struck me across the back of the hand with a ham knife, causing a out. I ran out to the manager, and after that went to the hospital, where the wound was dressed and stitched up. Prisoner and I had not been on speak<lb/>ing terms that afternoon. Once he accused me of taking a penny out of the till, and we were bad friends over that. About a week before he struck me across the hand with the same knife and cut me where this little scar is. He said, "I will knife you you little s—d."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I sweep out the warehouse and get 6s. a week. I did not complain to the manager when prisoner cut me before. When this occurred prisoner was sitting on a bench buttering his bread and having his tea. I did not make a grab over his head to get these plums and fall on to the knife. I hadn't spoken to him on that day; we were on bad terms. Every time we had words he would always take up the knife and make me run out of the ware-house. I suppose he has taken the knife tome 20 times, and I always used to be frightended of him, but I never complained to the manager. The knife was very sharp and had been ground on the Wednesday. When prisoner saw I was cut he got a cobweb and put it over the cut place and started laughing. He didn't say he was sorry for what he had done. I returned to the shop about eight o'clock with my mother. My mother said to prisoner, "You have done a nice thing for yourself." Prisoner did not say it was entirely an accident. My mother then said that prisoner had better tell his father to come to our place and see my people in the morning. At 10 o'clock I returned to the shop with a policeman, having previously been home to ask my father what was the best thing to do, and father said charge him.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am 17, and live at 29, Chandos Street Stratford. I have been employed by the firm about 12 months, and was at another branch before I went to Freemason's Road. It is not true that Smith and I were not on friendly tears. It is false that I have threatened him with a knife something like 20 times, and that I cut him on a previous occasion. On this day I had bought some plums which were on the window sill. I was sitting on the bench underneath cutting some bread, and prosecutor, in leaning forwards to reach these plums, stumbled and fell forwards on to the knife. I didn't say he could have the plums if he could get them. When I saw that his hand was cut I got up and got a cab web and bandaged it up for him. He said to the manager, "I have cut my wrist," but nothing about my having cut him with a knife. When his mother said to me, "You have done a nice thing for your<lb/>self," "I do not know that I have; it was entirely an acci<lb/>dent on his part." Shethen said I had better go and see his father about it on the Sunday morning, and I said, "All right." When prosecutor gave me in charge I told the policeman it was an are dent, and I was very sorry it had happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We were on quite friendly terms, and we were always talking and passing jokes and larking about. When first he came I used to go out with him and show him the round, and he used to walk down the road with me as far as the trams after we had shut up the shop. We never went to a music-hall together in the evening, and there is no young lady in the case. We never had any quarrels in business—only once I caught him pinching a penny out of the till. I saw him put something in his pocket without exactly seeing what it was, and I asked him to lend me the duster, and he said, "Wait a minute," and went out at the back messing about with a drawer. I said, "I want to use that duster." Then he heard the manager coming and threw the duster across to me and a penny dropped out of it. I told the manager about it, and the manager</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100181"/>
               <p>spoke to him, and that was settled there and then and the manager gave him the penny back. After that we got on all right. After that his stock always turned out all right. I do not suggest that he stole things. I may have run after him now and again in joke, that is all, but never with a knife. It is not true that I ever said to him, "I will knife you, you little—." (Prisoner was then cross-examined as to the position of the knife at the time of the alleged accident.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a married woman, and my husband is a sol<lb/>dier. On August 16 I was moving from 13, East Road, Bettersee, to 3, Lavender Terrace, a few doors off. My next-door neighbour, Mr. Randall and another man and my lodger, Mrs. Laurence, were help<lb/>ing me to move my furniture. We adjourned to the "Lord Auck<lb/>land," where prisoner was with three other men. Prisoner asked "Can I help you move missus?" I said, "No, thank you; I have got these two men here." We were in the house about five minutes. Prisoner asked me to call for a drink. I was frightended of him, and the three men with him were bully-looking follows. Having paid for the drink, I went out with my men and the women and brought some more furniture to the new house, and while we were sitting down in the parlour a knock came at the door. Mrs. Laurence opened the door, and prisoner pushed by and walked into my parlour and looked round to see what was in it. He remarked that it was a nice house, and then went upstairs and came down again. We then went for some more things and prisoner came out with us. We locked the front door and also the gate. It was about half past seven when I left the house, and about eight o'clock I saw prisoner with a barrow with some things going down the street in company with the three men that had been in the public-house. I said, "That looks like my things." When I got to my gate I found it open but the house door was shut. I found they were my things. and went to the top of the street to get a constable. We had laid some pic<lb/>tures on the ground as we brought them in, and these had been trodden on and broken. I missed five small saddlebag chairs, two arm-chairs, and two cane chairs from the bedroom. I value the things at £6. I had never seen prisoner before in my life.</p>

As soon as I found my house had been broken open I gave information to the police. Mrs. Laurence would not come to the police court because your wife threatened her. I have also been threatened.</p>

I saw prisoner with two other men, one of whom was pulling a costermonger's barrow containing a num<lb/>ber of chairs—I suppose about seven or eight. They pulled up as the "Bagally" beerhouse and all three went inside. After remain<lb/>ing there two or three minutes they came out and went away together with the barrow. I noticed that the chairs were red and green and upholstered in a kind of plush. I have since at 3, Lavender Terrace, seen some chairs corresponding with those I saw that night. I have known prisoner by sight for years.</p>

I endeavoured to find Mrs. Law<lb/>rence, and applied for a witness summons for her, but was number to serve it. I examined the premises in Lavender Terrace. The lock on the door was a very ordinary one, and could have been opened with a knife or false key. In an inner room I saw a saddlebag catch two cane chairs, and several pictures lying smashed on the floor. I arrested prisoner on August 27, and in answer the charge he said, "I know nothing at all about it." On the way to the station he said, "I know the woman, I was drinking with her; that is why I have got the blame; it is nothing to do with me."</p>

She denied having threatened either Mrs. Bailey or Mrs. Laurence. After her confinement Mrs. Bailey asked her to go to her house, but she did not go as she did not think it a fit place to go near.</p>

                  </hi>, overseer of the Postal Order Department General Post Office. I was present when prosecutor gave notice to stop an order, and I made a note on the yellow paper produced, "Stop order, Stolen." This is the advice concerning the order that is retained in the office. The order was issued by the Post Office in Montreal, and we know by the advice that the proper person is being paid. We should not pay unless the order was duly signed in accordance with the advice. The order was brought to me by the prisoner, and is for £100, which is equivalent to £20, and the difference in the exchange is 10s. 8d. Prisoner presented the order, signed "J. Fox," the name in the advice being "William Jackson." I refused to each the order. I asked the prisoner where he had got it, and he said it had been sent to his brother, who is a sailor from Montreal. I asked him when he saw his brother last, and he said not since two years ago until last night. I asked him who had signed the order, and he said he had.</p>

                  </persName>, 193 H. Prosecutor came in to Commercial Street Police Station about half-past eight on August 23, and stated that he had been into a public-house near Spitalfields Church, and whilst there a man had spoken to him and asked him to go outside, when he was immediately knocked to the ground, and a sum of £5 in gold and silver and also an order for the payment of £100 were stolen from him. Prosecutor was quite sober. His face was swollen and there was a slight cut on the back of his head and his clothes were disarranged. We went to the vicinity of the occur<lb/>rence to see if he could recognise the man, but he was unable to do so. I took him to the District Post Office in the Mile End Road, and reported to the General Post Office next morning.</p>

                  </hi>, Rowton House, Whitechapel, bricklayer. On August 23, between 8 and 9 p.m., I remember being in a public-house in Commercial Street, when prisoner asked me to give him a drink, and I did so. Afterwards he called me outside the door. I went outside, not knowing what he wanted, and he punched me in the mouth, and another man, who was with him, hit me on the back of the head. I was dazed, and while I was lying on the ground one of them put his hand into my left-hand trousers pocket and took out the money I had. They also stole a Canadian Postal Order for £100, which I had in a wash-leather bank bag. They then ran away, and I went to the police station in Commercial Street. I had arrived from Canada between five and six that very morning. The following morning Detective Betteridge took me to the Snow Hill Police Station, where I immediately recognised prisoner as the man who had struck me in the mouth.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I had some other money in my waistcoat pocket, with which I was able to pay for my lodgings at Rowton House.</p>

                  </persName>, City Police. On the morning of August 21, about nine o'clock, I was at the General Post Office in connection with another case, and saw prisoner present the order for payment. I heard the overseer ask prisoner where he had got it from, and he replied, "My brother is a sailor, who has just returned from Canada, and he gave me the order to get it cashed." The overseer then asked where his brother was, and prisoner replied, "At home. My brother did not sign the order, I signed it myself." I then asked prisoner to come outside, saying that I wished to speak to him, and he did so. I told him I was a police office, and believed the order had been stolen. He replied, "It cannot be; it is my brother's." I asked him his brother name and address, and he said, "I shall tell you nothing." I then said I should take him to the police station for being in unlawful possession of an order supposed to have been stolen. I did not know for certain that the order had been stolen, but I heard that some inquiries had been made about a money order. I took him to the Snow Hill Station. I then went out and found prosecutor. Prisoner was sitting in the charge-rooms, and there were other men present. As soon as prosecutor came in he pointed to prisoner and said, "That is one of the men." I then took him to Commercial Street Police Station, that being the district in which the robbery was committed, where he was charged. He said, "I was going home from the Cambridge Music Hall, when I picked the order up in Fashion Street, and I went to change it at the Post Office this morning. I can bring five or six others to prove it." Before the charge was taken the inspector asked prosecutor where the robbery had taken place, and before any reply was made prisoner called out, "In Fashion Street." When he was about to be searched he produced the certificate from one of his pockets.</p>

                  </persName>, M Division. I was present at Tower Bridge Police Court on August 12 when prisoner attended and made an application to Mr. Chapman, the magistrate, against two policemen; after reading her written statement Mr. Chapman refused to issue any process against the two officers. At four o'clock that afternoon I was at Tower Bridge Police Station when prisoner came in and asked to have back her written state<lb/>ment. She was very pale and evidently in a state of suppressed irritation. I refused to give her the statement, when she said, "You don't know me, you only know what you have been told, but I will mark you for it if it is 12 months to come, a and I can get some to help me get even with you; don't you forget it." She them left. I next saw her in the station at 12.40 on the following morning. There were traces of an explosion having occurred, and in conse<lb/>quence of what was told to me I directed her to be charged with</p>

               <p>causing the explosion. She said, "I got the benzine at an oilshop in Aldgae; I asked the man for some gunpowder; he said, 'I don't keep it; you can get it at an oilshop in the Minories, and say I sent you, as it is difficult to get; say Dyas has sent you.' I got the cigarettes and the matches at a tobacconist's in the Minories. I got the gunpowder, and was carrying it about with me so that the policemen should see I had it and think I was going to do some harm, because I had threatened to take the law into my own hands. When I came in here I did not have any intention of doing any<lb/>thing to myself then until I heard what the policeman said. I got upset because the policeman charged me with something I did not say, and then I lit the matches and set light to the benzine and gun<lb/>powder. I did not mean to do any harm to anyone except myself." On a later day prisoner said to me, "I sat on the seat and laid the bottle of benzine on the seat close to me; the cork was loose and most of the benzine dropped on the floor. I had the flask of powder in my other pocket with the top off, so that the powder could come out. The policeman could not see the things. I thought he was coming towards me, and lit the match quick and dropped it on the benzine and dropped the powder flask on, and then it burst and burnt my face and hands."</p>

                  </persName>, 278 M. On August 12 I was on duty in Tooley Street just before eight p.m. I saw prisoner outside the Tower Bridge Hotel, which adjoins the station. She was smok<lb/>ing a cigarette. I noticed nothing in her hands.</p>

                  </persName>, 258 M. About half past nine, on August 12, I saw prisoner in Tooley Street moving up and down in front of the station. Just before 12 she entered the station, smoking a cigarette. She was sent away; then she commenced a quarrel with two women at the street corner; she was using very had language. I ordered them all away; the two women left; pri<lb/>soner refused to go, saying she was doing no harm. Eventually I took her to the station, and charged her with insulting behaviour likely to lead to a breach of the peace. Inspector Marriott took the charge; prisoner was told to sit on a bench in the charge room. She sat down by the table, which partly hid from view her right hand. I heard a match struck and went towards her, but before I got close to her there was an explosion, with a good deal of flame and smoke. Prisoner's eyebrows and hair were singed, and she com<lb/>plained about her right arm. She was crying, and saying, "Oh, do let me die."</p>

                  </persName>, M Division. I was on duty at the station at midnight on August 12, and took the charge when Pep<lb/>perell brought in prisoner. She made no reply at the time, declining to give her name, address, or occupation. On reading over the charge to her she said, "Do let me go out; I won't came back here again." I told her she could have bail provided she gave me her address; she said, "I don't wish my friends to know that I am</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100187"/>
               <p>locked up." I directed her to sit down while the female searcher was sent for; I went to my office, adjoining, leaving Pepperell in charge of prisoner. Shortly afterwards I heard a very loud explo<lb/>sion. I went to the charge room; I met prisoner with her hands to her face; she was very hysterical. There was also a little boy who had been sitting on the bench just by prisoner, waiting to be fetched by his friends. Prisoner had in her hands a box of match vester. The charge room was full of smoke, and there was a small of benxine; there was a large flame on the floor and on the bench. Prisoner was crying, and said, "I am sorry now I have done it"; she was superficially burnt on the face and on the back her right hand. On the floor I found this canister. On the female searcher arriving she found in prisoner's pocket the cork of the benzine bottle and the cap of the canister.</p>

She said, "I will take a pound canister, and have done with it." I sold her a pound canister, for which she paid 1s. 3d.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">PRISONER</hi> (not on oath). I was arrested on a false charge. When I went to the station I had no intention of using anything I had on me at all. I put them down on the sent just to let the matron take them when she came in. The cork of the benzine bottle was loose, and the stuff ran on to the floor, and the policeman saw it. He went straight away to the inspector's office. After the explosion I ran to the inspector's office. The inspector caught hold of me and asked me what I had done. He and the policeman returned to the charge room and found it burning, and popured some water over it. When I went into the station and the policeman met me I felt nervous and I did not know what to do. A sudden feeling came over me when I went into the inspector's office, and I felt I could not bear it any longer, and I lit the things up with the intention of killing myself, nothing else. I had no intention to do any harm to any<lb/>body. Just on the in pulse of the moment when I got frightened I lit up the things.</p>

On Tuesday, July 23rd, he came to my shop about three o'clock and said he wanted a watch and chain. He chose a watch and chain of the value of £3 10s., and said he had no money but he had a cheque. He then produced a cheque for £5 10s., signed "J. Clark and Son", payable</p>

He said the cheque was for wages for billiard-marking, and that he was now a week-end valet at the Hotel Cecil and Hotel Metropole. He took the watch and chain, and I gave him £2 change. I passed the cheque on to my ladlord to each for me, and in two or three days he brought it back marked "Forgard," and returned him the £5 10s.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Thorne. I consider Flor, though a black man, an easy man to understand. He told me that he had given up billiard-mark<lb/>ing, and that he hoped to go away with a gentle man, who was staying at the Cecil, as valet. I am absolutely certain that he said the cheque was for wages. He did not say that a bookmaker had given him the cheque.</p>

I got change from a pawnbroker. Next day I went to the pawnbroker and asked him if the cheque was right. He asked me where I had got it from, and I told him the truth.

He said, "The cheques were given to me for bets made at Sandown Races. The bookmakers had not sufficient money to pay out. I went with the women and gave her a cheque, and she gave me £3 out. The second cheque I took to a friend near Royal Osk, Barnsbury. I bought a silver watch and chain, and he gave me £2 1s. 6d. change. I pawned the watch to back horses. Here is the ticket. Clark was the bookmaker and Phil Kent wrote out the cheques in a public-house in Jermyn Street." I searched him and found upon him 4 1/2 d. in bronze and seven pawn tickets, which he said were all in respect of property he had had at different times.

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I stayed with a friend at Kings Road, Chelsea. On July 19 I went to Sandown Park and backed a horse called Sophron with Mr. Kent for a sovereign and won at 4. Kent paid the £5 by cheque. I can only read figures and can only write my name. I did not write the endorsement on any part of that cheque. On Saturday, July 20, I was again at Sandown and had a bet with Mr. Kent, but do not remember the names of the horses. They were favorites and won, and Kent paid me £5 10s. by cheque. The endorsement of that cheque is not my writing. (Prisoner wrote his name and some other words for comparison.) The second cheque was also gave to me in Jermyn Street. I remember meeting Miss Gerrik on the following Monday. Her story as to what took place is quite correct. I had no idea the cheque was forged. I remember seeing her again on July 30 in Tottenham Court Road. I asked her if the cheque was all right, and she said "Yes." Then we went and had drinks together. I made no attempt at any time to avoid her. She was with me on the second occasion more than an hour, and we Passed some policemen. It is true that I bought the watch produced of Mr. Read and paid for it with the other cheque. When I went into the shop he said, "How are you going along?" "Pretty fair" "What are you doing now?" "I think I (shall) give up the billiard marking job and do a valet job. I have two chances—one at Hotel Cecil and one at Hotel Victoria. I do not know which I am going to take yet." That was true. I also said, "I have not a watch and I want one. I have a cheque here from a bookmaker. I cannot afford a very expensive watch, as the value of the cheque is only £5. I want a cheap one." Mr. Read is mistaken in saying I said the cheque was for my wages. I did not tell him I was actually a value at the Cecil or the Victoria. I said I was expecting to go away with a gentleman on tour. When I gave Mr. Read the cheque I had no idea it was forged.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Curtis-Bennett Prisoner Kent makes at book on the course either in the 2s. 6d. or 10s. ring. Sergeant Read is mistakes in saying I said Clark was a bookmaker, and that Phil Kent wrose out the cheque in a public-house. I said that Clark saw me along with Kent. I did not know that Kent had signed one of the cheques in the name of Henry Heath. I cannot read English at all. The "Walter Smith" on the back is not my writing. I did not know that the cheque handed to me on July 20 was postdated July 22. I say Mr. Kent wrote both the cheques, but I am not going to call him to say so.</p>

On July 24 they came to see me with a young gentleman whom they introduced as Mr. Clark. Hudson was introduced by his uncle, Mr. Whitehead, and Kent was introduced as Mr. Burton. They said Clark had a big engineering business in Battersea and that half Battersea belonged to him; that he had just got married and wanted a nice quiet horse for his wife to drive. Clark confirmed this, and Kent, whom I then knew as Burton, said that Clark's motor licence had been suspended for 18 months and he was taking up driving. After that I showed them a horse, which I eventually sold to Clark for £57 10s., for which the cheque produced was given in payment. I did not see the cheque written out. Burton (Kent) and Clark went into another room to write it. I paid the cheque into the bank, and it was returned two days afterwards with the intimation that it was a forgery.</p>

               <p>Mr. Whitechead. We went to Hudson's house, arriving there about six in the morning. When we told him the cheques were dishonoured he professed to be greatly surprised, but his countenance told me different from that. I do not consider I had made a good bargain in selling the mare for £57 10s.; she was very cheap at the money. Hudson dressed himself and went out with us to Anderson Street, Chelsea, and I told him it was no use his trying to get away as a detective was watching him all the time. He told me Clark lived in a big mansion. We went to Shaftesbury Avenue before we went to Chelsea to a letter call office.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Rentoul. Kent introduced himself as Burton, and told me he was in a big way of business and had got a yard. He said young Clark was going to drive next morning to Brighton, and also that his motor licence had been suspended. I am positive it was Kent told me that. This conversation took place in a lane close to my stable, and Hudson, Kent, and Clark were all present. I asked 60 guiness for the horse, but agreed to take £57 10s., and I consider that was a fair price.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Curtis-Bennett. After the deal was done Hudson wrote down Clark's address in a book of mine, "Mr. J. Clark, 54, Shaftes<lb/>bury Avenue." I have been to 54, which is Gill's Library and letter call office. There are flats over the top, but they are not No.54.</p>

                  </hi>, jun., farmer, Mersham, son of last witness. I was present when my father's horse was sold. Kent met me on Ashford Station platform, and said, "We want to get these horses away to-night, for if Clark gets to London and gets drunk he may stop the cheque and won't want the horses at all." After the cheque for £57 10s. had been written, Burton, I think it was, came to me and asked me for £1, for which he would give me a cheque, as he wanted to give 10s. to our groom. and 10s. to Mr. Whitehead. The cheque wa subsequently sent back as a forgery. Kent wrote the cheque out and Clark signed it and smudged the endorsement is blotting it. Kent then tore it up and said, "That won't do."</p>
               <p>To Mr. Rentoul. I think it was Kent who handed me the cheque but I could not swear. They were altogether, but I think Kent was spokesman. Clark stood by and never opened his lips. Clark did not appear to be accustomed to writing.</p>

                  </hi>, The Green Farm, Shadoxhurst, Kent. Hud<lb/>son is my nephew. I remember Hudson, Kent and Clark coming to see me in July, but I cannot remember the date. My nephew intro<lb/>duced Kent and Clark to me. He told me he had not known Clark very long, but he was a very wealthy man, and that his brother and father were engineers at Battersea, and very wealthy people. He also said Clark had married an American lady, an heiress, and intro<lb/>duced Kent as being a judge of horses, who had come down to look at some horses for him. Kent was introduced as Burton Kent. I hadn't any horse for sale, and I took them to Mr. Tomkin at Ash<lb/>ford. After that I saw them again and told them I had two horses at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100193"/>
               <p>the "Kent Arms." They saw the horses in harness, and eventually bought them. The actual buyer was Kent. In payment for the horses I received a cheque for £80 sterling, signed, "J. Clark and son." They took away the horses that night. I paid the cheque for £80 into my account next day, and also the cheque for £1 which Mr. Tomkin, jun., has spoken about. Both the cheques were sent back as forgeries.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Green. My nephew had done business with me before and had bought persons to me to buy horses. He took no part in this transaction, or in the writing of the cheque. Clark and Burton went into another room to fill in the cheque. My nephew said that Clark was connected with the firm of Clark and Son, engineers, Battersea. I do not recollect whether he mentioned Anderson Street. He said they were pretty wealthy people and had property in the country. He said they were pretty wealthy people and had property in the country. He told me frankly that he hadn't known Clark very long. I could, of course, have kept the horses until the cheque was cleared. My nephew brought no pressure to bear upon me to let the horses go. I never dreamed that Clark was not all right. He looked very nice and was got up smart. He would take anybody down. When Mr. Tomkin and I were in London, my nephew professed to spend several hours in trying to find Clark.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Rentoul. When my nephew told me that Clark was a millionaire or something of that effect, all three prisoners were present. I do not think Kent was away a minute. He examined the horses, and I was with them. He may have strayed away a few yards. Kent's name is given sometimes as Burton and sometimes as Kent, and I understood his name to be Burton Kent. I am a little hard of hearing. It is quite possible I may not have heard all that was said. I think Burton gave me the cheque for the two horses but I would not swear. I believed Clark to be what they said he was; he looked like the son of a rich man. I admit I was thoroughly taken in.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I made no inquiries about Clark at all; I believed my nephew. The transaction was on a Wednesday, and I followed the horses up on Friday night and saw Hudson on the Saturday morning. I went to the police station to try and find out what this Mr. Clark was. Hudson didn't tell me that he knew perfectly well where these horses were.</p>

                  </persName>. On July 27 I arrested Clark. Hudson was with me at the time. We had been to Charing Cross Station to inquire as to the arrival of the horses from Ashford, and afterwards went to Aldridge's. Hudson told me on several occasions that he didn't know where the horse were, and that he knew nothing whatever about them. After I had arrested Clark I went from Vine Street to Walton Street, accompained by Hudson. On the way he asked me if he was in custody, and I said "No." He replied, "Virtually I suppose I am." At the station I told him he would he charged with obtaining these horses, and he said, "Of course I was there."</p>

                  </persName>. On September 6 at four o'clock in the afternoon I went with another police-sergeant and arrested Kent at Kingston. In answer to the charge he said, "I know nothing about the house-breaking. Young Charlie Clark told me his father was a rich man in Dorsetshire. He said he had just come back from Dorset after being rigged out with new clothes. His father was sending him a draft so that he could go to Buenos Ayres, but he said he was not going abroad. He wanted to buy some horses. I intro<lb/>duced him to Hudson, and we all went to Ashford, in Kent, and bought some horses. I only judged them. Hudson 'told' his uncle 'the tale.' I did not know anything about Clark being a millionaire and his father owning half Battersea until I read it in the news<lb/>papers. All I did was to judge the horses and make out the code of the cheque, but Clark signed them. I never gave the black man (Flor) any cheques." Kent was subsequently charged at Walton Street Police Station, and said in reply "All right; I have already said what I have to say about the matter.</p>
               <p>A Juror asked how long it was since Mr. Whitehead had seen his nephew before this transaction.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">WHITEHEAD</hi> said about two or three years.</p>

               <p>In answer to a Juror, Hudson said he had been acquainted with Kent for 12 or 14 years, and formerly they were both in the cab trade.</p>

               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">READ</hi> said there was a small conviction against Hudson for aiding and abetting a fraud, for which he was fined at Highgate Petty Sessions £20 or two months. He at one time held the license of the "Three Tuns" at Greenwich, and was afterwards manager of a public-house in Hertfordshire. Subsequently he be<lb/>came a bookmaker at Greenwich. Kent was at one time a cabman and became a cab proprietor. Suddenly he became a very wealthy man, and was the owner of race horses, but owing to some law pro<lb/>ceedings he became a poor man again, and recently he had been about the West End with men of doubtful character, and how he had got his living was a mystery. With regard to Clark, witness had known him for some years, but not by the name of Clark until he was arrested. He was a chauffeur until about 18 months ago, and now he was known in the West End as the associate of prostitutes and thieves.</p>

               <p>Mr. Rooth (by indulgence of the Court) stated that he had been instructed to apply for restitution of Mr. Tomkin's horse under the Larceny Act. The horse was cold to Chariton for £20, its value being stated at £57, Mr. Tomkin having given £41 for it some months before. The receipt was faked to make it appear that Chariton had given as much as £30 for it when it was afterwards sold to Mr. Ducrow. He happened to know something about Mr. Ducrow and it could not be suggested that he could be mixed up with a parcel of knaves of this sort, and when he pointed that out to those instructing him it was quite clear to them that they could not ask his lordship to arrive at the conclusion that Mr. Ducrow had been party to this chica<lb/>nery. As regards the £10 found on the prisoners he asked that it should be handed ever to Mr. Tomkin.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul understood that he had no power to make such an order.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rooth said that practically these men had been convicted of obtaining a horse by larceny by a trick. Under the 100th section of the recent Act, if one was able to earmark money that had been stolen the Court might order it to be restored. Here the money found on prisoners had been stolen indirectly.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul said he could help Mr. Rooth to this extent, that if the money could be ordered to be refunded it would be to his client.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rooth hoped that publicity might be given to that expression of opinion so that it might come to Mr. Ducrow's ears.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones, for Mr. Ducrow, said the position was this; Mr. Ducrow bought the horse for its full value, and when the matter was first mentioned he said to Mr. Tomkin: "Well, it is an unfortunate transaction, but I am under no obligation. I paid the full price for this horse, which is very faulty. I will make you a present just to help you over your difficulty." Mr. Tomkin was not satisfied with that, and adopted a threatening attitude and demanded the whole amount. Mr. Ducrow, having been put to the expense of being represented here and at the police-court, did not feel inclined to make any allowance whatever.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul observed that the price paid for the horses took away a good deal of sympathy from the men who parted with them. Mr. Tomkin was absolutely in the hands of Mr. Ducrow, who could deal with the matter as he liked; but he (Judge Rentoul) thought that Mr. Ducrow would not care to keep the horse under these circumstances, although it was perfectly clear he was not to blame in the matter.</p>

               <p>Mr. Currtis Bennett asked that five postal orders, amounting in all to £5 12s. migtht be handed to the Commissioners of Police.</p>
               <p>Mr. T.G. Clark claimed the money as being the proceeds of the burglary at his house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curtis Bennett pointed out that Mr. Clark could obtain the money on applica<lb/>tion by summons at Bow Street if he could prove a title to it after the police had get possession of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Read, the watchmaker, asked for restitution of the watch and chain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curtis Bennett sumitted that as Flor had not been convicted of larceny the Court had no power to make an order. It was also for the pawnbroker to prove his title to the goods at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Read said he would willingly redeem the articles for the money advanced by the pawnbroker. The gold chain weighted more than 1 oz.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curtis Bennett intimated that the pawnbroker would accept that.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul said he had no power to make an order, but the pawnbroker, for the sake of his own respectability, would no doubt give it back on receiving what he paid.</p>

                  </hi>, 400, Romford Road. On July 15, at 10.15 p.m., I locked up my house and retired to bed. On going down at six next morning, I found that the back parlour window had been forced and an entry effected, and the room was in disorder. I missed certain articles of jewellery and some money and a postal order. I identify the property produced, said to have been pawned by Mack as part of the property stolen from me.</p>

                  </hi>, assistant to Richard Byrne, pawnbroker, high Street, Plaistow. The diamond ring produced was pawned with me on July 17, by Mack, I advanced him 12s. on it. On july 31 he came and asked for a further advance on the ring; he wanted another 6s. on it; by that time I had ascertained that the ring was stolen. I detained him, and sent for the police, who took him into custody.</p>

                  </persName>, K Division. On July 31 I saw Mack at Plaistow Police Station. I said to him, "A pawn ticket found in your possession relates to a ring which is part of the proceeds of a burglary committed at 400, Romford Road, on the night of July, 15; how did you become possessed of the ticket?" He said, I got the ring from a man in the "Lord Raglan' at Plaistow the day before I pawned it; I gave him 8s. for it; I pawned it the next day for 12s., and told the pawnbroker it was my sister's; I have been on the booze for several days, and cannot remember who I got the ring from."</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">MERCER</hi>, K Division. On August 1, I searched Riches's premises. I found a number of burglar's instruments and several articles connected with recent burglaries. Riches and Mack were both charged together; Mack made no reply; Riches said, "You don't want to bring him into it; I gave him the ring to pawn." Mack said nothing to this.</p>

               <p>Prisoners are systematic bicycle thieves, and altogether about 26 bicycles have been traced to them, of which eleven have been identi<lb/>fied. The bicycles were mostly taken from the neighbourhood of Croydon, and were taken into Essex to be disposed of, prices realised varying from between 30s. and £2 10s. The value of the machines identified is about £70.</p>

Mears were carrying small bundles under their arms. I followed them and saw Gardner hand W. J. Mears his bundle and leave the other two. He was then followed by Police-constable Ray. I followed the two Mears, who looked round at me, threw the bundles to the ground, and ran away towards the forest, where I lost sight of them. The bundles contained two fowls dead, quite warm, which I took to the station, where the prosecutor identified them. At 7.30 I saw w. J. Mears asleep on a seat at Leyton Green. I aroused him and told him I should take him into custody for being concerned with two other men in stealing two fowls. He made no answer to that, but on the way to the station said, I own I was with the others, but I did not have the fowls." It was a voluntary statement. I saw him receive the fowl.</p>

                  </hi>, carter, employed by Mr. Flint, farmer, Dagenham. On Saturday, August 10, I received a horse from Mr. Flint and White<lb/>chapel hay market to bring back to Dagenham Farm. I tied it be<lb/>hind the cart and started to go him. The first call I made on the way home was at the "Denmark," in East Ham. Prisoner Hart asked to have a drink with him, and I did so. He was a stranger to me. I then went to have my dinner at a coffee house near by. I had just pulled my horse round the corner, and was just going to get my dinner when I looked round and saw Hart untying the pony. The other prisoner was standing on the kerb close by. Hart mounted the pony and galloped off. I followed, but could not catch them. The police found the horse, and I went to the East Ham Police Sta<lb/>tion and identified the men from amongst a dozen others. There is not a scrap of truth in the statement made by the prisoners that I offered them a shilling to bring the horse home. I had not a shil<lb/>ling for myself. As to their statement that I wanted them to buy some trusses of hay, I had no hay on the cart.</p>
               <p>To prisoner Cox. I did not give you 1s. to take the horse home. I had only 2s. when I came on to the market. I paid a man 1s. I owed him, and when I saw you I had only 9d. I had nothing at all on the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. On August 10 I was standing outside the "Cock" public-house, High Street, East Ham, at 20 minutes to four in the afternoon. I saw prisoner Cox, whom I have known for over 20 years. He was riding a grey mare with a bridle and disappeared round Wakefield Street. I called out, "Halloa, Coxey, how are you?" and he replied, "Halloa, Bob, how are you? I will see you later on." Prisoner Hart was following close after Cox.</p>

                  </hi>. I remember being outside the "Cock" public-house on the afternoon of August 10. I saw Cox riding a pony; Hart was following close behind. I heard Naylor greet Cox. I have no doubt prisoners are the two men. I had known cox 18 years. Hart I had not known before.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">VANSTONE</hi>, K Division. I arrested Cox on August 10 in the evening. I met him riding in the Barking Road, Plaistow, and said, "Is your name Henry Cox?" He said "Yes." I said, "Yes answer the description of a man wanted for stealing a horse at East Ham this afternoon." He replied, "You have made the biggest mis<lb/>take of your life. I have not been at East Ham to-day. I can answer where I have been all day. I have been in the "Castle" since out o'clocl—about seven hours. You have made a big mistake this time. I do not know anything about it." I conveyed him to the East Ham Police Station. When I told him he would be charged with stealing the horse and bridle he made no reply. On the way to the cells he said to me, "I admit I was there. The other man asked me to have a ride. I got up and rode away. After going a little way I pulled up and gave it to the other man. I do not know his name or where he lives. The countryman gave the other man a tanner to lead it as it was afraid of the tram." I found the horse turned out without bridle or anything upon the marshes. I was present when prisoner Hart was charged on August 31. I told him he would be charged with being concerned with Cox in stealing this horse on the 10th. He replied, "The countryman gave me 1s. to ride it. I rode it down the road, and when I got it round the corner Cox took it away and jumped on its back and said, 'I will see you at Mr. Meech's'. I have not seen the horse or. Cox since. The countryman wanted me to bay six trusses of hay at 1s. 6d. per ton."</p>

"You answer the descripion of a man wanted for horse-stealing on the 10. You even answer the description to the red socks. You will have to come to the police station with me." I went to catch held of his wrist, and he struck me a violent blow in the face and struggled to get away. We got him to the police station yard, and he was after<lb/>wards conveyed to East Ham by Vanstone and myself. He struggled all the way to the station.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Cox, in defence, said he saw prisoner Hart and the countryman having transactions together, and thought it was all right. Doe said he would give Hart 1s. to take it along because it was afraid of the trames, so he got on its back and had a ride. Hart said he would give him (Cox) 6d. to lead it along, and said, "Will you have a ride?" so he got on its back and rode it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Clarke Hall, prosecuting, said he felt a difficulty in this case. The girl was only eleven years of age, and before the magistrate was carefully examined with a view to her giving evidence, and it was specifically set out in the depositions that in their opinion she was not able to undersand and the nature of an oath. They thereupon took her deposition not on oath, under the statute, but appeared to have overlooked the fact that under those circumstance there could be no case unless the girl was corroborated, and unfortunately, there was no corroboration whatever. Unless his lordship should think dif<lb/>fervently from the magistrates that the girl's evidence could be taken on oath, he could not proceed with the case.</p>

Constable Button went round to the back and I went to the front door and knocked. I heard a scuffs. When I was admitted I found Burder detained by Button. I told him he would be charged with a man in custody with stealing fowls that morning. He replied, "You will have to prove it. I shall not go. Where is your warrant?" He was taken to Walthamstow Police Station and charged, and in reply said, "You have made a mistake." There was a feather on his cot near the top button.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. The fowls were in the charge room three or four yards from you. It is, of course, possible for feathers from fresh-killed fowls to be flying about, but I did not see any. There were feathers on the ground near the dead fowls.</p>

I leaped over the fence and caught him in the house. I told him I should arrest him as being concerned with another man in stealing fowls. His trousers were saturated with water, there was a feather sticking to his button, and fresh grass on his shoes. The feather was on his coat before he went to the police station.</p>

A cream jug and sugar basin were part of the missing property.</p>

                  </persName>, Walthamatow. At 6.30 on the even<lb/>ing of August 25 I saw prisoner Burder at Forest Gate Police Sta<lb/>tion, and cautioned him. I said to him, 'I want to examine the pair of socks that you're wearing, as they answer the description of those stolen from 4, Warwick Road, Chingford, on August 13." He said, "I have had them in my possession three weeks. I bought them in Petticoat Lane." I afterwards showed them to Mr. Spary, who iden<lb/>tified them as his property. I told Burder he would be charged with stealing a quantity of silver-plated goods, socks, and other clothing on August 13. He replied, "I do not know anything about it." In the evening I went to 90, Gladstone Road, Walthamatow, where Burder lives, and in the kitchen under the table found a paid of ladies' shoes. In a drawer in the dresser I found two pairs of black</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100204"/>
               <p>stockings. In a drawer in the bedroom I found two pairs of brown seeks exactly resembling those that were left behind. I afterwards saw Burder and told him what I had found. He made no reply. On April 25, at eight o'clock, as I was leaving Burder's address, prisoner Johns walked in. I knew him quite well, and said, "Halloa, Johns, what do you want here?" He said, "I have come to see the missis." On the following day I saw him meet Mrs. Burder in Markhouse Road, just after Mrs. Burder had left the Police Court. I followed her to her address, and shortly afterwards Johns came in. I was there with Sergeant Phipps. I asked him to stay outside a few minutes. Mrs. Burder said, "I am mistress of this house, and he will go out when I tell him to go." When I searched Johns at the station on August 26 he said, "Do not think I have anything upon me; like the other 'cam.'" A "cam" I take to be a fool. "Just fancy him wearing those socks. He must have been a fool."</p>

He replied, "I pawned nothing. I can prove where I was that night." On the way to the station he said, "You could not take me if I did not like to go. There is one thing, I am a thief and a good-hearted one, and when I get a 'bob' I share it amongst my pals." At 9.30 the next morning he was placed amongst the thirteen men and identified without hesitation by Mr. George.</p>

                  </hi>, groundman, employed by the Notting Hill Gun Club. About 10 o'clock in the evening of August 6 I saw my horse in a field. Next morning it was not there. I next saw in at West Ham Police Station and identified it. Its tail had been docked and the mane pulled practically all out. The tail might have been done with a knife or chopped off somehow. I should say it had not been done by a professional.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The object of docking the horse would be to alter its appearance. There is not the slightest doubt about it being my house.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERTSON</hi>, K Division. On August 26 I had a conversation with prisoner, and said to him, "I want to see a horse you have in a stable at Weston Street." I accompanied him to the stable and saw the horse, and asked him where he got it from. He said, "I bought a piebald pony at Stapleton's on August 8 for £4 15s. Three men followed me home to this stable, and when they got here they wanted to have a deal with me. I 'chopped' the pie<lb/>bald, giving a metal watch and £3 10s. in silver for this cob." I asked him, "Do you know the men?" He replied, "I do not know the men or anything about them. I believe I have seen them at Stepleton's or at Hammer's and I believe I should know them again." I noticed that the tail of the horse had been recently docked and there was congealed blood adhering to the end of the tail. The flesh had actually been cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There was no attempt at concealment.</p>
               <p>Constable <hi rend="smallCaps">DRIVER</hi>, 322, K Division. I arrested prisoner at five a.m. on August 20. I saw him leading a dark bay cob out of the stable in Weston Street. I was about 30 yards from him. I shouted, "Where are you going to take that?" He said, "That is all right." I ran after him and said to him again, "Where are you going to take that horse?" He said, "Out for exercise; it is lame." I said, "It does not appear very lame." He said, "I am just going to run it up and down." I said, "What are you going to do with that sack on your back?" (containing horse mixture). He said, "I am going to give it a feed on the way." I said I had reason to believe the horse was stolen and took him into custody for unlawful possession. He said, "I have got a receipt for it. I paid £4 10s. and exchange a piebald pony and a watch and chain, and have the receipt in my pocket." I told him I should take him into custody. He replied, I did not think you was going to watch the place all night." I took him to the station, where he was charged with unlawful possession. I was present at the police court on August 27, when he was further charged with stealing and receiving the horse. He made no reply. The receipt was produced and attached to the depositions.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On August 8 I bought a piebald pony at Stepleton's Repository, Commercial Street Spital<lb/>fields,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100206"/>
               <p>and gave £4 15s. for it. When I reached my stables at Weston Street with the prebald, some men drove up with the bay cob in question. I had seen the men at the repository and knew their faces. Stapleton's also have a repository in Edgware Road and near the Elephant and Castle. I had had no dealings with the men before. When they drove up one of them asked me if I would buy the cob, and I replied that I had just bought one and did not want two. I looked at the one he was driving, and he asked me how much I would give in exchange for the pony I had bought, which was a very small one. He said he would take a £5 note to chop. I said I had only £4 altogether and talked about £3, and eventually we came to £4 10s. He was not satisfied with that, so I gave him a little watch and chain I was wearing belonging to my son. I asked him for a re<lb/>ceipt, and he gave me the receipt produced. He said he would bring the watch and chain back, and then I could give him half a sovereign. He put the piebald into the cart and drove away with it. When the police came on August 19 I took them to the stable and showed them the cob. There were four or five detective came. With regard to Robertson's evidence, the horse was a bit lame when I took it out on the Saturday (August 10), so I thought I would give it a day's rest on the Sunday and I took it out for exercise up and down the street. I had a bit of food in a sack on my shoulder which I was going to give it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I noticed that the horse had had its tail docked, and I bought some veseline to put on it. I often buy horses with docked tails. I was asked for the receipt when I was charged. I had it in my pocket with perhaps a dozen others. I did not get a receipt for the piebald pony. They do not give receipts at the hammer. I did not notice that the cob had been docked until I saw him rub his tail, and then I looked and saw the sore place. I thought the mane had been pulled, but did not ask any question about that.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I made a statement at the police court about having bought a piebald pony, and the police have had every opportunity of making inquiries. Books are kept at the repository.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERTSON</hi>, recalled. I have made inquiries at Stapleton's Repository, Commercial Road, and I find prisoner bought a skewbald pony for £4 15s. on August 8. The receipt given to pri<lb/>soner is signed in the name of Sampson, who is not known at the Repository.</p>

                  </hi>, 109, Romford Road, grocer. In 1901 I was as these premises, where I had a cellar flap outside, which had a small hole in it just big enough to get two or three fingers in to pull it up. It had been used for two or three years like that, and nobody had fallen over it, nor complained of it. On November 28, 1901, prisoner came into my shop with another man and made a small purchase. Imme<lb/>diately after he had left he returned limping, saying he had caught his toe in my trap and had hurt his knee. I thought it strange he should get his toe in such a small hole. He said he was afraid it had hurt him a good deal, so I asked him to come in and sit down. It was his right leg which appeared to be hurt. He said be lived at Matthew's Park Avenue, Stratford, which is about 10 minutes' walk from me. I got him a cab, which he went off in. The card (pro<lb/>duced) he gave me at some time. I am not sure when: "Mr. Rose, commission agent, 43, Matthew's Park Avenue." On the next day I went to see him there, and found him sitting with his leg on another chair, and he appeared to have been bathing it. He knew I was coming, as previously his wife had called at my shop and made I was coming, as previously his wife had called at my shop and made an appointment. I asked him how his leg was. He said, "It is very queer; it seems to me very sore and bad." I stayed with him some time. After that I called two or three times. On about the third visit prisoner said, "Well, Mr. Smith, it looks to me as if this will be a long job." "Oh!" I said, "it don't look to me as if the knee is very bad. I cannot see much the matter with it." He said it was a great loss to him, that he sometimes earned a good deal of money, and led me to suppose he could earn £5 easily some day, an<lb/>other time perhaps nothing. I asked him what compensation he thought he would require. He said he thought about £25. I told him I would not give it, on which I left him. I found out Dr. Gal<lb/>braith was his doctor. I forgot who told me. I do not think pri<lb/>soner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100208"/>
               <p>did. I went to see Dr. Galbraith, and told prisoner I had been. Finally, after consulting two or three friends, I agreed to pay him £15 on December 4, 1901. Receipt (produced) was signed by pri<lb/>soner in the name of Henry Rose. When I paid the money, in my conscience I did not think the accident was a very genuine one. I did not think he had injured himself, but I thought this was the best way out of it, paying £15 instead of going to law.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Groceries and odds and ends go down my cellar trap. The continual traffic might have worn it away. I do not think it was defective. I did write in the receipt, "Owing to defect in the cellar flap." It was a very small defect. Mr. Rose Dictated the receipt to me. I put a new cellar trap in after this; I did not want anyone else catching their toe in it. There have been no other acci<lb/>dents. The affair has rankled in my mind a little bit. I do not know whether there was anything the matter with prisoner's leg; it did not look very bad. I swear that I did not send prisoner to Dr. Galbraith; I did not know the latter untill I went to him about this matter. He told me it was not a very serious case; that prisoner would be out in a few days. He did not say what was the matter with the knee. It was after I saw the doctor that I paid prisoner £15.</p>

                  </hi>, 325, Barking Road, Plaistow, hosier. On December 27, 1901, I remember prisoner coming into my shop, with a lady—his wife, I understood. They made a small purchase and went out, returning in a second or two, the man limping with his right leg. He said he had fallen over the mat in the lobby, which had just been repaired, one part being a little higher than the other. Prisoner came into the room behind the shop, pulled his trousers up, and showed me a large knee discoloured. His wife then bathed it, and prisoner afterwards went to Doctor Beadle; I am not sure whether in a cab or not. He came back sson after. Card (pro<lb/>duced) is similar to one he gave me. I next had a letter from pri<lb/>soner, and went to see him. I found him sitting in the front room with his right leg resting on a chair. This was about a week after the accident. He told me he was a commission agent earning £4 to £6 a week, and that he thought he would be laid up for six or seven weeks. I told him I did not think it would be that time, and could not understand how he could have fallen so heavily as to hurt his leg so much. I went afterwards with the intention of settling as far as I could, after seeing a solicitor, who told me, "If it could be settled for anything under £20 do so." I took two receipts with me when calling on prisoner, one for £12 and the other for £15. Pri<lb/>soner accepted £12. I have lost the receipt. It was signed, H. Rose. I did not believe the accident was genuine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Some weeks after the accident I removed the mat, because my wife kept on at me about it. The mat was not necessarily defective. We did not want another accident. It was my own soli<lb/>citor whom I consulted. I did not see Dr. Beadle, and I swear that I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100209"/>
               <p>do not know him. I did say at the police court that I knew the doctor who attended prisoner (Dr. Beadle). He lives in the same road; I know him by sight. I have hurt my knee myself, but have not had to lay up.</p>

                  </hi>, Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation, Limited, Third Parties Claim Department. It is my business to in<lb/>vestigate claims in respect to third parties' accidents. The London Exhibitions Company in 1902 had a third party policy with us; they were conducting Earl's Court Exhibition. In May of that your a claim against them by Henry Road was referred to us, which in turn was handed over to Dr. Benthal, the doctor acting for us, who had authority to settle it. The receipt produced for £35 was giben by prisoner on May 14 in settlement of his claim, which receipt we re<lb/>ceived from Dr. Benthal. The claimant's doctor's fees were also paid. In 1903 Mr. George Alexander, Lassee of St. James's Theatre, had a police with us, and a claim was made against him by Henry Rose. Letter produced is from him to Mr. Hemsley, Mr. Alexander's secre<lb/>tary. In it Rose says that as he was leaving the pit of the theatre his foot caught in some loose carpeting, which caused him to fall, severely striking his right knee against the wall, and that he was taken to St. George's Hospital, where he was told that he had severely sprained his knee-cap. The letter was sent on to us by Mr. Hemsley, followed by another from Rose, saying that his leg was still painful and enclosing doctor's certificate. (Certificate produced). Through Dr. Benthal we paid the man £45. (Receipt produced.) I did not know at the time that this was the same man as in the last case. In October of the same year another claim was made by this man, Henry Rose, this time against Crisp and Co., Seven Sisters Road. Letter of October 27 (produced) purports to come from Ada Rose: "With re<lb/>ference to the accident that occurred to my husband on Friday even<lb/>ing last at your shop, I regret to have to let you know that the doctor has explained that my husband has torn some ligaments in his knee and has advised him to have complete rest. It appears it will be some weeks before he will be able to put any strain upon it. I have enclosed doctor's certificate." (Certificate of Dr. Sullivan produced.) There is also another letter to Crisp and Co., November 4, written by Rose, in which he says he will be laid up for five or six weeks, as his knee is considerably swollen, and that his business is at a standstill. Another doctor's certificate was enclosed, which is produced. When these documents were forwarded to us I recollected the previous claim against Mr. George Alexander and had the papers looked up, when I came across the case also of the London Exhibitions. After com<lb/>paring the handwritings, I came to the conclusion that they were the same in the three cases, including the letter signed "Ada Rose." Another letter is produced, November 11, Rose to the manager of Crisp and Co., saying that he held the firm responsible for the acci<lb/>dent, and suggesting that their representative should pay him a visit. On December 2 Rose wrote again, saying that if Crisp and Co. would allow him a little towards expenses the matter would be at an end.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100210"/>
               <p>Dr. Benthal was again instructed to see prisoner, but no comensa<lb/>tion was pay him and no more was heard of the claim. On April 17 this year I was at Stratford Police Court on business, when I met several people connected with the prisoner's different claims, with whom I had a conversation. The prisoner himself was there, and my solicitor also. Afterwards my solicitor and Mr. Bagshaw went to West Ham Police Court, the prisoner meanwhile disappeared, and I did not see him again till he was arrested in July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I heard that prisoner had gone to Teignmouth to carry on business there. In regard to the accident at Earl's Court, I had a report that prisoner fell over a defective valve cover in the grounds. Dr. Benthal certified in that case and the case of St. James Theatre, that prisoner's knee was injured. (Dr. Benthal's reports of Earl's Court and St. James Theatre cases were read.) I have not seen the reports for five years. The ocean Company often pay without having any liability. There was apparently an injury in prisoner's cases; we have many cases of a doubtful nature. In those days I paid practically no attention to the injury at all; the only thing we considered were the wishes of our assured that they were not to be troubled.</p>

                  </persName>. In 1902 and 1903 I was medical superin<lb/>tendent for the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation. In May, 1902, in consequence of instruction, I called at 43, Matthew's Park Avenue, saw prisoner (under the name of Henry Rose), and examined his right knee, which was in a condition of acutely inflamed syno<lb/>vitis, commonly called water on the knee. This might be caused by a fall or blow. You may have merely synovitis and nothing else, or you may have a loose cartilage, and you cannot detect it. It will be permanent unless it is taken out. With a knee like that, a slight blow will bring about the condition. There is chronic liability to trouble in the knee. It would be impossible for a doctor to tell whether such a condition was brought about by a recent acci<lb/>dent or was of long standing. I do not remember any conversation. I had with prisoner; his doctor told me all about it. I had power from the insurance company to settle if I thought the medical aspect was bona-fide; I had not to think of liability. I thought there was a genuine injury in this case; and I settled it. I cannot remember the negotiations, but it was thrashed down to £35, and £5 for his doctor. My report on the case was made at the time. About a year afterwards I again visited prisoner at the same address, but he was out. I received the following letter from him: "Sorry that you have had inconvenience when calling upon me to-day. As I have been in the house nearly two weeks, and being so giddy, my doctor thought it would do me good to take a drive, as my leg is in a plaster splint. Shall be pleased to see you on Tues day next." He called on me at Tavistock Square, coming in a cab, and I examined him. The</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100211"/>
               <p>same of his doctor at that time was Parsons. (Witness's report in the Alexander case was read.) I settled that case for £45, giving pri<lb/>soner a cheque, for which he signed receipt in my presence. I thought it was a genuine accident. I did not recognise prisoner as the man whom I saw a year before. I have a large number of these claims to deal with. In November the same year I received instruc<lb/>tions for the third time to visit prisoner, which I did, and made the report produced of November 26. Prisoner had a bruise on the right knee, but no synovitis. He said his doctor was named Sullivan. I recognised prisoner this time as the man I had seen before, and asked him why he had had three different doctor. I do not remember whether he replied. No compensation was paid. He did not tell me that he had had previous accidents.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I only act now as consultant to the Ocean Com<lb/>pany. I had acted for seven years in the other capacity. The soli<lb/>citers went into the liability question; then sent the case to me to deal with the medical aspect. Dr. Vause, who attended prisoner in the Earl's court cases, was an old friend of mine. I agreed with his opinion of the case. I thought the injury a permanent one, subject to an operation, which of late years has been a very successful one. Is the case at Crisp's I recommended the company to make inquiries and consider the previous injuries and the question of negligence. Assuming prisoner had not had any injuries before this case, I should have compensated him. If a person has an injured knee an insurance company will not take the risk, of it again, it is no liable to become inframed. A person of prisoner's weight may he likely to fall fre<lb/>quently.</p>

                  </hi>, manager to S. Cavander and Co., 65 and 67, Great Eastern Street. On January 29 this year, about seven o'clock, I received certain information from one of our men. Two or three days later a lady called who gave the name of Mrs. Britten. In con<lb/>sequence of that visit I went to 11, Alfred Street, Bow, where I saw the prisoner in bed. He told me that as he was coming round the carner of Great Eastern Street with his wife he saw a tram pass and went to catch it, when he caught his foot in a hole in our cellar light. He said he was taken over to the doctor's opposite the factory—Dr. White, I think. We have several glass cellar lights outside the place; one had a hole knocked out of it, but a piece of wood had been put in. After the accident I saw the piece of wood was out. The hole was about 3 1/2 inches in size. I went to see prisoner again to settle as to the compensation. I told him we did not admit liability. He told me he earned about £7 a week, and that his doctor had told him he would be laid up for seven or eight weeks. He said he would put the matter into his solicitor's hands. I thought it would be a good get out if I paid him £40 or £50, so I paid him £45 on February 18, for which I got the receipt (produced), signed B. H. Britten. I believed at the time that it was a genuine acci<lb/>dent.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100212"/>

After the accident a boy said he had felt a piece of wood fly out and strike him, and that he pulled prisoner's foot out of the hole. I examined pri<lb/>soner's leg when I saw him in bed. I did not advise prisoner to go to Dr. White. It was in consequence of what our specialist, Dr. Hope Grant, who saw prisoner, said that I paid the £45.</p>

                  </hi>, director of William Reddan and son, Limited, 41 and 42, Greek Street, Soho. these premises are shut at night with large iron shutters. In process of shutting them there is a chain which is pulled out on the pavement and lied there to a dis<lb/>tance of two or three yards. This has been in operation for about 40 years and no accident had happened till February 17, 1903, on which day, just before eight in the evening, I noticed a small crowd of children outside the shop. I went to the door and saw prisoner and his wife. The former said, "I have had an accident outside your place here with these chains." He said it was his right leg, and as he seemed to be in pain I asked him to come inside and sit down, which he did, with his wife. He pulled up his trousers and I looked at his knee, which looked slightly bruised. I had it bathed and bound up. He gave me his card—H. Rose, one like that (pro<lb/>duced)—and I sent for a cab, which he walked towards, and after going about six yards he seemed in a fainting condition. I put a chair under him and he sat down again. I then sent for a doctor, whose name I do not remember. When he came he said prisoner had evidently strained the ligaments of the leg. It was bound up and prisoner went home in a cab. Before he went he said this was a very bad job for him. Next day I went to Matthew's Park Avenue, and saw prisoner's wife. On another occasion, March 13, I saw prisoner in his house, with his leg resting on a special hassock which had been sent him by Mr. Reddan. Prisoner said he was getting better slowly, but it was a long job and he should like the affair settled up. I said we were anxious to do what was right and asked him what he thought he was entiled to. He said he was earning about £7 a week and mentioned the sum of £80. I told him that was too much, and offered him £20, at which he seemed to grow worse all at once, as if he was going to faint. At last he accepted £40, after declining it and waiting till I had left the room, when he called me back. I paid £40 by cheque, for which he signed receipt (pro<lb/>duced). I believed then that it was a genuine accident. Prisoner never mentioned what doctor he has seen. On April 17 last I was at the Stratford Police Court, when I recognized prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not deny the liability for the accident. We called in out own doctor to prisoner, who did not demur. ap<lb/>parently he was injured; we had no means of knowing that he was not. Our doctor advised him to go home and rest and see his own doctor.</p>

                  </hi>, 44, Woodgrange Road, Forest Gate, confectioner. On November 24, 1903, prisoner came into my shop. when I saw him he was sitting in a chair, and said he had fallen over my trap four outside—one of the hinges of which had a screw loose—and had hurt his right leg. One of the young ladies bathes his leg, and I sympothised with him. His knee appeared to be swollen. I sent for Dr. Miller, who advised me to get him home and gave me some lotion. Prisoner gave his name as Rose, and address Matthew's Park Avenue. His wife was with him on the first occasion I went home with them in a cab. When we got there prisoner talked about compensation and suggested my paying £50. I said I should do no such thing. He then said £40, but I said "No." After seeing him three or four times I agreed to £10, which I paid him in two sums of £5, and received receipt (produced) on December 19. Dr. Miller would not charge me for the attendance. In addition I gave prisoner £5 worth of goods. I thought he had had a genuine accident. The next time I saw prisoner was on April 17 this year at Stratford Police Court, when I asked him how his poor knee was but he did not ap<lb/>pear to know me. Eventually he did, and said his poor knee was better. I saw other people there who knew prisoner. The same day I went before Mr. Gillespie at West Ham Police Court and swore Information against prisoner, on which a warrant was granted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not remember that prisoner demurred to seeing Dr. Miller. The latter called on prisoner several times, but I believe prisoner was never at home on those occasions. When I called he was always in bed; I called by appointment.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BENTHAL</hi>. recalled. I should think it would usually be a very painful thing to fall on a knee such as prisoner had.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk to Mr. Macpherson, solicitor to Watney, Combe, Reid, and Co., Limited. In February, 1904, the letter pro<lb/>duced, from H. Rose to Watney, Combe, and Co., was handed to us by the latter, in which it was stated prisoner had caught his foot in a hook in a rope lying on the pathway outside the "Swan" at Strait-ford, which rope belonged to Watney and Co., that he had been taken to West Ham Hospital, and would be unable to attend to business for some time. I made inquiries into the matter, but could not find anyone who had witnessed the accident. On February 10 we received another letter from Rose, enclosing hospital certificate, and saying his knee had been put in a splint, also asking us to attend to the mat<lb/>ter. (Certificate and letter produced.) On the next day I went to see prisoner at Matthew's Park Avenue. He was sitting with one leg necked up on a chair. We had a talk about the accident. He said he carned £7 to £8 a week. I asked him if he had any books. He said he had none, that he made his money by attending suctions, etc. He said he might have, or had got, water on the knee. He wanted £50. I told him I would see what our people said. About two days later I called again and paid him £45 in notes. (Receipt produced) He never mentioned having hurt his knee before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I have a large number of these accidents to deal with—something like 50 a year. Holness was the drayman who took prisoner to the hospital. I thought we could not successfully resist prisoner's claim, whatever the merits might have been.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The 50 cases a year refer to accidents like this one—falling over a rope.</p>

                  </hi>. I was inspector of claims on behalf of the Scottish Employers' Liability Company, now amalgamated with the London and Lancashire office. In February, 1904, Meux and Co., who had an accident policy with us, had a claim by a man named Rose, a letter from whom was sent on to us: "Gentlemen,—Un doubted your drayman has notified you of the accident that oc<lb/>curred to me on Tuesday. When leaving the "Greyhound Hotel," at sydenham, my foot was caught in the hook of the rope lying on the pathway which drew me to the ground, severely brusing my knee. In consequence I am under the care of the doctor, who says the kneecap is severely wrenched and fears it will be some time before I can get about again. As I am unable to attend to my business, I think it right to call your attention to the same." A day or two afterwards I visited prisoner at 3, Matthew's Park Avenue. I asked him if he had ever met with a similar accident. He said, "No." I then made inquiries, in consequence of which we wrote him the fol<lb/>lowing letter: "Without prejudice we have now fully investigated the circumstances of the alleged accident at the 'Greyhound,' and we have no alternative but to deny all liability on our assured's behalf. We think it right to inform you that, notwithstanding your statement to our representative that you had never previously had a claim, full particulars are now before us of your previous claims for damages to your right knee." We never paid him anything and did not hear any more of the matter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We had it in a report that the prisoner did fall. I was not told so. When I swore at the police court that I was told by Messrs. Meux that their man picked prisoner up I had just heard the report read. The drayman said he did not see the acci<lb/>dent. He had his back to it. I have not the report here.</p>

                  </hi>, 19, Woodgrange Road, Forest Gate, hosier. I have a branch at 751, Romford Road, Manor Park, from where on November 2, 1904, my manager communicated with me, in conse<lb/>quence of which I went to 43, Matthew's Park Avenue, where I saw prisoner, who said he had met with an accident through falling over my dirmat at 751, Romford Road and had hurt his knee very much; showing me same. He subsequently asked for compensation, and on November 11 I pain him £30 (receipt produced). I believed him at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My mat was old, but not defective. I believe it was taken away afterwards. There was a doctor next door, Dr. Coll<lb/>yer, and my manager took prisoner in to him. The doctor said pri<lb/>soner had a very bad knee.</p>

                  </hi>, 473, Romford Road, post office and gorcer's shop. On April 14, 1905, prisoner came to my shop with his wife; he was limping with one leg; I am not sure which. He said he had fallen ever my cellar-flap and hurt his knee. After the accident it looked so though someone had pulled up some iron hooping. It was all right previously. I afterwards received a letter from prisoner, which I gave to Mr. Maynard, a friend, who paid prisoner £6 and brought me back the receipt produced. Mr. Maynard later gave me £1, which he had received back from prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There war an iron bar across the flap, which had been nailed down; after the accident it had been pulled up. I sent prisoner to my own doctor, Dr. Vanse, who said he had attended the some knee when the prisoner fell at Earl's Court Exhibition. The doctor did not say anything about a fresh injury. I did not ask him. I saw prisoner's knee when he was at my house; it was swollen. I think I said at the police court that the iron hoop had been picked up.</p>

                  </persName>, 479, Commercial Road. On October 5, 1905, I saw prisoner in my husband's shop as above, sitting on a chair, and his wife beside him, bathing his right knee. He said he had fallen ever an advertisement board outside to shop. Later on he wrote asking from compensation. My husband went to prisoner's house, and eventually paid him £15. (Receipt produced, October 20.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I sent for a neighbouring doctor, not my own. One of the hooks of the advertisement board was off. Occasionally the children would unhook the board and let it fall. Prisoner said it was lying in front of the doorway, but it could not have been.</p>

On October 21 I got some information from my manager, Cochran, in consequence of which I went to 11, Alfred Street, Bow, and saw prisoner, who called himself Britted. We have a pavement light outside the premises, which had a slight defect. Two pieces of wood had been put in place of glass broken, about four inches square. Prisoner was sitting on a chair with his leg resting on a hassock. He said he had fallen over a piece of wood in the skylight, and had hurt his right knee. His knee was ex<lb/>amined by Dr. Cohen, prisoner's doctor, in my presence. The ques<lb/>tion of compensation was discussed, and on November 28 I paid him £33.

                  </persName>, K Division. On April 17 I went with a warrant to 11, Alfred Street, Bow, but could not find prisoner. After inquiries I found him at Teignmouth, Devonshire, on July 23. I told him the charge; he said, "All right, Mr. Brown, Mr. Bagshaw gave me the £10; I did not demand it, it was given to me. He was brought to London and charged. He said, "I never obtained a penny by false pretences."</p>
               <p>The three last counts in the indictment were not proceeded with.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100216"/>
               <p>Mr. Abinger submitted that there was no evidence that prisoner had falenty alleged he had fallen and received certain injury, nor that he was healthy up to the time of the accidents.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant ruled that there was plenty of evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abinger then submitted that the indictment disclosed no offence, nor did the evidence; that the whole of the evidence went to show that in each case the sum<lb/>met with an accident, and in each case the person who compensated him admitted a defect; therefore there was a liability in common law which the prosecution mean negative. The whole thing narrowed itself down to this: That if there was an accident there was no case, if there was not an accident there was a case. No witness had been called to say that the man deliberately fell.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant: It is for the jury to form their own impression.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abinger said he had searched carefully in the law books for a report of a case such as this.</p>
               <p>This Common Serjeant: The law books only report disputed cases, where there is something for the judge to consider.</p>

               <p>It was stated that prisoner had been getting his living but these bogus accidents for the last eight or nine years. The way the prose<lb/>cution came about was that in April a brother of prisoner was being prosecuted at Stratford for a similar series of offences, and on being let out on bail had disappeared. Prisoner came to the court to ex<lb/>plain that his brother had committed suicide, when in fact he had gone to the United States. The witnesses in the case then recog<lb/>nised prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>, Folly Farm, Folly Lane, Chingford. I had a bay mare at grass on July 11 in a field opposite my house. On the morning of the 12th, at 4.30, the mare was not there. It was daylight then. I hunted all round the field, and not finding it reported it missing. A chestnut gelding belonging to Mr. Richard Keen was also missing. On August 3 I went to Dorking, where I saw the chestnut gelding in Luck's van. Luck himself was driving the horse. I waited about two hours to see if I could see the other one. I afterwards spoke to Luck as he was coming out of a police-house, and asked him where the mare was. I said to him, "You had two horses down here on July 12?" He said, "Yes." I said, "I have seen one of the horses in your van this afternoon. Can you tell me where the other one is?" He wanted to know who I was and I told him that the two horses which came down on the 12th were stolen, and I was the owner. After I had satisfied him as to who I was he told me he had sold it to a baker company. I asked him if it was anywhere in the town, and he said, "No; it is at Bromley, in Kent." He told me he had sold the mare for £35, and that a man named Smith had sold the animals to him. He said he did not know Smith's address just then, but he could find him, and that he had given £9 for the mare and gelding and two ponies in exchange. On August 4 I went to Bromley with Detective-sergeant Phipps and Mr. Keen and identified the mare. I had no doubt about her whatever. After that we went to Dorking, where Mr. Keen identified his horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Reen's was a striking-looking horse, easily re<lb/>cognisable. When I first saw it at Dorking it was being driven in a baker's van with Luck's name upon it. The police had ascertained that two horses were consigned from London Bridge to Dorking on July 12. Luck made no concealment about it. The first I knew of the whereabouts of my horse was from information given me by Luck himself. I do not suggest that he refused to give me Smith's address. Luck offered to go to the police station with me. There was nothing the matter with the horse when I lost it.</p>

I have sons allotment ground near Folly Lane, but I cannot see Mr. Brown's field from those allotments, as it runs rather low there. On the even<lb/>ing of July 11 I was engaged on my allotment from half past six till nine. Three men passed who struck my attention, because every time I looked to they were looking towards me, and they bring strangers I thought it rather suspicions. They were going towards Mr. Brown's farm. One was carrying a braided affair which looked very much like a halter. I watched them till they were out or sight. On the morning of the 14th Mr. Brown came and told me of his loss. On August 9, at Stoke Newington Station, out of about 20 men, I picked out Friend as one of the men I saw pass my ground I have no doubt he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>, 15, Russell Road, Dorking, railway porter. I remember two horses arriving at Dorking Station in the middle of July, at 11.53 a.m., consigned from London Bridge by train leaving at 10.38. Luck, who had been waiting in front of the station, paid for their carriage. I saw prisoner Friend there. He asked me where Mr. Luck was as I was uncoupling the horse box. I told him he had gone into the booking office to sign for the horses, and as I looked up I saw him coming down the platform. Luck and Friend led the horses away. On August 8 I identified Friend at Dorking Police Station.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have been at Dorking Station about 14 years and have known Luck for a good many years as an honest, straight-forward tradesman. I know he keeps three or four horses and west, which he uses is his business as a master baker.</p>

                  </hi>, Cat for, managing director of the Brosley Co-operative Society. I first met Luck in January last in connection with buying a horse which he advertised for sale. On July 19 I re<lb/>ceived a letter from him offering "A good, useful vanner, quiet in every way, six years old. If your committee is looking for a good, genuine animal they will do well to see this. Price 35 guiness." The matter was placed before the committee of my society, and I was deputed, in conjunction with our horsekeeper, to go and see this horse, and we went to Luck's residence in Pixham Lane. He asked 60 as for two horses, and ultimately I decided to give him £35 for the brown mare and offered him £25 for the gelding. I made out a re<lb/>ceipt, at Mr. Luck's request, as follows: "Received of Mr. L. W. Fooks the sum of £3 as part payment of bay mare for the Bromley Co-operative Society." I stamped it and got Luck to sign it. Subse<lb/>quently he was notified to send the other horse on for trial for a few weeks, but he informed us that he had loaned it to his Geomenry officer for a fornight. It did not strike me to ask Luck where he got either of these horses. I was at his place early in January last, and I said to him, "Our society is frequently in the habit of buying horses of good character, and any time you know of a good one let us know." He said his brother was a farmer, that he bred horses,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100219"/>
               <p>and brought them in for sale, so we presumed when we received this letter it might have been a horse which his brother had broken in. After I had bought the horse I said to Luck, "Is this from your brother's farm?" and he said "Yes."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not mention about the brother's farm at the police court, as the clerk only gave me set questions. I only re<lb/>collected it yesterday. The detective asked me whether Luck had told me that he had a brother who was a farmer. When Luck was at Faltham Cross he asked me whether I could become bail for him for £100. I said "No; I won't become surety for you. Your brother is a farmer, why not appeal to him?"</p>

                  </persName>, Walthamstow. On July 12 I received information concerning this case. In company with Keen and Brown, I went to the Bromley Co-operative Society's stables on August 4, where Brown identified the bay mare. We then went to Dorking, where I met the prisoner Luck in the WaLtham, a small open<lb/>ing in the Dorking High Road. I told him I was a police officer and was making inquiries about two horses stolen from Chingford on July 10, one of which he had sold to the Co-operative Society for £35. I said I believed he had the other one in his possession. He said "Yes" and invited me to his home in Pixham Lane. In the stablewe saw the bay gelding. After I had cautioned him he said, "A man named Smith brought the horses to me at Dorking Station. I bought them in exchange for £9 and two ponies. Smith, I think, lives at Hardinge Street, Commercial Road. I had seen him about three or you months previous to this. I had no receipt for the horses. I ought they were straight." I said, "How do you account for the orses being consigned to you a few hours after they were stolen?" He made no reply. I then told him I should arrest him for being concerned in stealing and receiving these horses. He replied, "Smith sent me a wire saying they were coming. They got here about mid<lb/>day. I did not know they were crooked (stolen)." I conveyed him to Dorking Police Station, where he was detained all night. Next morning while waiting for a train at Dorking he said, "I saw Smith last Sunday. I have been to his house. I will tell you about it. Smith lives at 15, Drewton Street, Hardinge Street." As a matter of fact, Smith does not live there, but his sister or sister-in-law does. On the 9th I was present at the Stoke Newington Police Station, when Friend was put up for identification with several other men and was immediately picked out by the witness Godlonton without any hesitation. On the 13th, at Watham, Friend was confronted with Luck, and I read to Friend the statements made by Luck. Friend replied, "I am as innocent as Mr. Luck. I did not know the horses were stolen. They were fetched round to me. I went for some butter, and when returning from the shop a man Wado had the horses. I do not know where Wado lives. I asked him if he was doing to the Barbican. He said, "It does not matter. I have the privilege to sell them." I have known Wado three or four months, but have not had much conversation with him. I asked him what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100220"/>
               <p>the horses were worth. He said, "They were allowed out to me to take £30 home for them. I put them on the rail, Mr. Luck saw me give the money to another man, who gave me £1." Friend was then charged with Luck and made no further reply. I have made inqui<lb/>ries concerning Wado, but can hear nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was owing to the action of Luck's son that I was able to arrest Friend. Friend came to Luck's house, the seperin<lb/>tendent of police was sent for, and he was arrested at the house. At the station Luck identified Friend as the man Smith he had been speaking of. Friend admitted he was Smith, and that Luck's state<lb/>ments were true.</p>

                  </persName>, Stoke Newington. I was present when the prisoner Friend and two other men were discharged by the Justices at Dorking Police Court on August 9. I told Friend I was going to arrest him and take him back to London for stealing two horses from Chingford on July 12. He said, "I never stole from Chingford, I was at my house getting a cup of tea for my missing at eight o'clock on the morning of July 12. She was expecting to go to bed (to be confined). I live at 542, Old Ford Road, and went out to get some buter, and when I came back with it I not a man named Wado. He had two horses with him, and I asked him if he was going to the Barbican. He asked me if I knew anyone who would buy them, and I said I knew several people. I asked him how much he wanted for them, and he said £30 for the two. I told him if he liked he could go with me and put them on the rail at London Bridge. I knew a man named Luck, who would buy them. I took the buter home and then went with Wado. I sent a wire to Luck to meet me at Dorking Station, and Mr. Luck was there and met us. Wado led the horses to Mr. Luck's place, and I jumped up with Mr. Luck in his trap. The horses were put in the van and tried, and Mr. Luck gave me £8 10s. in gold and two ponies, which were put on the rail for London Bridge, and Wado took them away. I got a sovereign out of it for my trouble; Wado gave it to me." From Old Ford Road to London Bridge Station in about four miles. I should think it would be possible to get from Old Ford to Lon<lb/>don Bridge by the time the telegram was despatched (8.50 a.m.).</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath). At the request of my wife on July 12 I got up and went across the road facing my house to get some butter. As I returned from the shop I met a man who is called Wado in the Old Ford Road. I asked him, "Are you going to the Barbican?" Friday is the sale day at the Repository. He replied, "Yes. Let me know anybody that will buy them. I am privileged to sell them." I asked him how much he had to take back to the owner, and he said £30. I told him a man named Luck, of Dorking,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100221"/>
               <p>would buy them, and I said I would take them down and let him have a look at them. Wado led the horses to the station, which took, I think, about three-quarters of an hour, and they were put in a truck and sent to Dorking. I sent a telegram to Luck saying that the horses were coming and met him at Dorking Station. Luck asked the price and I told him £30. "Well," he said, "they look cheap horses. Are they all right?" I replied, "As far as I know." They were led round to Luck's place in Pixham Lane and tried in the van. Luck gave me £9 for them and two ponies, which I handed over to Wado. I thought the horses were straightforward and not stolen horses. As to the witness Goldton saying that he saw me at Chingford on July 11, I can assure you I was on the flat of my back on the 10th and 11th, and only got up on July 12, I am perfectly innocent of having stolen the horses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Wado has been up and down Old Ford for about three months as near as I can remember. If I said I did not know saying about horses I should be a liar. I know a little. I asked wado where he got the horses form and he told me he was working for his governor. I know Chingford, but I was not there on the 11th as Godlonton said. I was suffering from a ricked neck and horrible pains in the head and had been in and out of London infirmary. I was, however, well enough to take a trip to Dorking on the 12th. The horses were led along burdett Road, Stepney, into Cablee Street and over Tower Bridge into Tooley Street. We had no trouble in getting over the bridge. I have seen wado once since when he told me he had sold the two ponies, one for £15 and one for £7. I have not tried to find him. I thought they were straight forwared horses.</p>
               <p>The following evidence was given with reference to other stolen property traced to Luck's possession.</p>

The mare was worth £7, and the two pigs I gave 14s. each for. I kept the trap till the detec<lb/>tives told me it was stolen property; Luck told me his wife was sorry he had sold the pony and trap, and he wanted to buy it back from me at a slight premium.

I next saw the trap at the Dorking Police Station on August 11. It was not in the same condition as when it was stolem. When I had it it was of a dark green colour, picked out with black, and the cushions were dark green. When I saw it at Dorking it was a dark blue with cushions to match. The name of the maker had been erased from the axle boxes and the splashboards altered. I knew it to be my trap by the tyres and one or two marks I could swear to.</p>

                  </hi>, Cypress Villas, Dorking, carriage builder. I have had business dealings with Thomas Luck. On May 10 his son brought me a Stratford cart, with instructions that it was to be thoroughly done up. The cart was taken to pieces, thoroughly cleaned, and painted blue and yellow, the shafts being yellow picked out in black, and the straight wings replaced with bent. It looked a totally different cart when I finished with it. The caps had some grit marks on them and these were removed with a file, and the name of the maker was also filed off. I do not remem<lb/>ber what the name was. The cushions were re-covered with blue cloth. My charge was £5 10s., which Mr. Luck paid yesterday morn<lb/>ing. He runs an account with me. The work was done in my shop in West Street, and a passer by could easily see the trap. After it was finished it was put in the show-room facing the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Luck is a respectable and well-known tradesman in the town. I have done work for him for a number of years. I had three carts of his to overhaul in May and June. It is the usual practice to clean the caps of the axles with a file. the name is never very deeply indented, and any cleaning of the caps would obliterate it. Luck's trade colours are blue, yellow and, black. With yellow we always have blue as it suite the yellow. There is no truth in the statement that the cart was sent to me in order that I might disguise it. I put the value of the cart at about £8.</p>

I had some information and made inquiries about a stolen Stratford cart, and on May 10 I saw Luck at the station, where he called to deliver bread to one of the constables living there. Luck said to me, "You are making inquiries about a horse, cart, and harness." I said I was. He said, "I bought a pony, trap, and harness from some dealers, which I sold to Saun<lb/>ders at 'The Gun.'" That is the turnout which has been indentified</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100223"/>
               <p>as the property of Mr. Henderson. I said, "I have already seen that, but it does not correspond with what I am inquiring about at all. This Stratford cart that I am inquiring about is painted black, picked out with green, and has rubber tyres." Luck replied that the cart he sold to Saunders was the only cart he had had. At the time, I had no suspicion of Luck. Later on I found the Stratforad cart at Luck's premises, covered over with a white cloth. It was different in appearance form the description originally given to me, being blue and yellow instead of green and balck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The cover over the cart was the ordinary carriage cover to keep the dust off. The statement about the pony and cart sold to Saunders was quite voluntary.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have been in business in Pixham Lane, Dorking, for 18 years. I have never before this been in the hands of the police or been charged with any criminal offence. I employ two or three carts in my business. They are painted with blue bodies and yellow wheels. These are my regular colours. About the end of March I purchased the horse, trap, and harness, which was sold to Saunders at the "Ram Inn," Dorking, of a man called "Tom" for £16 10s., which in my judgment was a fair price. Saunders stopped me as I was driving past his place, and we had some conversation which led to the deal. A little later I heard rumours about the pony, cart and harness and had the conversa<lb/>tion with the superintendent which he has related. I first met Friday (or Smith) on the Thursday before I bought the pony, cart, and harness with several other dealers. They were down for a periodical horse sale which is held twice a year, but had made a mistake in the date. The spring sale has generally taken palce on the Thursday before Good Friday, but it was a fortnight later this year. They had horses for sale. I bought a horse off one of the other dealers. About a fortnight or three weeks afterwards I met Smith in Dorking, and we went to the "Tuns" together. I exchanged a roan mare for the Stratford cart and another cob that he had. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100224"/>
               <p>had no reason to believe that Smith was not an honest man or that the cart had not been properly come by. I had seen him in Dorking several times. On July 12 I received the telegram which has been produced by the Post Office that two horses were consigned to see at Dorking Station. I paid for the two horses as described, and they were taken round to my shop. I valued the two ponies I gave in exchange at £20, and that with £9 in gold makes £29, which I con<lb/>sidered a fair price. The bay mare that I sold to the co-operative Society had a large knee, and that, in my opinion, reduces its value. In purchasing horses from dealers in the ordinary way I do not get any warranty; there is a certain amount of risk about such pur<lb/>chases. The Stratford cart was not sent to the carriage builders for its appearance to be altered. It is not correct to suggest that I ordered the maker's name to be obliterated from the wheels. I sent it to be thoroughly done up. The first time I had inquiries about the two horses was on the Saturday before the August Bank Holiday, when I saw Mr. Brown. Up to that time I had no suspicion that the horses had been stolen or dishonestly come by. I told the detective next evening how they had come into my possession. I had up till then only known Friend as J. Smith. I had Smith's address at Drewton Street, Commercial Road through him writing to me from there. When I saw Friend at the police-station I identified him as the man Smith from whom I had purchased the horses. He was arrested close to my shop. My son had him arrested. I purchased the animals in good faith.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When I saw the horses they struck me as being very good ones. The mare improved wonderfully after I had her. It did not strike me as being a curious deal or anything out of the way. I have had altogether three transactions with Friend—a cob, a cart, and these two horses. The cob I sold to a man named Ford, who lives at Hedley. Friend had a standing order to bring me any decent animal he could get hold of. I have not done anything with horses until this year. I have not seen "Tom" since I bought Henderson's cart of him that I know of. You can call it a nice little lot; it seized me very well. My wife fancied it. "Tom" was known to Swift, who kept the "Three Tuns," where the periodical sales are held and I asked him about him and thought I had satisfied myself that he was all right. I purchased three carts within about a month. My instructions to Sherlock about the Stratford cart were that I wanted it done up properly. I told him the colours. I tried to sell the Stratford cart. Everything I have is for sale. After my son fetched it home it stood in an open shed and I chucked a sheet over it to keep the dust off.</p>

                  </hi>, Wife of Richard Munday, labourer, Clapton. On August Bank Holiday I had a bay horse at grass in Reader's field, close to Lea Bridge. It was safe at five o'clock in the evening. Early next morning, when I went to look for it to take it to Spitalfields Market, it was gone. I am a costermonger, and help to get my own living and the childern's. When next I saw it it was at Dorking on the 9th, and 18 inches had been cut off its tale. I know prisoner Riley. He came to me to buy some fowls and a set of harness, but I could not say for certain when that was. He did not buy the fowls as the price was too high. Riley saw the cob on two occasions and asked whether it was for sale. The value of the horse was £14. It had on, in the field, a leather head stall, which was found in the trap at Barking. There was also found in the cart a collar I had sold to Riley. The collar was too small to go over my horse's head. Later on I saw Riley at Stoke Newington Police Station, and charged him. I value the halter at a shilling. I was shown some of the harness which I did not recognise. I know nothing of the harness except the collar. There was a complete set and some head pieces. The harness was found at a livery bait stables, and I paid 7s. 6d. for the feed of the horse on 6th 7th 8th and 9th. When I saw the horse it was in the custody of the police.</p>
               <p>To prisoner Friend. I have had the horse 16 years. I am not accustomed to let it out to anybody.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Thomas. I do not exactly remember the date when I sold some harness to Riley.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. If someone else has declared that this particular collar was theirs, very likely Mr. Riley sold it to him. It was mine once.</p>

On August 9 I saw the prisoners, Friend and Riley, at Dorking Police Court, and said to them, "I am going to arrest you both for stealing a cob and harness, which has been found in your possession." Riley said, "I never got in the trap. I do not know anything about it. I only went with Friend for a drive." Friend said, "I wish to make a statement. I borrowed the horse from a man named J. Lovell, on Monday night, in the Lea Bridge Road. Lovell lives at Bethnal Green, but I do not know where. Lovell had the cob which had the set of harnes on, which was on the animal when I was arrested at Dorking. He had a rug over the horse, and was carrying the saddle under his arm. I said, 'Hallos! what is the matter?' He said 'My trap has broken down, and I have left it up the road.' I not Riley shortly afterwards in the 'Ship Aground' public-house in Lee Bridge Road, and asked him if he knew anyone who had a trust Riley said his landlord would lend him one for a bit of silver. I saw Lovell standing outside with the cob, harness, and cart. He took it away. Next morning (Tuesday, August 6), he came round about 9 a.m. and asked if I knew anyone who would buy a cob. I said, 'Yes,' and took the cob down to Mr. Luck at Dorking, and sold it to him. Lovell left me, and I have not seen him since. On the way to Dorking, I met Riley and Gardner in the Old Ford Road, and took them for a drive. I made inquiries about the trap, and found it belonged to a man named Head, Riley's landlord."</p>
               <p>To Mr. Thomas. When I first saw Head he said he did not lend it, but when it was a question of coming to police court to charge Riley with stealing the cart he said he remembered that he had lent it to him.</p>

I stopped him and asked him if his name was Jack smith. He replied, "No, John Friend." I told him I was going to arrest him on another charge and conveyed him to Dorking Police Station. Ascertaining that two men had been in his company, I went out and found them, prisoner Riley being one and the other a man named Gardner. They were also taken to Dorking Police Station, where all three were charged with being concerned in the robbery. Friend replied, "I got the horse from a man named Jack Lovell, of Bethnal Green, and the other two men only came with me for a rids." Riley said, "That is right." The other man made no reply. The horse was afterwards identified by Mrs. Munday, and the harness at North London Police</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On Bank Holiday night (August 5) I was in Lea Bridge Road, accompanied by my brother and my sister-in-law, when I met a man named Lovell leading a harnessed horse with a rug over it. He said, "My trap has broken down up the road and I have left it. Do you know where I can borrow one?" I said, "No, I do not." Outside the "Shop Aground" I met Riley with Gardner. I said to Riley, "Do you know anybody that can lend a chap a trap." Riley said, "My landlord has got one. He will lend it to you for a bit of silver." Meanwhile we went to Nesbit Street, where Head lives, and dragged the trap round to the "Stag" public-house in Brooksby's Walk, where Lovell said he would meet me with the horse and harness. Lovell put the horse in the trap and away he went, saying to me, "Do you know anybody that will buy the old cob. I am a bit short of money and want to go to the market to-morrow." On the following morning I met him in Old Ford Road, and he asked me, "Did I know anybody who buy his horse?" I told him "Yes." He can said, "Here it is; do what you like with it. I want £10 down for it or you can have an exchange for another one, as I want some money." I got up into the trap, and going along the Old Ford Road I met Gardner and Riley. I said, "Halloa, would you like to go for a ride?" They said they did not mind and got up and accompanied me to Droking. When I got to Pixham Lane I left Riley and Gardner at the top of the lane while I went down to where I was going to sell the horse. I am perfectly innocent of having stolen the horse. I had seen Lovell on the Thursday before at Spitalfields Market with some bananas on his cart with a horse exactly like the one he gave me to sell, and I thought it was the same horse when I saw it one the Monday night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. After I had sold the horse I intended to put the cart on the rail and send it up to London Bridge. I think I had 10 1/2 d. in my pocket. That would not have paid for sending back the cart, but I should have had money after I had sold the horse. It did not strike me to ask any questions about the harness or the horse because I had seen Lovell with it on the previous Thursday. He keeps a fruit stall somewhere in the Bethnal Green Road. When I was arrested at Dorking they asked me who this Lovell was, and I told the detective as far as lay in my power. I did not know Lovell very well, only through having seen him up and down. Lovell promised me a bit of gold if I sold the horse. I was to meet Lovell again after I had sold the cob at the corner of Brick Lane, Bethnal Green Road the same night. I have never seen Lovell since as, of course, I have been in custody, whereas if I had been out on bail I might have had a chance to look about for him.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a costermonger and live at 31, Nesbit Street, Homerton. On August 5 I was at the "Skip Aground," Lea Bridge Road, at about ten o'clock with a lad named Gardner. Friend came up and asked me if I knew where he could borrow a cart. I said, "Yes, I think so. My landlord has got use. and I have no doubt he will let you have that if you give him a bit of silver for the hiring of it." I went with Friend to Head's leaving the horse behind at "The Stag" in charge of another man Head was under the influence of drink, but I asked him if he would lend "Little Jack"—meaning Friend—his cart, and he said "You." Head said he would let him have the cart, and he took it away. I then parted company with Friend. Next morning I was again in company with Gardner in the Old Ford Road. We met Friend with a horse and cart. He pulled up and asked where we were bound for Being holiday time, we said we had nothing to do. Friend then said, "Would you like to go for a ride?" We thereupon got into she came and Friend drove us to Dorking. In Pixham Lane he asked us to get down while he was doing his business. We waited close upon an hour, and then Superintendent Boon arrested us and took us to the station, and charged us with stealing the pony. I did not steeling the pony, and know nothing about it or about the harness. Is in true that Mrs. Munday sold me some harness, and I dispossed of a to a friend named Smith, a greengrocer. I do not recognise the collar as the one which Mrs. Munday sold me. I think it was the second week in January last that I bought the harness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We drove from Old Ford Road to Epsom, and stayed there an hour, and I suppose it would be three o'clock when we reached Dorking. We pulled up several times, and, of course had a drink at each place. I had 4s. or 5s. when we started. Friend was supposed to meet a man at Epsom, but did not do so. We talked about various things over our beer, but it never struck me to the Friend what he was going to Dorking for; it did not concern no at all. I merely went for the ride, it being holiday time. I never considered how I was to get back, but I think Friend said he was going to exchange the horse. I am a fairish judge of a horse. The was a very aged old cob and showed a lot of wear. There was on old collar in the cart. It did not strike me to ask what it was doing there. I heard Mrs. Munday say she sold me that very celler, but that is a lie. I do not know where it came from or where the other harness came from. I heard Mrs. Munday say that I had taken a fancy to her cob on more than one occasion. That is false. I had never seen her cob in my life until I went for this ride with Friend and never wanted to buy it. I know Clapton pretty well. I suppose the "Ship Aground" is about a quarter of an hour's walk trass Reader's Field, where Mrs. Munday's horse was stolen from. Harvey's stable is close by.</p>

               <p>Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">SIMMONDS</hi>, D Division, stated that in 1901 Riley was sentenced to three years' penal servitude at the North London. Sessions for horse stealing. On January 22, 1894, at the same sessions he was sentenced to five years' penal servitude also for horse stealing, and there was a prior conviction for horse stealing on Feb<lb/>ruary 4, 1889. Altogether he had had 13 years' penal servitude for horse stealing, and was at the present time reporting to the police on his licence. For years he had been extensively engaged in stealing horses from Hackney Marshes and the surrounding districts, which he know intimately. With regard to Friend, the police had great difficulty in detecting a man of his class, as he was engaged in horse dealing. Witness had pulled him up taking horses along which had turned out to be correct horses, and Friend had then made a com<lb/>plaint to the Commissioner that he had been prevented from getting an honest living.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">HAWKINS</hi> said that Friend had against him only one conviction of three months for horse stealing, with the excep<lb/>tion of the conviction yesterday for stealing a mare and a gelding, but he was the associate of notorious horse thieves, one of whom was sentenced to four years' penal servitude and another to 18 months last Sessions. There was a great deal of this horse stealing going on, people turning their horses out to grass in the early part of the year, and the sufferers were generally poor people who could ill afford to lose their animals.</p>
               <p>Judge Lumley Smith said he was satisfied that Riley was a con<lb/>firmed horse stealer or dealer in stolen horses, and he could not pass a less sentence than <rs id="t19070910-103-punishment-119" type="punishmentDescription">

After a short time I returned and met charles Smith and a policeman; on going into my house I found that two vases, which were there when I left, had disappeared; their value was 5s. 6d. I have known prisoner several years and have employed him. At the police court he declared that he took those vases for wages due to him; I saw there were no wages due at all; I do not owe him a penny. I never authorised him to take the vases.</p>

I asked him where he had pinched them; he said he got them from the fair at Wantead. He showed them to me; they ratiled, and I told him he would break them; so he turned them upside down. Three or four cards fell out; one had on the name and address of Mr. Ager, so I took the card to him. I did not take the vases; prisoner took them away.</p>

                  </hi>, 417, Holloway Road. I have stable in Holloway Road. On Sunday, August 11, between three and four, prisoner drove up to my house with my boy. He had my horse in the trap, me boy having lent it him to trot out with the trap. Prisoner santed me to buy the trap for £16. I went for a run with it, and it seemed all right. I eventually agreed to give him £10 and my old trap for it, which I did on the Wednesday evening at six o'clock. Meanwhile on the next two days I went out with the trap, and on the second one I was stopped by a constable, with whom I went to the Minories Police Station, and was detained for six hours till my statement was investigated, on which I was released. On the next day, the 16th, prisoner came about 5.30 to receive the money. As he was signing the receipt Detective Eustace came in and arrested him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had never seen prisoner before the Sunday that he called. Prisoner first called at my stables and borrowed the cob to drive the trap to my house. I am pretty well known in the neighbourhood, and sometimes buy traps in the course of busi<lb/>ness. After wanting £16 prisoner came down to £13 before accept<lb/>ing £10. My old trap was worth about £5. I told prisoner I had not the money at the time, and he agreed to wait till the Wednes<lb/>day. He gave me his name as Henry Jones, 29, Halton Road, Islington. I arranged to pay prisoner in cash. When he had written the receipt, I said, "I will go outside and blot it." Whilst I was going out, prisoner said, "I am glad you are satisfied with the trap, and I will do anything for you in the future." I then handed the receipt to Detective Eustace, who asked who prisoner was. I told him, and he informed prisoner that he was a police officer, and understood that the trap had been stolen, asking him where he got it. Prisoner said he got it from a man outside a public-house in Holloway Road or Caledonian Road on August 9 for £13. The man was a stranger. The market in Caledonian Road to a well known place for buying horses. Prisoner said there had been a horse in the trap and he had taken it out and pulled the trap round to his stables.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100232"/>
               <p>Re-examined. Prisoner gave Eustace the address of 24, Halton Road.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">EUSTACE</hi>. K Division. On August 14 I went to 417, Holloway Road, and saw prisoner in the front room with Mr. Bryce. I saw prisoner writing a receipt (produced). After telling him the charge, prisoner said, in answer to questions. "I bought it from a man on the 9th inst. He asked me £16 for it; I gave him £13. I was standing in the Holloway Road when I saw the man with it. He was driving it. He took the horse out of the cart and I pulled it round to my stable, a few yards from the address I have given you. I do not know the man I bought it from; I never saw him before; I haven't seen him since, and I have no idea where he may be seen. I do not know nobody that saw me buy it, and I cannot give you any further information." He gave his name as Henry Jones, 24, Halton Road, Islington. I took him to the sta<lb/>tion; subsequently to West Ham. He made no reply when charged I went to the address given; prisoner was not known there, and there was no stable near the house. I asked for White, as well as Jones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Halton Road would be about two miles from Caledonian Market. There is no mews in Halton Road. I went to No. 29 as well as 24.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's statement at the police court: "All I have got to say is I appeal against the charge of having received the trap. I acknowledge I bought the trap and sold it to the gentleman. The other things I know nothing of."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I was going up the market—we call it Smithfield—on Friday, August 9; I was standing outside the public-house in Holloway Road, near the railway arch, about quarter to one, when a man drove up in a horse and cart. He says, "Will you buy that lot?" I says, "No." "Buy the cart then." He asked £16; I said, "No, I will give you £10." He finally ac<lb/>cepted £13. I said, "I have nowhere to put it; I have no horse; where can I put it?" He said, "There is a mews down here is Halton Road; go and put it down there and leave it." He directed me the way down and I went, took the trap, and left it there. I paid for the trap at the time I bought it. On the Sunday following I went to Mr. Bryce, having been told he wanted to buy a trap. I went to his stables first, asked his chap if it was true Mr. Bryce wanted a trap; he said, "Yes," and told me to take mine up to his guv'nor. He lent me the cob, and I went to Halton Road to fetch the trap, the boy coming with me. We then drove back to the stable, and from thence to Mr. Bryce's house. What passed be<lb/>tween us was substantially what he had said; also on the Wednesday when the detective came. I generally sign receipts, "Henry Jones."</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100233"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. There were hundred of people about when I bought the cart on August 9. I have not brought anyone who saw do it; I am a stranger about there. I had the money with which I bought the trap in gold in my pocket. I think the mews was at 29, Halton Road. I have nobody here from it. When I went to the mews to fetch the trap I left the boy in a public-house near while I fetched it. I live at Deptford. The detective never asked me where I lived; I gave the address where the trap was. I always buy things in the name of Jones. The money I bought the trap with was borrowed from my niece the day previous; I always get money off my niece. I do not live on her. Her husband is a green-grocer. I reckon I gave almost the full value for the trap. I do not ask questions when I buy in the market, and do not get receipts. I asked the boy if he would stop at the public-house while I fetched the trap; he said, "All right." He could have come if he liked.</p>
               <p>To the Judge. They buy and sell anything at the Caldonian Market. I have no place to keep a horse or cart when I buy it. I sell a horse as quick as I can. Close to where I live there is a big forest where you can turn a horse out; they charge you nothing. I have turned out hundreds of them there.</p>

                  </hi>, 27, Nelson Street, Tidal Basin. I have known Edith Dickenson for four or five years. Twelve months ago she was living at 3, Francis Street, with Charles Winter, and had been while I had known them. I once saw Edith Dickenson and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190709100234"/>
               <p>Winter with the man Dickenson, in the "Freemasons' Tavern," Vic<lb/>toria Dock Road; that was a good way back, but during the time she lived with Winter. I knew Dickenson was her husband, be<lb/>cause I have seen the marriage lines. He came to the house when Winter was not there. I had a room off Mrs. Dickenson in Francis Street. On the day the case first came on Mrs. Dickenson asked me to go and tell Winter to clear out, as he had no right there when her husband was at home. I never heard Winter mention Mrs. Dickenson's husband to her. I do not remember being asked at the police court if I had; I never knew anything about Winter and Mrs. Dickenson being married.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Mrs. Dickenson always went by that name. I think she lived rather a loose sort of life, because she had the two men coming backward and forward. Both Winter and Dickenson were seamen. When they were both away she had the two half-pays. At those times I have seen men go in with her, but have not seen them sleep with her. It is 12 months since I left Mrs. Dickenson's place.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the two prisoners for four or five years as man and wife. I lived next door to them 2 1/2 years ago at Custom House. During that time I have seen the man Dickenson at the house. One day Mrs. Dickenson came to me and asked if I would let Charlie (Winter) stop with me as her husband was home. When Winter was in my house he said to me, "She has no business with her old man as her husband, as he knocks her about so." When Dickenson left Winter returned to Mrs. Dickenson. This happened during the six months before I left. Winter knew that Dickenson was married to the female prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was in my kitchen one Sunday evening that Winter spoke about Mrs. Dickenson's husband; there was another young man present. I turned round and said to Winter, "Oh, shut up, don't make any noise; I don't want murder in my house." He was rather upset about Dickenson being next door with his wife.

               <p>Judge Lumley Smith objected that there were so many cases now in which an expression as to the conduct of the police was asked for. It was becoming a regular business, and he thought was a little over<lb/>done. The police were expected to do their duty, and of course in this case they were quite right. But he did not know that any extraordinary ability was required to stop two men at night carrying a bag on Richmond Green. He should think that was about what any policeman would do. He had been asked before that day to pass a commendation on the police, and it was becoming a little too common; but he always liked to encourage the police, and they had done very well on this occasion.</p>
