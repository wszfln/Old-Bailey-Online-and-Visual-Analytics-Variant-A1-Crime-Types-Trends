Then Knight said, do not be afraid about your cardinal, for a young woman brought it to her room: she delivered it to my wife, and went with her and me in search of Clements; and at Clements's mother's house, in the Coal-yard, there we found my wife's pocket; we took the mother in charge till we found the daughter: when she was taken, she confessed she had sold a shirt and a shift to a woman in St. Giles's for 18 d. which we found accordingly: we found one of my wife's aprons, not quite dry, at Mr. Desalear's, a pawnbroker, pawned in the name of

               <p>Q. Had you seen it between the time it was put into that bag, and the time it was missing?</p>
               <p>Jennings. I saw it the day after the fire, and not after that, till it was found upon the prisoner on Friday the 18th. The prisoner had let a lodger's servant see the watch-case, who informed us of it; upon which she was taken up, and before justice Mombray she said she picked it up the day after the fire, as she was sweeping the shop, and that she intended to give it to her mistress.

I had it. I went up into her room, she took it from under her bed, and gave it into my hand: when she came down, she said, she picked it up wrapped up in a paper, in the back shop, and had an intention to give it me again. She had told it to some in the family, that she had some table linnen and sheets at her brother's. I sent to her brother, desiring him to bring what he had of that sort of hers to me; the next morning her brother and sister came, and brought 3 table cloths, and a pair of sheets, which I swore to to be my property, which at that time I had not missed, the prisoner was then in Newgate</p>

She said, this is another watch which her sister had left her, that her sister had left her two.</p>

Mr. Poupard, a pawnbroker, brought me the spoons, (3 table spoons produced in court.) these are my property which I lost at that time, he stopt them, and is here to give the court an account of it.

            . I was coming down Fleet-Market last Tuesday was a fortnight, there a girl picked me up, this was between 12 and 1 at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I was in liquor. She carried me to the prisoner's house, <placeName id="t17630223-11-crimeloc55">the Black Horse in Fleet-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Who brought it up?</p>
               <p>Marshall. A servant maid: the girl that brought me there, insisted upon my paying for it. I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out 3 s. 2 guineas and 5 d. farthing, I laid down a shilling, and said, I had not got 18 d. The girl that picked me up lent me a sixpence, she laid it down; upon that I gave her a shilling, and put my money in my pocket, and took my hat, and said, I must be gone, I did not like my situation. The girl<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176302230007"/> said, she had something more to say to me, and catched hold of my coat, and put her hand to my pocket, and wanted to force me to stay in the room with her; as soon as I found I could not get shut of her, she forced one of her hands into my pocket: I catched hold of her and said, what do you mean to pick my pocket! she told me she must have another shilling of me: I said she should not, and insisted on going away: she struggled with me a good deal, and as I could not get shut of her, I yielded to give her another shilling I put my hand in my pocket, and took out my money, I gave her another shilling; I then saw the two guineas, and put them in my pocket again; the immediately forced her hand into my pocket, and said, I had stole her ring from her huger, and it was in my pocket, and she would have it out: I immediately called out and made a noise, and she likewise: immediately the girl that brought the wine up entered the room; as soon as that girl came in she seemed frighted; I was a good deal frighted; then in came another woman, a lusty jolly woman, (such as the prisoner) she had a bed-gown on, no hat nor cloak, she asked what was the matter?</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, do you know her?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I am called here upon my oath, but to take an oath that she was the woman, I can not. I think that woman was something younger; with the fright I was pretty well got sober; whoever the woman was, she came round me, and with a saint voice said, Curse you, be quiet! She gave me a slight blow, but did not hurt me; I got from them, but they intangled me at the back part of the door, and threw me on the bed, and the lusty woman held her hand on my mouth, and my hands with the other hand, while the girl that picked me up, took my money out of my pocket, and ran away with it. I had a bundle with me, which I took up, with my hat and wig, which were down in the scuffle; then I came down stairs as fast as I could, but one of the women stopped me on the stairs, and desired I would not run over her, which I apprehended was to give the other time to get away. I saw a man in the house, but I cannot swear to him.</p>

            . I am constable, this was my watch-night. When this person was robbed, he came to the door, and sent a watchman up to the watch-house; I went down with the man he sent, there I saw him standing at the door; he said, are you constable of the night? I said, yes; then he said, I insist upon your breaking this door open. It was not quite clear to me whether I could answer it or not; I knocked at it, and found it fast, it was equal to that of breaking a stone wall. He said, he had never quitted the door, and he believed the two persons that had robbed him were both in the house, and that one of them was a very lusty woman with a pale face. I asked him, in what manner he was robbed? he said, a girl picked him up in Fleet-market, and gave the same account he has here in court; I judged that lusty woman to be the woman of the house, the prisoner. I live in the neighbourhood, and knew her before; it is a bad house, for my watch-night before there was a person robbed in that house of 2 guineas; there is hardly a night but there is robbery or murder cried there. There are about six or eight such houses in that same Fleet-lane.</p>

Last Friday morning between 2 and 3 o'clock I heard my bell ring, a man with a lanthorn called to me to come down, he told me my shop was robbed. I put on my cloaths and went down, I found the iron bar that goes cross the shutters, was drawn out; there was the watchman with a young woman that he was guarding home; the two shutters were taken down, and the glass was broke all to pieces, some lay in the street, and some within; the watchman, coming over the hill, found a bit of brown cloth with 6 of my handkerchiefs in it, and 2 other handkerchiefs that had been in it, lying near the others. In the morning I went to Justice Fielding, thinking he could give me some directions; the clerk told me, I must advertise the things, and a reward. I came home and had some bills printed and dispatched them to the pawnbrokers, and on the Saturday I had an account of a bit of lawn that had been offered to pawn. I sent my apprentice to see if it was mine; he came and told me, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176302230008"/> had seen my mark on it, and could swear it was my property. The prosecutor sent the young woman that brought it to him to pawn, and one of his neighbours with it, in my house; I found it to be my property. The young woman said, she would carry me to the person that had given it to her. I got an officer, and proceeded six of us to the house, there was the prisoner Lyon. The young woman asked her, how she could serve her so to send her to pawn goods that were stolen? Lyon said, she had sent her with no stolen goods: then I shewed her the cloth, and desired her to tell me, how she came by it? she said, she found it; I asked her, where and when? she said, yesterday morning about 6 o'clock in East-Smithfield, wrapt up in a bit of paper, on the ground: I desired to know, how she could say she found it on the ground when it was quite clean. Several of the company desired her to confess the truth, and give an account of her confederates; she said, she had no accomplice, nor she would discover none. The officer and I went to Justice Berry for a search-warrant. I told the clerk, there was a man in the prisoner's lodgings with her that looked like a sailor, and asked, if I should bring him? he said, bring him and all the people you find in her room. We had a search-warrant, and urged her again to confess before we began to search; she would not confess any thing, but said, if this would hang her, she would be hang'd for it. The officer searched under the bolster of her bed, we found 2 silk and cotton handkerchiefs; between the feather-bed and the matting we found a Southsea handkerchief, and the rest here was tied up in a silk handkerchief and put between the head-board and the wall, when the board was taken away it fell on the ground; then the prisoner began to cry; we took them and her before the Justice, a great many have my pencil mark upon them, (about 50 handkerchiefs produced in court) these were all in my shop the day before. The Justice desired to know, how she came by them? she said, she found them on the Friday morning about 6 o'clock in East-Smithfield, as she was going to Billingsgate to buy fish; the Justice blamed her very much for going so much out of her way. Then the prisoner Martin was examined. The Justice asked him, what business he had there at the prisoner's lodgings? he said, he came to get a little girl that was there to go and take a pair of shoes of his out of pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a little girl there?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I did, she appeared to be about 10 years of age. The justice asked him how long he had been on shore, and what ship he had been on board, and what money he had when he came on shore; he said 6 guineas; and by his own account he had but 16 s. 6 d. a month. The justice asked, how long ago it was that he had pawn'd his shoes; he was very inconsistent in his answers: the justice asked him where he laid; he said, with his mother in Spittlefields, with a tall sailor that used to come to the prisoner Lyon, one

The justice ordered us a search warrant; we went and searched his lodgings at his mother's; the mother was a basket-woman that attends Leadenhall market, she was not at home; we looked in at a hole big enough to put my hand in, we saw it was an ordinary room, with only one bed in it, we could view the room all over; we were informed by the neighbours that he did not lodge there, and that his mother had not seen him for some time, we could not find where he lodged: we found

We took the prisoner Lyon apart, and told her, she certainly would be acquitted if she would tell the truth: at last she said, if you will discharge us all, I will tell you the whole story; this the justice's clerk and several others heard. I told her, I would discharge her, and all that were innocent: when she found I would not discharge the whole, she said, I did it all myself, let me be hanged, and there's an end of it. After that she went in to be farther examined, and he committed them, and bound me over to prosecute. It went very hard with me, to think this woman must suffer, for what I know she could not of herself effect. I went to her yesterday in Newgate, there she would not own so far as she had before; I did all in my power to save her life; she says she is but 18 years old, I do not think she is above 4 or 5 and 20.</p>

             this silk was delivered into the care of the servant that has the care of raw silk before it is put to do; several days after the silk came in, he came to us in the counting-house, and told us the last parcel of silk weighed 16 lb. upon which I said he had tied them in separate bags, which I was sure had been untied; he said, they were done up different to what they were when he did them: I did not at that time suspect they were stolen, but thought that (it being evening) he might have mixed them together himself, so told him to let it alone till morning; in the morning we examined and weighed the other parcel, which wanted 1 lb. 2 oz. in the whole was wanting 2 lb. 1 oz. this made me suspcious: the prisoner had warp'd one parcel of silk that day; my man asked me if I had ordered him to warp another cane? I told him no; he said there was as much silk gone as goes to the warping. A cane contains 126 yards of silk and worsted together, this silk is only a part; I was more suspicious, and in the morning went to a neighbour that had frequently been in things of this sort; we went and got a warrant of Justice Somerville, but he desired us to lay a trap for him; accordingly my partner and I threw a parcel of bobbins in the way, marked, and the next morning found them in the same condition we left them: we had the day before sent for some bobbins to wind silk, and there not being enough, we put them in a drawer; my apprentice came in the morning, and asked me, if I had taken one of the bobbins out? I went, and found one missing; my partner said, he thought it was came to serve the warrant; for, though we could not fix upon any one, it was time to search: he was obliged to go out, so the whole weight of the affair fell upon me. I went to the gentleman's I mentioned first, and we went and searched the house where Holden lived; when we searched the lower room, we found small quantities of worsted that was our property, this was upon the second floor.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did it lie?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. There was some in a trunk about 18 inches broad, I know it to be my property, it being a peculiar sort: Mrs. Holden wanted to go up stairs, but was refused, I insisted upon going with her; when we came into the room, it appeared more like a warehouse than any thing else; there was worsted on the floor to a great amount; upon opening a hat-box we saw several bobbins of orange-colour silk, together with some pink, we had missed the pink the first thing, but we had not missed the orange, they were worth about 2 s. 6 d. a bobbin; in a trunk I found, I believe, 60 bobbins more, and I think some of the pink silk, there was in the same box a large painted Christmass-box, on the opening of which we found 14 l. 2 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that these things you found were your goods?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. I am positive that these things we found in the box, &amp;c. were my property.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. I took him up on the same day that I found these bobbins, and delivered him into the custody of the constable; he asked me what he must do with him? I told him to carry him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say at the watch-house?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. He said it was the first time, if I would forgive him he would do so no more: these bobbins are most of them mark'd with my name, (produc'd in court) besides they are mark'd with our windster's mark. We took the mother to the alehouse, and told her, that the way to have favour, would be to confess. She confess'd that he dealt with

            . Last Shrove-Tuesday I took out one guinea and then another and slung them in my wife's lap; she took them both, and wrapt them up in an old cloth, and tied them in a knot, and put them into a drawer in a pair of chest of drawers, she did not lock the drawer; the prisoner was in the room at the time, and saw me give them to my wife, I was cold, coming in out of the snow, and sat by the fire; there being a parcel of hemp lying so that it in part kept me from seeing the prisoner; I did not see him at the drawer. I went to bed, after which my wife going to the drawer for something, missed the money, the knot was cut off in which it had been tied. The prisoner came to work the next morning, but made off about noon, and I went over the water and took him between 9 and 10 at night, at his own home in Southwark. I told him I had lost 2 guineas, and no body could have it but you. We walked a little way, he was between the constable and me; then he said, if we would go back with him he would give me part of the money; he owned he cut the knot off the rag, and took it out. Then we went to a public house, where the Justice was: we took one guinea out of the prisoner's shoe. He had 2 shillings besides about him. He owned he took it out of my drawer before the Justice; he owned the guinea in his shoe was my property.</p>

I asked him, if he did not take it when I went out for a pot of twopenny? he said he did much about that time. The weather being bad, we were all in the master's room, till the weather was better.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, this is one of those kinds of murders, which, like many thousands of others, are so far committed in secret, that no one can swear to their being present, and seeing the fatal blow given. The consequence of which is, the evidence now to be laid before you, (except what appears from the confession of the prisoner) will depend upon circumstances merely; but they are circumstances of that kind, so connected, so cemented together, and so explanatory of one another, that I dare say they will have the effect with you, as hitherto they have had with other people: they will leave no doubt with you with regard to the prisoner at the bar. The facts are so strong, and the prisoner's case so melancholly, that I shall do little more than name them to you.</p>
               <p>It will appear in evidence, that the person called

            , was butler to Lord Dacre, that on the evening of Monday the 31st of Jan. last, he was not very well; he went into the housekeeper's room, and there complained that he was ill; that the housekeeper made him some small tea, or something of that kind; that he had all the appearance of calmness and serenity, and no other complaint than a common cold, or some flight disorder. Some little time after this he complained of being hungry; he had something to eat and drink; he went to bed sober, perfectly so, and the next morning was found dead, with all the horrid circumstances of murder about him; his throat was cut, and he had violent blows on his head: you will hear what knives and things were there to induce the world to believe he murder'd himself.</p>
               <p>It is our business to shew you, why we call upon the prisoner at the bar to answer for his offence.</p>
               <p>We shall shew this in the following manner: that prior to the day when this fact was committed, the prisoner was in very great poverty; he was drove to such distress, as to want a single shilling; but upon the day the murder was committed, things were changed, for that very day, before noon, he paid some small sums of money, he applied to the very person to whom he had complained a day or two before of his poverty, (and where he had left his silver buckles in pawn) and, without any solicitation, paid a debt to that person.</p>
               <p>On the same day he went to another person, to whom he owed some money for washing, paid her, and told her he had received the money of his uncle, and though this was done on the day the poor man was murdered, (and you know murder occasions conversation in every family in the neighbourhood) yet when he paid this money, he took no notice of this man's death, and did not so much as mention one single circumstance of it.</p>
               <p>Upon the same day that the murder was committed, (so far were his circumstances alter'd) he bought linnen cloth to the value of 8 l. and on the same day he gave directions to a person to make it up into shirts, and he then (sorry I am to bring this circumstance home to him by giving his generosity in evidence) made a present to a child belonging to that person, of half a guinea. He paid on the same day 25 s. for a pair of breeches; and the next day, he was not satisfied with buying necessaries, but it will appear to you, he became extravagant, for he bought himself a watch.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it will appear to you, that at the time this murder was supposed to be committed, a noise was heard on the stairs, and it was suspected to be by the prisoner's going backwards and forwards. There were many circumstances of the like kind, but as I have had notice that all the witnesses will not be here, I would not open willingly any fact that shall not be proved in evidence, it being expected that the trial would not come on till tomorrow.</p>
               <p>I mention these circumstances, because I would not have a man in his unhappy situation be too much affected by what comes out of my mouth; therefore were the proofs to rest on what I have opened to you, few people can doubt of the prisoner's guilt, But more remains behind.</p>
               <p>He was afterwards taken up, and before a Magistrate, after having repeated warning to be catious what he said, and after being told that all admissions might be used as evidence against his own life, he, struck with a proper contrition for his offence, and willing to deliver his fellow-servants from this heavy charge, he acknowledged,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176302230013"/> he murdered this man. He did it in so deliberate a way, he calls for pen and ink, and desires him to write it down; on writing the word murder, he asked how it was spelt, and being informed, he took the pen in his own hand, and wrote these four words, I MURDERED THE MAN. This he wrote before the magistrate, who then was enquiring after the murder of 
               <persName id="t17630223-19-person202">
                  John

            , and therefore the words could be applied to nothing but the murder of that very man. After that he signed a formal confession, and, I believe, he wrote a letter to the Noble Lord whom he served, acknowledging he was guilty of this fact.</p>

               <p>These facts, Gentlemen, are so connected, that I dare say, when they are proved in the manner I have opened them, you can do no less than find the unhappy prisoner guilty.</p>

               <p>Q. In what capacity?</p>
               <p>Barnfield. He was my <rs id="t17630223-19-deflabel110" type="occupation">Lady's footman</rs>

               <p>Q. Where did you lie?</p>
               <p>Barnfield. There are 2 beds in the garret, the prisoner and my Lord's footman lay in one bed, and I in the other. When I came down he was cleaning the plate in the servant's hall, I went into the butler's pantry, and fetched that part of the plate which I cleaned; at 8 o'clock the prisoner had done his plate, and was carrying it into the butler's pantry to put it up, I said, Daniel, call Mr. Murcott up, it is 8 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was Mr. Murcott?</p>
               <p>Barnfield. He was <rs id="t17630223-19-viclabel111" type="occupation">butler</rs>

When he came back into the servant's hall, I said, Daniel, did you call Mr. Murcott? he said, Yes, I called him two or three times, but he never spoke. Then I said, Daniel, go and call him, and make him speak, you must awake him; at which he made no answer. When I had done my plate, I went to dry a cloth, and wipe it over, I put it up in the butler's pantry in the chest, after that I went and read the news in the laundry; in the mean time my Lord's bell rang, and Mrs. Jones called me to call Mr. Murcott, and said, my Lord's bell rang: I went to call him, I called 5 or 6 times, he never spoke; I laid my hand on the bed, and found he was there, I shook him pretty hard, he never stirred; I thought to myself, God bless me, the man is dead sure, or dead asleep; the cloaths were thrown over his face, I pulled them from his face and found them all bloody; then I went back into the housekeeper's room, and told my Lady's maid, and the housekeeper, that I believed he was dead, for I could not make him move, and his face was all bloody, then my Lady's woman, named Fortiscue, came and pulled the cloaths more down from his face, and near his breast saw a knife, I was there but did not knife; she went on the other side of the and said, let us see if we can lift him up; she on one side, and I on the other, we lifted him up; then his head dropt quite back, and we saw his was cut, on each side as far almost as un ears, (describing it with his own fingers) and quite deep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner soon after this?</p>
               <p>Barnfield. Yes, he had been out for some mussins and French rolls, for breakfast, he came in while we were in the pantry, he went to the door, and came out directly, and fell in a great crying and ringing his hands; I bid him not make a noise, for it was a great misfortune, and my Lord and Lady would hear of it too soon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it mentioned to the prisoner that the deceased was dead?</p>
               <p>Barnfield. It was directly on his coming in.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Barnfield. He said nothing further.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any thing afterwards that relates to this matter?</p>
               <p>Barnfield. No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether there were any other marks of violence?</p>
               <p>Barnfield. I saw a cut on the side of the deceased's temple that morning, when I went to look at him about an hour afterwards, it seemed a longish cut, near the temple, about 2 inches long.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it appeared to be a clean cut with a knife, or whether it appeared to be a bruise?</p>
               <p>Barnfield. There appeared to be a bruise with-all, besides the cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine that wound, to see if it was deep?</p>
               <p>Barnfield. I did not.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176302230014"/>Q. Whereabouts in the house did the deceased lie?</p>
               <p>Barnfield. He lay in the pantry below stairs, that is down stairs from the street, one pair of stairs below the street, upon the kitchen floor.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen Mr. Murcott last, before you found him dead?</p>
               <p>Barnfield. I saw him about 12 o'clock, when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner go to bed?</p>
               <p>Barnfield. He went to bed along with me, and the other footman staid for something to be made hot for his cold.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell in what condition Mr. Murcott was for liquor when he went to bed?</p>
               <p>Barnfield. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner getting up?</p>
               <p>Barnfield. I knew nothing of his getting up, I heard nothing of him till between 7 and 8 o'clock.</p>

               <p>Miller. I lie in that part of the house that is even with the footman's room. I did not see Mr. Murcott on the Monday night, I went to bed about 8 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any disturbance in the house that night?</p>
               <p>Miller. No I did not. The laundry-maid and the kitchen-maid went down in the morning; about one o'clock, as the watch went one, I went down soon after, it was our washing morning; I went and looked at the clock, it was half an hour after one.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you stay from that time till morning light?</p>
               <p>Miller. I went down into the laundry, and took a basket of cloaths, and carried them into the wash-house; the laundry is a great way from the wash-house; the laundry is below stairs down from the street, and the wash-house is farther on, on the same floor where the pantry is.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the wash-house from the place where the butler used to keep his plate?</p>
               <p>Miller. The wash-house is a good distance from the pantry, farther than the breadth of this court. Carrying the basket of cloaths, I met the kitchen-maid, after that I went into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might you go to breakfast?</p>
               <p>Miller. That was about 2. The laundry maid went to light the fire about 4; she came down to me as I was washing, and told me it was about 4 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise or any disturbance during any part of that morning?</p>
               <p>Miller. About half an hour after 5 o'clock I went down to the laundry, and was looking at a new gown, I thought I heard somebody come out of Mr. Murcott's pantry, and go into the house-keeper's room, and back again into the pantry, and I thought I heard somebody rattling the plate about; I said, Daniel is up by times nobody made me any answer.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you thought you heard; did you hear the plate rattle, are you sure?</p>
               <p>Miller. Yes, I am sensible I heard the plate rattle.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean you imagine you heard somebody go out, or did you hear a person move about?</p>
               <p>Miller. I thought I heard him step.</p>
               <p>Q. The noise you heard of a person, as you supposed, did it found like shoes, or a person without shoes?</p>
               <p>Miller. That I did not so much observe. I saw the pantry door open, I went in, I had my gown going to carry it up stairs; I knew Mr. Murcott was out on the Monday, and I did not know where he was gone; seeing the bed down (it was a turn-up bed) I was not frightened at all, I went to the foot of the bed, I did not see any body in bed, but I thought I heard him snore.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean by your saying you thought, you were in any doubt, or did you hear him snore?</p>
               <p>Miller. That I cannot tell, I did not stand to mind that, he was laid over head and ears, the cloaths were turned over his head, and his coat and waistcoat were all on a heap at the foot of the bed, the bed cloaths lay very smooth, I could not see any thing of his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a candle with you?</p>
               <p>Miller. Yes. After that I went up stairs to call my fellow-servant, I went to look also at the clock, it was half an hour after 5; I thought, as I was going up stairs, I heard somebody go up stairs before me without shoes, but I did not see any body.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned you to think so?</p>
               <p>Miller. I saw the footman's room door a little way open, and I thought he might be gone to bed again; I go by the prisoner's room door to my room. I lighted the candle, and went down stairs into the wash house, and said to the laundry-maid, is Daniel here? she said no. I said, if he is not here he is in the kitchen. I went into the kitchen, and back again, and said, Daniel it not there, I fancy he is gone to bed again,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176302230015"/> for I thought I heard somebody go up before me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think it was Daniel?</p>
               <p>Miller. He used to get up to clean his plate on a washing morning, and I thought he was got up too soon, and was gone to bed again. The laundry maid said, Molly, go and draw a little beer. I thought she spoke to me, but she spoke to the kitchen-maid. I went to the pantry, and found the door open; I went in, and drawed some small beer, and left the door open as I found it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I believe she is not certain of my going up stairs, for I went up stairs with my shoes on.</p>

            . I am a chairman, I have known the prisoner about 12 months, I carry a lady that he did serve. I remember the morning this unhappy affair was talked of; the prisoner came to me that morning between 8 and 9 o'clock; I did not hear the man was dead till the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it?</p>
               <p>Bond. It was on a Tuesday. The prisoner owed me some money, I heard him call Bond; I jumped out of bed, and threw up the sash; he said, I want to speak with you, I am come to pay you some money I owe you: he came into the room, and threw me half a guinea, (it was for lodging) I gave him change, he paid 8 s. then he wanted the key, to take out some things from his trunk, he having sent a man, while he was at this place, for some things out of it; I went to look for the key in my other coat pocket, he said, I'll be here again in 10 minutes, and went away, and soon returned; I gave him the key, he took out what he had a mind to, and went home; and about 10 or 15 minutes before 4 o'clock he came again, and took out a music book for pricking down tunes in. I said, what do you do with that old trunk? Said he, I am going to Monmouth-street to buy a box. I said, I can sell you one, I have 3 or 4 up stairs; he went up, and bought one of me for 3 s. 6 d. I changed him a guinea, and gave him half a guinea, a 5 s. and 3 d. and the rest in silver, and he paid me, and called for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived at my Lord Dacre's?</p>
               <p>Bond. As far as I understand between nine and ten weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was worth any money when he came from his last place?</p>
               <p>Bond. He had some money coming to him, but it was but a trifle I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave any thing with you on account of this debt?</p>
               <p>Bond. He owned my wife 14 s. for washing, and he left a pair of silver buckles with her; that was before he came to my Lord Dacre's services, that was when he left Mrs. Clift; he left them when she went out of town, and when she came to town again he came in three or four weeks time and paid the money, and took the buckles.</p>

               <p>Fermer Hast. I lodge in Pall-Mall; I am a surgeon; there was a message sent from my lord Dacres for Mr. Hawkins to come there; Mr. Hawkins sent me, I went about 9 in the morning on the 1st of February: I found the man dead; I returned; after that my lord sent to Mr. Hawkins desiring he would let me be there the next morning to attend the Coroner. I went between ten and eleven; I found the deceased's throat cut through, and the wind-pipe and the large blood-vessels were divided. I discovered a wound on the right temple, a little above the ear. Feeling about the wound, I perceived an unevenness of the bone underneath, and upon removing the sealp round the wound, I discovered a large fracture. There were two small wounds on the right corner of the lip, and another likewise on the head, near the other place.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think those wounds had been given by?</p>
               <p>Hast. The fracture must have been given by something weighty, from the extent of that and the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Cou'd that wound have been given by the deceased himself?</p>
               <p>Hast. I should suppose not, it was a large fracture.</p>
               <p>Q. What say you as to the cut on the throat?</p>
               <p>Hast. It was a very large wound on the throat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you imagine a wound in the manner that appeared to you, that a person could have made such an incision upon his own throat?</p>
               <p>Hast. I should not have thought it in a man's power to make such a wound on himself.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have some reason for forming that judgement.</p>
               <p>Hast. Because there was a fracture on the head, and that also no man could be able to cut his own throat in that manner; it is impossible, alter that wound on the head, that that cut could have been done by himself; the wound on the head was mortal, after that was given, which must be by a blow, I suppose, he never stirred afterwards.</p>

            . I was present when the prisoner was examined before him. I was at my Lord's house best part of two days. He was examined with the rest of the servants, then no guilt appeared on him any more than the rest, till the second day; then some circumstances appeared, that pointed with some suspicion at him. (The first day he was examined upon oath, the second he was not.) He was ordered into custody, and sent to the Justice's house. He was there charged with laying out that money that has been mentioned; to answer that he said, he had received 10 guineas the week before from his own brother. I went to his brother, who is a baker in Little Britain, and found that account to be false. I think he was committed to New Prison on Thursday night. He stiffly denied the fact there. He had wrote a letter, that occasioned his being examined again before the Justice that evening. He confessed the taking the money, that was 20 guineas, out of a cupboard, but denied the murder for some time; but at last he said, there needs no inquiry. The gentleman present seemed to take it as if he was going to make a confession. He, being hand-cuffed, said, if they would let<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176302230017"/> these things be taken off, and give him the use of pen, ink, and paper, he would satisfy every body. I was directed to give him paper; I gave him a piece that I have here. (Producing a paper.) He first put the letter I, and addressed himself to me and said, how do you spell murder? It struck me, it was an improper thing for me to dictate. There were several noblemen there, and I think it was the Earl of Sandwich told him how to spell it, then he writes the rest as it stands here. This is his own hand-writing; it is, I murder'd the man. (The clerk of arraigns reads it, &amp;c.). Sir

Then he was told by Sir John, it was putting a halter about his own neck, or words to that effect; he was told the consequence of signing such a confession, and asked, whether it was a voluntary thing? he declared, he desired to do it to prevent any innocent person being charged with the same fact. Then this paper (producing another paper) I took down from him, he dictated the contents of it, it is his own words, he did it under this admonition.

The prisoner at the bar told me she had taken the two notes from me before I went for it; and said, nobody was concerned with her in it: the other note she owned she had paid away to Mr. Sharp, a Linnen-draper, in Cheapside. I went there, he said he had had it changed; I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176302230018"/> that, by tracing it in the hands of Mr. Roaper in St. Martin's Lane.

            . I met the prosecutor that Sunday morning a little after 9 o'clock, he was coming to Westham, I came from there, he seemed in a sort of a fright; I asked him how he did, he said he had just been robbed coming over the fields.</p>

She desired me to put her up 3 pounds in her basket, then she desired 3 pounds more, and as many puddings as came to 2 s. I turned about to reach six pennyworth of puddings for another customer, and detected her with her hand in my pocket; I took hold of her hand, and in it were 3 s. and 3 halfpence; then she took and throwed my goods out of her basket in the dirt, and got away.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176302230020"/>Q. How do you know what was done when you was asleep?</p>
               <p>Benn. I have a witness here that saw her take it out.</p>
               <p>Q. What had she to do in your bed room?</p>
               <p>Benn. It was not in my room, it was done in the taphouse, in the house where I lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you into her company?</p>
               <p>Benn. I happened to be a little in liquor; she kept company along with me, as a company keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you kept company together?</p>
               <p>Benn. To the best of my knowledge 9 or 10 weeks; we lived together in the same manner as man and wife.</p>
               <p>Court. Now you find her expensive you are tired of her.</p>
               <p>Benn. If she had not ran away from me I would not have prosecuted her.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it is not for the sake of the 16 guineas that you prosecute, but because she ran away from you.</p>
               <p>Benn. Sixteen guineas is a good deal of money too, I should like to have the spending of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who would you spend it upon?</p>
               <p>Benn. I do not believe I should spend it all on her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who bought the provision, you or she?</p>
               <p>Benn. I always paid for provision; I would not have trusted her if I had not been in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of her after she got it?</p>
               <p>Benn. She went out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she return again?</p>
               <p>Benn. Yes, she came in again, and lay with me that night, and in the morning she went out, and I did not see her again till Tuesday.</p>
