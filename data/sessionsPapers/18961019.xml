I am shipping clerk in charge of the export depart<lb/>ment of De La Rue and Co—among the cards in the warehouse there are cards called "Retres," defective cards, used simply for exportation under a permit; they are not sold for use in this country—single packs are put into half-dozen packets, and three dozen packs are put into brown paper parcels—in the last days of August I took stock, and found twenty-four and a-half dozen of those packs missing, also other cards—the prisoner had nothing to do with my department—he was engaged in the pasting department—these cards produced are "Retres" cards, coming from my department.</p>

I am a gun maker, of 44, Elles<lb/>mere Road—I am president of the North East Radical Club—I was present at the club on June 9th—the secre<lb/>tary was there also—he bought some cards that were sold by the prisoner—these cards produced are part of what were bought—three dozen were bought—this is a receipt of Mr. Turner, the secretary to the club, which he gave to the prisoner—they were in paper, on which was printed "for exportation," with a penalty of£20 if used in this country—I saw that printing when they were bought—I knew the prisoner was employed at De La Rue's—one of our committee asked if they incurred any liability by the use of these cards; the prisoner said we should not—he was not asked how he had got hold of the cards—he said they were all spoiled cards—we thought they were given to him by his employers as perquisites, and were sold cheap—I saw the penalty of£20 affixed on the outside of every pack—the price was 7d. a pack—I was present when the cards were first mentioned—the prisoner got one of the committee, Mr. Hills, to broach the matter—Mr. Hills is not here—the prisoner had been a member of the club—he ceased to be a member, and was re-elected last March—I knew that he had been at De La Rue's a long time—I did not know how long.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Frederick Day, of 67, Priory Park Road—on July 28th the prisoner came and said he was second mate on board a ship, and wanted two rooms and board for himself and a friend for six weeks, and offered to pay 25s. for himself, and his friend would pay the same—I accepted him as a lodger—he said he was short of money, but that he had not been paid off the ship, and he would have his money, £96, from the Board of Trade in a few days, and asked me if I would lot him have a little money—he said he wanted to buy a coat, and he has on now the coat and vest he bought with my money—I lent him 10s. on the Friday night, ana£1 on the Saturday, and a few shillings on the Monday to go and meet his mate—after he had been with me about a month, by which time I had advanced him about£6 17s., he aroused my suspicions, and my husband went to the Board of Trade office and made inquiries, and, in consequence of what he heard, I said to the prisoner, "My husband has been to the Board of Trade, and you have not got any money to come from them"—he said, "Yes; I have not, but I did not wish to tell everybody my business; but I have£1,300 to come from the solicitors; I have some property not settled"—he did not tell me the names of the solicitors then—I found afterwards he meant Parker, Garrett, and Parker, of St. Michael's Alley—after that I let him have about£3—he said he was going to get his money, and took me to the city, and I waited outside St. Michael's Alley, or near there, the Friday before his arrest, while he went down some court; he told me to wait till he came back—when I advanced the first sums of money I believed his statement about the£96 coming to him; and afterwards I believed his statement about the£1,300—Ishould certainly not have advanced the last£3 if I had not believed that.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">this was addressed to Fred Tyler at that Black Bull High Holborn</hi>). It was not written by me, or by my authority—some time afterwards I went to Leicester, and identified Thomas as the man that had called upon me; I picked him out of several others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Lang worthy Grey, of 88, Queen's Road, Upton Park—on September 24th I was in Gracechurch Street, going in the direction of London Bridge—at the corner of Grace-church Street a horse had fallen, and there were a great number of people—to avoid the crowd I crossed the road—I felt nothing, but when I got over someone spoke to me, and I discovered that my purse was gone—I had seen it only a few minutes before—it was in a deep pocket, and my handkerchief was on the top of it; I had used my handkerchief, and put it back on the purse only a few minutes before—this is the purse—I saw it fall from Berry's hand on to the pavement—I saw Hoddinott by his side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I was crossing the road I was asked whether I had lost anything—I said, "No"—I was asked to be sure—I put my my hand in my pocket and said, "Yes, my purse is gone"—the prisoners were together—when I saw the purse drop from Berry's hand there were not many people in the roadway; no more than ordinarily; they were princi<lb/>pally on the pavement watching the fallen horse—I had not seen either prisoner before I was spoken to—Berry's hand was held by two gentle<lb/>men, who were trying to get something from him when he dropped the purse.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective City</hi>). On September 24th I was with Gillard in Gracechurch Street, at two o'clock—we watched the prisoners in consequence of their suspicious movements in a large crowd assembled to see an injured horse—the prisoners were together—Hoddinott placed himself in front of a lady, and Berry on her right side—Berry put his hand into his pocket, and through a hole at the bottom of it, and into the folds of the lady's dress, in the direction of her pocket—they moved from that, part of the crowd, and Hoddinott stood in front of another lady, and Berry again put his left hand through his pocket and into the folds of a lady's dress in the direction of her pocket—they crossed the road to where there was a crowd on the other side of the street—Hoddinott got in front of a lady and Berry on the right side, and put his hand again through his coat pocket and into the folds of the lady's dress; then they went a few yards further, and Hoddinott got in front of another lady, and Berry put his hand into a lady's dress pocket—they did it four times; then they stood on the kerb watching the crowd—the prosecutrix was crossing the road; Hoddinott touched Berry with his elbowand looked at the prosecutrix, and they followed her across the road, and as she was about to pass through the crowd on the footway, Hoddinott hurried on and got just in front of her; it was a very narrow place to get through the crowd, and he purposely obstructed the lady, while Berry, who was</p>

               <p>just behind, put his hand through his pocket into the lady's dress pocket—as he drew his hand out I seized his hand, and I saw him drop this purse on the ground—Gillard arrested Hoddinott; I arrested Berry—I told them they would be charged with being concerned in stealing this purse—Gillard picked up the purse, and spoke to the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The hole was in Berry's left-hand coat pocket—I noticed it before and after I took him into custody—I think he is wearing the same coat now—I saw him show the coat at the Police-court; he must have had a needle secreted about him, because at the Police-court he raised his vest and showed a few stitches here and there—he might have had a needle secreted in his shirt or hair and have sown up the hole—I am certain I saw his hand through the hole—in each ease Hoddinott stood in front to cover Berry's movements, and obstructed the lady—when I got hold of Berry Hoddinott was not more than a yard off, just in front of the lady.</p>

I am a dressmaker of 3, Little Drummond Street, Euston Square—the prisoner lodged with me four or five weeks before September 11th—on that day, Friday, he went out to work at six a.m.—he was a cutter-out for a cabinet-maker—in the course of that that morning I received a telegram; in consequence I went to the corner of Southampton Row at 11.45 a.m, where I met the prisoner—he said the men he imagined were following him had come to his workshop, and that he had given up his work there through that, and he had sent for me to give me the money he used to give me every week; he did not know what would happen to him before the day was out, and he wished me to go and spend the day with him, to which I consented—we went to Stamford Hill—afterwards we had dinner together at a coffee house—he began to quarrel, and I said I wanted to go home—that annoyed him—he said he was going to stay there—I went as far as the tramway—he said he did not want to go home, and ran up the hill after me—he said, "Come and have another drink; say nothing more about it"—after going into a public-house I was frightened, I ran out; but he came out at the side door and found me—a sweep came and looked at him, the prisoner asked him what he was looking at, and he said he lived up there, and he was not looking for him, and as he was standing at the corner of the road I took the opportunity to get home, and walked up the hill to where I could see the trams—I was getting in the tram when he came behind me and shot me—I heard a report in my ear; I felt the pain—two constables were there—the prisoner gave himself up—a constable took me to the hospital—my wound was dressed and I was detained—I knew he had a revolver—I had seen it, but I had no reason to be frightened of him, because he never threatened: he was always good and kind to me, and he only carried the revolver because he was frightened of the people he said were following him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper, carrying on business at 53, High Road, South Tottenham—on the afternoon of September 11th I was in the colfee-house when I heard a noise outside like quarrelling—looking out of the window I saw the prisoner and the last witness—I went out—a small mob were round them—the woman said something to the prisoner, and he struck her in the face—she said, "What did you bring me out for?"—he said, "To shoot you"—then, it was not like a blow, but he pushed her down—I took the prisoner away—he said, "I'll shoot her now"—I said, "Nonsense, governor"—he said, I will, so help me God! I will"—I saw the revolver—I said to the woman, "Go away," and she went towards Hands Road—he followed her—I said to a friend," Fasten that door"—they came back and went up Stamford Hill—while I was talking I heard a report of firearms—I went up the hill with a friend, and found the prisoner between two policemen—then T came back—the prisoner put the pistol in his pocket—he said, "I have got a pistol; I will shoot her."</p>

What he says is wrong. I only pointed at her hat. She tried to poison me three times this week with poisoned herrings"—he had been drinking, but was not drunk—I looked at the revolver—it was seven-chambered—one cartridge had recently been discharged—the other six chambers were fully loaded—one cartridge was in his pocket, where I also found this hammer—I also found the blade of a knife, a cap and a tobacco-box, and £1 Us. in silver and 4d. bronze—the money was returned to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Boyd Finney, an inspector, since retired—the prisoner married my deceased daughter; they were married on August 14th; she was then nineteen—she lived with the prisoner till August Bank Holiday this year—she then left him, and came to live with me at Little Cross Street, Islington-some time after that a summons was taken for maintenance—before that came on for hearing the prisoner came to see me; that was on the Saturday before the 17th—</p>

               <p>I then said, "Well, Ernie, don't you think we can settle this without going into Court?"—he said, "I think, Mrs. Finney, it had better go through, although I think quite as much of Beatty; I am very fond of her, but I think I must let it go through"—on the 17th the summons was adjourned for a week—the prisoner came to me on Friday, the 18th, to see Die and my daughter; I saw him come in—he saw my daughter in a room alone—they were quarrelling—he stayed there till late in the evening—they afterwards went out that evening together—he said, "Beatty won't be long; she shall only come to the corner with me"—they did not return that night; he brought her home in the morning in a cab, and he remained till the evening; they were then on perfectly good terms—on the Monday evening he came again; they had some words that evening—he went away that evening, and she slept at my house—on the Tuesday she wrote a letter to him; it said, "Come early this evening keep sober"—he came just as she posted the letter, in the afternoon about four, and they went out and bought a pair of boots, and came back—they were on friendly terms—I think they stayed at my house together that night, but I am not positive—the summons was returnable on the 24th, and my daughter did not appear in support of the summons; she did not intend to; the prisoner breakfasted at my house with her about nine, and then went away—when he was going she said, rather coolly, "What time shall we see you again"—he said, "dome time in the afternoon or evening"—he did not come back that day; she walked up and down in front of the house till about half-past ten, and then she went for him—I went to bed, leaving her upstairs in the sitting-room—afterwards she was out again—I afterwards heard them on the steps; they were having very high words; I could not tell the words—then they came in<lb/>doors, and went straight upstairs to the back bedroom, and they quar<lb/>relled very much—I heard her say, "You can keep up your 12s. 6d. till after that, I don't want anything to do with you whatever; no<lb/>thing more"—I went out of the room—I came down three or four times as far as their room; it was underneath mine—I said, "Ernie, what are you going to do; had you not better go and finish your time at your club?" that was, I think, after one o'clock; the first time I went into their room she was not undressed, she was standing in the room, and he was stand<lb/>ing there, too; she was telling him to go; she wanted nothing more to do with him—he said to me, "I have been to the club, Mrs. Finney, and I saw Beatty come in <hi rend="italic">boosed</hi>"—I said, "It isn't possible, Ernie; she didn't go out from here till past eleven the first time; it must be your fancy"—he said, "She said she went in after a <hi rend="italic">to</hi>"—I said, "She must have said that to annoy you; she went after you"—I stayed there about ten minutes, and left them still arguing—I heard some very high words in<lb/>deed, and then I heard a pistol-shot—I then ran downstairs; I couldn't hear the words—I saw my daughter lying on the floor, between the fireplace and the bed—she said, "Oh, mother, Ernie has shot me"—I said to him, "What have you done?"—he said some thing about Aggravation, and said, "What have I done?"—I said, "Where are the blank cartridges?"—he said, "Oh, what have I done? I wouldn't hurt a hurt of her head!"—I said, "You see you have shot her?"—he screamed, and said, "Oh, Mrs. Finnsy, I wouldn't hurt a hair of that woman's head! I haven't shot her, have I?"—at this time he</p>

               <p>had a revolver in his hand; I think in his right hand; I couldn't tell exactly—I then went and called my husband, and he came and took the revolver out of his hand—the prisoner said, "What can I do?"—I said, "Go and tell Dr. Mavor you have shot your wife"—he went off directly for the doctor—my daughter was removed to the hospital the same night, and she died on the 29th—after the prisoner was arrested I went and saw him at Holloway—I afterwards received this letter from him (it is in his handwriting), and also these other letters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have heard of the Dramatic Club for years, but I don't know anything particular about it; it is within about three minutes' walk of my house—the prisoner was engaged to my daughter about eighteen months before he married her—she was very desirous of earning her own living, and went out as a barmaid—she remained there about a fortnight, and rather than she should remain there he allowed her 13s. a week for twelve months—he was very much attached to her—after the marriage they went and lived at Mrs. Danford's, 250, Essex Road—I visited them there very often—they had one child, born in the early part of this year—my daughter was somewhat quick-tempered—their married life was not a very happy one—after leaving Essex Road they went to Mrs. Bishop's, 1, Florence Street—they were living there at the time a separation was agreed upon—while at Mrs. Bishop's I saw the prisoner with a black eye, and his forehead cut, caused by my daughter; that was through his stopping out late; it was caused by a ring, I think; she did not strike him with the ring—I don't know that Mrs. Danford gave them notice to leave on account of violence and rows—she told me that she had slapped his face, and thrown ornaments at him; I have seen him with a black eye—at his marriage his father set him up in business in a gold beater's shop; he was then only twenty—I have a daughter who lived at St. John's Wood, separated from her husband; she has not been living with a man named Kemp; she lodged in his house; I think he was the land-lord—I have heard that Kemp was tried and convicted here recently of stealing jewellery, and that he got five years; I do not know that the money my daughter got from the prisoner was for my other daughter at St. John's Wood; I know she tried to borrow it, but she did not get it—the first money was paid; it was for the second time—I know that the prisoner very strongly objected to Beatty having anything to do with her sister at St. John's Wood, and desired her not to associate with her—when she did go there I told him she had gone to Wood ford, but I advised her to tell her husband the whole truth as to where she had been—I know that he told her not to go to this Dramatic Club; he told me he did; he did not think it a place for respectable persons to go to—he has told me that he very strongly objected to Beatty drinking anything—she used to take a drop occasionally, a little; nothing particular—on Thursday, September 17th, when he called there was a quarrel; on the Friday, the day after the summons was adjourned, there was a thorough reconciliation, and they slept together at the Cosmopolitan Hotel as man and wife, and on the 20th the friendly terms continued, and my daughter slept at homo, and he went home to his lodging—on Monday, the 21st, there was a quarrel because some person had told her that they had seen her husband at the club with a woman; on the 22nd there was a reconciliation—when I heard the pistol</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189610190027"/>
               <p>fired on the 24th I think it must have been a full hour after I heard them quarrelling on the doorstep—up to a minute or two before the shot I heard loud and angry words—I only heard one shot—my first impression was that it was a blank cartridge—she told me she had been shot, but I did not see any blood—when she said, "He has shot me," he seemed quite thunder-struck and surprised; he said, "What have I done?"—the door must have been open, for I rushed in—when my daughter told him that she did not want his 12s. 6d., she said "You have deceived me; you have been with Carter. I will have nothing more to do with you. Go back to Carter again"—he used to lodge in the same house as we did, 250, Essex Road—she did not like Carter because she thought he was a bad adviser to the prisoner—I know that when my daughter was in a temper she has taken off her wedding-ring and thrown it away, and the prisoner bought her a second one—on several occasions she has come home to stop with me, and he invariably called and begged her to return—when she went to the club to look for him he said she had been to look after somebody else.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I don't know that I was present when she took off her wedding-ring and threw it away; I heard it from her—on the night of the 24th I saw no indication of her having been drinking—she was not in the habit of drinking—the prisoner had been a teetotaler for a long tame; once in a way I have seen him take drink—I did not know much about him in August and September.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—on the early morning of Friday, September 25th, I had gone to bed before my wife; I was not in very good health; something woke me up; it sounded to me like the slamming of a door; I heard it four or five times; then my wife called me—I slipped on my things and went downstairs—from what my wife said I pushed the door open, and saw the prisoner standing against the foot of the bed, with a revolver in his hand; he was holding it down at his side; I caught hold of him with one hand and took the revolver from him, and slipped it into my pocket—after that he ran out and fetched a doctor—I did not know that he fetched one; I fetched Dr. Mayberry—the sounds I had heard were very quick ones; in as quick suc<lb/>cession as could be—the doctors came and the police—I gave the revolver, to a policeman.</p>

I am a builder, and live at 250, Essex Road—I have known the prisoner some two years—he and his wife lodged at 250 after their marriage; they remained there up to the beginning of August, and then left—after that I saw the prisoner occasionally—after his home was broken up he came to stay the night with me—he came and called for me on Thursday, September 24th, at about nine, and I was in his company up to twelve o'clock—we went home to 250, and it was his intention to stay the night with me—he complained of feeling worried, tired, and miserable—he started undressing to go to bed; he was going down below before coming to bed—I said, "You will come back, won't you?"—he said, "Yes, I shall be glad to come to bed"—that was about a quarter past twelve—he did not return, and I did not see him again till after he was in custody.</p>

               <p>very bad—he seemed very excited—I knew him; it the time of his marriage—I lodged in the same house with him and his wife at Mrs. Dan<lb/>ford's; I have been there two years and three months; they were there for about ten months—the deceased was very violent and aggressive—I have heard her threaten and strike him on many occasions—I have seen her strike him two or three times—on one occasion when he was home late I saw her knock him down the steps and follow him down the street—I have known her smash a lot of crockery when in a temper—they con<lb/>tinually quarrelled—he was very kind to her, and continually forgave her for the violence she has used, and has expressed himself as very much attached to her—I know that he carried a revolver to protect himself, as he was the habit of carrying valuable property—he used to carry a life-preserver, but six or seven months ago he told me he should get something better, because a man had been found in the house where we were lodging, and he thought this man had come to rob him—the man was found in the garden, and I flung him out; he pretended to be drunk—the whole time I have known the prisoner he has borne the character of a quiet, respectable young man, but a more miserable life I never saw.</p>

I am a doctor, and practise at 2, Upper Street, Islington—I was known to the prisoner and his wife—the prisoner came to me in the early morning of September 25th; he said, "Come at once; I have shot her"—I said, "You must be a silly fellow to do such a foolish thing"—I asked him how his case had gone—he said, "It came on yesterday"—that referred to the separation—I went and saw the woman at the house, on the first floor—I examined her, and found bullet marks—the prisoner came into the room—I stayed till the woman was removed to the hospital.</p>

I am independent, and live at Weybridge—at the end of July I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> of the sale of a horse, in consequence of which I went to Stanhope Street, Euston Road, and saw the prisoner, who sold me the horse for £15—I said that I had not got the money at the time, but would write him a cheque for £15, and send the cash next day if he would return the cheque—he asked me to leave the cheque open as he had no banking account, but I would not do so—he was to hold the cheque till he got the money—next day I gave a man, named Smith, three £5 notes in an envelope, and he came back with the cob—he did not tell me what Sheen had said or done—the next time I heard of the cheque it was in Mr. Willis's hands, and I am now being sued upon it—the prisoner had no authority to part with it—I had not said anything to him about stopping it.</p>

He said, 'Leave off, or I will stab you.' I did not take any notice of that; then he stabbed me in the belly with a snob's knife. I was catching hold of him round the neck. I might have said I was going to throw him out of the shop. He did not say, "Don't go sparring about with me.' He gave me a slap in the eye. After he stabbed me I hit him.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Edward Beall, a solicitor, of 15, Copthall Avenue—on July 13th I opened the letters addressed to him at the office—among them I found this envelope, containing a copy of this circular, signed "Vindex," and headed "Important Notice"—it contains a series of libels on Beall, and refers to the proposed publication of a newspaper which is to be devoted to exposing him and his career—on July 16th, three days afterwards, I saw Nesbitt at Mr. Beall's office—he was introduced to me as Mr. Nesbitfc by Mr. Beall; I did not know him before that day—I saw his business-card in the office that day: "Nesbitt and Co., Iron and Timber Merchants, 35, Walbrook"—I had not seen it before that day—Nesbitt said, "I have just seen Mr. Houghton, and if you are willing to pay him £175 for the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189610190043"/>
               <p>bill, he is willing to undertake not to send out any more of these circulars, or make any more attacks upon you," referring to Mr. Beall; he was speaking to both of us; Mr. Beall had one of these circulars in his hand at the time—he said, "Have you Houghtcn's authority for saying this?"—he said, "Yes"—after that, acting on instructions, I went away with Nesbitt—in the course of the conversation Mr. Beall handed me this copy of a bill, which Nesbitt gave him; Nesbitt's card was pinned to it. (<hi rend="italic">This bill was on paper with the printed heading</hi>, "William Houghton, 55 and 56, Bishopsgate Street Within," <hi rend="italic">and was</hi>, "Three months after date, pay to my order £200 for value received. W. <hi rend="smallCaps">HOUGHTON</hi>. To the Leslie Syndicate, White House, Telegraph Street. Accepted, payable at the City Bank, Threadneedle Street. <hi rend="smallCaps">ALFRED BARNETT</hi>, for and on behalf of the Leslie Syndicate.") I went with Nesbitt to the office of Mr. Bartlett, a solicitor, of Walbrook, where I had been told the bill was—Bartlett was out—acting on Nesbitt's suggestion, I went with him to his office, 55 and 56, Bishopsgate Street, the address on the bill—on the door there were the names of "W. Houghton "and "The Financial Protection Association"—I do not think I had seen Houghton before—Nesbitt went in, and had a private conver<lb/>sation with Houghton for a short time—there were two rooms to the office; the one in which I waited was empty—Houghton and Nesbitt then came out, and went along the passage and down a few steps, and beckoned me after them into a large, empty room in the basement—Nesbitt there introduced me to Houghton, saying," This is Mr. Beall's managing clerk"—Houghton said, "What do you want?"—Nesbitt said, "I have seen Mr. Beall, and if you are willing to undertake not to send out any more of those circulars, and make no more attacks on him, he will give you £175 for the bill"—Houghton said, "I am willing to do that, but I should like to see Beall personally"—I said to Houghton, "What about the bill? Is it yours? Is it all right?" or words to that effect—he said, "Yes, it is my bill, accepted by Mr. Barnett"—he asked me to go back and see Beall, as he wanted the matter settled that night—I went back to Bartlett's office with Nesbitt, who suggested that we had better see the bill before we saw Beall—Bartlett produced this bill to us; it was not cancelled then—it has been cancelled, and this receipt put on the back since—I have seen Houghton write, and know his writing, and, to the best of my belief, this copy of the bill first produced by Nesbitt is in Houghton's writing—I then went back to Beall's office, and reported to him what had taken place—Nesbitt went with me, but stopped in the outer room; I saw Beall alone—I went back with Nesbitt to Houghton's office—on the way Nesbitt said, "We had better draw up the under<lb/>taking Houghton has to sign"—I said, "Very well," and went into the coffee-room of the Great Eastern Hotel, Liverpool Street—Nesbitt called for some of the hotel paper, tore a sheet in half, and wrote out two forms—he gave me one, and said, "You can take that to show to Mr. Beall; I will keep the other one to show to Mr. Houghton, and get him to approve of it and sign it"—he gave me this (No. 11), and kept that (No. 8). (<hi rend="italic">These were</hi>: "In consideration of your discounting my draft upon Mr. Barnett for £200 due for the sum of £175, I undertake and agree to agree to abstain and desist from printing or publishing, directly or indirectly, any further attacks upon you whatsoever.") We went from the hotel to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189610190044"/>
               <p>Houghton's office—Houghton was there alone, and we all three set in his office—Houghton said, "Well, have you seen Beall? Will he settle? Is he going to see me personally?"—I said, "No, certainly not; he won't see you. that you have written about him is so bad; and there is that shameful reference to Madame Rachel. Mr. Beall says if he saw you he should at once lose his temper"—Houghton said, "It takes two to make a quarrel"—I said, "What about this undertaking?"—Nesbitt pulled out the paper No. 8 from his pocket, and handed it to Houghton, who read it—Houghton said, "The spirit of the thing is here, but not the letter; I will draw up a much longer document," and he then sketched out ver<lb/>bally what he would do; he did not write anything at the time; it wound up with the same form as that on the paper—he said, "I should very much like this matter settled to-night, and we had better go back to Beall"—Nesbitt, Houghton and I walked to London Wall, and I left them together while I went up to Mr. Beall's office—having seen Beall, I went back, and found them waiting for me, as arranged, in a public-house—I told Houghton that Mr. Beall would not see him, and we arranged for the three of us to meet at the Bodega, in Coleman Street, at twelve o'clock the next day—before leaving I said, "Let us thoroughly under<lb/>stand, Mr. Houghton; you are to bring the undertaking and the bill, and Beall is to bring the £175"—I think I said I would bring the £175, as Beall would not see him—on No. 8, in addition to Nesbit's ink writing, there is, in Houghton's writing in pencil, "And I hereby undertake to enter into such other and further agreement as you may require"—about 11 a.m. on the next day, July 17th, I saw Inspector Downes at Mr. Beall's office, and informed him of all that had taken place—a few minutes before twelve Nesbitt came to Mr. Beall's office and asked for me—I went out with him, and we went towards the Bodega, in Coleman Street—he left me, saying he would fetch Houghton, who was waiting at the corner of the street—when I got to the Bodega I saw Nesbitt and Houghton coming down the street together towards the Bodega—Downes was talking to me at the time outside the Bodega, and I pointed them out to Downes—I left Downes, and went into the Bogeda with Nesbitt and Houghton—Houghton suggested we should go down into the basement; it would be quieter there—I declined, and we went into the back of the ground-floor bar, and sat together at a small table, and began talking—I said, "Some<lb/>thing unpleasant has occurred since I last saw you; you have been sending out a lot more of those Vindex circulars"—Houghton said, "No, I have not sent out any since I saw you; but I think I know who has been sending them out; they had a lot of them from me, but I can soon put a stop to it"—I said, "Well, I shall not go on any further in this matter without I have all the circulars that are left. What about the bill? have you got that?"—he said, "No, I shall want £25 before I get that"—I said, "What about the undertaking that you promised to bring? have you got that?"—he said, "No"—about that time he asked me whether I had brought the money—I said, "Yes," and I showed him £175 in notes—after saying he would let me have all the circulars that were left, he pulled out this piece of paper (No. 12), and wrote in my presence this authority, and directed it to Mr. A. J. Freeman, and gave it to me and said, "You take that to my clerk, Freeman, and he will let you have all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189610190045"/>

Freeman," I said, "Those seem to me to be the initials at the end of the circular"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Before I hand over the money I want the undertaking and the bill, and all these circulars that are left"—we began talking about the undertaking again, and he pulled out several pieces of paper from his pocket; they turned out to be the proofs of the first number of the proposed newspaper (No. 4)—he said, "Would you like me to write it on the back?"—I think he only meant it in a joking way—he pulled out one of the Vindex circulars from his pocket, and said, "You can have that; you have got good evidence of publication now," and he laughed—he and Nesbitt several times asked me to let them have £25 to go and get the bill; I did not do so—we all left the Bodega, and arranged another appointment for that afternoon, at 2.30, at the Bay Tree, St. Swithin's Lane—Nesbitt left me outside the Bodega, and said he was going round to see Freeman about the circulars—I saw Downes (who had been in the Bodega all the time, a few yards off, and saw what went on), and told him to attend the appointment in the afternoon—at 2.30 I went to the Bay Tree—Houghton was sitting alone in the coffee-room downstairs—Nesbitt was not there—Downes came in—I asked Houghton where Nesbitt was—he said, "He has gone to your office to fetch you; he thought you were not coming"—I again asked for the bill—he said, "No; we want the £25 to get it," and then he sent off Nesbitt to try and get the bill without the money—when Nesbitt had gone Houghton said he could give Mr. Beall a lot of information about those behind him (Houghton)—he said, "If Beall would only see me personally, I could tell him a good deal"—he said several times he wanted the matter settled that night, as he wanted to get away; he was going away for three months—at that interview Nesbitt produced Form No. 8, and gave it to Houghton, who began discussing the form of it, and wanted to alter it, and did alter it in pencil, and said, "Would Mr. Beall like that?"—Nesbitt went away to try and get the bill without the £25—before he went pen and ink and paper were called for—while he was away Houghton wrote several things in pencil, and eventually he copied in ink the undertaking in Nesbitt's writing (No. 11) on this paper, 5—at this point I was called out; Nesbitt had not come back—I said, "I am going to the Mayor's Court; Mr. Beall has sent for me; I will see you again here at five o'clock"—I went to the Guildhall Justice Room, where I saw Downes, and an information was then sworn, upon which a warrant was granted—I informed Downes of the appointment at five o'clock, at the Bay Tree—I went through from the Guildhall Justice Room into the Mayor's Court, and immediately came out again, and, coming through the hall, I met Nesbitt and Houghton coming in—Houghton said, "We came over here to see about this. You spoke the truth about coming to the Mayor's Court"—T think the appointment was then made for 4.30; he said he wanted the matter settled that night—I went to the Bay Tree at 4.30. and saw Houghton and Nesbitt standing in the street, just outside the Bay Tree—Houghton, I believe, said, "I am afraid there is another hitch; I have had a letter "(which he showed me); "Barnett has paid</p>

O. U. for £5 on the back of one—I told him I had no authority to accept those in place of the bill, and I declined to accept them—he wrote another undertaking there—all he had given me was the one circular and the order on Freeman—Nesbitt came back before we left the Bay Tree—Houghton told me Bartlett had had about £15, I think, out of the bill; I know he said he had £10 at one time, and small sums since—when I said I could not accept the commission notes, I said I was going back to Mr. Beall, and Houghton proposed to come with me to Mr. Beall, and try and persuade him to take the commission notes—I said, "It is no good"—we came out of the Bay Tree together, and were walking a little behind Nesbitt, when Downes came up and arrested Houghton—Nesbitt afterwards went with me to Houghton's office—to the best of my belief, this letter is in Houghton's writing (16). (<hi rend="italic">This letter, dated July</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th, addressed to Mr. Beally stated that the Vindex cir<lb/>culars had been written and published by Houghton.</hi>) The envelope ap<lb/>pears to have gone through the post—Nesbitt is not a client of ours; I had not seen him before July 16th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am Mr. Beall's managing clerk, and I suppose his confidential clerk with regard to transactions that I have to conduct—I have been with him for fourteen or fifteen years—I have had the manage<lb/>ment of a number of actions brought for and against clients—during the last two years, since I have been managing clerk, I don't remember any personal action by or against Mr. Beall—actions have been brought by and against him—he has been successful several times in actions brought against him—there have been more than 500 actions in the office since I have been there, for clients, not personal actions—I remember the name of one personal action where he was successful; I daresay, if I had the books, I could remember others—July 16th was the first time I met Nesbitt—if my recollection is right, Nesbitt came into my room with Mr. Beall, who introduced me to Nesbitt—I think one or two remarks were made, passing the time of day and so forth, and then the first matter of interest that occurred was Nesbitt's allusion to having seen Houghton—that referred to the fact that he had seen Houghton before, I should think—I had no inkling of what had taken place before—I understood that Nesbitt had seen Houghton, and brought some message to Beall—I know now that Nesbitt had been to the office before—I cannot say what had previously taken place between Nesbitt and Beall—I had not seen Nesbitt at the office on the 15th, 14th, or 13th—I cannot swear he had not been there on those days; I was told he had been there on one day, at all events—I was told by a clerk in the office, Reed, I think, that he wanted to see Beall, and Beall would not see him, and he must make an appointment—I won't swear positively it was Reed who told me that, but, to the best of my belief, it was—Reed is here—at the first interview Beall asked Nesbitt if he had Houghton's authority, and Nesbitt said, "Yes"—</p>

               <p>I did not tell Bartlett when I first saw him that I was a bill discounter's clerk—I did not suggest to Nesbitt that a form of guarantee should be drawn up—he suggested that, and said he would get it signed all right—I was acting throughout upon the instructions of Beall, as I understood, through the police, who were at work—as a lawyer's clerk, I should know of the offence of attempting to blackmail—I had never had legal business in connection with such a charge, except that Mr. Beall once defended a man, Walker, upon such a charge some years ago—I did not dictate to Nesbitt the terms of the guarantee (No. 8)—I rather think he asked me how to begin it, but not how to go on with and end it—I observe the legal form of it—I cannot say if Nesbitt had any knowledge of legal matters; he seemed to know a good deal about matters in general—I was desirous of obtaining the document as evidence against Houghton—my instructions were to ascertain whether Nesbitt really was authorised by Houghton, and to obtain proof of the bill—Nesbitt made one copy, and I think I asked him to make the other for me—he said he would get Houghton to approve of and sign it—Houghton had not seen it then—I did not ask Houghton to sign it; if he had done so it would have saved a lot of trouble—Nesbitt did not ask him to sign this document; he wanted him to write out one—Houghton altered it in pencil—he did not say he would not sign it—he said it was not the sort of document, and he sketched out another one, which ended with the same words—he wanted the docu<lb/>ment made longer, with the reasons leading up to it; he did not quarrel with the terms of it—he said he would like to see Mr. Beall; he would tell him a good deal more—he was not asked to sign the document—certain portions of it were struck out by Houghton in my presence, and he made pencil marks—it was left with him; it was never again in my possession—I believe the police were communicated with the first thing on the 13th as to the libel—I saw Downes myself on the morning of the 17th—he had no warrant then—I swore my information a little after four, on the 17th—before the interview at the Bodega at twelve on the 17th Beall had cashed a cheque and obtained notes for £175, which he gave to me to take up the bill with—I went with the notes to the Bodega—I showed thorn to Houghton; he would not believe I had the money till I did so—I did not say, "See, here is the money; sign the guarantee"—I wanted the bill, and he said he had not got it, and then threw doubts on whether I had the money with me, and I showed it to him—if he had brought the bill I should have given him the money—he did not take the money or sign the document, nor did he bring the bill—he did not refer to the fact that he had revealed himself to Beall as the author of the circular; the letter was not mentioned—he did not say that, inasmuch as the circulars were printed anonymously, and he was not going to use anonymous circulars I was welcome to them—to the best of my recol<lb/>lection, I do not think he said so; there was a lot of conversation—eventually, at the Bay Tree, they said the bill had been parted with, and showed me a letter from Bartlett—I made the remark, "There is an end of the matter"—I did not suggest that Nesbitt, Houghton, and I should go to Beall and try to arrange matters in some other way—I saw Houghton write the document (No. 5); he did not sign it, nor give it to me to take away—if Nesbitt had come back with the bill Houghton would have given me the bill and the undertaking—I did not tell Downes</p>

               <p>that he had written that document—Dowries was in and out of the room there—he was arrested not long after, but not immediately after writing it—I was not employed by Beall from first to last to entrap Houghton into signing such a document—Beall has been accused of blackmailing in some of these circulars and newspapers, which are only written for the purpose of blackmailing Beall; "Who's who?" is one of them, and that is since this case—I do not know if Green accused Beall of blackmailing some years ago, or whether Beall paid him £700 to withdraw the charge—I had my head broken by Green; not in connection with the £700—Green was a company promoter, I think, and Beall had presented a petition to wind up one of his companies, and Green first sent a man to assault Beall in his office, and broke all his windows—I suffered in the <hi rend="italic">melee</hi>, and was taken to the hospital; I think I went to the Court the next morning—I was in the hospital about half an hour—I took proceedings against my assailant at the Mansion House—I forget now who he was—I think the case was adjourned once or twice, and then, when it came on, I was ill with quinsy, and it was withdrawn—I believe all that arose out of accusations against Mr. Beall—I was a signatory to certain companies—fourteen years ago I might have been living with friends, or in lodgings; my real home was at Reading; I was clerk to Beall then—I signed years ago as signatory to a company in which Beall had some interest as solicitor to the vendor, or something of that kind; I think I only signed one, or it might have been two—I cannot remember the names of the companies; it was when I was a junior clerk, years ago—I had nothing to do with the <hi rend="italic">Financial Critic</hi> or "Craven Brothers."</p>

On July 13th, about ten o'clock p.m., Beall consulted the chief of my department, Mr. McWilliam, who called me in and placed the matter in my hands—a copy of this circular was shown to me—the object was to find out the printer and publisher of it—the same day I saw Beall again at his office, Throgmorton House, Copthall Avenue—I made inquiries, and caused inquiries to be made as to the person whose initials were on the circular, "A. J. F., 50, Albion Street, Caledonian Road"—the next day, July 14th, I saw the prosecutor, and reported to him what information I had obtained—on July 16th he came and saw the superintendent and me at the Old Jewry detective office, and gave me certain information, in consequence of which on July 17th I kept observation on the Bodega Restaurant in Coleman Street—about twelve o'clock that day I saw Crawley join Houghton and Nesbitt (whom I saw first), and go with them into the Bodega—they stayed for about an hour—about 2.30 the same day I saw them all in the coffee-room of the Bay Tree, St. Swithin's Lane—after they left there I went to the Guildhall Police Court, and after the information had been sworn I received a warrant about 3.45 for the prisoner's appre<lb/>hension for this offence—I got the warrant entered, and then went back to St. Swithin's Lane—I found the prisoner and Nesbitt at the corner; shortly after Crawley came up, and they all went into the Bay Tree</p>

               <p>it is striking under the belt, and I fear I can do nothing more in this matter, if this should have come from Houghton"—I meant that I would no longer act for a person who could send a circular of this description—he said, "Well, you had better see Houghton and ascertain if he sent it, and if it is him, and he will stop the circulation of these papers, I will see what I can do about the bill and the champagne"—he then made an appointment for the following day at eleven o'clock, and that was the end of the conversa<lb/>tion—after Beall, said he would see what he could do about the bill and the champagne, I said, "£175 Houghton wants for the bill, and £2 10s. a case for the champagne"—I told him there were about 100 cases—in the afternoon I called and left the sample bottle in the outer office; I did not see Beall—I called again on him the next day, Wednesday, 15th, pursuant to appointment, at eleven o'clock, and met him in the outer office—he was very much agitated, and said he had received a letter from Houghton, acknowledging that he was the author of the Vindex circular, and he could not speak to me then, as he was too much overcome; he added, "You may come back at three"—on the day before, Tuesday after<lb/>noon, I had seen Houghton about four o'clock, when I took the sample bottle from his office before taking it to Beall; that was the purpose for which I went there—I told Houghton, "I want a sample of champagne to take to a likely purchaser"—that is all that occurred that day—he gave me a bottle from a case in his office—I did not tell him who the purchaser was; I don't remember that he asked—I did not see Beall again that day—I saw Beall on the afternoon of the Wednesday in his private office—I had not seen Houghton between times, lam sure—Beall seemed less agitated; he mentioned again receiving a letter from Houghton—he said, "If this man Houghton means peace I will do the bill, and give him £175 for it, providing that he under<lb/>takes to withdraw altogether his circulars, and allow my clerk to go and look at the bill"—I said, "I will see Houghton, and ask him, and tell him what you have said"—an appointment was then made for next day (Thursday) at three o'clock, and I left and went at once to see Houghton—I said to Houghton, "I have seen Mr. Beall, who agrees to give you £175 for the bill, and he wishes his clerk to go with me and see the bill"—I had previously deposited the bill with Mr. Bartlett, a solicitor, of Walbrook, for an advance of £25—the bill was in his hands—I added that Beall would require Houghton to withdraw these circu<lb/>lars, and give a guarantee that he would stop all such libellous documents—I said that to Houghton—Houghton said, "I have no objection to his clerk seeing the bill, and I have no malice against Mr. Beall, and will be pleased to meet him on mutual grounds"—I said, "Mr. Beall is very much put out about a letter that you have written to him"—he said, "Yes, I wrote that document; I published the circular; I wrote to him, saying so, but, as I say, I have no feeling against the man, and will be pleased to meet him at my office, or his office, or anywhere"—that is all that took place that day—next day, Thursday, 16th, at three o'clock, I called at Beall's office, and he asked me into Mr. Crawley's office—Beall's office is beyond his; there are three rooms, leading in to one another—he introduced me to Crawley, and said, "Mr. Nesbitt, who has come to take you to look at the bill which I have agreed to discount"—I left the office</p>

I have got the money for the bill"—we went inside; he ordered some refreshment, and asked if we had got the bill—Houghton said, "No; it can soon be got by payment of the £25"—Crawley said, "I have got the money, here it is"—he pulled out his pocket-book and showed us some notes—he said, "Before I pay, this docu<lb/>ment must be signed"—he had got the guarantee which he had taken to Beall—Houghton again refused positively to sign the document—then they entered into a long discussion as to the nature of the document to be signed—Houghton would not sign it—he said, "I will not sign the document, and I will not take your money; but I will give you an order for the circulars, which are no good to anyone, as they are not signed"—another appointment was made for 2.30 that day—Crawley was to go round to Houghtons office to get the circulars—Crawley said he would endeavour to get Mr. Beall to the Bay Tree—I met Crawley at three at the Bay Tree; Beall was not there—Crawley in<lb/>sisted on having this document signed—Houghton said, "Let us see what can be done"—he and Crawley discussed the form of the document—Crawley said to me," Here is £25; go round and see if the bill is ready; I will give you £25 to go and get the bill"—I went to see Mr. Bartlett; I did not take the £25 with me; I was to bring the bill back, and then the</p>

               <p>whole thing was to be completed, and the £ 5 paid—Crawley did not give me the £25—I don't remember asking Crawley for £25 to go and get the bill; I wanted the whole thing settled at the same time—Bartlett would have sent the bill round by his clerk—Bartlett was out—on my way back to the Bay Tree I met Hough ton in a great hurry—he said Crawley had left suddenly; his master had sent for him to the Guildhall, and he was going to see if he was there—I accompanied him; at the en<lb/>trance to the large hall we met Crawley—he said it would be necessary to make another appointment for five o'clock at the Bay Tree, as he had not been able to get Mr. Beall to finally settle the whole thing—I went to Bartlett's, and discovered that Mr. Barnett, the acceptor of the bill, had paid the £25, and withdrawn it—I went to the Bay Tree at about five, and met Crawley and Hough ton, and told them the bill had been redeemed by Barnett—Crawley said, "Well, I don't know what can be done now"—Houghton said, "Let us all three go round to Beall"—I let them to go to my office, saying I would be back in a few minutes—when I got back Houghton and Crawley said they had been talking about this docu<lb/>ment, which they wished signed, and said, "We had better all go to Beall's office"—we left the Bay Tree, and then Houghton was arrested by Downes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Houghton about two years—he was the Financial Protection Association for about two months prior to his arrest, as far as I know—I was not connected with him in that business—I have been connected with him in business for about eighteen months—one part of that business was a wine business, which was carried on at my office, 35, Walbrook—I had that office for about nine months; I left it on September 29th, of my own motion—my solicitor, Mr. Bartlett, paid the rent—it was a matter of business between him and I—Houghton and I carried on the wine business in the name of Nesbitt, Oswald and Co.—we dealt in champagne and other wines—about £250 worth of cham<lb/>pagne was obtained from Mr. Lefevre, of Rheims, on credit, in the name of Nesbitt, Oswald and Co.—about £140 of that has been paid—the name of Nesbitt, Oswald and Co. was up at 35, Walbrook—after I left there, in September, the name of Bartlett, Checksfield and Co. was put up—this is my printed card, "Mr. Thomas Nesbitt, 35, Walbrook. Bart<lb/>lett, Checksfield and Co."—Mr. Lefevre's name also appears on that card, as if we were agents for him; that is what it was meant to represent—I am an agent of Bartlett, Checksfield and Co., and an arrangement was made between them and Lefevre for wines to be supplied by him—Bartlett, Checksfield and Company were obtaining champagne from Lefevre—I am Nesbitt, Oswald and Company; no one else is—after they left 35, Wal<lb/>brook, Bartlett and Checksfield came into existence—my name was printed on their card with that address because I was associated with them—the Mr. Bartlett in that firm is a brother of the solicitor; he is a general agent in the wine trade, with an office on the ground floor of 35, Walbrook—Houghton introduced Bartlett, Checksfield and Company to Lefevre—Houghton and I, as Nesbitt, Oswald and Company, had got wine from Lefevre, some of which was not paid for, and then we started Bartlett, Checksfield and Company, and Houghton introduced them to Lefevre—I don't think they have obtained wine from Lefevre yet—I paid the £140 to Lefevre by hills of myself and Houghton—I gave a bill for the first lot of champagne</p>

               <p>we had; that was dishonoured—I think this letter of July 15th, 1896, is in Mr. Checksfield's writing—he was a maltster, near Broadstaire, before he joined Bartlett—this letter has a printed heading, "Bartlett, Checksfield and Company"—I swore that firm's office was not at Walbrook before September 29th—I don't know where they were before that—I know very little indeed of Mr. Checksfield—I knew Hough ton, Bartlett and Checksfield were negotiating with Lefevre—I knew they were in want of money about that date, for they could not take up a dishonoured bill—July 15th would be about the time when these negotiations were going on between me and Crawley—I knew on July 15th that Bart<lb/>lett, Checksfield and Company were trying to take up a dishonoured bill of ours; I do not know if they could do it; I was given to understand the bill was renewed—the matter was in their hands—it was my bill, and I was interested in trying to find money to take it up—this is one of my cards: "Nesbitt, Oswald and Co., Iron and Timber Merchants"—I have been an iron and timber merchant nearly all my life, in Crooked Lane and Bishopsgate Street, and in Newcastle—I have left Crooked Lane—that business and the champagne business are not going on together—the wine business was really out of my line altogether—Houghton was not a partner with me in the iron and timber business, only in the wine business—it has not occurred to me that Beall has found out all about my champagne business through the sample bottle I left with him; he told me he wanted to sample it—I am not aware that Lefevre has come to this country to complain to the police about the transaction—I saw him over here myself—he came about these bills—I don't know that he complained—I was with Houghton when he was arrested; I knew he was locked up—I went to the Guildhall the next day, when he was charged—he was re<lb/>manded for a week in custody, and then for another week in custody, and committed for trial, and he has remained in custody up to now—I was present at the Police-court at each hearing—I did not give evidence—I have not before to-day volunteered to give evidence for him—I have had nearly three months since his committal for trial, and to-day is the first time I have spoken in public about the matter—I did not give evidence at the Police-court because I was not called—the prisoner was represented there by a solicitor and counsel—I was subpoenaed by Mr. Beall to be there, and by Mr. Davis, the prisoner's solicitor—I made a statement to Mr. Davis, in writing, of what I knew of the trans<lb/>action shortly after the arrest—I knew the prisoner was charged with this offence—I heard the whole case as it was investigated before the Alderman—I heard Crawley's evidence—I am now carrying on business at the office of a friend, Mr. Monden, a shipping agent, 12, Great St. Helen's—I have several matters of business—I am busy with a large estate of about forty acres at Lough ton, in Essex—there are building operations there, and I am supplying the timber—I am living at 108, High Street, Putney—my wife has an agency of Hetherington's Servants' Registry Office there—Beall was an absolute stranger to me when I went on July 13th—I did not go to him for the purpose of getting the bill discounted; I thought of it before getting to his office; it struck me as I was going there; it was more the question of the champagne that I thought of—I had known a gentleman, Mr. Fulford, for years, who knows Beall well; I told him what I proposed laying before Beall, and he said</p>

               <p>I could not go to a better man—the object of my visit was the flotation of a brewery company, but it struck me in going from Fulford's office about the champagne—I went about the champagne, and the brewery, and the bill—before I got into Beall's office I had it in my mind to ask him to discount this bill, which is drawn by Houghton and accepted by Barnett—I knew Barnett slightly; he is a financial gentleman of standing—he has large finances; he is a company promoter, I am told—I did not know that Barnett did not like Beall I know it now—this bill is dated June 18th, and it was drawn on that date, I think—I had not had it in my possession since June 18th—I had had the copy of it three weeks—I went about with the copy, trying to discount it; I laid the particulars before my friends—I never had anything but a copy of it; I had the original once—Houghton took the bill to Bartlett—I think I saw it on June 18th—it was taken to Bartlett, and £25 borrowed on it about a fortnight before July 13th, about the end of June—after that I went about to discount it—I took it to three people before I went to Beall—I first took it to the City Bank, where it is payable, to try and discount it—I went there without Barnett's or Houghton's knowledge—Houghton asked me if I could get it discounted—I did not hear what passed between Houghton and Bartlett when the £25 was advanced; I was not there—I heard Bartlett say at the Police-court, "I think it was Nesbitt who introduced this bill transaction to me"—I do not know that Barnett was interested in the publication of the projected <hi rend="italic">City Critic</hi>, which was going to libel Beall—I don't know that the account for printing the proof of it was sent to Barnett—I did not hear Mr. Bleech say at the Police-court or here that Barnett had Had the account sent to him—it was not my champagne that I wanted to dispose of to Beall, nor was it mine and Houghton's—Houghton's champagne was alto<lb/>gether different from mine; he had some, and so had I—we obtained it separately from Lefevre—that obtained in the name of Nesbitt, Oswald, and Co. was mine; I was responsible to Lefevre for it—I presume Houghton got his in the name of Houghton; I swear I believe that—I have no reason to believe he got it in any other name—I do not know why Beall should have been anxious to discount the bill and buy the champagne on the 13th, if nothing was said about the libel or the newspaper; I thought it was a good piece of business, £175 for a £200 good bill—I had not been hawking it about; I had been doing my best in private sources to get it discounted—I thought it was a very good bill—I cannot suggest any other reason why Beall did it; he was quite willing—I do not know what the Leslie Syndicate is—I cannot suggest why Beall should have said to me on the 13th, "Don't let Houghton know you have been to me"—Beall said to me next morning, "Do you know any<lb/>thing of a circular or paper sent out by Houghton?"—he was calling my attention to it, and alleging it had been sent out by Houghton; he was not sure—I said it was not fair, and "I fear I can do nothing further in the matter'"—on the next day, the Wednesday, I found it had come from Houghton—I did have more to do with the matter after finding out that Houghton had sent the circular, because Beall said that if he would withdraw these documents, he might see his way to do business about the champagne and bill in the face of it—nothing was stipulated as to what I was to get out of it—I expected a commission from Houghton, i</p>

               <p>I got the £175 for the bill, of 2 1/2 per cent, or 1 per cent., and there would have been the satisfaction of being able to get the £25 paid back to the solicitor, Bartlett, who was a friend of mine—I was not afraid that he was going to lose his £25 on this very good bill—I had no doubt Barnett would meet it at maturity—Bartlett was all right for his £25, but there was the possibility of getting the bill done, so that he might get his money back, and get the remaining portion of the money—I glanced over the circular when it was shown to me—I saw the general scheme was that this person was going to bring out a paper for the purpose of exposing Beall, and was soliciting contributions for the purpose, and that two City men had pro<lb/>mised £50 weekly to carry on the paper—it did not strike me as odd that Houghton was willing to stop the publication the moment I put the pro<lb/>position before him—it seemed to me he wanted capital to continue the Financial Protection Association business—it did not strike me that his way of getting capital was to threaten to libel a man, and then take £175 to stop it—I thought his object in being willing to accept £175 from Beall to stop the publication of the libel was to get capital for his business—he said he wanted money—the Financial Protection Association was to protect individuals in the country against fraudulent company pro<lb/>moters—that was my impression, and he said as much—I never entered into conversation with Houghton about the statements made against Beall—I did not interfere in his matters of business at all—when I put Beall's proposition before Houghton he said he had no malice against Beall, and was prepared to meet him and take the £175 against the bill; he said he was prepared to withdraw any malicious state<lb/>ments—he did not see Beall, to my knowledge—Crawley, on the after<lb/>noon of the Friday, said something to the effect that Beall refused to meet Houghton, as the circular was so disgraceful; he could not shake hands with him, and that Beall stated he might lose his temper—the only difficulties in the way of a settlement appeared to be the getting of the bill, and the form of the document to be signed—all Houghton wanted was some alterations in the form Crawley suggested—Houghton, from time to time, I think, drew up what he thought should be the proper form—the whole of No. 5 is in Houghton's writing—Crawley made it a stipulation, before parting with any money, that I must get the bill—what finally threw the matter off was because I could not get the bill.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as Geelkerken and Co., import merchants, at 7, Mark Lane—I had employed the prisoner from 1886 till about 1891, and had no reason to complain of his honesty—he came back about April, 1894, when he introduced Sharp, who generally paid in cash, and always in full, till about two years ago, when I found out that the payments were getting irregular—I sent him a monthly account the first time for £54 odd—I had before that spoken to the prisoner about Sharp not paying in full; he made all sorts of excuses; he said that Sharp could not pay, because he had to buy vans, and he had had bad debts, and then I heard that he had had to buy a second van—I received an answer from Sharp to my account, in consequence of which I went to the Police-station, and asked what I could do—I afterwards went with a detective and saw Sharp, who gave me these invoices (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>); they are all receipted by the prisoner—I have not had all this money—this is the sheeted invoice; it is signed by the prisoner as paid on September 2nd—the prisoner received</p>

               <p>a salary of 5s. and a commission and travelling expenses; his actual outlay came to about 7s. 6d. a week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner opened a few accounts for me during the seven years he was with me, and, with the exception of Sharp's, every account was perfectly correct—when the account was opened he said that Mrs. Sharp and her son were simple people who had been previously supplied by a Jew in the East-end—I did not say that I did not care about the account, as the business was small and conducted by a female; nor did Evans reply, "They are good people; we shall do good business with them, I will take the responsibility; you supply me, and I will supply them"—Sharp's account was treated differently from all the other accounts; statements were not sent in—he said that if I sent in monthly accounts they would close the account, because she was a woman, and did not understand business; we had an argument about it, and he said that if I sent a statement she would stop the account—I was paid occa<lb/>sionally by transferred cheques given to her, some of which were sent back as bad; I gave them to Sharp—cheques were sent to the prisoner's private address—I have since heard from Sharp that there were occasions when I could not supply goods, and Evans had to go to other houses and get them.</p>

               <p>were dreadful, and if she went with them again he would give her a hiding—I came out of the public-house, and asked her to go home along with me—I went a little way with her—the two women were jangling and going on their hands and knees, and swearing—we crossed the road—the prisoner heard the deceased and the other two women quarrelling, and he crossed the road and made a hit at her with his open hand or fist—he struck at her, but I do not know whether he hit her or not—it was towards the face that he struck her—they kept quarrelling, and we were going along; he followed—I said, "You had better go back with Clara, or they will begin quarrelling again"—about twelve o'clock I saw the prisoner standing outside the public-house—the deceased went across the road and went up to him—they were quarrelling—after that I heard her cry, "Oh!"—I went over and saw her on the ground—there was a policeman there then, and some people around—I asked the prisoner what he had done—he said he only pushed her, and she fell down—she was unconscious then—we got some brandy and water, but she would not take any—she was taken away on an ambulance, and the prisoner was taken to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by William Dennis and Son, of Covent Garden, at their warehouse, where empties are taken—I receive baskets, and give vouchers for them—on September 4th I had some baskets waiting to be called for by the carrier—they had been returned and paid for; and a man came in and bought six boxes marked T (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they have had tomatoes in them—I took them and gave him this voucher, worth 6s., which he would be entitled to receive when he presented it—I afterwards discovered that six of my crates were missing with the same mark—they were the very same six which I had left outside, and I had given a voucher for my own crates; we do a large business—on September 6th I put some crates outside, tied together with a peculiar kind of string to go away to France—during the day a man brought me four of those crates; I recognised them at once—he gave the name of Perry, and I gave him this voucher, which entitled him to 4s.—on the previous Friday I looked outside and missed four crates, the same number as had been brought in; finding that out I ran to our cashier and found the prisoner there getting the money for them—I told the cashier not to pay, as they had been stolen; the prisoner remained there, but I did not hear what he said.</p>
               <p>———I am cashier to Dennis and Son, at the office in James Street—the prisoner presented these counters for 10s., and I gave him 6s. and two 2s. tokens like these—if a man has twelve baskets of fruit we should charge him 5s. on the empties, and anybody could steal them and get the tokens—the empties are brought back and a receipt given—I cash them without asking any questions—he got two of these 2s. ones in change; he came back and presented the ticket and the tokens and said nothing, and Ooleman came in and said, "Don't pay that man the 4s. because he has stolen the empties"—the prisoner said that it was not so, and went away from the cash desk.</p>

I am innocent; I do not know how my man came to take tour crates, and not four baskets. I have been in business fifteen years, and never had a slur on me before. They were all baskets, both on the 4th and on the 7th. The man generally lurks about the market.</p>

About four, to go to Charlotte Street; my wife was to have met me there, and we were go<lb/>ing together to the Alhambra, but she came too late"—I said, "How do you account for the smell of methylated spirits in the place?"—he said, "I have never had any methylated spirits in the house in my life"—I showed him this bottle"—he said, "It is a wine-bottle; there is no methylated spirit there"—I rubbed it on my hand, and held it up to his nose and said, "What do you make of that?"—he said, "That is methylated</p>

I left on the table"—I asked her if she had left anything burning in the house, and she said, "No, I left a candle for my husband when he came home; "you went inside the coal-cellar; very likely you used a candle there—someone brought in two candles from another house; I would not let them use them about the place—I did not send you out of the house.</p>

               <p>43, Sheldon Road, and searched—I found a policy of insurance in a chest of drawers on the first floor, a bill relating to a bicycle bought on the hire system, and a letter calling attention to the instalments being very much in arrear; a weekly payment card relating to furniture bought on the hire system from Wood and Cole, 160, High Street, Camden Town—I found no lamp for burning methylated spirit or benzoline—it was Saturday night when I searched; I only found in the way of food about two pounds of potatoes, a loaf, two apples, and a pinch of tea in a bit of paper—there was an entire absence of women's underclothing—in the back kitchen I found some embers of paper and trimming materials, and on those embers were traces of a greasy sub<lb/>stance, such as candle grease—I scraped some up from the floor with my finger nail, and smelt it, and it was candle grease, such as, I take it, would run from the paper on to the floor.</p>

I am a house-agent, living in the Sheldon Road—on March 22nd I let 43, Sheldon Koad to the prisoners, who moved in on March 28th—the rent was 7s. 6d. a week—before the fire I went into the house on various occasions—I saw, in the front room, a hearth-rug, a curtain chain, a table-cover, and a clock a few days before the fire; on the night of the fire they were not there—the table-cover would be worth, perhaps, 30s.; the hearthrug, 10s. 6d.—I found a receipt for the clock for 23s. 6d.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the male Prisoner.</hi> When you came about the house you deposited some money—it did not appear to me you were only going to stay there for a short time—at first you spent a good deal of money and time on your garden, and kept the place in good order—I considered you a good tenant, and never saw you other than respectable—I have to report to the landlord about all tenants I let houses to, and I think I told him when you first came that you were one of the most respectable people that had ever been there—you paid fairly well—I collect the rents, and have to go inside—I cannot say you had less furniture than was in the adjoining houses—I have heard that two officials.</p>

               <p>from the insurance company have been to the owner of the house and expressed their surprise at your prosecution—I don't think it would be very difficult for anybody to enter your house without being noticed, and without using force; you generally left the window open—I think it would be difficult to get into the house any other way—no one could get in without breaking the door except myself—I have a key—I let you in one night when you came home without your key—I have a duplicate key to most of the houses—it is not the fact that the keys of most of the houses in the road fit your door—I am not aware that the next door key fits your door—I tried the key of No. 41, and it would not open your door—I did not try the key of No. 45—I don't know if Mrs. Hey ward's key fits your door—when I went into your front room a white tablecloth was on the table, and a few cups and saucers, a loaf of bread, and a little sugar in a glass basin, and, I believe, two apples in a plate—the table had the appearance of being left from tea, the cups and saucers were dirty—I think I should take off the other cloth if I had a white cloth on the table.</p>

I am manager to Wood, Cole and Co., furnishers, of Camden Town—on November 30th, 1895, we supplied the prisoner with furniture to the value of £12 6s. 6d.—on December 6th further articles to the value of £3 12s.; on March 23rd, 1896, further articles to the value of £3 6s.—all these articles were on the hire system, at 3s. 6d. a week—£5 10s. has been paid on account of the£18 odd, and £13 14s. is the balance owing—I have seen all the goods so supplied at the house, 43, Sheldon Road—the instalments have not been paid so regularly as previous to the prisoners' going to Edmonton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and value, of Stamford Hill—on September 29th, at the request of Inspector Nairn, I visited 43, Sheldon Road, and made an inventory of the furniture there, except as to certain articles, pointed out to be hired—excluding those articles, the value of the contents of the house to a private person was £18 3s. 6d.; £10 would be a good price for them to fetch at an auction—I found no velvet pile table-cover; there was no clock worth 26s., only a small drum clock, worth about 1s. 9d. when new—I found a very small quantity of clothing; no female underclothing—I found two men's jackets, one man's old vest, a pair of old cycling pants, and five pieces of men's under<lb/>clothing, an overcoat and four pieces of men's clothing—the outside value of the lot would be £3 10s.; I included that in the valuation of the furniture—the value of the whole property there would be about £38, £20 of hired stuff and £18 to the other—there was some bedding, which I in<lb/>cluded in the £18—there were no portable articles of any value in the house—I did not include the bicycle in my valuation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the male Prisoner</hi>. I carefully examined the articles—I valued a walnut over-mantel, about four feet across, in the parlour, at £1 15s.; I could buy it at that price new—there were two brackets which would not cost 1s. 6d. new; they were carved by machinery</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189610190081"/>
               <p>I should say—I should be very much surprised to hear that they each cost 35s.—I reckoned 6s. for a hanging lamp; that is a fair value—I valued a sewing-machine at £2; it was of German make—I have found the makers' name on it, Frister and Rosmond, of Berlin; and its outside value by auction would be about 18s.—I should be very much surprised to hear you paid £8—in the front bedroom I found two single feather<lb/>beds, a covering and pillows, a chest of drawers, old couch, a round table, a sewing-machine, three pictures, an iron bedstead, palliasse, mantel<lb/>board, small chimney glass, and two chalk figures—I examined the beds—I took no notice of the back bedroom, as I was instructed that the things there were on hire—I value the bedding and covering in the front room at £3; they would not fetch 30s. under the hammer; I should be ex<lb/>tremely surprised to hear they cost you £40; they never cost you more than £4; the two single beds are less than two feet wide—only a straw palliasse was underneath.</p>

On August 21st, about 9.50 p.m., I was called to the Manor Tavern, and saw the prisoner and a tall man—the landlord said that the prisoner had been annoying him and' the barmaid—the prisoner said, "What is it to a thing like you?"and shook this stick in my face—I said, "Come along, Shearman, you will have to go out"—he said, "It will be the first thing you ever did in your life if you put me out"—I pushed him out, and went and got the other man out at the door, and the prisoner tried to come in again—I pretended to go away, and he followed me and said, "You b——unfortunate puppy," and put his stick in front of my face; I put my hand up, and he struck me on my nose with his clenched fist, and threw me down, and the other man struck me with a stick—I tried to blow my whistle, and the prisoner struck me on my mouth, causing it to bleed—a postman came and blew the whistle, and the prisoner seized it; we fell, and he kicked me violently several times on my ribs, which caused me severe pain at the time; another man came up, and he got assaulted; a second postman came, and he was held back; another man came to my assistance, and he was struck by the prisoner; I was then overpowered—I could not blow my whistle—no assistance was obtainable, and I drew my truncheon and struck the prisoner twice on the head, and knocked him down; he and the other man seized my truncheon and dragged me some distance till the hand-strap gave way, and he got it, but I regained it—somebody in the crowd struck him with a walking-stick; I seized him by the throat, and he struck me a violent blow behind my right ear, and I became in<lb/>sensible till I found myself in a public-house—I was confined to my bed till September 6th, but was able to do my duty last week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I often have to turn men out of public-houses, but it is not my duty to do anything further—he did not strike me, but he kept putting the stick in front of my face—when I had got him outside he got just inside the door again, and I gave him another policeman's push—I was not losing my temper then, I was as calm as I am at present—I had no scrimmage with the other man—I gave both men a push, and got them outside—I then walked away a little, and the prisoner followed—it is not true that I walked behind him and trod on his heels, and pushed him along the street, nor did he turn round and object to my assaulting him—he did not strike me with the stick at any time, but his companion did—the prisoner merely held it up in front of me, and I gave him a policeman's push—I did not lose my temper—he was not in a very excited state when I turned him out—I left him alone, but he followed me, and it was not till I turned round that he flourished the stick—he was merely using vulgar abuse to me—I did not aggravate him; I advised him to go away—I have not lost my teeth; I can eat with them still—someone struck him on the head after he kicked me—he managed to get up first, and kicked me as I lay on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. On August 21st, about 9.55, I was in the Manor Tavern, and saw the prisoner and a taller man—the prisoner told the landlord he had knocked his half-quartern of gin over, and asked for another—the landlord refused him, and said that he would have to leave, or he should have to send for a constable—he said, "You had better send for two; "and the other said, "You had better send for four, "and shook side stick in my face—Matheison came in and said, "Come along out<lb/>side"—he took the prisoner outside, and came back for the other man; but the prisoner came back—I followed them outside, and heard the constable ask them to go away several times—they said, "You go away"—he said, "It is my place to remain, "and the prisoner struck him in the face with his fist—the constable caught hold of him—they struggled some time—two "buses" came up, and he ran behind one of them; the constable struggled with them, and they fell—the other man came up, and I drew the stick out of his pocket, and afterwards threw it on the ground in the public-house—I went to Plaistow to fetch more constables—there were 500 people, I should say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw no violence used by the prisoner till the con<lb/>stable book hold of him—I did not see him use the stick—the constable was walking up and down outside the public-house—the prisoner was in front of him—he told the policeman he was a b——Irishman, and he knew he was a man from Cork—that was not chaff; it was mere abuse, till he struck him—I do not know whether the policeman, being a Scotchman, was annoyed at being called an Irishman, but he caught hold of his elbow and asked him to go away—I do not think the man with the prisoner did the most of the injuries; he struck the policeman only once with the stick, and then put it in his pocket, and I took it out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a postman—on August 21st I was near the Manor Tavern, and saw a crowd; Matheison asked them to go away—the prisoner said he would not, and struck the constable on his face with his fist; he had this stick in his hand, and said that the constable had got a piece of wood, and so had he—the constable tried to get him to move on, and then the blow with the fist was given—I saw a taller man, but did not see him strike the constable; he tried to get the prisoner free—the constable called on me to assist him—I blew his whistle, and the prisoner asked me to leave go—I said that I would not, and he struck me; he fell, and Matheison with him—I kept my feet—Matheison drew his truncheon; I was prevented by the crowd from going to him—assistance came, and I left—Mr. Good gave me this stick, and I took it to the station—I did not see the prisoner kick the constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the whole of it from when it commenced in the street—I did not see the prisoner turned out of the public-house; the constable tried to get him away by persuasive language—he said, "Now, come; go away"; but the prisoner said that he would not go—I saw and heard all that went on—the prisoner referred to an Irishman other<lb/>wise than in a complimentary way, and held his stick up and flourished it in front of the constable, but did not attempt to strike him with it—the constable caught hold of his elbows, and asked him to go away, but</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ship's steward—on August 21st, about 9.30, I was outside the Manor Tavern, and saw the prisoner being taken out by Matheiso D, who said, "Now, there's a good fellow, go away"—the prisoner said, "You go away first"—he went a few yards—there was a tall man there—Matheison said a second time, "Now, go away, or I shall have to take you"—one of them said, "You will have to take both of us"—there was a slight struggle for a stick which the prisoner was waving about—he said, "You have got a piece of wood, and I have got a piece of wood as well, "showing him the stick; he then struck the constable a violent blow on the side of his face, and ran away with the tall man, and Matheison called to the postman for assistance—he had a postman's jacket on—I took hold of the prisoner, and there was a struggle to get him to the station; he butted at the constable—we got him into the road, and the tall man gave the constable a violent blow on the side of his head—he staggered, and we all strove for the possession of the stick—all that time Matheison was holding on to Shear<lb/>man—the postman went away, and the tall man followed him—the prisoner and I had a struggle—I was kicked afterwards—there was a large crowd—I fell at the edge of the pavement, and became half stunned—I got up and leaned against the palings for a short time—I saw the prisoner strike the constable on his shoulder and arm; he called out, "Help, "and I went to his assistance, and found them on the ground struggling, and the tall man kicked the constable, and the prisoner kicked him four times on the lower part of the body—some of the by-standers took him into the public-house in a fainting condition—the tall man got away, and so did the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A good deal of kicking was going on—when the prisoner kicked the constable they were on the ground together; he was not standing up and deliberately kicking the constable when I saw it—I did not see what happened when I was on the ground and the crowd on top of me—the constable fell seven times at least—I do not say that the prisoner did not stand up and kick the constable, but I did not see it—I saw the tall man kick the constable; he was standing up—I saw the prisoner ejected from the public-house; he walked out quietly and decently, and when he got out he stopped three or four yards from the door—he did not make any attempt to enter the house again, but he made three or four steps towards it; he did not go in; they bolted the door—he called the constable an Irish bastard, and said, "I have got a piece of stick as well as you"—the constable took it very quietly; he only ordered him off—the prisoner did not follow the constable; he stood still and said, "I shan't go home "; the constable said, "If you don't go, I shall take you somewhere"—about twenty people were assembled out<lb/>side the public-house—the constable did not push him; he simply said, "Now, go home, there's a good fellow, "but he had to use a little force—the house stands in its own ground; it lies back from the road—the prisoner was standing on the licensed premises when the policeman put his hand on him, that was twenty yards from the road, and he forced</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 87, Green Hill, South Plaistow, and am a tally clerk in the P. and O. Co.'s service—on Tuesday, September 8th, I was tallying cases of American tobacco out of the barge <hi rend="italic">Shannon</hi> into the <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi> a P. and O. Co.'s boat—there were over 600 cases, measuring 16 by 16 by 31, and all bound with iron hoops, which were nailed on, so that the cases could not be opened without breaking the iron hoops—it was my duty to stand in the barge and check each case as it was weighed, and make a note at the time—this is my tally book—I had a case marked outside, "E. and B., Sydney, 11132," going to Sydney—its weight was 229lbs.; this is the entry—I saw it go up on the crane into the <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi>—the crane would take about five at a time—I next saw the case between ten and twelve next day, September 9th, lying alongside the main hatch on the deck of the <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi>—it was then shut up, but the hoops were broken—I weighed it, and its weight was 178 lbs.—I did not examine it to see how the contents had been removed—Mr. Graham, the Customs' officer, and Mr. Baker, the stevedore, came soon after<lb/>wards.</p>

I am manager to Mr. Arthur Cameron Corbett, the freeholder of the St. Germain's estate—Mr. Corbett opened up the estate by building on it a number of houses—about 500 men are employed on the estate—Mr. Gee was paymaster to Mr. Corbett—the pri<lb/>soner entered Mr. Corbett's service about five or six months ago as a brick<lb/>layers' foreman—the workmen were divided into gangs with deputy<lb/>foremen over them—there is an estate on the property called the Brown-hill Road, divided into Blocks 4, 5, and 6—the prisoner was bricklayers' foreman and under him were Deekes and Wells—Wells was on the Brownhill Road as foreman; Deekes was in St. Fillan's Road—the course of business was to supply the bricklayers' foreman and deputy-foreman with a time-book—the bricklayers' foremen are paid for ten and a-half hours per day, and the labourers seven and a-half—it is the deputy<lb/>foreman's duty to enter in his time-book the number of hours per day the bricklayers work—the prisoner's time book would give the names of the men who were at work, and the number of hours to talled up, with the amount of money to which each were entitled—if a man finished his job or wanted his money, pay-off tickets were given to him, and on their production the cashier would pay, checking the tickets with the entries in the time-book on the Friday—I remember having a conversa<lb/>tion with the prisoner about his wages; that was, roughly, about two months and a-half ago; a discussion arose about raising his wages—I said, as the work was costing a great deal too much money, I could not think of it—I had said to him that his wages would depend upon how the work came on, and I could not see any perceptible improvement—Mr. Amery is a clerk in the office; he would be in the office about breakfast-time—on August 10th the prisoner came to me and made a statement, in consequence of which I gave him certain instructions—Mr. Amery kept me informed of everything that took place between him and the prisoner—it was with his sanction that Deekes was allowed to take £2 7s. more than he earned; that was re-paid to me by Deekes—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the fore-man-labourers' time-sheet; the whole of it is in the prisoner's handwriting; this sheet, No. 2, is also in his writing—in the first sheet the names, J. Priestly and J. Keswick are in the prisoner's writing; that shows that they had worked fifty hours and were entitled to £2 3s. 9d.—the last entry in sheet No. 2 is T. Wright, working for fifty hours, and was entitled to £1 11s. 3d.—in my opinion the names, of Priestly and Keswick were not written at the same time as the others—the name of T. Wright is not so</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189610190093"/>
               <p>Clear; it may or may not be in the same writing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a time-book kept by the prisoner, in which the names of the various gangs working under him are entered—the names of Priestly, Keswick, and Wright, are not there—various blocks are distributed over the estate, which is of consider<lb/>able extent—the entry of August 21st is the prisoner's writing—the name of Potter appears at the top, after that there is a space, and then comes the names of Priestly and Keswick, and T. Wright—these two pay-off tickets are in the prisoner's writing—these tickets are supplied to the prisoner in a book—on the strength of these tickets the cashier would pay the persons producing them—certain information was given to me, and the police saw Wells, the deputy foreman—Wells made a statement, and the prisoner was arrested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I engaged the prisoner about May 1st, he produced a book with printed testimonials, I looked through them, and said I would see Mr. Corbett and make inquiries, and, if everything was satisfactory, we should probably engage him—I did not make inquiries, and in the re<lb/>sult we engaged him—the work on which he was engaged is very exten<lb/>sive work—I am not in a position to say that the testimonials are not genuine—I did not make inquiries—I engaged him at three guineas a week, depending upon whether or not the costs of the bricklaying were increased—at that time the cost was about £6; I can't say that it has since risen to £9—he did not ask when he was first engaged whether we had a time-keeper—it is usual to have one at our busiest time—he would have under him about 100 bricklayers, 100 labourers and four or five masons—it would be possible for him personally to keep their time—he had very little other work to do—he had not the superintendence of the work itself—of course, he had to superintend the work, and see that the time was right, but his principal duty was to see that the men were at work—he is a retired policeman—he said no previous experience, and he gave it up; I have now an experienced time-keeper, and he does it quite easily.</p>

I could not tell, without referring, how many men were employed on June 26th, the number varied very much; it would take about a quarter of an hour to go over the works from end to end—I re<lb/>member a man named Scott being discharged by the prisoner because his work was costing too much; he had not given satisfaction to the prisoner, and fourteen of the men went away with him—Scott was not discharged because he was returning the names of men who were not employed—on a certain Saturday three men turned up for wages that were not down in Street's book, and on inquiring from Street he said, "Oh, yes, they were there, I saw them yesterday myself "; and on the strength of what he said they were paid—subsequently I said to him, "You must discharge Poole and those three men; I won't have them working on"—he said, "I want to get some information from Poole"—when Street discharged the fourteen men he had not consulted me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Beaconsfield Road, Catford—I am deputy-foreman on the St. Germain's estate, working under Mr. Walker—on August 4th the prisoner was general bricklayers' foreman; he was my superior; he had the power of discharging the deputy-foreman—I was employed on St. Fiellan's Road—I kept a time-book, in which I enter the hours which the bricklayers and labourers work in gangs, and that in<lb/>formation was given by me to the prisoner—on August 14th he came to me and made a proposition; he intimated to me that my work was turned out cheap, and it would bear a few pounds, and, if I was willing, Mr. Amery, a clerk in the office, was with him, I could easily assist him, by writing a dummy bricklayer, or labourer in my time-book—I said I would see what could be done in the matter; he went away then—I saw him again on the 6th, and he asked me if I had seen Mr. Amery—I said I had not—on the 8th he said, "It is no use this week; it is too late"; that was on Satur<lb/>day—on Monday, the 10th, he saw me again—I told him I had not yet seen Mr. Amery, but I intended to do so that evening—we knocked off work at five, and at half-past five I saw Amery; I said something to him, and he said something to me—I saw the prisoner on Tuesday, the 11th—he asked me if I had seen Amery—I said, "Yes; it is all right"—he said, "That's all right, but don't let anyone see your time-books"—on the Thursday I worked an hour and a-half short before breakfast—my average work would be about nine hours a day—so that would make my average hours forty<lb/>eight and a-half—my average pay would be a shilling an hour—he came to take my time into his book on Friday morning, the 14th, and he noticed that on the previous day I was an hour and a-half short; he said that did not matter, and booked my full time—that would entitle me to draw 1s. 5d. more than I was entitled to; I drew that, and repaid the 1s. 5d. to Amery—on Tuesday, the 18th, the prisoner said he thought he should be able to work a few more in that week, and I heard nothing further—from the 10th up to the 18th I kept Mr. Amery informed of everything that had taken place between myself and the prisoner—I know Felix Wells—on Saturday, August 22nd, I saw Wells and the prisoner—they came down the Brownhill Road towards the Black Horse public-house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was stopped for work that week, because I did not appear on the work—I have been stopped before, if I have not been on the job, not by the prisoner—he complained of some work I had done at Brown-hill Road, and I did it all over again—there was no ill-feeling between us about that—I know a man named Pierce; he was sent to me by the prisoner to start him, and I put him on—the prisoner said he would put him on as a full man—Pierce did not pay me 10s. for the first week and 8s. for the second.</p>

               <p>I told Mr. Walker everything that took place—On August 12th, before breakfast time, which is eight o'clock, the prisoner asked me if there was usually anyone about before breakfast—I said, "No"—he said, "Had I any money to pay with?"—I said "Yes, about £5"—he asked me if I was all right—I said, "Yes," and then he said Mr. Walker had offered him more money at the end of the first month, and he had not given it to him, and he was determined to have some money from some<lb/>where—on the 14th I saw the prisoner; he said he felt he could not work it that week, because the new foreman had been spotting about among the men; a new foreman, Ruffle, had been there a few days—on Monday, 17th, the prisoner said, "It will be all right now, Amery; we will have two or, perhaps, four in this week"—I took that to mean that he was going to work in two <hi rend="italic">dummy</hi> workmen from Deekes' gang and two from another gang—the following day in that week would be Saturday, 22nd—on 20th I saw the prisoner in the Brown<lb/>hill Road—he asked me how I was fixed for cash this week—I said I was not over flush—he said, "All right; I can get two in from another block; and we will be bound to have them this week"—I took that to mean that he was going to get in two dummy workmen.</p>

               <p>get Keswick's money, and gave me this pay-off check for it—on Keswick's pay-off check two hours are deducted, in the prisoner's writing, for short time—that was on it when he gave it to me—he told me to deduct that; it would allow for his leaving off that afternoon at three o'clock, because it rained—no labourer named Wright was working under me at Block 6, Brownhill Road, and no bricklayer named Keswick or Priestley—no men were entitled to receive these three sums—the prisoner told me when I presented Keswick's pay-off ticket to say that Keswick had gone volun<lb/>teering, or to put in his drills—the cashier is Mr. Gee—I wrote on a piece of paper, "T. Wright. Please pay bearer fifty hours, "and gave it to Shepherd—Shepherd took it on Friday, 21st, to Mr. Gee, and came back and gave me £1 11s. 3d.—on the same day I went with Keswick's pay-off ticket to Mr. Gee and got £2 2s. from him at 5.10—that same afternoon I met the prisoner, and gave him the £2 2s. and £1 11s. 3d.—he gave me back 7s. 6d.—about eleven a.m., on Saturday, the next day, the prisoner came and asked me what arrangement I had made about drawing Priestley's money—I said, "None"—he said, "The man's time is in, and the money must be drawn; you must give someone a piece of paper, stating 'Please pay bearer' to get the money"—I gave that piece of paper to James Bloom<lb/>field, who took it to the cashier, and Bloomfield came back and gave me £2 3s. 9d. in the yard, in Hither Green Lane, about one o'clock—the prisoner stood in the yard till all the men were paid—I gave the prisoner the £2 3s. 9d. at the Black Horse, Catford, about a mile from the pay<lb/>office—I and the prisoner left the yard together, and walked to the Black Horse—he had told me to wait for him till the men were paid—I do not remember if I passed Deekes in the Brownhill Road that day—the prisoner gave me 7s. 6d. back out of the £2 3s. 6d., so that I got 15s. altogether—those were the only three transactions I had with the prisoner—I heard on the Monday afternoon that the prisoner was locked up, and on the Monday evening Detectives Pearce and Small came to me, and I made a statement to them on the Tuesday evening.</p>

We went out, and he asked the driver if there would be any work to morrow. We then went into the Duke of Cambridge public-house, and I paid for five quarts of beer, and the landlord, we being customers, treated us to another pint. The prosecutor said, "I don't want to pay, because I left my basket here"; I said, "Recollect you will have to pay for as much beer as I paid for at the last public-house"; he said that he had no money; I said, "You have"; he said, "Search me"; and I just touched him, and he was smothered in blood. He pulled his purse out, and there was 11s. 3d. in it. I said, "Here is the purse, and here is 11s., and here is 3d., what am I to do with this?" He said, "Give me the half-sovereign, and keep the rest"; I said, "Go and wash your face, and let us be friends"; he laid down in the field, and said that he should lie there for the night.

I then returned to Mayford Bridge, where I got on the line, as I thought it was the nearest way to Working, not passing under Hook Bridge.

I can take you into custody; or you can tell me the way you did go"—he said, "I went over Mayford Bridge, past the Hand-in-Hand, passed Jackman's nursery, passed under the railway bridge, up High Street"—his father was present at the time—he said, "Tell them the truth, which way you did go"—he said, "I have told the truth; I went round the road"—he then went away with his father—he said, "I arrived at the station about twenty minutes to nine"—I made further inquiries, and saw him at his cottage—I asked him to accompany me to Worplesdon Station, where he was spoken to by Superintendent Robinson—I was present, but did not take a note—I took him into custody, and charged him—he made no reply—on the road to the station he said he was sorry he went up the line, he kicked up against the iron, and that he should not go that way again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Police Superintendent of the London and South Western Railway—on Friday, September 25th, I saw the prisoner when he was brought to Worplesdon Station waiting<lb/>room by Marshall—Marshall left the room for one moment, when the prisoner said, "Do you think I put it on the line?"—I told him I wanted no conversation till the sergeant returned—when Marshall returned shortly afterwards I told the prisoner he had made several statements with regard to how he got to Working on the Monday, and I was going to question him, but, before doing so, I cautioned him that I was going to take his statement in writing, and that he might be given into custody—then I said, "Now you asked the question: 'Do you think I put it on the line?' Did you put it on the line, or "did not you?" He cried for two minutes, and then said, "I kicked against it," (I took his statement down in writing. The original is attached to the deposition. I have a copy of it here): "It laid close to the line, and when I kicked against it then I thought it was a piece of the line. I am sorry I kicked it against the line. I did not do it intentionally. It very nearly threw me down. I went straight up the line afterwards, and got off at Black Street Bridge. I did not see the iron at all, and did not wait for anyone. I am sorry, too. It will be a bad job for my mother"—Black Street Bridge is the next bridge beyond Hook Hill Bridge, where this iron was originally—the prisoner was then taken into custody—I called his father in, and read the statement to the prisoner in the presence of his father, and he said it was correct.</p>

I live at Thorpe Lane Crossing—my father is gateman at Thorpe Lane signal-box—on Wednesday, September 16th, I was about two yards from the line, and about 400 yards from the signal-box—there is an advance signal near it—between six and seven p.m. I saw Painter and George Hibbert—Painter got hold</p>

               <p>of the lever of the signal, and worked it up and down—the signal went up and down, and the colours turned from red to green—Painter went up the ladder, and said to George Hibbert, "It is alight," and he came down and threatened me it would be my death if I told of him—Hibbert is a younger boy—I knew the prisoner—he has been to our school.</p>

I am signalman and pateman at Thorpe Lane Crossing, of the London and South Western Railway—on Wednesday, September 16th, the advance signal was worked up and down—I could see it by my repeater in the box, and by the signal itself—it showed the red and then the green light—this is not the first time it has happened—I sent my little boy to see on several occasions; these boys not only trouble me on coming from school, but it gets our people into serious trouble—I put on glasses, but could not see who it was—this happened between six and seven p.m.</p>

I am station-master in the employ of the London and South Western Railway at Staines Junction—between six and seven p.m. the 6.40 from Waterloo is due about 6.23—in consequence of information received, I went and saw a lad up the signal—not this lad—I warned this lad and two other lads coming from the Direction of the signal—I said, "Painter, I want to speak to you about playing with the signals"—he said he was not coming with me, he was going on an errand—he did not come—the red means "Stop," and the green, "Go on"—it is dangerous, because the driver does not look to see when once the signals are moved.</p>

I live at 57, Hayling Road, Croydon—I have known the prisoner for the last four years—she has been married to her present husband, the prisoner, about two years; she had two children, a boy and girl, by her former husband—the deceased child was born About July last—in September she was living at Vine's Row with her husband and the three children—on September 22nd, about half-past ten in the morning, the child <hi rend="italic">Gracie</hi> came to my house and brought me this letter in the prisoner's handwriting: "Will you let <hi rend="italic">Gracie</hi> stop with you to</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 73, Vines Road, Croydon—I knew the prisoner, living at 65, with her husband—on the morning of September 22nd, about half-past ten, I went to her house—the prisoner was there with the youngest child, in the perambulator; it was very ill—I had seen it before, and knew it was ill—the prisoner stood on the landing, crying bitterly; I asked her, "What are you crying for? Is baby worse this morning?"—she said, "No; I think she is better, but I am dreadfully worried; my head is so bad"—I said, "You have cleaned up very early this morning"—she said, "Yes; I am going out"—I saw that she had been writing some letters, and I asked her why she had done it so very early—she said, "It is time I wrote; I have not written since baby was born"—she said she had been to Dr. Beard that morning; she said there was nothing very particular the matter with the baby, but it did not seem, to be getting on—I said, "What are you going to do with the baby?"—she said, "Gracie will mind it"—I left her in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I stopped with her about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—she was sobbing, and in a nervous state—I have known her about two years, since she came to live there—I did not know her before—as far as I know she has been a good wife; I did not know her husband; she always spoke well of him; they lived happily together—there was no suggestion that she had ruined her husband—I should not think that anyone in their senses would say so—she looked very strange on the day I saw her, as if she had been crying a lot—she said her head had been very bad since baby was born; she had been very much more strange since that—before that she was bright and cheerful; she got worse gra<lb/>dually, and did not talk to anybody; that sort of thing began when she was going to have the baby; I noticed that she got more weak and de<lb/>pressed; she was more careless in her dress than she used to be—she said she could not sleep much.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She was very anxious about it, crying bitterly and very unhappy—I had not known her before her confinement, only when she came to engage me to attend her—during the time I saw her she was never bright; she had not much to say; she was silent, not given to say much—I did not pay any attention to her mental state; there was nothing to lead me to do so—a state of melancholy after con<lb/>finement is not unusual—I have seen the children—the youngest of the two was born in 1886—I could not say that a child born after so long an interval would be likely to predispose the mother to melancholia—the last time I saw the prisoner she asked me if I thought the baby would recover; I said, "Very likely"—she was crying before I told her that; I gave the child a white powder.</p>

               <p>me—he said, "No; I want to go to work"—I said, "If you won't go voluntarily, I shall take you, on a charge of stealing money from the milestone"—he said, "I am innocent; I did not go near the stone"—at the stone he said, "I stooped down to tie up my boot"—I was in plain clothes and Constable Nash also—as we left the stone he went away towards Godalming; he again said he was not near the stone—I said, "I will be strictly honest with you," and I pointed out the impression of a hand on the stone—he then said, "I can prove my innocence by the evidence of two men"—I said, "If you can give me any particulars, or write it down, I will make inquiries"—he wrote on this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the station in the evening—I read the charge to him, and in reply he said, "I know nothing about it"—I then read the letter to him—he said, "I know nothing about writing that letter"—I knew that he was residing in Godalming, and that he was at work at Lee Park—Milford is between Godalming and Lee Park—there is a Post-office between the two places—before I took him away from Lee Park I spoke to some workmen, and told them if they found any money to bring it to me—the prisoner was brought before the Magistrate on the Saturday morn<lb/>ing—on that day the witness Snelling brought these coins to the station at Godalming—he has since pointed out to me the place where he found them; it was exactly the spot where I had seen the prisoner stooping be<lb/>fore I got up to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I searched that place roughly—I made notes of the conversation I had with the prisoner when I got home after the hearing before the Magistrate on the 29th, when the facts were in my memory—I said before the Magistrate that I saw him stoop down, and that I saw him looking at the money—I said, "I saw him turn round and take the thing up and put his hand in his pocket"—I first charged him with stealing the money—I knew that the coin was in this piece of paper—I know the allotment ground opposite the milestone; I was in that, watch<lb/>ing; that was seventy-two yards from the stone—Nash was with me—I did not find the paper that the coins were wrapped in—speaking roughly I should say about 150 men come from Godalming to work at Lee Park—the main Portsmouth road goes from north to south, and there are two roads that turn into it, there are four cross-roads before you get to the milestone—I was concealed in the bushes; I could see between them; I made a place on purpose so that I could see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I did not see any other man besides the prisoner go up to this milestone; they were all going to work—the milestone is four feet from the road; there is no footpath on either side of the road—there is no foot track along from Milford, it is all trodden over—there is no ordinary track.</p>

On the morning of June 27th I was with the last witness near this milestone; my attention was di<lb/>rected to it—while he was giving me instructions I saw the prisoner coming along the road on a bicycle—before he got to the milestone he stooped down and picked up something white, and put it in his pocket—I followed with the sergeant, and he arrested him and brought him back towards the stone—he was riding on the machine; he had a small parcel on his back—I heard him say that he stopped to ease himself before he got to the stone—when he was brought back to the stone he denied having been there—the sergeant said, "I searched about for anything unusual,</p>

               <p>and if you will come back I will show you the marks of the bicycle on the ground by the stone"—the prisoner then said that he had stopped there; he made a motion as if he had made water there, but he had not time to do it—there were some men walking along the road a little way in front of him.</p>

I am a carpenter, of 49, East Street, Farnham, Surrey—I know the prisoner well; I did not know his wife by sight—on July 25th, between seven and eight, I went into the Lamb public-house with May, and called for a whisky and a lemonade—the prisoner served me with the whisky, and was going to serve me with the lemonade, when a woman in the bar, whom I afterwards learned was Mrs. Hitchcox, said, "That is a fine way to serve a customer!"—we were the only four people in the bar—the prisoner said, "Come round and serve it yourself"—she was standing on the customers' side of the bar—she went round, and when she got to the flap he struck her with his fist and knocked her back into the customers' side—he followed her round, and struck her again, and knocked her to the floor—she screamed, and some of the neighbours came in and said, "Try and get her outside"—about the time they came in I saw Nowell going by the house, and I called him in to have a drink—I was taking no notice of the row; I did not think it was serious—Nowell came in—the prisoner was going to strike his wife again, and Nowell went between them and said, "Remember, the house you are in, and what you are doing"—I asked Nowell to fetch a policeman, and he left for that purpose, so far as I know—he had just got outside the house when the women came in, and tried to get the deceased (who was on the floor, screaming) outside the house—the prisoner tried to follow, and we thrust him against the partition while she got out—he struggled to get out—when the deceased had had sufficient time to get into a neighbour's house we let him go, and he went outside the house—I remained inside for a few seconds, and then I heard him call to his wife, I thought, to come back into the house—I went outside, and saw him throw her to the ground—he was standing by her side, with his left arm round her, and I saw him throw her to the ground—he was on the pavement, or close to it, on the opposite side of the road to me; I was on the Lamb side—she fell on her right side in the gutter, I think—before I got across they were lifting her up.</p>

Is she dead?"—I said, "No, she is not dead"—he went towards her as she sat in the chair, and used filthy expressions towards her—he said, "May she be stiff before eight o'clock;" and asked the policeman if he could do with a bit of punching, and took his coat off and threw it on the table—I said, "I am landlady here; I will have none of that"—he went to his wife again, and used nasty words to her, and said, "I am willing to swing for her to-morrow"—he went out—we sent for Dr. Coffee, who ordered me to make her a bed and lay her down—before the doctor came the prisoner came back—I saw him coming alone the garden path, and I went to the door; a policeman was standing at the door and asked what he wanted—the prisoner said, "I will soon show you," and he was going to come in, but I would not allow him, and the policeman put him off the premises—the doctor attended the woman twice before she was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.O.S., M.D. I practise at Farnhan—on July 25th I was called to attend the deceased just after the accident—she was lying on her right side, insensible, with a little blood coming from the right ear—there was a lump behind the right ear—she was removed to the Cottage Hospital—I attended her until her death on Wednesday morning—she was not conscious during any portion of that time—I subsequently made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—externally there was a bruise on the outside of the right thigh, and in front, and some smaller bruises below the right knee; a bruise on the outside of the left thigh—with those exceptions, there were no bruises on the body, head, or neck—on removing the skin of the skull there was a collection of blood behind the right ear—on removing the skull-cap I could find no fracture, but on the left side of the brain, towards the front, there was a large collection of blood, and the brain substance under it was suffused—there was no fracture of the skull to be found, and nothing else of import<lb/>ance—there were four or five ounces of blood, half a tumblerful—the suffusion of blood on the other side of the brain was caused by <hi rend="italic">contrecoup</hi>—anyone filling on one side of the head may produce a suffusion of blood on the other side—it may have been caused by a fall and the right side of the head striking some hard substance—the suffusion of blood was the cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no fracture—all of the injuries I saw might have been caused by one blow and a fall; all but one bruise on the out<lb/>side of the left thigh might have been caused at the same time by a fall—such a fall as that described by Mr. Jameson could have caused the injuries—she was a strong, big, heavy, well-developed woman—I saw no marks on her throat—I should expect, if pressure had been put on her throat, so as to make a woman short of breath, to find marks on her throat—I found no mark on the back as if she had been forced back against the counter—if the evidence for the prosecution is correct I should have expected to find more signs of violence—I found no mark on the body, and no mark under or round the ear, except where it is alleged she fell.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. All the injuries and marks, except the one on the left thigh, might have been caused by her slipping down—she need not have slipped violently if she fell on her head against a kerb-stone.</p>

I was walking up the street with a woman when the man arrested me." I went back to the Tabernacle, and found Clark under a seat—on Hart was found fifty-eight farthings and some Jersey money, and on Clark 5s. 8 1/2d. and twenty-five farthings.</p>
