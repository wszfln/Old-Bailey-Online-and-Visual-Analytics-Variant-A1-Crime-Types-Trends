                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Redman's-row, Mile-end. On the 21st of November the prisoner Lee came to my shop and asked for half-an-ounce of "returns" tobacco—after he was served the prisoner Roberts came in and asked for half-an-ounce of "returns" as well—he was served—when he came in Lee said to him, "Captain Roberts, when did yon arrive?"—he said he arrived with the night-tide, or morning-tide, which he pleased to call it, and that his ship laid in St. Katharine's Docks—Lee said to Roberts,"—You are little aware who you are talking to; you are talking to Mr. Rolls's sister, the plumber, of Wapping" (I am sister to Mr. Rolls, the plumber, of Wapping)—Roberts passed round Lee, and came round to a wicket-door which I have to keep customers away—I pushed him back, and told him what he had to say, to say over the counter—Lee told me not to be alarmed, for Roberts wanted to leave his watch, and I need not be afraid, it was all right—I pushed him again, wishing him not to come in, but he insisted on leaving the watch, saying if it was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he should not be afraid of leaving it with me; that he was going out on a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>, and did not wish to take such a valuable watch with him; he would not take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he then pulled his ring off his finger, left the ring and watch, and asked for two sovereigns on them—he did not say the watch was gold—he said he knew my brother very well, he had done his ship—his name was mentioned, and on that condition I lent him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of my brother's name being mentioned—I believed that he knew my brother—did not look at the watch, to ascertain the value—Lee said there was a great deal of interest wanted among the captains, to get work now, and he seemed rather <hi rend="italic">huff</hi> and cross at it—I considered he thought my brother would have the work of the ship—I gave Roberts a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I have since delivered the watch and ring to the policeman—I had seen Lee before, but not for five or six</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale confectioner, at 57, and 58, St. John-street. The prisoner was in my service ten weeks as porter, at the time he was apprehended—he had access to the stock mentioned in the indictment, and could have taken it—he had been in my employ about two years before, for three or four years—I had a very high opinion of him, and recommended him to the police force, where he obtained a situation—about nine o'clock in the evening, on the 3rd of December, I received a communication from Mr. Caulfield, my clerk—he showed me some cur<lb/>rants in his apron—the prisoner was present—he cried, and said it was the first thing he had robbed me of, and he had merely taken them for a Christmas-pudding—I gave him into the custody of a policeman—I af<lb/>terwards Went to the station—the policeman searched him again there, and found about half-a-pound more currants in his pocket—his premises were afterwards searched, and all the articles stated in the indictment were found, all of which I deal in—the currants were in a bag, with the mark of one of my country customers on it—I can undertake to say that bag had been in my possession—there was more currants in another bag, and the liquorice was in in a paper stamped—I know the lozenges and other things—they belong to me, as they are marked with our stamp—I believe all the articles found belong to me—my stock is considerable—I should not be able to miss the articles individually—I should miss them in the whole—my stock has cer<lb/>tainly decreased beyond my sales—(<hi rend="italic">property produced</hi>)—when the prisoner was at the station-house he said he lived at No. 3, Swan-alley—in conse<lb/>quence of that statement I accompanied the police-officer to No. 3, Swan-alley,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184112130008"/>
               <p>but no such person lived there—I returned to the prisoner and said, "You don't live at No. 3, Swan-alley, you had better tell us the truth" he then said he lived at No. 6, Swan-alley, in the middle room—I went to No. 6 about half-past ten o'clock—I found nothing belonging to me in the middle room—in consequence of inquiries I made there I searched the front room ground-floor, and all the articles enumerated were found in that room—we do not deal by retail—we deal in all the articles found, and I believe the whole of them to be mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's clerk. I remember the occasion in question which called my attention to the prisoner—I commu<lb/>nicated what I saw to the prosecutor, and afterwards saw the property which was brought from the prisoner's premises—I was shown two bags—there was pimento or allspice in them then—I know this bag—it had been sent to a country customer and returned—it is my master's property—here is my master's stamp on this liquorice, which denotes that it was made at my master's premises—I know this tin—it is used to put goods in, and has a label on it, printed purposely for us—there is nothing in the tins—they usually contain acidulated drops—we found no acidulated drops—the other articles are such as Mr. Wilkins deals in—nothing but the liquorice bears the stamp—we have a great quantity of the tins—here is another bag similar to the one sent to the country customer, and returned, which belongs to my master—the prisoner was never authorised to take any of these things away, nor the bags.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How would the bags be sent back to you from the country? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the same conveyance as they went, and be brought from the wharf by porters—our porter would not go for them, nor take the goods out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Have you ever sold any of that juice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of course we have sold some, but we do not perhaps send out 25lbs. in twelve months—our dealings are very large—our returns are from 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I cannot undertake to swear the juice was never sold—we never sell by the stick, nor do I believe we ever sold 2lbs. at a time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was his duty as porter if he did not carry out goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Cleaning up the warehouse, and helping in the manufactory—he took goods out sometimes, but since he has been back this time he did not take out many goods—we send out four or five cart-loads of goods in a day—Mr. Wilkins lives at No. 57—the prisoner would have access to Nos. 57 and 58 also—he was not left quite alone in charge of the premises of a morning, but he might be an hour or an hour and a half at No. 58 alone in the morning—his lodging was about two hundred yards from the pre<lb/>mises—I can say that these particular sacks were in our possession within the ten weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I occupy a farm at Heston. One Friday, in August last, the prisoner was in my service, harvesting—he had been reaping corn for me, and had not done it to my satisfaction—I told him I wished him to alter it, and do it in a workman-like manner—he said, if there was any alteration required, I might do it myself—I told him I should not pay him until he had done it—he was at work with another man, his father-in-law—I then went into my house—this was about two o'clock—about nine, he came to the house, accompanied by his fellow-workman—I said I should not pay him till it was altered—he said he should not leave the house till he was paid—I went in, leaving him there, and closed the door—shortly after he rapped very violently at the door—I went out, and found him at the door, with his companion—I told him it was no use his stopping there, for I should not pay him till I saw his work done properly; if he would meet me in the field at five o'clock in the morning, if the work was then properly done, I would pay him for it—his companion heard what I said to him, seemed perfectly satisfied, and was going away—on his being about to go, the prisoner used some very bad language, and said he was a fool for leaving; he was not to be afraid of that fellow—he did not appear in the least intoxicated—his partner left, leaving him alone, and then he fol<lb/>lowed him—there is a gate before you get off my premises after leaving the door—when he used the bad language going out, I asked him what he meant, and followed him to the gate, and at the gate he said he would knock my b—brains out—he had a hoe in his hand, and swung it over my head at the time he used the expression—I had not offered any violence to him, or attempted to strike him—I did not observe any reaping-hook at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184112130011"/>
               <p>the time, if lie had one—he did not strike me with the hoe—I went up to him to take the hoe from him—Mr. De Carr, a friend of mine, who was there, came and drew the hoe from both of us—I was struggling for the hoe, and closed with him, in my own defence—I was within two yards of him when he swung it over my head—I merely went up to get the hoe, to protect myself, to prevent his injuring me—while we were struggling for the hoe, Mr. De Carr took it from us, and the prisoner then struck me with the reaping-hook—I felt a blow on my leg—I had not noticed the hook—I am quite certain I felt the blow on the leg before I fell down—I felt a sort of numbness in my leg, but did not know the nature of the wound—the blow did not cause me to fall—after the hoe was drawn from him, in the struggle, we fell together—the struggle continued after the hoe was taken, and I fell in the course of the struggle—it might be two minutes, or one minute, between my receiving the blow and falling—we had a pretty smart struggle after I received the blow—it was while the struggle was going on that he struck me with the hook—I did not see him strike me, or see the instru<lb/>ment he struck with at the moment—when I fell, I put my hand down, and felt the blood—the injury was two or three inches below the knee, in the upper part of my calf—I was wearing thin summer clothes—I am certain I did not receive the injury in falling, nor after I had fallen, but, in my judgment, a minute or two before—when I observed the nature of the injury, I turned round, and said to the prisoner, "You rascal, you have cut my leg, the blood is running"—he said, "Oh, no, it is not blood, it is mud"—it was not muddy or dirty where I fell—the blood was plainly to be seen—we had a light, which was brought up—I had got up when this conversation happened—Mr. De Carr put me into a chaise, and took me to a surgeon—the prisoner went away, and I passed him on the road—I met a policeman, and told him to take him into custody, but he was not taken till next morning—I am confident the cut did not happen accidentally in the scuffle, from the manner in which he spoke to roe before, and the way he threatened—the hoe being taken from his right hand, he had the hook in his left—after the hoe was taken from him I endeavoured to throw him down, to extricate myself from him—it could not have happened in struggling—I cannot say where his hands were in the scuffle—I have been totally unable to go about since—Mr. Emmett has been attending me.</p>

                  </hi>. In consequence of information I received on Friday night, the 27th of August, I went in search of the prisoner—I was not able to find him that night, but found him, about nine o'clock next morning, at the King and Queen beer-shop at Heston, on the Bath road, about a mile from Mr. Peto's—I asked him if he had not been working for Mr. Peto the last few days—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he had not had a bit of a <hi rend="italic">tustle</hi> with him over night—he said he had—I asked him if he did not give him a chop with a reaping-hook—he said, "No, I gave him a chop with this hoe"—(he had a hoe in his hand)—and he said, "It served him right"—he did not say why—I told him he must consider himself a prisoner—I took him hoe" to Mr. Peto's—on our way to the station he said he did not cut him with the reaping-hook, but gave him a chop with the hoe, and he was very glad of it, for he would have to suffer as well as him—I said, "You would not mind whose life you took away then, so that you had your revenge"—he said he should not mind being hung for it, and he was sorry he had not cut his head in two—I am sure he said that—I produce the hoe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in partnership with Mr. Frogley—the prosecutor was brought to our surgery on Friday the 27th of August, shortly after nine o'clock—he had a wound on the back, and upper part of the left leg, below the knee, transverse, across the leg—it was not a circular cut, but a flat cut, and very deep, about two inches deep in one point, but not in all—that irregularity of depth was not caused by the roundness of the leg—it was deeper in one point than you would expect from that—the deepest part was on the inside—it was not a wound which, in my judgment, would be caused by drawing such an in<lb/>strument as a reaping-hook across—I should think it more like a wound done with force—it might have arisen from a fall on a reaping-hook, if he had fallen directly on it—the first sensation, upon receiving a blow with a reaping-hook, would be numbness, from the violence of the blow—it is very probable that such a wound may be received, and numbness follow, and the party not be aware at the moment of his being cut—nothing is more common, and probably he would not for a moment or two be sensible of any violent pain—I have had some experience in such wounds—the cut divided the muscular fibre of the calf of the leg, and the integuments be<lb/>tween the muscle and the skin, and the fascia underneath the muscle, so as to get very deep into the fleshy part, especially in the one part I have alluded to—it was certainly a wound calculated to inflict grievous bodily harm, and to maim the party receiving it—Mr. Peto has never been able to use that leg since, except with crutches—I believe he now bears a little on the toe of that leg, but it is quite as much as he does—up to within a few days of this inquiry his life has been in imminent danger, from the</p>

               <p>time the wound was inflicted—it is only within the last week or ten days that he has been at all out of danger—I do not suppose this hoe could produce the wound, and for this reason, that, with that depth of wound, the external wound would have been larger when a wound is received in a fleshy part, especially in the calf of the leg, it gapes—I should say it is impossible this hoe could have done it—it was a more penetrating wound, especially in one point—more of a stab than a cut across—if it had been done with the point of this hoe, the external wound must have been much larger to penetrate two inches, because, to get the hoe in that depth, the surface would have been much broader than it was—it was certainly such a wound as might have been received from the point of a reaping-hook; and, from the testimony I have heard, I believe that was the instrument with which the wound was inflicted.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a lodging-house in Craven-street—the prisoner was my servant. On the 3rd of December I missed some tea, sugar, bread, and meat—the prisoner was brought to me by a policeman, with a jug containing meat and bread—the policeman asked me if it was my jug—I said, "Yes"—he asked if the bread and meat were mine—I said, "Yes, no doubt it is"—I had long suspected the prisoner, and had accused him of taking tea, sugar, and bread—I had missed articles of this description—the prisoner was then taken to Bow-street, and a key found on him—he was not present when a box was opened with that key—the officer returned to the house and opened the prisoner's box with that key—a bag of tea and sugar was found in it—it corresponded with what I had, and what I had missed—the jug is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Duke-street, Smithfield. I had some cloth on the counter in my shop on the 7th of December—I was out myself at the time it was taken, but I missed it in the evening—this now produced is the cloth—it has my mark on it.</p>

On the 7th of December, about a quarter-past five o'clock, I was at work in the back of the shop, and heard something slide along the counter—I lifted up my head and saw the prisoner putting a roll of cloth under her cloak—I hallooed out—she ran out, I followed her and stopped her—she let this cloth fall on the ground—I am sure the prisoner dropped the cloth—I had not lost sight of her—a man picked it up and brought it into the shop—it is my master's, and the one I had seen safe in the shop about ten minutes before.</p>

On the 7th of December Mr. Edwards came to me, and I cut off eighteen yards of silk—I went to the warehouse-door and saw the prisoner—I said, "Who sent you?"—he said, "I want the silk for Mrs. Barnett"—I said, "How long have you been in her service?"—he said, "Three days"—I gave him the silk, and said, "Here is the parcel, and the bill is inside."</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a wax-chandler in Piccadilly. I know a person named Campbell—these bonds were lodged with me by him at two separate dates, 29th of September and the 4th of October—four each time—I had lent Campbell some money, for which these bonds were deposited as security—on the 12th of Novem<lb/>ber, in consequence of seeing an advertisement in one of the daily papers, I went that same day to Campbell's place of business in the City—he was not at home—I then proceeded to the prisoner's office—(I had not known the prisoner before November)—I found Campbell there—after some time the</p>

               <p>prisoner came in—there was a newspaper there, and Campbell referred the prisoner to the newspaper, to an advertisement—I do not remember his exact words—he called his attention to the advertisement, and desired him to explain—the explanation, as I understood it, was that he had received them from his friends in Portugal, to be converted hen—(I do not recol<lb/>lect that he said any thing about the advertisement when his attention was directed to it—he read it)—I then pressed for the money, and some con<lb/>versation took place between Mr. Campbell and the prisoner, as to further security—I did not hear accurately the conversation that took place be<lb/>tween them—they proposed to pay me the money the next day—I said I had come to settle the business, and unless I had the money I would go to the Portuguese agency—they then spoke of bills and wine warrants—a locksmith was sent for to open the prisoner's desk—I ultimately got some wine warrants in place of the bonds—the wine warrants were sent to my house next morning—I kept the bonds—in consequence of seeing something next day in the newspaper, I sealed them up, and sent them to Mr. Har<lb/>ris's, my attorney—I afterwards saw them at the Manpion House—this advertisement is to the same purport as the one I saw—(<hi rend="italic">the advertisement setified that the lost bonds in question were null and void, and offered a re<lb/>ward of</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for their recovery</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am Secretary to the Portu<lb/>guese Financial Agency in England; their office is at Finsbury Chambers. The prisoner was in the employ of the agency in June and July last—he was assisting in sorting the bonds then out, and sent in to be cancelled and converted—these eight are bonds issued by the authority of our office, and which were brought in to be cancelled—I know the handwriting of all the official persons whose sgatures appear at the bottom—after the prisoner had sorted them, I made up a list of them, to see that they were accurate, and then missed eight 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bonds—I spoke to the prisoner many times about it, and he said he did not know any thing about them—I caused an ad<lb/>vertisement to be put in the papers about them—the prisoner had only to sort the bonds after they were cancelled—I do not know whether the per<lb/>son whose business it was to cancel them did so in the prisoner's presence—these bonds are not cancelled, at least, the part that is produced—if properly done there ought to be a line on this part—these are severed, but not cancelled.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, and have one partner—my place of business is No. 36, Crntched Friars—I have had some dealings with the prisoner. On the 12th of November, about one o'clock, he came to my counting-house—he said be came to settle the purchase of the wine, and to pay the balance—there was a balance of I think 391<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or something of that sort to pay on the purchase of some wines—the original amount was 691<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid by cheque ori<lb/>ginally, and wine to the value of 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. delivered—Mr. Boyn, our clerk, showed him into my room, and at the same time brought me the delivery orders which had been already signed, with the date, I believe, of the ori<lb/>ginal purchase, and reminded me in the prisoner's presence that it was a cash, or ready-money transaction—after a little conversation had passed, my clerk brought me in a little slip Of paper, showing how much the balance was, and said as it was a cash transaction interest would be charged—the prisoner looked at the paper and said that he thought there would be a discount for ready money, to which I said, "Why it is a cash transaction, and consequently there is no discount"—these are the two delivery orders which my clerk brought in—I said, it being a cash transaction I should have the money on the delivery orders, but previous to this, when he paid the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he had told us that these wines had been bought for a party in the country who had given this 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and not being able to come forward with the rest, was the reason he had not paid the balance at this time—he said the party in the country had sent orders to town to the house of Messrs. John Mitchell to pay it—I did not know that house at that time—he said they lived in Broad-street, and it was a very respectable house—his words were, "You will find it is all right, the order has come to Messrs. John Mitchell and Co., a very respectable house in Broad-street"—I then said if he would allow me I would send one of my clerks with the delivery orders to receive the money at John Mitchell and Co.'s—he said that would not look well, it would hurt his character, and it would appear as if he was not trusted—I said, but if I sent anybody I would send him in his name, not send him with him, but with the delivery order, so that his credit should not be affected—he said he had promised to be with the parties himself, personally to deliver the orders.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Pinto. I introduced the prisoner into Mr. Pinto's room—I said to the prisoner, "It is a cash transaction, and therefore you must pay interest on the balance"—I took the delivery-orders, and laid them before Mr. Pinto, then went into the other room, and made a little memorandum of the balance, adding the interest thereto—Mr. Pinto spoke to the prisoner in Portuguese, and after that Mr. Pinto, addressing himself to me, said, in English, "It is arranged between us that Mr. Basto returns me the orders or the money"—in the course of the conversation in Portuguese, I heard the prisoner mention the name of John Mitchell and Co.—in consequence of the prisoner's not returning as was expected, I went to his counting-house, and saw him—it must then have been a little before five o'clock—I left our office about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before five—I said I had called from Mr. Pinto, who was surprised at his not having returned—he said he had not been able to manage it, or to ar<lb/>range it—I then asked whether he would walk on with me to Mr. Pinto—which he did.</p>

I was clerk to a person named Campbell—on the 12th of November I took these orders to the St. Katharine Dock office—I had received them from the prisoner, at Mr. Campbell's office, about five minutes before—two are delivery orders, and the other two re<lb/>quests for warrants—I did not see the requests for the warrants written—I have seen the prisoner write, and believe them to be his handwriting—I afterwards obtained the warrants to which these requests refer, about a quarter to five o'clock that same day—I took them to Mr. Campbell's office, and left them there—the prisoner was not there—I took them to Mr. Jackson's, in Piccadilly, next morning, by Mr. Campbell's desire—the prisoner was at Mr. Campbell's office at the time I was desired to take them to Mr. Jackson's—he did not endorse them in my presence—these are the warrants I obtained—I believe the endorsement on them to be the prisoner's handwriting.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wax-chandler, in Piccadilly. I had some dealings with a Mr. Campbell—I made up something he owed me to 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the deposit of some Portuguese bonds—on the 12th of November, I noticed an advertisement in one of the daily papers, in conse<lb/>quence of which I went to Mr. Campbell's office, in the City—from what they told me there I went on to the prisoner's office—I found Mr. Camp<lb/>bell there—the prisoner came in afterwards—I should say it was about a quarter past eleven o'clock, about eleven o'clock, or a little after—I called their attention to the advertisement in the paper respecting the bonds—the prisoner gave an explanation that he had received the bonds from a friend in Portugal—a locksmith was sent for, the desk was opened, and a book taken out—the prisoner turned over the leaves, fixed on a parcel, or some entry in the book, and then wrote some figures on a paper—he said, "This is forty butts of sherry"—he turned to the book, apparently to select a parcel of wine to give me wine warrants—nothing was said about it that I am aware of—it had been said before that there were wine warrants—I think it was Campbell suggested to the prisoner that there were wine-war<lb/>rants, and then the book was turned to—it was said before the locksmith was sent for—I do not know what was done with the paper which the prisoner wrote—he took it with him—it was put before me—I was sitting by his side, but I had nothing to do with it—when it was put before me, the pri<lb/>soner said, "This is the order for the wine," or something of that sort—I think the words were, "This is for forty butts of sherry"—they were in a nook in the room, and in and out of the inner office while I was there—where they went to I do not know—after I had been there some time, the prisoner went away—I think it was about twelve or one o'clock when he left—I remained about half an hour, and then went away also—I waited expecting his return—I thought he was gone to the docks—I cannot tell what he said when he went—I was waiting for the warrants—an order to the St. Katharine's Docks had been written by the prisoner in my presence, and he took it with him—I left the prisoner's counting-house about one o'clock, and returned about two or half-past two—I found Campbell there—the prisoner came in afterwards—he told me the warrants were preparing—that was I suppose about three o'clock—I remained there until, I think, five—he was in and out while I was there—I was impatient for the warrants—he said they were making out, that there were a great many figures, and it took a long time to make themout—just before I came</p>

               <p>away Campbell and the prisoner were present, Mr. Gardiner, the clerk, came to me, and said the warrants were preparing, he shewed me a receipt from the docks, to satisfy me that they were preparing, and promised they should be left at my house the first thing next morning—either Campbell or Gardiner said so—the prisoner was present—the warrants were brought to my house next morning by Gardiner—they were not endorsed then—I saw them endorsed afterwards by the prisoner—he came into my house, and there endorsed them next morning, the 13th, perhaps about half an hour after they were left—on the previous day, before the prisoner went out, I said, unless I got the money, I would go at once to the Portuguese agency-office—that was about eleven o'clock I should say.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Clapham, and am in the habit of fetching my newspapers from town in a cart. About five o'clock in the morning of the 12th of December, I put 153 <hi rend="italic">Weekly Dispatch</hi> newspapers into my cart—about six I went to my cart, which I had left opposite the gateway in Shoe-lane, at the house where I fold and sort my papers—all my papers were then gone—I went to the Dispatch office to buy an equal number—I then came down Shoe-lane, and went up the Strand to Catherine-street, to announce to the trade that I had lost a number of <hi rend="italic">Dispatches</hi>—I saw Dunny, and told him—the prisoner passed me about half-past six, and I heard him call out "Here is the <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">Sunday Times</hi>"—I turned back, and asked how he came by them—he said he bought them of some man in the street, he did not know who—I called a policeman to take him, but he refused to do so—I then went with the prisoner to some persons whom he said knew him, but I did not find any person who would say any thing about him—he had fifty-five of these papers—it is the prac<lb/>tice of the trade to get them between five and half-past six o'clock—a per<lb/>son cannot get them without his name is down.</p>

I said, "Eighteen for sorts;" that is, for different sorts. I said I bought them in Shoe-lane; he said, "What did you give?" I said, "What do you give for yours?" He said he would call a policeman, and the policeman would not take me into the City. I took him to Shoe-lane, and Mr. Dyson said he knew me as being in the trade; he went to Mr. Taylor's, and there this boy said I was the man that took the papers out. I took the prosecutor to Fleet-street, and saw a man named Powell, who knew me. I bought two quires, and he lost five quires.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in Glass House-street, Rosemary-lane. On Sunday morning, the 12th of December, between eight and nine o'clock, I was at a beer-shop in the Minories, having a pint of beer—the prisoner was outside the door—I knew him before by sight—said to me, "<hi rend="italic">Flashy place</hi>,"or "<hi rend="italic">flashy chap</hi>," I cannot say which—I he said, "Go on; what are you hallooing at? what do you mean?"—I waved my hand at him, and I might have slapped him on the face, I do not know—</p>

               <p>he then called me "Irish s—," and "<hi rend="italic">Flash Tom</hi>"—that made me rather angry—I ran after him to Tower-hill—he ran away as far as Postern-row—I overtook him, and was going to hit him—I cannot swear I did not hit him—he stooped down, with his back against the railing—he drew his hand behind me, and I found myself cut in both my thighs—I saw a police<lb/>man, and said I was stabbed—the policeman took him—I said, "You have stabbed me twice"—he said, "No, I have only stabbed you once"—I was taken to the doctor's—the prisoner said to the policeman, "Here is the knife"—he had it in his hand—I am twenty-four years of age.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of police. I assisted in taking the prisoners from Islington-station to the police-court—in Upper-street there was a great disturbance and crowd collected round the officers—the persons in the crowd cried out—one in particular, though I do not know who he was, said, "Why don't you make several of them take you? why do you walk? don't walk"—that was addressed to the prisoners Wybrow and the two Ways—at that time I should think there were about fifty people in the crowd; several women and children, and children in arms—when we got near the turnpike Ching took hold of Saunders, who instantly seized him—they closed together, and Saunders threw him down and fell upon him—I went up and pulled Saunders off—he was kicking and making great resistance in every possible way—he had hold of Ching's collar, and was very violent—Sergeant North then came up—he and Ching took hold of Saunders by the collar, one on each side, and led him forward, he still making great resistance, plunging and kicking—when we got on to Arlington-street, opposite Sadler's-wells Theatre, Saunders again com<lb/>menced a great resistance, turned round, and tried to bite Ching—I imme<lb/>diately stepped up to assist Ching, and my attention was drawn to Norton, who called out to Saunders, "Give it him, go it, b—t him, kick him"—Saunders was then making great resistance, and kicking violently—Norton was about five yards off on my right hand—there was then a dense crowd, a great crowd, making a great noise—at that moment Ching was thrown down—I did not see who threw him down—he laid on the ground with the prisoner Lee, who had got his legs round Ching's neck—Lee was under<lb/>most, and was twining his legs round Ching's neck—both were on their backs—Norton still continued to make these vociferations, "Give it him, go it"—a person in the crowd undid Ching's belt by which Lee had hold of him, and also released his legs—Lee had got his hands fast by his belt behind, as well as his legs round his neck, and both were on their backs—I could just see Lee's head under Ching's belt—they were twined like two snakes—as soon as I saw Ching released, I seized Norton—he resisted violently till one of the letter G constables came up and took him from me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist and stationer. I was close by the Angel, at Islington, and saw Saunders in custody, and a large mob of people following him—I heard the mob hurrahing, which induced me to go over, and see what was the matter—I saw Saunders try to get away from the officers, by plunging himself backwards and for<lb/>wards—I followed them to Arlington-street—there was then a cry among the mob of, "Give it him!"—Saunders tried to throw the constable down, and at the same moment William Way came up behind him, to assist Saunders in getting away—he caught hold of Ching behind, and assisted Saunders in making his escape, if possible—Ching threw his arm back, and beat Way off—he and Saunders then fell down together, and then Lee, I believe, made the attack on him—I saw Lee there, struggling with Sergeant North, but I went to the station.</p>

I left off work about midnight; I met a girl as I was coming home, who asked me to treat her; I took her to two public-houses, and treated her; she then wanted some<lb/>thing to eat, and took me to a little shop in St. Giles's; and every body of experience must know the infamy and notoriety of St. Giles's. Well, I went; she had some soup, I had some bread and cheese; I then sent out for gin and beer; the old woman, Kennedy, came in, and had some; I felt a little stupified, and went out; the woman I had been with came after me, embraced me, and put her hand into my pocket; she then ran into a house over the way; I followed her, and there were three or four women in the passage, who pulled me about; I then went out, and thought perhaps I had only lost a shilling or two. I was going on, and these people seized me again. The money in my coat-pocket was my master's, as I can prove: the money in my fob was my own, which I had saved up. I hope you will recollect that this deceiver is worse than one of old: he could read the superscription, but this deceiver cannot. I hope you will "render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Martin, and live in Crown-street, Greenwich. On the 10th of December I sent my little boy on an errand—I afterwards heard a loud talking below stairs, and heard a slap—I saw my child crying on the stairs, and in consequence of what be told me I went down, and asked the prisoner why she struck the child—she said she would serve me the same, and with that she struck me with the dust-shovel, which she had in her hand—this now produced is it—it was without a handle, as it is now—she struck me over the left eye, and the mark I now have is the effect of the blow—she only struck me once, it was a very hard blow, and bled a great deal—I had not raised my hand towards her—I then seized the shovel—her son came and wrenched it out of my hand, and said he would serve me the same, if I hit his mother—I had not made any attempt to strike her with it—I had it in my hand, and I told her I would show it to the Magistrate—Mrs. Webb came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She says I struck her child; I am too fond of children to do so, and I have endeavoured to teach hers in the way it should go—she is a fortune-teller, and she teaches the child to sneak up stairs, and insult me because I am an aged woman, and a Christian—she struck me, and knocked me down. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not—it is all false—I had not the least inten<lb/>tion to strike you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She has threatened me these four months—she ran down two pairs of stairs to beat me, and struck me several times—she snatched the old tin thing out of my hand, and, being drunk, she pitched on it, and cot her eye. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

                  </hi>. I live down stairs in the same house with the prosecutrix, and go out to work. On the 10th of December, Mrs. Martin came down to know why the prisoner struck her child—the prisoner instantly said, if she concerned herself about that she would serve her the same—she imme<lb/>diately fetched her a blow with the dust-pan on the right temple—there was a great deal of blood—I washed it off as well as I could—it was a severe wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Her name is not Webb, it is Friend. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. That was my second father's name, but my own is Webb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She told me her name was Friend at the time she was confined with a second child, and several neighbours assisted her, to see that she should not make away with the child—she swore at Green<lb/>wich she was a married woman—if you knew as much as I did, the house would be indicted—they have owed me a prejudice some time—I think she says the blood spirted out—if it did it must have sprinkled over me, and I have the same cap on now—they were all tipsy—I was beaten down to the ground. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Not that I saw—I saw no one strike, or attempt to strike her—I only came to speak to the truth, to tell what I saw—I have no enmity against her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant of the prosecutor's. I fastened up the house on the night of the 3rd of December—the back-door was bolted top and bottom inside—I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock—the staircase-window was then close down—I came down a little before six in the morning—the nurse came down with me—the staircase-window was then a great way open, and the door from the passage to the shop stood wide open—the hasp was broken off—it had the appearance of having been forced open—the bolt was not pushed back—the back-door was open, and was kept open by the mat—I missed a quantity of boots and shoes from the shop, four spoons, an ironing-blanket which had been in the dresser-drawer, and a shawl of mine—some high steps were taken from the pas<lb/>sage and put to the yard-wall outside—they would be able to get out by standing on these steps and getting over the wall—they would then be in the highway.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of in<lb/>formation, on Tuesday morning, the 7th of December, between ten and eleven o'clock, I went to Berry's house—I found Poulton there—Berry came in afterwards—Poulton pointed to the skins—I took possession of them, and then went to the prisoner's—I found her with her husband—I asked them both if they had sold any skins to Berry—Mr. Bowler said, "No, I know nothing about any skins"—the prisoner made the same reply—I searched the house, but found no black skins nor any pink ones—I was present at the examination before Mr. Trail—I heard the prisoner make a statement, which the clerk took down—I saw her put her name to it, and the Magistrate countersign it—I believe this to be Mr. Trail's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The prisoner says, A man who I do not know brought the skins to our shop; I told him I did not buy them; I had a person close by, of whom I bought shoes, I would go and see if he would buy them. I took them and sold them, and gave him the money; he was not in my house at all."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not her husband tell her not to make any answer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear it till after she denied having any knowledge of the skins—he then told her she had no occasion to talk to me, to hold her tongue.</p>
