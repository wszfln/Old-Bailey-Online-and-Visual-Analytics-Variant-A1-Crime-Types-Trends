               <p>Fog. There was another Letter came on Sunday Night; this Man (Hunt) delivered it, and said he had it from a Sailor: When we took the Prisoner, the second Letter was produced, and shewn him; and he owned the Writing both of that and the former, and said, the Persons that brought them were Innocent. This Confession he made at the White-Hart Alehouse in Grace-church street; and he told us, that he had been under so many Troubles and Misfortunes, that he was weary of his Life, and was as willing to die as to live.</p>
               <p>The Second LETTER.</p>
               <p>For Mr. BELL, Merchant, in Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. BELL, Sunday, Jan. 8, 1737.</p>
               <p>'' WE wrote a very conformable Letter to '' you Yesterday, and have received no '' Answer; now we want the Money, and resolve '' to have it by the Bearer, or else your '' Life the first Opportunity. One of us went to '' the Waterman that brought the first Letter, '' and he says you was inquisitive after the Persons '' who sent it. It will be impossible to take '' but one of us, and they that are left will be '' revenged on you the first Opportunity, by Night '' or by Day. We are resolute, and value not '' Life, so desire you to send the Money, and '' with a faithful Promise never to divulge the '' Secret.</p>
               <p>'' P.S. Sir, We have as many Ways to keep '' clear of you, as you can think of, to betray '' us, for you are not the first Person we have '' borrowed Money of, the same Way. Let it '' be put in something that the Bearer may not '' apprehend what it is.</p>
               <p>- Hunt. On Saturday Night last he came to an Alehouse where I lodge, (Mr. Read's, the King's Head, on Tower-Hill) and he staid there all Night; before he went to Bed he wrote a Letter to his Sweetheart, and desired me to carry it to her three or four Doors from the House; I did so, and she sent him Word that she was engaged, and would not answer his Letter. After this the Prisoner was very merry, and bought Oysters to treat the People of the House. The next Day (Sunday) he call'd for Pen, Ink, and Paper, and went up Stairs, and wrote a Letter, which he gave me, and desired me to carry it to Mr. Bell, a Stocking Merchant, and he would pay me. I went, but Mr. Bell was not at Home, and the Prisoner having ordered me to deliver it into his own Hand, I brought it back. The second Time I went, I found Mr. Bell at Home, so I delivered him the Letter. He asked me if I knew what was in it? I told him, I did not; upon this he read it to me, and I was very much surprized. Why, says he, you have brought me a Threatning Letter, and you must tell me who you had it from. I was afraid the Prisoner would run away, so I went with Mr. Bell to look for him, and found him at an Alehouse in Grace-church-street, where Mr. Bell shewed him the Letter he had received from me, he owned he wrote it, and sent it by me, and acknowledged likewise his writing the Letter which Mr. Bell had received the Day before. This is the very same Letter which the Prisoner gave me to carry to Mr. Bell on Sunday.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Goodman. A little after 6 in the Evening, Dec. 23 I had been a Minute or two out of the Shop, and I heard a little Bustling, so I return'd and saw the Shadow of something in the Shop, and the Hatch at the End of the Counter open. I cry'd out, stop Thief, but before I could get to the Door, the Thief was gone. I went out into the Street, and heard a Noise like the falling of a Drawer. A Gentleman took the Prisoner and brought him back; this is the Drawer, which he confess'd he took out of my Shop, and all the Things mention'd in the Indictment were in it, when he took it away. I keep a Pawnbroker's Shop, but these Things are my Property; I have had some of them several Years. At the same Time, I lost a Bundle of Linnen which I never heard of again.</p>
               <p>Peter Deval I was coming that Night thro' Wide Gate-Alley and heard the Cry - Stop Thief; seeing the Prisoner run with a Drawer in his Hand, I pursu'd him about the Length of this Hall, then I saw him drop it. I did not stay to take it up, but continu'd running after him; I kept him in Sight all the Way, and in Gravel-Lane I took him. As soon as I came up with him, he told me I knew him, and begg'd of me not to take him; I did know him indeed, for he liv'd at a Livery Stable where I kept my Horse, but I told him he must go back to the Place, from whence the Drawer was taken, and I carry'd him back accordingly. The next Day he was carry'd before the Lord Mayor; at first he deny'd the Fact, but at last he confess'd that he open'd the Hatch, and took out of the Shop, a Bundle of Linnen which lay under the Counter, and gave it to a Confederate; then he went in again (he said) and took the Drawer. He impeached 2 Fellows with whom I knew he kept Company, and to them he had given (he said) the Bundle of Linnen.</p>

            . I live next Door but one to Mrs. Goodman. I heard the Cry - Stop Thief, and saw a Person about the Size of the Prisoner go on the opposite Side of the Way. I push'd after him and he dropp'd the Till. I stood by that, while Mr. Deval pursu'd the Man. He overtook him and brought him back, and we carry'd him to Wilson the Constable's House; the Prisoner deny'd the Fact at first, but afterwards I heard him confess it, and he told us he would make himself an Evidence against 6 or 7. The Constable keeps an Alehouse in Bishop's-Gate-Street, and us'd us very ill, and tho' we sent a Messenger to my Lord Mayor's, who brought us Word that my Lord was ready to hear us, and tho' we call'd a Coach to tempt him to go, yet he told us he had Customers of his own to mind, and would not go 'till he could spare Time.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Goodman. The Prisoner told us if we could go before a Justice then, we might get the Bundle of Linnen, but it would be gone (he said) if we staid till Morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Powel. The Prisoner confess'd at the Constable's House, that he went into the Shop, and took out a Bundle first, which he gave his Accomplice; that upon their urging him to make a second Attempt, he went in again and took this Drawer, with the Things mention'd in the Indictment. We took an Inventory of all the Things that were in it, as soon as we had pick'd it up, and they are the Goods mention'd in the Indictment; I did not know what was in it when I took it up in the Street.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Goodman. All the Things that are mention'd, were in it when 'twas taken away; they were all seal'd up before my Lord Mayor, and have never been opened till now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming past Mrs. Goodman's Door that Night about 7 o'Clock, and I saw a Boy run out with the Drawer, he dropt it, and I took it up; when the Gentlewoman cry'd stop Thief, I threw it down again, so they took me and carried me to an Alehouse. I am innocent of it as you are.</p>

He was in a blue Coat, and I took him to be a Chairman, so had no Suspicion of him. I pass'd on towards the Posts, under the Arch next Covent Garden, and there a Fellow stopp'd between me and the Posts and jostled me. I spoke to him, and shov'd him from me, upon which he mov'd on, but my Wife, (whom I was leading to a Coach) told me, she believ'd the Man had pick'd my Pocket. I immediately found my Watch was gone. I had look'd upon it to see what Time it was just before I came out of the House, and many Minutes could not pass between that Time, and the Time I lost it. No sooner had I missed it, but a Person came and told me he knew the Man that had taken my Watch, and that he had seen him commit the Fact. He acquainted me where he might be found, and I told him where I liv'd. The next Day when I came Home from Church, I had Information that a Watchman had been to let me know that the Man who robb'd me was taken; I desired a Neighbour to go and enquire into the Matter, and he accordingly did, but he told me the Man had made no Confession. As for the Prisoner, I cannot take upon me to say that I know him.</p>

            . I was going thro' the Piazza's that Night with a Captain that came from Bristol, and I saw a Gentleman come out of the Playhouse. I observ'd the Prisoner to push against him several Times; after that he snatch'd away his Watch, and I saw it in his Hand; but I will not swear it was Mr. Monday, if it was he, he struck at him, and then run away; upon that I came up to him and inform'd him he had lost his Watch, and that I believ'd I knew the Man that took it, and that I could find him out. Then I went a little farther, and saw the Prisoner again, with 10 or 12 of his Gang, besides Link Fellows; when I came up to him, they told him they believ'd he was snitch'd; upon which he ran a cross Covent Garden, and the Captain that was with me ran after him, but Boots would not overtake Shoes, and so we lost him. The Linkmen afterwards told us of some Houses where we might find him, and after searching several, we found him at Mr. Peartree's in Colson's-Court, Drury Lane, and the next Day carried him before a Justice. I am positive to the Prisoner, that I saw him very near the Gentleman; that he put his Hand under his Cloaths, and I saw him take hold of the Watch String, and whip it out of his Pocket. When the Prisoner was taken, his Wife swore bitterly that he should Puff against me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask this Witness whether he did not say at Peartree's that he could not charge me with this Fact?</p>

               <p>Mr. Eustace. On Sunday Night last, I was at a Tavern with Mr. Justice Midford and the Prisoner, and Mr. Current came in. The Prisoner desir'd to speak with me. The Justice imagining he intended to make a Discovery, desir'd me to take him into a private Room; there he told me, that he would put his Life into my Hands. I told him I did not desire he should do that, but if he could help Mr. Monday to his Watch, I would hear him with Pleasure. Upon this, he own'd he had taken it, and would take Care that it should be return'd to him the next Day. I went to him in New-Prison, and there he told me that one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173712130006"/>

               <p>Mr. Eustace. He was not a Minute in the Tavern before he spoke to me in the manner I have mention'd, and I told him if he would discover a Gang of 3 or 4, the Justice (I believ'd) would admit him an Evidence, in order to break up a Gang; he said he could not, for he was but just enter'd into a Gang, but he had (he own'd) taken Mr. Monday's Watch, and would help us to it again. I never saw the Prisoner before that Time, in my Life.</p>

            . The Deceased lodged in my House. On Monday Oct, 10, she went out in the Morning, and return'd about 11 o'Clock, and told me her Husband was come, and she was going to meet him, and to go abroad with him, and she borrow'd a Hood and Cloak of my Wife. But she not coming Home all Night, I blam'd my Wife for being so free in lending her Things; upon which she said she would get Mrs. Lamb to go to the Prisoner's Master, to know what was become of the Woman Some Time after this, Mrs. Lamb came and told me, she had been at Mr. Cokes, and the Prisoner had told her he had not seen any Thing of his Wife, but if the Hood and Cloak did not come Home again, he would pay for them. Sometime after this, I was mentioning the Thing to a young Man, who came to my House, and he inform'd me, that the Prisoner fetch'd his Wife out in a Chaise from the Woolpack, a Publick House in Monkwell-Street. The Prisoner had promised to pay for the Things if they should not be return'd; but on Tuesday the 11th of Oct. about 2 or 3 o'Clock in the Afternoon, a Man brought to me in the Shop a Bundle, with a Letter: I asked the Messenger from whence it came? He told me it came by the Post, and away he went immediately. I open'd the Bundle, and found the Hood and Cloak, and this Letter with them, which I have compar'd with about 20 Letters of the Prisoner's own Hand-writing, found since he absconded, and I apprehend this (which I receiv'd with the Things) is the same Hand with the rest. I examin'd the outside of the Bundle for the Post Mark, but could find none. What made me suspect the Prisoner the more, was my finding this Stuff in one of the Letters to his Wife; I think they call it Savin, and there are some Directions in the Letter, concerning the poisoning his Children.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coke. I have some Knowledge of the Prisoner's Hand-writing, and I take this Letter (which came with the Bundle) to be wrote by him. I have seen him write, and have Receipts now in Court, and a Letter which he sent me the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173712130007"/> Day after the Fact was committed, and they seem all to be wrote by the same Hand.</p>
               <p>The Letter produc'd by Mr. Barber, was read.</p>
               <p>Mrs. BARBER,</p>
               <p>I Have sent your Cloak and Hood, and if that Person comes, that I used to call my Husband, for the Box, let him have it; for I promised when he parted with me, to leave it at Mrs. Lamb's till he called for it, and was never to see him any more: When I heard he was coming, I thought it my prudent Way to make off, because I have run him so much in Debt. I am now gone to a Relation in the Wild of Kent. Take what other Things there are left, I mean, to pay you and Mrs. Lambe; if there should not be enough, what is left unpaid, I will send as soon as God sends me any (Thing;) but I was ashamed to stay, when I found it was known that I was not his Wife.</p>

               <p>Mr. Barber. Chambers was the Deceased's Maiden Name; and this is the very Letter which I received with the Hood and Cloak on Tuesday October 11. When the Prisoner was examined before the Lord-Mayor, I was present, and heard him own, that he took her out in a Chaise from a House near Cripplegate, and that he delivered her to a Man at the Monument. After I had received this Letter, I went to Mrs. Lamb's, and there I found the Prisoner; I told him I was afraid he had made away with his Wife; he declared his Innocence, and I told him, I had received a Letter which tended to make him innocent, but I doubt you wrote that Letter yourself. Upon this he burst out a crying, and desired me to have a Care what I said, for (says he) my Master will not trust me to shave him, if he should hear I am suspected of such a Thing I charged him with having taken his Wife out in a Chaise from a House at Cripplegate; but he denied it to me, and said he was that Night at the Playhouse, without mentioning which of them.

When the Prisoner was before the Lord-Mayor, among other Questions, he was asked how he came by the Chal'e again, for it appeared that he brought it home again at Night? His Answer was, That he left his Wife and the Chaise with another Man at the Monument, who drove away with her, and that he found it again at Night near the same Place, a Boy having brought it thither.</p>

The Deceased having told me when she went out, that she was going to meet her Husband, who was come that Morning out of Kent by the Hoy, I sent to the Master of the Hoy, and found that she had met him that Morning. I was uneasy about my Hood and Cloak, but the next Afternoon (Tuesday) the same Hood and Cloak which I lent the Deceased, was brought Home, with the Letter that has been read, by a Man who said the Parcel came by the Post; the Apron was found in Mr. Coke's House after the Prisoner absconded.

About half an Hour afterwards I saw the Prisoner (if a Man may swear through the Glass) in a Blue Livery, answering to the Description that the Deceased had given me, with the Chaise, at the End of Hart Street, near Cripplegate; as soon as she saw him she started up, and said she must be gone; and I saw her go down the Street towards him.</p>

            's on Blackheath. He had the Chaise from us between 2 and 3 in the Afternoon, and my Husband help'd him to put the Horse in it. The Same Night about 12 o'Clock, the Prisoner brought Home the Horse and the Chaise, and I saw my Husband unharness the Horse; then he desired to know if he could not lie at our House that Night; but we told him we had People come from Canterbury, and that our Beds were full. The Prisoner said, if they were Canterbury Men he would go and see if he knew any of them, and he went into the Rooms where they were; but not knowing any of them, he said he would go Home to his Master's House.</p>

The Prisoner paid me 2s. for the Chaise, and Mr. Millings at the Three Colts, had 4s. for the Horse; I saw him drive away, and when he returned with the Horse and Chaise at 12 o'Clock at Night, I told him he had been a long while at Blackheath; I have been further (says he) I have been at Dartford. Have you, says I? then the Horse has had a bloody hard Job of it, to go so far in so little Time, when the Roads are so very bad. The Horse had sweated much, but the Sweat was dry'd upon him when he came Home.</p>

            . On the 10th of October in the Morning, the Deceased came to my Master Coke's House, to know if her Husband was come from Canterbury; when she heard that he was expected that Day by the Hoy, she said she would go down and meet him at the Hoy. About 11 o'Clock she returned to our House, and told us he was come, and she had got his Bread and Cheese, and the Dram that his Mistress had given him, in case he should be sick, and she could not stay at all with us, because he had appointed her to meet him some where by Wood Street, to carry her to see a Place which he had provided for her. I asked her if she would go with him, when she knew he had attempted to poison her? Yes, says she, I will, I neither love him nor fear him. I desired her to let me hear from her, and she told me she could, and that if I did not see her next Morning, or before Noon, I might depend upon it she was kill'd; then she went away. Between 12 and 1 o'Clock that Night, the Prisoner came Home to my Master's House, and complained that his Back aked very much, and he wished he had had the Dram that his Mistress had given him; but (says he) I left it behind me at a Publick House. Upon that I asked him if he had not seen his Wife? No, says he, as God's my Judge, I have not seen her since I parted with her at my Uncle's: I have had two Children by her, but I have parted with her. While we were talking, a Woman knocked at the Door and enquired for him. He took her into the Laundry, as she passed along, I heard her say, - Why, when did you see her? Hearing this, I went into the Laundry, and asked her, if she did not come to enquire after George's (the Prisoner's) Wife, or Sister? (as he call'd her.) Yes, she told me she did, and asked me if she did not come there last Night. I told her she did not, and would have had more Discourse with her, but the Prisoner was too intent upon getting her out of Doors, so I followed her, and overtaking her, I took her to the Three-Tun Alehouse; I asked her what the Prisoner had said concerning the Deceased? Why (says she) he says she is none of his Wife, and what can any body do to him then? But must the Woman be murdered, says I, because she is not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173712130009"/> his Wife? I am resolved I will go down to the Hoy, and enquire what Time she was there; and accordingly, I took my Master's Brother's Man with me, and we went down to the Hoy, and heard the Deceased had been there to enquire for the Prisoner; then we went home and acquainted our People with what we had done, and we went directly to Mrs. Lamb's and enquired for the Prisoner; we found him there, and I asked him if he had found his Sister? (as he used to call her.) No, says he, nor d - n her, do I intend to look after her. I told him I had been at the Hoy, and that he come from thence at 11 o'Clock, and I asked him where he had been from that Time, 10 12 or 1 o'Clock that Night? He said he had been to see a Play at Drury-Lane Playhouse. From Mrs. Lamb's he came Home with me, and as we came along together, he told me I had taken a great deal of Pains about the Deceased, and he would make me amends. I had the Letter that was sent Mr. Barber, with the Hood and Cloak at the same Time about me, and upon comparing it with one the Prisoner sent me, about a Week after he absconded, I do believe it to be his own Hand-writing. This is a Cap, Handkerchief, and Apron (shewing them to the Court) which my Master's Brother's Man found in my Presence (after the Prisoner was run away) in a Place where he lock'd up the Plate. We were forced to open the Lock, because he was gone away with the Key in his Pocket, and there we found these Things.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Barber. I believe this is the Apron I lent the Deceased, but this Handkerchief I am positive to.</p>
               <p>Prosser. I taxed the Prisoner with having seen her that Morning, and he then told me positively he had not, and that if he ever did see her again, he would shoot her. But when he was examined before the Lord-Mayor, he confessed that he took her from Wood Street, and delivered her at the Monument to a Stranger, and if she was killed, he supposed it was for the Sake of a Guinea which he had given her to buy her a Gown to go to her Place in. He likewise owned that he had seen her at Bear Key that Morning, and that he bid her go Home and get a clean Apron, that she might go out with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were there any Marks of this Villainy on my Cloaths?</p>
               <p>Prosser. No; only you complained of a Pain in your back.</p>

               <p>'' I Find how the Villainy has been contrived '' that sent me away, but hope God will provide '' for me. She met me at Bear-Key, and I '' was surprized to see her, having parted with her '' before. So, says she, how do you do? My '' Heart came in my Mouth, and I could make '' her no Answer. Well, says she, if you turn '' me off to seek my Fortune, will you tell me '' good News? My Resolution is, says I, to have '' no more to say to you. Has the young Man '' had his Shirts? Yes, says she. Have you got '' a Service in Town, or do you go to your Aunts, '' says I? I am to have a Nurse-Child from Putney, '' says she, and there is a young Man who '' knows you very well, will help me to the Child, '' but I want Money to pay for a Horse and Chaise '' to carry me thither, and this is the last Time '' I'll trouble you, says she. I being over-joy'd '' at that, said, I would hire one for her. She '' said if I would give her the Money, she would '' hire one herself. I thought I should be cheated '' of the Money, so I told her she must stay '' till To-morrow, for I must go home with my '' Master's Things. It will be too late then, '' says she, and I must go thither to Night. All '' this passed at a Publick House in Tower Street, '' by Mr. Watts's Academy where I gave her '' the Bread and Cheese which I had in my Basket.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173712130010"/> '' It was God's Mercy I had not the Horse '' and Chaise to pay for, but God owed the '' Owner of them better Fortune. 'Tis a Scheme '' to take away my Life, because I did design to '' take up and lead a good Life. Give my Duty '' to my Master; on my Knees I will ask his '' Pardon for leaving his Service; I trust in God '' he will take me again, and stand my Friend, as '' I am a poor Servant and Friendless. At present '' I am not able to come, I am so bad with '' Pains all over my Body and Head, that I can '' hardly stand; but I will starve my self, rather '' than spend my Master's Money. Take my '' Shirts, Dear Jenny, into your Charge, I have '' but few Things, but I hope God will bless me, '' which is all from,</p>
               <p>Your Unfortunate Fellow Servant,</p>
               <p>Oct. 17. 1737. George Price.</p>

I asked '' her what Time the Man was to come Home '' with her? She told me, she would have me '' wait. I said, I thought they might be back about '' 10 or 11 o'Clock; they told me, if they '' did not come back by that Time, they would '' not come 'till next Morning. I said, that I '' would go then to the other End of the Town; '' but she repeated her Words, that I must not go '' till she saw whether she should have this Child '' or no, and that I must swear I had not seen her. '' I misfortunately promised to say as she desired '' me, it being the last Time that she trouble'd '' me; so I went to Drury-Lane, and from thence '' I run to Fishstreet-Hill, where I found a Boy '' leading the Horse and Chaise, who told me, he '' had 6d for bringing them from St. George's '' Church in Southwark, by a Man who looked '' like a Sailor; but it was not like the Man that '' went out with her, for he was like a Carpenter. '' The Boy told me, the Man came with him to '' the Foot of the Bridge, then left him, telling '' him, he would meet some body to take the '' Horse from him. I lay'd down my Dram upon '' a Table, as God is my Judge I never tasted it, '' and you say she got it. She gave me the strictest '' Charge to say, if I chanced to meet any '' Body that knew her, that I had not seen her. '' I did so, but there is a God in Heaven, who by '' some Means or other will right my Cause. At '' present I am Fatherless, Motherless and Friendless. '' I went to look for a Horse that would '' carry double, but I could not find one, so I got '' a Chair, and took her to the Bridge-Foot, where '' I met this Man, whom I never saw before, and I '' asked him, the Reason of his going that Way '' to Putney? He told me, 'twas to save the Expence '' of going over Sir Robert's Bridge. I gave '' her Half-a-Crown, at the Alehouse in Tower-Street, '' which I suppose she spent; for before '' she went off, she gave me her Handkerchief, '' Cap and Apron to be wash'd."</p>

            . On the 10th of October, about a Quarter after 6 in the Evening, I was going over Hounslow-Heath from Work, and I heard a Woman's Voice, I thought, about 2 or 300 Yards from me. I laid my self down upon the Ground; for we Country-Folks imagine we can hear any Thing at a Distance, much better in that Posture. I heard the Woman cry, O Lord! My Dear! My Dear! I will never trust you any more, if these are your Favours. The next Day, the Woman was found murdered about 2 or 300 Yards from the Place, where I heard the Voice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coke. I had been in Kent all the Summer, and towards the latter End of it, I came up to Town with the Prisoner; as we came along, he had a Fall from his Horse and hurt himself, so I made him go back, and order'd him when he was better, to come up by the Hoy. He came Home on the 10th of October, about 12 o'Clock at Night, as I was informed; I did not see him that Night, for my Brother got out of Bed and let him in. He was angry with him for being late, and to justify himself, he told him, the Hoy was but just arrived; he told me the same Thing the next Morning.

            , and he told me your Brother and you were out of Town. I thought these Excuses a little odd, for Mr. Midford's Man had seen him at 12 o'Clock at Noon that Day, and he had desired him to say, he had not seen him at all. However I gave him 3 Guineas to fetch something from Mr. Godfrey's the Chymist, I knew 'twas a costly Thing, and did not know the exact Price; he brought Home what I sent him for, which cost but 10s. and that Day he absconded with the rest of the Money; for when I came Home in the Evening, about 6 or 7 o'Clock, I call'd for him, and my Brother's Man told me, he went out about 5 or 6, and said he was coming to me at the Coffee-house; but he was not return'd, and he believ'd he would come no more; from that Time he never came to my Service. The next Day he wrote me a Penny Post Letter, telling me therein that he was over Head and Ears in Debt; that he must go to Sea, and that he dare not shew his Head. He pretended he ran away for Debt, but in that long Letter to Prosser, which has been read, he says, all his Debts in the World were but 7l. 4 Guineas of which he owes my Brother's Man, who would never have troubled him for it. I have told you the Excuse, he made to me and my Brother for coming Home so late, was, the Hoy was but just arriv'd; but the Reason he gave to Prosser was, that he had been at Drury-Lane Playhouse.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I declare I am entirely innocent of all that is laid to my Charge; and I am so far from knowing any Thing of the Murder of my Wife, that I can take a solemn Oath, I know nothing at all of it. 'Tis very plain, my Lord, that there is a Scheme of Villainy laid before you, but when I lay the manner of its Contrivance before you, I make no Doubt but you will think so too. My Wife I lov'd as I do my own Life; I marry'd her for nothing else, and indeed she merited all my Love, being a vertuous, sober, good Woman. If she was not so frugal in the Management of what little we had, it was our Misfortune only. I hope your Lordship and the Jury will put a charitable Construction on my leaving my Master's Service. You will find I did not, without good Reason, and that I am not the Villain I have been represented. If I was, I think I should never have had the Confidence to have look'd your Lordship and the Jury in the Face. I have no Friend but God to be my Councellor, and Innocency must be my Defence. And I believe several People now in Court have Reason to think I speak the Truth. I think they have now discharg'd their Duty to the King; - now let them declare, whether they think I deserve some of my Wife's Speeches I have taken Pains to preserve her Life, - never any to destroy it. If any of them can say I ever misused her, than let me suffer Blame, but till then, I hope your Lordship will hear my Cause. Ask Mrs. Lamb in what manner I used this Woman, - this Wife of mine?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lamb. He used her very well. In a Fit of Sickness she had, he fetch'd his Master's Apothecary to her, and desir'd him to discharge his Conscience to her, and make her well. When she did not take her Medicines, the Prisoner would blame her. He paid her Lodging and her Nurse. I know no Fault in him; how this happen'd I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Counc. How long is it since the Deceased had this Fit of Sickness?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lamb. About 7 or 8 Months ago. I am not sure whether the Apothecary is paid or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He is not paid: This is his Bill. Pray call Mrs. Sherwin, and ask her where I spent the Evening on Monday the 10th of October?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sherwin. I remember nothing of it. There is a Woman under Misfortune in Newgate, and I went with an elderly Man to see her. While I was there, a Breviate was wrote out, by which I was to clear the Prisoner. I was to say, that he and his Wife were with me at Supper that Night, and I was to be well paid for my Trouble. This is the Paper of Instructions which I received from the Prisoner, and thus far (pointing to the middle of the Sheet of Paper) he wrote himself. I was carried to Newgate by this elderly Man, to do Service for somebody, - I did not know who; when I came there, I found 'twas for the Prisoner, and was to be paid for doing it, but I don't desire to get Money at such a Rate.</p>
               <p>The Paper was read.</p>
               <p>'' My Lord, On Monday October the 10th, '' about 9 o'Clock in the Morning, Mrs. Price '' came to my House in Aldersgate-Street, and '' drank Tea with me. She told me she was going '' to see a Place, but that she must stay 'till<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173712130012"/> '' her Husband came to London, (which would be '' that Day) because she wanted Money. She '' told me he would be surpriz'd to see her, for '' at Canterbury she told him, she would send him '' Word when she got a Place, or else she would '' go to her Aunts. She asked me to go to Bear-Key '' with her, to see if her Husband was come '' up; I told her I could not go with her, but I '' would come after her, and she was to stay for '' me at the Cock Ale-house in Tower-street. I '' went out a little before 2 o'Clock, and met the '' Prisoner and his Wife, in Tower-street. He '' had with him a Parcel ty'd up in a Paper, and '' a Twig Basket with Pidgeons in it, which he '' said he was going to make a Present of to his '' Master Lanes I heard her tell her Husband, '' that she had heard of a Service in the Country, '' and if he would get her a Horse, she had a '' Person ready to go with her in the Evening. He '' said, his Master would lend him Money, and '' therefore she should not go to her Place while '' he staid in Town, and she should have half the '' Money. He said he had some Business to do, '' and must go, but he would meet us again at the '' King's-head Ale-house in Clement's Lane. We '' went there and drank a pint of Two-penny, '' then he return'd to us, and told us he was disappointed '' of Money, but he would get a Horse '' for her, or a Chaise; which she consented to, '' and complaining of the poorness of her Cloaths, '' the Prisoner took out of his Pocket a Guinea '' and a 6 d, and said, if he could get that chang'd, '' he would pay for the Chaise, and give her '' the remainder of the Money. I told him, if '' he would give his Wife the whole Guinea, I '' would lend him 10 s. to pay for the Chaise, '' which I did, and am not paid to this Day. '' The Deceased then order'd her Husband to '' bring the Chaise to the Wool pack in Monkwell '' street, and charg'd him to tell his Fellow-Servants '' that she was gone into the Country, and '' had been there some Time; and she desir'd him '' to deny that he had seen her. All this I heard '' her say to him. While he was gone to see '' for a Chaise, a Man came to the Deceased, '' and she went out to see after her Husband. At '' 3 o'Clock she return'd to the Man, and the '' Prisoner with her in a Chaise. I saw the Man '' and she go away together in the Chaise, and '' the Prisoner ask'd the Man what was the '' Meaning of his going over the Bridge to Putney? '' The Man reply'd, it was to save the Expence '' of Putney Bride, and promised to be back about '' 11 o'clock, the Prisoner said he would meet '' him to take the Horse and Chaise, if he did '' not exceed that Time; if he should, he begg'd '' the Man would put them up at the Star-Inn, '' and he would fetch them from thence. He '' gave his Wife half a Crown at parting to bear '' her Expences, and kissed her.</p>
               <p>Sherwin. These were my Instructions, and this was what I was to swear here: I received this Paper from the Prisoner Yesterday Morning, I had it to peruse often over; it is Part of a Play which I was to act here, and was to be paid very handsomely for performing my Part.</p>

I cry'd out, but no body heard. The Prisoner struck me over the Arm with his Stick; I cry'd out louder, and then they both run away. When they were gone, I got forward as well as I could with my Legs ty'd, and knocked at this Man's Door, begging him to let me in: this other Man, cut the String from my Legs, then they fetch'd me some Water to clean me.

I told Mr. Fisher the Constable of it, and the next Day he went with me to see if we could find him at the same Place: but as we were going up Fleet-street, I saw the Prisoner and seized him; telling him, he was the Man that robb'd me. We carry'd him before Justice Poulson, and the Justice asked him what Account he could give of himself? He told him, that he liv'd by picking Pockets, and had done so these 2 Years, at Drury-Lane Playhouse.

Immediately 2 Men more came up with Pistols, and I think 'twas the Man that stopp'd me first - he felt for my Watch. One of the others laid hold of my Hand, in which I had my Cane and Hanger, which they bid me deliver, or else I should be a dead Man. I had 3 Pistols about me at once. When the first Man had got my Watch, he felt in my Fob, but found no Money there. Then he felt in my left Pocket, and took out 5 s. and 6 d. and the others disputed who should have my Cane and Hanger. D - mn it, says one, I'll have his Shoe-buckles. One of them (who insisted on my having my Cane and Hanger again) told the other, he should not take my Buckles, and this (favourable) Man, presented his Pistol to him who swore he would have the Buckles, and said, if he took them he would shoot him. They asked me what I had got in my right Breeches Pocket, and in my Coat Pocket? I told them - nothing but a Handkerchief and a black snuff-box: Immediately upon that, one of them cry'd! - Who's a coming! And away they all went towards London, but before they went off, they return'd me my Cane and Hanger. I stood still to look after them, but one of them came back, and said - d - mn you Sir, go along toward Holloway. I know nothing of the Prisoners, but when Waterman the Evidence was apprehended, I went to him in New-gate, and he made a Confession of the Fact, with all its Circumstances.</p>

The Watch we valu'd, and every Thing was equally divided among us all, at John Parrot's House, the Bell and Boy, an Ale-house in Brick Lane Sometime before this we robb'd Mr. Ellington (a Watch-maker) at Hackney, of a Watch, a Guinea, and some Silver. Oliver and I have been acquainted ever since Midsummer, and 'tis unknown what we have got every Night. When we robb'd Mr. Holst, 'twas Moon-light, and I believe it might be about 8 o'Clock. We lay at the Prisoner Parrot's House that Night, three in a Bed, and he was then as well as I am. We were 7 of us that used to go out; that Night 5 only were abroad. Grafton Kirk, who was one of our Company, had a Fancy for this Gentleman's Watch, and he offer'd 3 l for it.</p>

               <p>Wheeler. The 27 th of Sept. near 7 o'Clock in the Evening, I was going over the Bridge towards <placeName id="t17380113-14-crimeloc85">Holloway</placeName>

Immediately 2 more came behind me with Pistols in their Hands. Then they took my Money, and because my Watch came out hard, they threatn'd to shoot me if I did not undo my Breeches. They took my Watch with a Packthread String, 3 Guineas, and about 22 or 23 s. from me, with a French Crown, which was among the Silver. The Prisoner was the first Man that stopp'd me, the other two I do not know. I heard the Prisoner was taken, so I went to see him in Newgate, the Beginning of this Month, and knew him to be the Man that stopp'd me. I tax'd him with the Fact, and he own'd it, and told me the Watch was at Endfield, and the French Crown was at the House where he used to lie.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask him whether he knew me before I told him the manner in which I robb'd him?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. Yes, I knew him when I first saw him in Newgate; I did not know of any Information he had made then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Holst. The Prisoner made his Information a Fortnight or three Weeks ago, before Mr. Justice Chamberlain, and I believe Wheeler knew little of the Prisoner, till I gave him the Intelligence, for I asked him next Morning, if he should know any of the Men again? and he told me, his Surprize was so great when the Pistols came about him, that he verily believ'd he should not know any of them again. About a Fortnight or three Weeks ago, I sent Wheeler a Letter to let him know, the Prisoner had made his Information of this Robbery, and several others, and that he was accepted as an Evidence by Mr. Chamberlain, but I saw nothing of him, till last Tuesday I met him at Hicks's-Hall, and he told me he had preferr'd his Bill against the Prisoner. I told him it was a wrong Step he had taken; and he said, he should be glad to have the Prisoner admitted an Evidence, and that he would prefer another Bill against the other two. <rs id="t17380113-14-verdict86" type="verdictDescription">

The two Prisoners lodged in my House, and my Son lay with them; on the 26th of December, they two went to Bed about half an Hour after 10, my Son went up in order to go to Bed about a Quarter after 11, and opening the Door, he saw a great many Chips, both upon the Bed and upon the Floor; seeing this, he called me up, and found the 2 Prisoners in Bed, I asked them what they had been doing? they made no Answer at first, but at last Mortished raised his Head, and said, - I know nothing of the Matter, do you, John? No, says Gardiner, we have had a Sleep since we blue the Candle out. I felt the Candle, and found the Wick hot, and the Tallow warm; upon which I got a Constable,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173712130017"/> and two or three Watchmen; the Prisoners had no Money at all when they went to Bed, but the Watchmen found all the Money which was in the Club-box, upon them, except one crooked Sixpence which was found in the Bed. The Box wherein the Money, the Bond, and Note was lock'd, was in a Closet in the Room where they lay, and the Key of their Chamber opened that Closet. I saw the Box whole in that Closet the same Afternoon, and am positive nobody had been in the Room from that Time till they went to Bed.</p>

We had a new Servant, who was not acquainted with our Dustmen, but having no Suspicion of the Men, she went and drew them some Beer. When I came Home, I miss'd the Candlestick, and the Maid telling me who had been there, I went to the Master of the Dustmen, and found that they were none of his Men. I (being to pay for the Candlestick) carry'd the Fellow of it to Mr. Page in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173712130019"/> Orange-Street, to know what it came to, and told him the Story; but I had not been come home again above an Hour, before he brought the Prisoner's Wife, and Part of the Candlestick, to our House. We took her before a Justice, and at first she said she found it in Gray's-Inn Walks; and as she was carrying from New-Prison to be re-examined, her Husband begged of her to hold out in the same Story; and when we came to the Justice's Door, he ran away, but we pursued him, and took him near Saffron-Hill, and brought him to the Justice's, when they were both re-examined, she said her Husband gave it her to sell for him.</p>

            , Headborough. A Neighbour of mine appeared in the Prisoner's Wife's Behalf, and gave her the Character of a very honest Woman; at first she said she found it, but afterwards she owned she had it from her Husband. The House where he lives is a Den of Thieves, and it is a Place contrived for their Conveniency: He had the Impudence to go with his Wife to the Justice's Door, but then he ran away, and I cry'd stop Thief, and took him. Every earthly Thing upon this Occasion has been mov'd out of his House, except two old Bedsteads. When he fled from me, I asked him what made him run? He told me I look'd as if I had a Warrant against him, and he did not like my Face.</p>

               <p>Lot Cavannah deposed, that going up Stairs that Night he heard the Prisoner beating his Wife, that she cry'd out, - don't ye, - my Dear, for God's sake don't - and that the Prisoner's Child cry'd out bitterly, and said, don't Daddy, - Daddy don't, that in 4 or 5 Minutes afterwards the Prisoner call'd, - Neighbours! Neighbours ! my Wife is dead! Upon which he went down into the Prisoner's Room, and found the Deceased sitting by the Wall without her Cloaths, and her Head turn'd almost behind her. That the Prisoner had a small Vial in his Hand, and would have gone for some Gin for her, imagining (as he said) that she was in a Faint, if they would have permitted him.</p>
               <p>Other Witnesses deposed to the same Effect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bell, Surgeon, deposed, that upon his examining the Body of the Deceased, he found several bruises and Wounds upon it, but not of Consequence enough to affect her Life. One Wound was on her Temple, and several in other Places. On examining the Neck, he found all right, and the Contents of the Breast in a natural State; but upon opening the Belly, he found the Abdomen fill'd with Blood; the left Kidney in a very Morbid State; and the large Blood Vessel which supply'd that Kidney was burst, and caused her Death. That upon turning the Body (to look for the Occasion of the Rupture of that diseased Vessel) he saw a large Bruise, which tally'd with the internal Rupture, and was directly over it, but as it was 3 Days after her Death, that he view'd the Body, he could not exactly judge how long it might be since the Blow or Kick, which occasion'd that Bruise, was given, but he believ'd the Deceased might have receiv'd it within 5 Days, and was given with great Violence. <rs id="t17380113-44-verdict230" type="verdictDescription">
