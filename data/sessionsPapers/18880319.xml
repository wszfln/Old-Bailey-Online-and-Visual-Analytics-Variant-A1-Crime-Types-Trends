               <p>soda on the sideboard—I did not ask you if that was not soda; it was ammonia—I saw a book of gold leaf—I did not bring that away because I did not consider it necessary; it would not be useful for coining—I asked you what you had it for—I did not see a hammer—I did not search the chimney thoroughly on the first occasion; you had too large a fire—I looked up as far as I could and felt just round the edge—I searched the place in your presence, and after I took you to the station I came back, not to search, but to bring this flat iron to the station—the landlady came in the room with me then—I came to the room the third time on the next morning; the landlady was present then—I only searched the chimney then—she saw me hook this out—your place was impoverished—I found pawntickets for amounts from 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. up to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not see anything pawnable in the room—I consider this punch could be used with a heavy wooden mallet, of possibly 4 lb. weight, not a very heavy one—I think a person partly paralysed could hold the punch with one hand and strike a sufficiently heavy blow with a 4 lb. mallet—my impression it this punch has been used with a wooden mallet; it is rather blunt now, but it has been fit to cut anything—you gave no explanation about the lead—you did not say you bought it to make solder, that being cheaper than buying it—these counterfeit pennies are composed of tin inside and very thin copper outside.</p>

I live at 32, Marchmont Street, Russell Square, and am assistant to my sister, Amelia Kent, at a tobacconist's shop there—on the evening of 2nd March the prisoner came in for a pennyworth of peppermint, and gave me a bad sixpence—I said "Have you any more?"—he said "What did you say?"—I said "Have you any more?"—he said "No"—my sister came and shut the door of the shop, and asked him where he got it from—he said he had a halfpenny, and pulled a halfpenny out of his pocket—a constable was sent for, and when he came the prisoner was searched, and a purse containing 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on him—he was taken to the station, where I went as well—shortly before he came in two other counterfeit sixpences had been uttered at our shop—I gave those two and the one which the prisoner had given me to the constable; these are they—the 2nd March was the first evening I had seen the prisoner—he was alone—I did not see anybody waiting outside the shop—when I went to the station there were a lot of people outside attracted by seeing the constable inside—I did not take the other sixpences from the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Barnsbury Street, Islington, and am a seaman—between 1 and 2 o'clock on the early morning of 7th March I was in Upper Street, Islington, on my way home—I was stopped by a. female, and went with her to the Chamberlain Club, which is about 12 or 13 doors from where the Grand Theatre was—as soon as the door was opened I ran in—when I got into the passage several men were there—one of them said "We know this gentleman; he has been here before 'I—I saw the proprietor White behind the bar serving; he could hear all that was said—I saw Briggs in the small room—the first thing they said after the door was shut was "This is better; there is more room here"—one man, not one of the prisoners, said that—drinks were called for—White served and stood at the end of the bar nearest the little room, close to where we were, waiting for payment, I suppose—Briggs was in the room, and everybody's backs were to the counter except myself—they were talking about chest measurement—I buttoned up my coat tight and moved towards the door, with the intention of opening it—the man not in custody put his back against the door to prevent my doing so—they shoved me back into the middle of the room again—one man took my right arm and Curtain my left, and raised them above my head—I with a loud voice said "What can I do? what can I do but stand here and be robbed? let me out"—White was at this time standing at the same end of the counter—I said "Open the door and let me out"—White turned</p>

               <p>on his heel and walked to the other end of the bar—as soon as he turned his back my coat was forced open by a man who stood in front of me—by the time White had got to the end of the bar two men were tugging one at my chain and one at my watch; between them they broke the chain—Curtain was in the room on my right then; he was not holding up my hands then—as soon as they got my watch and chain they dropped my arms—they broke my chain by pulling it—I said in a loud voice "Oh, don't; my father's chain; don't take that; if you will give me my watch and chain back I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—then some man not in custody said "All right, old man; give" or "show us 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "Iforget which," and you shall have your watch and chain"—at that time one man had the watch in his hand and another man had the chain, which they had broken—the watch was broken from the bar—I said "I cannot" or "Iwon't give you the money now; you come up to my rooms, and then I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—then Curtain immediately came round to my left side, took my left hand, and the other man took my right hand, and raised them up, and a man not in custody rifled my pockets of the money—I had in my upper waistcoat pockets a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and silver—that was taken from me—they had not discovered that pocket before, but when I spoke about giving them 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they immediately seized me again and found it—I lost nothing else except a bronze medal—then they let go of me, and one man wanted me to have a drink; I would not have anything—I left very shortly afterwards—as I was going out of the club I said "All right; I know the house; you will hear of it again"—I have not seen my watch and chain since—the value of it is about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should say, when I got outside, I made a communication to the first policeman I saw; that was a good distance up Upper Street—I did not go to the police-station that night, but next morning I did about 8 a. m.—I made a complaint there; nothing was done till the evening, when I went to the club again with two constables, Cummings and Simpkins, at about 8 o'clock—we went in the small room where I was robbed—I could not say where Briggs was when I was robbed; I saw him one or one and a half minutes before—we were served at the small counter—at the time I wanted to get out Briggs was near the lobby door, on my right, standing, facing me sideways—I was facing the door and he was facing the partition; he had not got his back to the door—he was in the room about 2 feet from me, I should think—when I went in with the constables the next evening White was there behind the bar—the constables asked White some questions; how many members there were and such questions—while we were talking Curtain and another man, if not two others, came in—Curtain came up to the counter, did not speak a word or order anything, but left suddenly very shortly after he came in, having waited a minute perhaps—Cummings said "Come on," and went out—I followed them out, and then recognised Curtain in the street, and gave him into custody—we went to the station, where Curtain was charged—he made no answer—the policemen were in plain clothes—Briggs and White came down next day to give evidence at the police-court.</p>

I was close to him; there was only the bar between us when I went with the two detectives to the club on the night following—White did not move to the other end of the bar until after I said "What can I do but stand here and be robbed?"—Briggs was standing close to me at the time—I saw him there when I was prevented going out of the room about two minutes before the robbery—I did not notice where he was at the time I called out.</p>

On the evening of 7th March I went in plain clothes with the prosecutor and Simpkins to the Chamberlain Club—I saw White behind the bar in the small room—the prosecutor was on my right—I said "Mr. White, this gentleman complains of having been robbed in this club early this morning, and of having lost his watch and chain, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and silver, and a medal"—he said "That is strange; I did not see anything of it"—the prosecutor said "Yes, you must have seen something of it; you were behind the bar"—at that time Curtain with two others entered the club—White was still looking at me—I noticed him wave his right arm—he was looking me in the face at the time—when White made that signal the three men left immediately—I and the prosecutor and Simpkins followed the men out—a short distance lower down from the club I stopped Curtain—the prosecutor said "Yes, that is one of them"—I said to Curtain "You hear what this man says; you are one of the men that assisted in robbing him at the club this morning"—I then told him the nature of the charge—when the charge was read to him at the station he replied "All right, sir."</p>

I called to you 'Let me out! let me out!' You turned on your heel and went up to the other end of the bar; that was when they were measuring me"—White said "Yes, they were not robbing you then"—I then asked White to give me the names and address of any one who was in the house at that time—he gave me the name of William Galbraith, no address; Mr. Asfeldt, 19, Madeira Road; Mr. Briggs, 96, Cloudesley Road, and Mr. Fagan, Church Passage—he said "I could not see anything of it, as I was up at the other end of the bar at the time"—I asked him again to give me the name of any one who was in that small bar—he said he could not do so," they may not have been members"—I asked him if he knew a man named Curtain—he said "No"—I said "Then he is not a member?"—he said "No"—I went with the prosecutor and the last two witnesses—I arrested White on the following day after the evidence of the prosecutor before the Magistrate—I said to the prosecutor "Will you charge White now?"—he said yes, he would—he went outside the Court with me, and I saw White and Briggs standing together, and he said "That is another of them," pointing to Briggs, "and I will charge them both"—I arrested White, and said "This man," pointing to the prosecutor, "charges you with being concerned in that robbery"—White said "He cannot prove that I touched him or had anything to do with him"—they were taken into custody; Simpkins arrested Briggs.</p>

I am secretary to the Pelican Life Assurance Company—on 10th February, about 3.30 p.m., this card "James Paton" was sent me, and then the prisoner came in and announced himself as Mr. James Paton, son of Mr. Ninnion Paton, of Stockholm, our agent—he has been our agent for many years—the prisoner said he had been</p>

               <p>travelling for his health—he put himself into rather theatrical attitudes, putting his hands on his chest, and he said his last stay had been at Bournemouth, and feeling very ill he wanted to get home as soon as possible to his friends at Stockholm—I called our chief clerk in, and stated to him, in the prisoner's hearing, that the prisoner was said to be James Paton, the son of our agent at Stockholm, and perhaps it would be as well if they went to the Swedish Consul—the prisoner said what he should like to do would be to telegraph and get confirmation of his statement if I had any doubt, but he had already told me he was most anxious to leave that night, by way of Ostend I think—I suggested he should go with Mr. Clark of my office to the telegraph office as he wished to do so—on his return I was given to understand in his presence that supposing Mr. Paton had been at the other end to receive it, the time taken in sending the telegram and replying would prevent his getting off that night—I most certainly believed his story, and instructed Mr. Clark to let him have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and take a receipt for it—this is the receipt he gave in the outer office—he said he was staying at the Midland Grand Hotel—what induced me to part with my money was substantially that he was the son of my agent—I would not run the risk of offending Mr. Paton on any account—about 15th February I went to the Northern Assurance Company, in Moorgate Street—as I was going upstairs I met the prisoner coming down—I expressed great surprise at seeing him there—he gave a shrug of his shoulders, and I suggested a reason—I asked him if his house in Stockholm did any fire business for the Northern Company, my office doing life business only—he replied "A little, not much"—I remarked it was very bitter weather for him to be out—he said he was advised to keep a day or two longer here—the very next afternoon I met him in Piccadilly, about 5.45 p.m.—I called a policeman and gave him in custody upon a charge of obtaining the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me—directly I laid hold of him he wanted to give me my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said if I would come inside Hatchett's Hotel he would explain matters to me; he said it was a mistake on my part—I went with him and the constable to the station, and formally made the charge there—he made a statement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk in the Pelican Office—on 10th February this card was brought in by one of the juniors—I heard the prisoner say he was James Paton, the son of Ninnion Paton—I was requested to go with the prisoner to the telegraph office—first of all he called at the telegraph office on Cornhill to know where to go to—I suggested going to the Consulate—he demurred to that, because he said all Englishmen abroad went to the Consulate to get home again, and if he applied to the Consulate for assistance to go home it would be known all over Stockholm before he got home, and as his family was known all over Stockholm he did not wish that—I went to the Northern Telegraph Office in St. Helen's Place—I was there informed in his presence that it would take from four to five hours to get a reply from Stockholm—it was then 3.45—he asked whether the office would be open all night—they said that it would at both the ends—I said "Will you telegraph?"—he said "No"—then he spoke for some time, I don't know whether in Swedish or Norwegian, and when he came away he said if he wanted to telegraph he could do so during the night, but he should not do so then—we went back to the office, and I went with him into Mr. Tucker's room, who told me to get the agent's list, and then Mr. Tucker put</p>

                  </hi>. I am the secretary of the London office of the London, Liverpool, and Globe Assurance Company—on 15th February, about 3 o'clock, the prisoner called on me and produced this card, "V. Svalander"—our agents in Gottenberg are Svalander and Nast—he said he was a partner in the firm of Svalander and Nast, our agents in Gottenberg, that he had been ill, and had been in bed for about four months at Gottenberg, and that the doctors had recommended him to go to Bournemouth, his lungs being very bad; that he had been there for some weeks, and that he was getting better, but the last few days the weather had so changed that he became very ill, and wished to get back to Gottenberg as soon as he could, that he had come up from Bourne mouth that day, and wished to return home by the night express, via Flushing—I said that he looked very ill, and asked whether he might not do better by remaining in London to rest for a few days—he said that he must get on at once; he was so ill that he thought he might die if he did not—he then said that he hoped I would assist him by advancing him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he had no money to get home—I told him that I had never seen him before, and asked whether he could give me any evidence of his being really our agent—I had an impression that I had seen Mr. Svalander some years before, but I was not quite sure, and I said he was an older man—he said that was his uncle, and that he himself was the junior partner—I then said we in London had very little correspondence with his firm, and he said "Yes, I know that; we correspond for 'Fire' with your head officie at Liverpool"—I said that was quite correct, that I would help him if I could, that I would wire to Liverpool, and asked whether he could be back again about 5 o'clock; this was 3.15—he said he would come back—he left and came back about 5 o'clock—meantime I had telegraphed to Liverpool, and had looked up our correspondence and accounts with Svalander and Nast, so as to compare his writing—the letters were in my hand—the prisoner said he had never written any of the letters or signed them, that he attended to other business, their wine business—I told him I had a document before me, and that it was a loan for a Mr. Svalander on security of a life policy, and I noticed the name of the witness to the signature, who had put his name and signed himself "Bookkeeper to the firm"—he was sitting opposite to me and may have seen it—I asked him who was the bookkeeper—he said they were a very large firm and had several—I said "Will you name them?"—he gave me a name I did not</p>

               <p>recognise—I said "Will you name another?"—he said it must be Borgstrom; that was the name on the paper—I said "Surely you have some letters addressed to you"—he said he had many letters—I said "Have you any in your pocket?"—he said "No," but he produced another card similar to the one he had given me before, and said that he had only a small leather bag with him at the Midland Hotel, and the letters were in a large trunk, which was being sent to him from Bourne mouth in time for him to catch the night train, and that in that trunk were many letters—I had further conversation with him, and thought he was the man he said he was—I suggested his remaining a little longer—I again suggested that he should remain and wire to his friends in Gottenberg—he again repeated how ill he was, and he looked very ill certainly, and said if he did not get back he should never get back—I believed all his statements, and lent him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he wrote this in my presence. (<hi rend="italic">This was a receipt from the London, Liverpool, and Globe Company of the "somme "of</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">which would be repaid by V.

Svalander, and I said "This is not altogether a personal matter; it is for the firm"—he said "Oh, yes, I will append the signa ture of the firm," and then he wrote the firm's signature—when he got the money he said he would leave that evening, and would write the moment he got to Gottenberg—I saw no more of him till I saw him at the Mansion House—I have no doubt he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturing jeweller and gold smith. of 29, Gerard Street, Soho; it was formerly Grant and Peek—I have known the prisoner since April, 1885—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a summary signed by him, and dated May, 1886, of his indebtedness to me at that date: "G. M.Schroder, in account with Grant and Peek."

(<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th July</hi>, 1886, <hi rend="italic">from the Hotel Metropole, from the prisoner, stating that he had an abscess in his mouth and could not go out, and asking the witness to call on him.</hi>) I went to the hotel and saw him—he told me there was no need to trouble further about raising money on his reversion, as he had arranged with a cousin to raise sufficient money to pay his debts—I told him he had made me so many promises, and as I had to take proceedings against him on his bills that I should be glad if he would put it on paper to show to friends of mine, and he wrote this in my presence: "6th July, 1886. Dear Mr. Peek,—I herewith inform you that I have made such arrangements as will enable me to pay you this month 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for capital and interest, that I shall do through relations, who will advance the money"—nothing further passed—after he wrote that he left—I saw him again the following day at my office in Gerard Street—he had called twice during the morning when I was out—he called again about 1 o'clock—he seemed very much agitated, and asked to speak to me privately—I took him upstairs to my private room—we were there together—he was very much agitated, and for some time he could not speak; in fact, I had to get him some wine—at last he said</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Herbert George Muskett, clerk to Messrs. Wontner, proved service of notice on the prisoner's solicitors to produce the bills</hi>). The signature to the bills was "Schroder"—the signature of the acceptor is not mine—I never gave any one authority to put my name to the bills—there is a resemblance to my hand writing—the prisoner has had from time to time documents with my signature—at the end of May we applied for a warrant, and towards the end of July I swore an information.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> I first became acquainted with the prisoner on 14th April, 1885—I sold him a bracelet, he did not pay for it—at the end of 1885 I was pressed for money—I sent bills of exchange to the prisoner in Paris, accepted by my firm—at one time he held 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bills, it might be 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't think I ever sent any in blank, I could not say positively—he was friendly with a customer of mine in Paris, from whom I held a large quantity of foreign bills as security for a debt, he said no doubt it would be an accommodation to me if he could put me in funds to take up the customer's bills—he was to discount the bills in Paris, and send over the produce to me—that was the course of business pursued between us to the end of 1885 and the beginning of 1886—he has remitted to me about 2 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I don't think. more—I don't think I saw the prisoner in England during 1886—I frequently wrote to him; I sued him in Paris and in London as well—I did not hear of these bills being in existence until the prisoner came and told me of it—I saw him in London on 6th July, and the bills became</p>

               <p>due on the 8th—I think I did not dictate this confession to the prisoner, I could not tell you, because we were both in a very agitated state; he said "I will write it down"—I told him I wanted a document to show to the bank, I might have said "You must put down that you forged those bills," and he wrote it—I was not then in the habit of giving notice to my bank when bills were coming due to be met; this was the first time we had ever given the bankers notice, I do so now; when bills are becoming due we always provide for them—I cannot tell from memory what my liabilities were at the time, but I was solvent—had I known that I had accepted these bills I should have provided for them, but as I had not I did not provide for them—the first step I took after obtaining this document was to send the prisoner with my nephew to see his uncle, because he said his uncle would arrange to help him to pay the bills—I knew they were forged at that time—I also directed my nephew to go to the Paddington Station to see the uncle, and also to his house at Windsor; that was at the prisoner's suggestion—those attempts to obtain the money were not successful—I did not send him with a view of getting the money simply, but with a view of knowing what they were going to do about the bills—I told my nephew to remain in the same room with the prisoner all night, because the prisoner telegraphed to his brother and was expecting an answer, and simply to know what was to be done in the morning; it was not to lose sight of him; it was not that he might get the money to meet the bills, that was immaterial to me, there was no certainty that he would be there in the morning—I did not afterwards tell my nephew to let him go to Hamburg or where he liked—I sent to his lawyer, Mr. Vallance, not to get the money, to talk it over; Mr. Vallance told me if I took no steps everything should be arranged, that the bills should be paid—I then told my nephew to leave the prisoner; I knew he was to go straight to Hamburg, and he did go the same night—I knew then that he had committed forgery—he was going to Hamburg to get the money I presume—all this occurred on the 8th—the bills were all met and paid on the 13th—I have not lost anything on the bills; I have a claim against him that has not been paid—on the 27th I took proceedings for this forgery; that was not until he had left the country without paying me—if I had known that the bills had been paid I should not have taken any proceedings; I had no positive information that they had been paid—Mr. Thomas wrote to me from Paris, and said "I believe all the bills have been paid"—I suppose I could have found that out by going to the bank—the only in formation I had was from Mr. Thomas; I never heard anything more of them, perhaps I did believe the information—if my debt had been paid I should not have prosecuted—he led me to believe that he was entitled to a very large reversion; he sent me a will of his grandfather's, suggesting that money could be raised on the reversion—I put it in the hands of my solicitor—I have not been paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, of 13, Edgeworth Terrace, Pembery Road, Tottenham—on 16th February, 1887, I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi> for a trustworthy man, able to work on house property, with 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash security, apply 69, Ida Street, East India Dock Road, Poplar—I wrote to that address, and on 22nd February received this letter "B." (<hi rend="italic">Saying that if he was in a position to deposit</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">cash security and to sign an agreement, he could commence work at once, and that the advertiser would meet him to-morrow.</hi>) I have seen the prisoner write, this is his writing—in consequence of that letter I went to 69, Ida Street on 22nd February—I did not see the prisoner then, I called again on the same day and saw him—he said "I want a trustworthy man, honest, whom I can trust to collect rents, attend sales, buy and sell property for me" he said I should have 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my hands sometimes, that he had property at Poplar, Plaistow, and Southgate, and should want me to go to Plaistow the following week to sell some of the property, and he should want 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. security—I asked him if he could not take part; he said no, the security was for my holding so much of his money—I asked if I could not pay part down, and a part later on—he said "No, I must have it all down at once before you commence," and asked when I should be able to deposit 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said in a few days if it was genuine—he said "Yes, you will find me all right, I am honest myself and I want a man the same"—I asked him what wages he would give—he said "What do you want?"—I said 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he said he could not give so much—I agreed to take 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he arranged to meet me on Saturday, the 26th, at the same place, where I was to deposit the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did so about 4 o'clock, taking the money with me, part notes and part cash—I told him I had brought it—he gave me this agreement to read—I made a copy of it—I believed the statements it contained. (<hi rend="italic">By the agreement Mole was to be employed by Pantlin at</hi> 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week, to let houses, collect rents, attend sales, and make himself useful, and to advance</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">as security, and Pantlin was to repay the</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">at a month's notice, and to pay</hi> 7<hi rend="italic"> per cent. during the time he retained the</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) I thought it was a genuine service—I believed the other statements about the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that this was really required as a guarantee for my honesty, and that he was in a position to give me permanent employment as long as I behaved myself—he read the agreement, I executed it and had a counterpart—I paid my money—I asked him if he did not want any references—he hesitated and said yes, he would have one—I gave him Mr. Franklin, Criterion Buildings, High Road, Tottenham—he was to</p>

               <p>communicate with Mr. Franklin, the suggestion came from me—I was to begin my work on the Monday succeeding, 28th February, when he was to meet me—I did not see him then—on the Tuesday I went again—I saw him between 10 and 11, and went with him to 1, 2, 3, and 4, Sophia Street, and 1, 2, 3, and 4, Elizabeth Terrace, Poplar—they are adjoining streets—he showed me to the tenants, and told them I should be their collector for the future to collect their rents—one of the tenants, Mrs. Sullivan, said in his hearing, "How many more collectors are you going to bring here?"—she said she did not believe the property belonged to him at all—the prisoner said "Come along, Mole, don't take any notice of what the women say"—he gave me no book, and did not tell me what the amounts were—the property was seven or eight roomed houses in bad condition—he told me I was to go down to North Street, Plaistow, and take Lemon, who had been collector, with me to do some repairs to 45 and 47, North Street—I collected throughout the week from 1st March to the 4th or 5th in Sophia Street, and I collected that week 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there, paid in half-crowns and florins—that was the most I could get—next week I collected 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the same houses in Sophia Street—during the third week I occupied myself at North Street some time in doing cement work at two shops there, 45 and 47—I went nearly every day in the week—there were seven houses in Sophia Street—it took me pretty well an hour there altogether—after I had done that I would go and do the cementing—I did not collect after the second week—I heard something from Lemon—I was paid my wages for the first two weeks, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in all—I worked all the third week, and at the end of it I waited there expecting to see somebody—I did not get my wages—I went on working the greater part of the fourth week—I could not see the prisoner; I tried to find him—he came down the third week and spoke to Lemon, not to me—I was looking for him from Tuesday to Saturday in the fourth week, and could not find him—on 26th March I saw his wife at Liverpool Street Station with her father, Mr. Elkins—there was a conversation, in which we all three took part—I made some statement to them about my wages—the meeting at Liverpool Street Station was arranged by Elkins—the prisoner did not attend it—that was the first occasion on which any mention was made of a charge to be given to me—by arrangement I was to meet the prisoner on 29th March, three days afterwards—I met him and Elkins then at Liverpool Street Station—I asked the prisoner what he meant by treating me as he had done, and if he was going to pay me—he said "It will be all right, Mole; you need not trouble"—we went to a public-house, and he signed and gave me this charge. (<hi rend="italic">Dated </hi>29<hi rend="italic">th March. This was a charge on the houses</hi> 45<hi rend="italic"> and</hi> 47<hi rend="italic">, North Street, Plaistow, for the payment of the wages and the</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">the same to be repaid by</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">rd April, together with interest at 7 per cent., and was signed Louis Pantlin.</hi>) I asked him if there was any incumbrance on the property, and he said "No"—I asked where the deeds were—he said "We have not got them with us; it will be all right; you will soon have your money; you need not trouble about the deeds"—the charge was brought already signed and executed—Fowler, the witness to it, was introduced to me by the prisoner; he is not here—I believed that the prisoner was the owner of this property, and that this was a valid charge upon it, and a valuable document—he made no statement to me as to his holding the one house</p>

               <p>and one house only, or as to his having deposited the lease for a monetary advance on 1st January, 1887—in April and afterwards I applied to the prisoner for my money, but never received any portion of it beyond the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never saw him afterwards—I asked him his address—he gave me 86, Leadenhall Street—I went there, but could not find him—about 5th May I received this letter from 86, Leadenhall Street. (<hi rend="italic">This said that he was about engaging an office to himself, and that when he left Leadenhall Street he would forward the address, and that he need not be uneasy, as all would be right presently.</hi>) I did not know in February that Charles Mills and William Bussell were pressing the prisoner for money—I knew nothing of those two people; they were never mentioned to me while I was in tho prisoner's service, and I never saw them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>. I am a journeyman bricklayer, and experienced in repairing houses—I first went to Sophia Street to collect rents; I did no repairs there—then I went to 45 and 47, North Street, and then to 201, High Street, Poplar—these are small rents payable in small sums every week, and troublesome to collect, varying from 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—when I first saw the prisoner I asked for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—that was not exorbitant—he said it was too much; he could not give it, and I finally agreed to work for 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—that is a fair average wage in these times—it was not that but the money I was to hold in the future that tempted me to make the deposit of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made inquiries about the property at Southgate, and found the prisoner had some interest in it—I did not find he had a lease of property there—I cannot remember saying at the police-court "I made inquiries, and ascertained that the property at New Southgate belonged to Mr. Pantlin"—my evidence was read over to me, and I signed it—if that is on the deposition I said it.</p>

I am a bricklayer, of 13, Elthorne Road, Upper Holloway—on 3rd November, 1886, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi> about a situation for a man who understood house repairs and could collect rents, &amp;c.; house rent, free; wages, 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; state all particulars and amount of cash security—I sent a reply, and some three weeks afterwards I got a letter, signed Louis Pantlin—I have destroyed it—it asked me to call at 96, Campbell Road, Bow—I wrote and got an answer, signed Louis Pantlin, asking me to call at 144, East India Road—I called there and saw the prisoner—I told him about the advertisement that I had seen—he told me he had property at Southgate, Plaistow, and Poplar, and several other places he mentioned—he asked me if I came about the collector's place—I said "Yes"—he asked me inside, and he asked me what I was—I said "A bricklayer"—he said "That is just what I want," and he asked me if I could deposit 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked me if I would travel about—I went with him and Mrs. Pantlin to look at Commodore Court—when we got back from there an agreement was produced and read over by the prisoner—he asked me if I could deposit the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I had not got it with me then—he said my duties would be to do house repairs, collect rents, and attend sales, and then we made an appointment to meet on the Saturday, 11th December—I then went to 144, East India Road, and asked the prisoner if he could not take two bondsmen instead of the money—he said "No," he wished to have the money—he said I should go and see Sophia Street on the Monday, but I never went to see it—on the Saturday this agreement was prepared and read over to me, and then I signed it—it is the same as the others, but the salary was 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—no interest was to be paid on the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the same day I paid him a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. gold, making 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all—the agreement was signed in counterpart; I took one and the prisoner one—I was to start on Monday, 13th December, at Commodore Court, High Street, Poplar—on Monday I went there, and commenced some repairs to some closets there—my wages were paid at the end of that week—I continued working there till 19th February—about three weeks before I left there Clegg came there—in January, 1887, the prisoner complained that I did not do enough work for him—in consequence of that I sent in a written month's notice to terminate the arrangement between us—I after wards saw him, and asked him if he had received my notice—he said "Yes"—about the 16th February I saw the prisoner again at 6, Ida Street—I told him I should want my money, and he told me he wanted me to stop on—I told him I should not do that; I wanted my money by Saturday, the 19th, which would be a month from the day on which I gave him notice—he said nothing—on the 19th I and Cole and Clegg went to 6, Ida Street—we did not see the prisoner, but we saw Mrs. Pantlin, who said something, and in consequence I waited—on 28th February I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Produced, saying that he expected to settle</hi>

Before 31<hi rend="italic">st</hi> December, 1886, I saw an advertise ment in a newspaper, in consequence of which I went to 29, Woodstock Road, East India Road—I saw the prisoner there, and said I called to see him in answer to the advertisement I saw in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi> to collect rents, do house repairs, and attend sales—I am a house painter and decorator, and was then living at 41, Spencer Street, Battersea—I live at Maidenhead now—he said he wanted some one to place in some property at Southgate, to collect rents and do repairs—I was to have 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week and pay him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash security—I thought the wages would suit very well—I told him I could pay the cash security if it was required—he made no other statements to me at that time, only mentioned the Southgate property as belonging to him—I believed all that statement, and agreed to enter his service—I paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash on 31st December, 1886—I entered his service on 11th January, and endeavoured to collect rents at Southgate—I was more successful than a great many had been, from what I saw of the rent-books—I ceased collecting rents on 6th June, 1887—I gave notice to leave about a month previous, and asked for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be returned—I had the same agreement as Mr. Mole—I did not get my 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back or any part of it—I only received wages one week the whole time; that was the week I was kept in London.</p>

I live at 58, Charlotte Street, Portland Place, and let lodgings—on 19th August a man called, he had a muffler round his mouth and his hat very low down—to the best of my belief the prisoner is the man—it was at 9 p.m.—he asked for apartments, and I showed them to him, three rooms—the gas was alight—he said "Should I want them, can I have them at once?

                  </hi>. I live at 51, Belsize Avenue, Hampstead, and was formerly one of the firm of Charles Goodall and Sons—my connection with them ceased in September last, which had been contemplated for 12</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188803190061"/>
               <p>months before—I now carry on another business alone—towards the close of 1886 I became acquainted with the prisoner, when he was in partner ship with a man named Daly, as Daly and Cooper, in High Holborn, in connection with the Palestine floral cards—the transactions were very frequently with me, and I have frequently seen him write—I constantly paid him cheques of Charles Goodall and Sons', which were countersigned by me—the signature "R. Cooper" on this promissory note is the prisoner's, to the best of my belief, and here are several cheques, all which I believe to be signed by him—the signature "R. Cooper" on this acceptance is the prisoner's, and the endorsement also—here is a letter, all in his writing, addressed to Mr. Callow, and another addressed to myself, which I take certainly to be his writing—this letter to the London and Westminster Bank, ordering a cheque-book, I take to be his writing, and this letter to Mr. Sidney Warr, signed Daly and Cooper, this invoice to Mr. Warr, and these receipts, and this last invoice—I am the person who gave him the introduction to enable him to open an account at the London and Westminster Bank—some months afterwards I knew the prisoner out of business, and must have told him frequently that I con templated leaving the firm—I saw him in June, 1887; he came to my place of business to tell me that he was going to America, and to say "Good-bye"—I have nothing to fix the date distinctly, but I should take it to be close to the end of June—it is likely that I had told him I should leave the firm at the end of June, the year ending June 30th—I used to see him at long intervals, perhaps a dozen times a year—he came to my house as a guest—I am now a maker of pianoforte actions—I had been engaged in the two businesses for six or seven months before I left the old business, which I remained in for general convenience.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> When I knew him it was the end of 1884, and in 1885, 1886, and 1887, during which time the business he was creating was I believe in every sense a genuine one, and he was an energetic man doing all he could to create a business, and doing a considerable business—I have no means of telling what his accounts were, but his transactions must have been with a considerable number of people—I believe he was not only an energetic man, but leading a respectable life—so far as I know he lived on the premises where he carried on business, and employed a considerable number of workpeople—I do not know that he had an agency in America—he went there in 1886, and was there some months, and took a stock of these cards there to sell—both in business and in private life I have frequently written to him, and he to me—I have a number of his letters, and he would have numbers of mine—most likely in business transactions between the firm and him the cheques would be signed by me, prior to 1887 certainly—I do not remember giving him any information as to what the name of the new firm of my late partner would be, but the name continued the. same—I have no doubt I wrote to him in 1886, and he to me—at the end of June or the beginning of July, 1887, he told me he was going to America to seek American goods for sale on this side, and take goods for sale on that side, pretty much in the character of a commission agent—I never knew that he had parted with his interest in the Palestine Card Company—he told me that he was taking his passage in a cargo steamer, and that the captain was a friend of his—he did not tell me that the name of the steamer was the <hi rend="italic">Borderer</hi>, or that it was one of Adamson and Ronaldson's steamers, or anything</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188803190062"/>
               <p>about it, or under what circumstances Adamson and Rolandson had given him the passage—I don't think he gave me the address where he would be—after he left I got a letter from him, dated "Off Dover," in which the <hi rend="italic">Borderer</hi> was mentioned—this is it (<hi rend="italic">This was signed "R. Cooper" dated July 4th, and stated that he should be at Boston from the 15th to the 20th, and afterwards at New York</hi>.) I wrote I think twice, once to Boston and once to New York, and I have got copies of my letters—this is my letter. (<hi rend="italic">Found among the prisoner's papers, and addressed to him at Rivere House, and dated July</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.) It was probably posted about the same date—I received this answer in August; I have not got the envelope—it is addressed to me, and dated 23rd July, from 353, Canal Street, New York—I had no special reason at that time to notice dates—I wrote again—this is my letter and envelope (<hi rend="italic">Dated London, August 8th, from could to Cooper</hi>, 353, <hi rend="italic">Canal Street, New York; posted in London, August 9th; New York postmark, August</hi> 19th.) I got a letter about the same date; I am not sure whether it was an answer or not—the next letter I had was one dated August 9th, from 2204, Chesnut Street, Philadelphia—I have not got the envelope; I got it before the 20th, because I answered it on 19th August: "My dear Cooper, I have your letter of the 9th from Philadelphia"—I have no doubt this is Cooper's writing—I do not think Mr. Callow wrote to him—I do not think I wrote a letter after that, but I received another letter dated August 19th, 2204, Chesnut Street, Philadelphia; I have the envelope of that (<hi rend="italic">Philadelphia postmark, August 23rd, London, September 1st.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">I have two other letters from him here written since his arrest—this signature "R. Cooper" on</hi> 21st July in the book from the hotel I should take to be his, and also this on 3rd August—this on 22nd August at the bottom of the page superficially I should take to be the same as the others—this on 7th September I do not identify—this letter of 22nd August is in his writing—it is to Miss Woodward there is no address on it—it has a dissimilarity; the general appearance is that of the prisoner's writing—the first part of it looks like his writing, I should receive it as his—this writing on the flyleaf of this book on August, 1887, is his writing to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi> I observe the last letter purports to have been written on 19th August and posted on 23rd August—I should not think this is written in answer to anything of mine (<hi rend="italic">The letter was dated</hi> 2204, <hi rend="italic">Chesnut Street, Philadelphia, 19th August</hi>, 1887, <hi rend="italic">and stated that he had been ill, and was coming over as soon as possible, and hoped to arrive in time for him, and that he would write more fully unless he started at once.

Cooper in the hotel book on 22nd August was superficially like his writing I mean from a general impression, a cursory glance, and without any reason to doubt it I should take it to have been his—that is what I think—I</p>

                  </hi>. I have been engaged as an expert in handwriting for 40 years—I carry on my profession at 10, Bedford Row—these documents (with the exception of this promissory note) were handed to me as containing the proved writing of the prisoner, at all events in some parts—I was shown the signature book of the London and Westminster Bank, containing the signature of Cooper, and I have a tracing of it—that contains the name of R. Cooper, and then Ralph Cooper, gentleman, 9, Beachfield Road, Catford—that is the full and ordinary signature—I was also handed the forged cheque for 3,670<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have compared this cheque with the whole of the writing purporting to be Cooper's, and in my opinion it was written by the same hand—the disputed writing was written by the same hand as wrote the whole of the cheque, endorsement too—I have reasons to assign why I come to that conclusion from the peculiarities of the writing, which I can point out if desired—on my oath I am satisfied (<hi rend="italic">The witness pointed out to the Jury 17 instances of similarities between the writing on the cheque and that on the other documents.</hi>) I have examined these four signatures in the hotel register—the first, on 21st July, is most decidedly in the prisoner's writing in my opinion—the next, of 3rd August, is also a genuine signature, no doubt—the next, on 22nd August, at the bottom of the page, I doubt as to its being genuine, it lacks the characteristics that distinguish his signature—I won't swear it is not his, and I won't swear it is—it is written at the bottom of the book—it would not affect the</p>

               <p>signature that his hand would not rest in the usual way, he could easily have a prop if he wished; besides, there are blank lines left, and I have noticed pages in the book at which blank places are left for a person desiring to sign his name—there is no blank on 20th or 21st August—the next is 7th September, I don't believe that is the prisoner's writing at all, I do not recognise it—I have not the slightest doubt that the forged cheque was written by Cooper.</p>

Cooper, "Philadelphia, Room 519"—he registers as from Philadelphia—he stayed from the 7th to the 10th, and when he was settling his bill on the 10th I said "You were here on 22nd August, and your bill was not paid for the time you were here"—he said "Quite right, I was called away unexpectedly. By the way, here is your key; I will return you the key of the room"—he paid the bill; we only charged him for the use of the room—you can either pay for meals at the time or have them charged—the European plan is when you have a room without meals—this book is the transient boarders' ledger—we have another which we call the permanent boarders'—I find no entry under date of August 22nd with regard to the prisoner, but under date September 10th he is charged for a room August 22nd, one and a half dollar—when an entry is made in the register of the arrival of a guest an initial "E" is put against the name to distinguish whether he is on the European or American plan—that initial is against the prisoner's name on 22nd August—the European plan is that you pay for a bed only—when he paid on September 10th I told him he did not pay for August 22nd, and he paid for that at the same time as he did for the room for the three days—these are the original ooks of the hotel—we keep a book called the letter-forwarder, which is a register of the names of the persons stopping at the hotel, and the place letters are to be forwarded to them until a certain date—I find an entry on 6th August, 1887, "Mr. Cooper requests us to forward his letters to 2204, Chesnut Street, Philadelphia"—that is in my writing—I forwarded letters to that address from that time until I saw him again—I have not seen him since 10th September—when he was arrested I received a cable asking me if I knew Mr. Cooper and what dates he stopped with us—I cabled back—I received a letter afterwards in relation to the same matter—I answered that; after that I saw Mr. Birch, from Messrs. Wontner and Sons—it was a very difficult matter for me to come here—I have no interest whatever in this matter of any sort or kind; I come here at great personal inconvenience and expense—I had to put another man in my place as manager of the hotel—it is the first time I have been away for four years—I have had no vacation at all—I have no interest in giving evidence, except to give the facts.</p>

               <p>I am sure of that; it is written over two little ticks; that does not indicate to me that the person who wrote his name put his name and two dots, and that I wrote the "E" in some time after—these two marks and the letter "E" were made at the same time, I pledge my oath—there are two dots there—I will not swear the whole entry was made at the same time, but I will swear to the "E" and the two marks indicating the arrival—the "E" is not written over the two dots, they are in the tail of the "E"—it means this, I suppose; our house is mostly on the American plan, and the entry above being on the American plan for dinner, the two dots were put there to mean ditto, and then it being Mr. Cooper, it was afterwards changed to "E"—the "E" was written after wards, I imagine the two dots were there first—I always look at the book directly I come down in the morning, and the chambermaid would bring me down, when I sent for it, information that 440 was empty—I then looked to see if the room had been paid for, and who occupied room 440—I had a long conversation with him when he arrived, as to whether he might not have his old room, and I gave him the room, and he wrote the figures 440 himself—we have over 600 rooms, and I could not re member for the moment who had it—the prisoner used to occupy 440 when he could get it—there is half a page of entries after his on the 22nd—my conversation with him took place between 5 and 6 in the evening—I looked and saw the prisoner had occupied the room; I had forgotten it, or I should not have looked—I made an entry of the fact that the room was owing on a piece of paper we have for such purposes, and left it on the bill clerk's desk—I have not got the piece of paper, it is charged in the ledger—there is no entry in the transient ledger for 22nd or 23rd August; it would not be the proper thing to do, it is not our rule to enter people on the European plan unless they stay more than one day—we never enter it at all then as a rule—I had no entry except on the piece of paper, we tear those up as soon as entries are made on the ledger—they are put on the bill clerk's file for future reference should the guest come again, and then he is charged, if not the account is lost—that is the practice of the house—the prisoner had never gone away before without paying his bill—persons very often go away without paying their bills—7th September was a long day—the prisoner arrived there in the evening—I made the entry "E there and the number 519 of the room—on 21st July, 3rd August, and 7th September, the number of the room is written by me or the clerk, but 440 on 22nd August is in the prisoner's writing—I saw him write this—the clerk puts the ticks who transfers them to the ledger—this was checked next morning—the tick means that it has been transferred to the ledger, or that some notice has been taken of it; it is checked by me to show I have accounted for it and made a memorandum of it—that would be made next day—he wrote "R. Cooper," and "440, "Imade the two little strokes and two ticks after he had gone to his room some time—we fill that up after the guest has gone—I am quite clear that I asked him what plan he was on—I may have been called away at the time and so not have written the "E" then—I cannot state whether I was called away directly he came or not—if not I should not have finished this at once—it is our rule to write the figures of the room, I or the clerk in my absence, and also the time of arrival—I did not write those—I think I must have written those figures</p>

I am an artist, and have lived at 2204, Chesnut Street, Philadelphia for over 40 years—the prisoner is my nephew—I saw him in Philadelphia in July—after he was in custody I received a cable from England, in consequence of which I went to the Colonnade Hotel, Philadelphia—I saw the register there, and answered the cable to England—after that I received a letter and wrote this one in answer—I stepped in the Colonnade Hotel on the way to the post office—I think it was 27th July I saw my nephew, the day he arrived—I think he stopped about three days then—he came to my house the 19th August, the night he arrived—he then had a little hand-bag with him, but not his luggage—he told me he had left it at the station—he came to me because if was late—he thought he would like to see me, and thought I might have retired—he went to the hotel first; it was 10 o'clock or a little past—he stayed with me at my house that night of 19th August, and the two next nights he stayed with me—he stayed with me during that visit to Philadelphia, and slept at my house three nights—he left me on the afternoon of the 22nd—I went to the railway-station with him; he told me he was going to New York—the journey from Philadelphia to New York takes two and a half to three hours, or two hours by the express trains—he came to Philadelphia again early in September; I think on the 6th I saw him—he stopped at the Colonnade; he was early enough to come out to my place after entering his name there—I don't think he stayed more than a day then—that was the last time I saw him—I saw him three times; the first time he stopped at the Colonnade, the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> On the 22nd I saw the prisoner get his luggage from the bag room—he had one of those English travelling bags, I think they call them hunting bags; it was a pretty good size—he had an ulster; that was deposited at the railway-station too, and his umbrella and cane—I don't remember any other luggage—there were two parcels anyhow, that was the bag and another parcel and the ulster—he brought a little bag to my house, a kind of satchel—I did not see it open, and cannot tell you what it contained—my house is about a quarter of an hour's walk from the railway-station—during the time he was with me, from 19th to 22nd August, he went out walking occasionally; I went out with him—he went out at different times of the day, morning, after noon, and so on—he told me he had business—I did not go to any business with him during the time he was there—I don't know what his business was in Philadelphia that brought him there at 10 o'clock at night; he did not tell me; I did not expect him—he said without my asking him that he had left his luggage at the station; he gave no reason at all for that—I suggested next morning that he might as well fetch it—he said it was not worth while; he was not sure how long he would be there; when he got through his business he was going to return—I gave him what change of clothes and linen he wanted—he said next day he would go and fetch his luggage of his own accord—I said "You need not do that, "Iwould lend him some—I did not know when he was going to leave—he said he was going to get through his business soon; he did not expect to stay—I do not know what his business was—I live in my own apartments there; I have no wife or daughter—there is a servant who is used by the tenants and myself—the house is let out in flats, and the same servant does for the different flats—I do not employ her except when I want attention—she makes the beds, empties the slops, and does that kind of thing—she does not live in the house—I have a little apparatus to do the cooking; the woman brings what I want—she does not come after the morning; that would be mid-day or 10 o'clock; she does not return after that that day—I have lived in that house for 17 years—there is only one tenant in the house besides myself, he occupies five rooms, Mr. Osborne—he resides in the country—nobody sleeps there but myself—there are nine or ten rooms in the house—I occupy three, and some are unlet—Mr. Osborne is an artificial limb maker; he is there till late in the afternoon; he has lived there many years—he has three rooms on the ground floor and two on the third floor—we call the servant Elizabeth; she has been with him since he has been in the house—I don't know whether she is here; I have not seen her—my nephew stopped at the Colonnade in July, not at my house; he was there two or three days—he had never stayed with me in this house before; he had lived with me at one time—I have lived in Philadelphia oyer 40 years—he lived with me in 1861—I cannot call to mind how many times I had seen him since 1874 or 1884—he was at my house in 1886—he stopped at the Continental Hotel then—there was no other occasion in 1886—these last two years is the time I have seen him most—on 19th August he stopped with me—the hotels do not close at 10 o'clock—he said he came from New York—the Colonnade</p>

               <p>is only five or six minutes' walk from the terminus at which he would arrive from New York—the hotels in Philadelphia are open at any hour, I suppose, and however late the hour might be there would always be a porter to take people in, and at 10 o'clock things are in full swing there, persons coming and taking refreshments—he gave me the reason that he came and stopped with me, that he was afraid I was in bed—he thought of stopping at Bingham's house, which is below—he said he was undecided whether to stop at the Colonnade or Bingham's, and fearing he would not see me that night he came directly out to my house in the hope of finding me up—he wanted to see me, I suppose, on no special business; he wanted to see me as his uncle—he has always shown fondness for me, to inquire after my health—it might have answered as well to do that next morning—I don't think so; it was a natural impulse to see an uncle—I remember the 19th August in this way; he came about 10 or a little later—we sat talking over an hour, and then he proposed to go out and get a glass of ale; we went out and took a glass of ale and some refreshment—he came back to my house and sat there till about 1 o'clock—it was 1; I looked at my watch and remarked "You had better stay with me," and I said "The 19th is my birthday, and you remember the most important and successful enterprise I ever entered into was opened on the 19th, my birthday," and I further remarked "It is one of my lucky days, you had better stay with me," and he laughed—I took a property on 19th August, 1860, and put up some large buildings and improvements, and it was the greatest success I ever had in my life, and it firmly fixed in my mind the 19th—at the station they give you a check for your luggage when they take it; I don't think there is any fee, but there are two tickets on a strap, and they take off one, a round brass thing like a coin with a number on it, and give it to the traveller, and the other is stuck on the luggage—I posted a letter for him next day after he came, the 23rd, in Philadelphia—he wrote some letters; I am not sure he wrote the very day he left, the evening before, but he left one letter on my table; there were papers there, and the prisoner did not see he had left one of the letters by mistake on my table—I discovered it afterwards, it got under some newspapers, he forgot it, and seeing the direction I posted it, went out and got a stamp on the 23rd and posted it—I saw the prisoner write it—I was there when he was writing, of course I saw him write it—that was one of the letters he wrote at the time—he wrote other letters, one or more I know—he posted them himself, he must have, I did not find them there—I only found this one on the table where he wrote it—it had got under some newspapers—my address is 2204, Chesnut Street—I think this is the envelope of the letter I posted—it was a little after 10 when he came to my place on the 19th—we went out after 11 and had a glass of ale, and sat up till 1 a.m.—I am quite sure he did not write any letter there on the 19th—he was in my presence from 10 o'clock on the 19th till he went to bed at 1—he did not write any letter that night at my house—he told me he had not been well; he told me nothing about his business; he did not specify his ailments more than that he had been in bad health—I never troubled what his business was when he was with me, I never asked him his business—I did not ask him about his business when he came back in August, I told him some of my business, I</p>

I live at George Street, Bloomsbury; I was manageress to Daly and Cooper's business, at Featherstone Buildings, from August, 1884, to October, 1886; after that Mr. Harman succeeded to the business, and I assisted Mr. Harman—it was the Palestine Floral Card business—I remember the prisoner going to America in 1886; he was there for some months, from April till August; during that time I regularly corresponded with him; I remember his going to America on 5th July, 1887—Mr. Warr's stationer's shop is at the corner of Featherstone Buildings; I remember his having in a package of paper—before the prisoner went to America he left instructions that the packages of papers were to go to Mr. Warr; I have more than once been to Mr. Warr's shop, not on any particular business—after the prisoner had gone to America on 5th July, I wrote to him, and received letters from him; this is the first letter I received from him.

I advised her to go and see the writer of the letter on the Monday, and she said "Yes, ill as I am, if Mrs. Scrivens comes round to-morrow I will ask her to mind the children on Monday, and I will go to him"—Mrs. Scrivens was a former landlady of hers—the prisoner was very much disappointed and distressed at the letter—she had been complaining for some days past of acute neuralgia in the head, and of a weight on the top of her head—her face had been very much swollen, and she had had to wrap something round it—she also complained of a sore mouth and of a constant pain in her back—I do not know what was the cause of that, but I know she had been up with the children for a fortnight, and that her rest had been disturbed—from what I could judge of her she was very ill—she had nursed the children day and night, giving them the most tender care, and never leaving the house all that time—she was completely worn out—she was a most devoted mother to the children—aboutmidday on Sunday I supplied her with dinner for herself and children—on the Saturday evening I had gone to her bedroom and asked her if I could get her in something for Sunday, and she said "No, thank you, Miss Jones, I will take a pint of milk of the milkman in the morning"—the room was then in darkness, but she was lying in bed with one child each side of her—that was about 11 o'clock—she remained very ill on the Sunday, but she was up and attending to the children—the last time I saw her on the Sunday was after the morning service, when my sister took her some dinner—she was then in the same condition—the next time I saw her after that was between 7 and 8 on the Monday morning—I came down then to light the kitchen fire, and found her sitting upon the sofa—she was fully dressed, with her boots</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector at Ilford</hi>) On 20th February I went to this house and saw the dead children, and then the prisoner—she said the eldest child was registered as Bertie Morris Styles and the younger as Frank Morris Styles—she said that Styles was her mother's maiden name, and that that was not the true name of the children—she said the father's name was John M. Morris; she did not know his second name, and that he was in business at Stephen Evans', Old Change Buildings, City; they are wholesale mantle-makers—the prisoner was employed there as forewoman in the workroom for about 14 years, and left about October, 1885—during all that time, for the last 16 years, a man was employed there named John M. Morris; he was foreman of the factory—he was there until the time of the murder, but has left now, and I have not been able to ascertain his whereabouts—I took possession of this knife, which I found in the room—I also saw a pillow without any covering, but I did not take possession of it, as I did not know of the evidence connected with it—in my hearing the doctor said to her "What is the reason?" and she replied "Want; I owed Mrs. Jones money; I could not get any; the father would not send any"—I then took her in custody to the station—she afterwards handed me three letters—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two of them, and said they were from the man Morris—the firm authorise me to state that Morris was receiving between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner practising in Queen's Road, Plaistow—on the 20th February I was called to 36, Whitfield Road, and went there with my assistant—I went into the bed room upstairs, and there saw the bodies of the two children; they were both dead and cold—I noticed that there was a wound upon the neck of the younger child, and blood upon its mouth—it had cut through the skin, and ran parallel to the collar bone—it was such a wound as might have been caused by this knife—I did not examine the child further; I</p>

               <p>confined myself entirely to observing that it was dead—the same also applies to the elder child—on 22nd February I made a post-mortem examination of both the children, and came to the conclusion that they had died by suffocation; I could account for no other cause of death—I have heard the account which the mother gave of how the children met with their deaths; that was consistent with what I saw—I saw the prisoner in the kitchen on the 20th, about 9 o'clock, she seemed very weak and much agitated, and greatly distressed—I formed an opinion then as to the state of her mind, and considered her to be insane—she did not seem to comprehend the position in which she had placed herself by this act—I asked her how it came about, and then she gave me the account which has been spoken to—she gave a circumstantial account of how it occurred, but did not seem to realise her position—I have heard that she had been suffering from neuralga; that would undoubtedly account for the pressure on the head—want of rest and want of food would contribute largely to an attack of insanity—I have also heard that she complained of a pain in the back—I thought that was caused by getting up of a night and nursing the children—that would also tend very much to the upsetting of her mind—judging from her state of health before the murder of the children and her behaviour afterwards, I think it very likely that at the time she did this she was suffering from an uncontrollable impulse—I think it was a condition of moral insanity.</p>

I live at 49, Victoria Dock Road, Canning Town, and am a provision dealer—I have seen Burrell on several occasions—on 27th January, about 5 p.m., he called at my shop, and asked me if I would be kind enough to change this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for him—I said "No; it is not convenient"—he said "I have some men waiting outside for their wages, and it would be a great convenience to me if you would do so"—I ultimately changed it, giving him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I paid it in to my banker's next day, and it was returned, marked "Signature differs"—on 2nd February I saw Burrell close to his own house, in the morning I think—Sergeant Dicker was with me—I said "I have called in reference to this cheque; it appears to be a fraud"—he said he had received it from Mr. Leader for work done—I then said "Then no doubt you will have the cash returned to you from Tate's Institute," or something to that effect—Dicker had possession of the cheque then—Burrell called on me the same evening; he was very anxious respecting it—he said it was a very unfortunate thing, for Cooper had absconded, or something to that effect—he said "Mr. Leader handed the cheque to Copper, and Cooper handed it to me, and Cooper has absconded"—I think he said my money would be all right, and I had no doubt at that time that it would be—I saw him again on the Thursday, and on the Saturday evening he called on me and said "I have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket if you will take it in part payment of the cheque"—I said I had every reason to believe it was a fraud, and the matter was in the hands of the police—that was all that took place.</p>

On 31<hi rend="italic">st</hi> January I received information from Mr. Castle, and on 2nd February I was with Mr. Castle and saw Burrell—after Mr. Castle spoke to him I said Mr. Castle had no reason to believe that he had come by the cheque dishonestly, that he had placed the matter in my hands, and I wanted him to assist me to make inquiries about it—he said "He is a Christian man and would not do anything wrong; Mr. Castle knows that; I received the cheque for work done for the Building Society"—it is the Canning Town and Silvertown Building Society held at Tate's Institute—I asked him who I had better see—he said I had better see the secretary, Mr. Leader—I said "Where can I see him?"—he said "I don't know his private address, but you could see him at the office to-morrow morn</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The letters were read That of</hi> 22 <hi rend="italic">nd November said that Burrell must make an effort to let Cooper have cash in the morning, as he was hard up; and that if he could do nothing for him he must tell Mr. Leader his position in the morning; that marked "B" asked Burrell to make a binding arrangement to repay Cooper, as he was really pressed for cash, and said that when he let him have</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">he assured him there was no fear of his not having the money at once.</hi>) I went to Cooper's house on 20th February at half-past 11—I got to the top floor of the building and knocked at the door—I should think Cooper could have heard what was said—I got inside the room, a bedroom, and said to Mrs. Cooper "I want you to be candid; is Mr. Cooper here?"—she said "No"—I took a lamp and looked under the bed—I there found the prisoner Cooper partly dressed—I said "Come out; I want to speak to you"—he came out, and I told him I held a warrant for his arrest, and read the warrant to him; it charged him with forging a cheque—he said "How do you prove I forged it?"—I conveyed him to the station, and on the way he said "How does Mr. Castle prove that I forged the cheque?"—when charged at the station he made no reply.</p>

I live at 128, Mile End Road—I am a Queen's tax collector—this is a cheque on my bank, the London and South-Western Bank, Stepney branch—the number on it corresponds with my cheque book; it has been taken from this cheque-book; it was the last but one in the book—the counterfoil has gone as well—I had this cheque-book in my possession prior to August last—Cooper was in my employment then, or rather in the employment of the firm, of which I am a member, and in the office where I kept this cheque-book—I might have kept this cheque-book on the table, so that the prisoner could have access to it—this cheque is not signed by me—the signature is very much like one of my signatures, the one I use for giving receipts to the public as a tax collector—it is not like what I use for cheques, quite different—while Cooper was in my office he would have had the opportunity of seeing my signature to the receipts thousands of times—he would have the opportunity of seeing my signature to cheques very seldom—the signature and filling in are like Cooper's handwriting; it is disguised—some of the letters in the endorsement are like his writing—we missed three cheques from the firm's cheque-book, but I did not miss any from this book before this cheque was presented to my banker's—after it was presented I missed two cheques from my book—I did not myself tear them out; I don't know who did.</p>

                  </hi> I was Presiding Officer at Munson Road for both candidates at the Deptford Election—about 2.15 p.m. the prisoner came into my polling booth and asked for a voting-paper—Mr. Balderson, the agent for one of the parties, asked him his name and address, and he gave that of Samuel Buckoke, of No. 1, Faulkner Street, Deptford—at the request of Mr. Balderson I read the declaration to him—in answer to it he said he was Samuel Buckoke—I asked him the second time, and on oath he gave the same answer—I asked him four times in all whether he was Samuel Buckoke, and he gave the same answer—thereupon Mr. Balderson said "If I am acting up to my instructions I must give him in charge"—the prisoner was asked where he lived—he said he had removed to New Cross—after he was given into custody Mr. Balder son said to him that he had been to Mr. Buckoke's house several times, and found that he had removed to Berkhamstead, and that he had himself seen Mr. Buckoke, and knew that the prisoner was not the man—the prisoner said "Very well, then you know that I am not Samuel Buckoke"—I went with him to the police-station and saw the name that the prisoner gave on the charge-sheet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Darby, and live with him at Belmont Villas, Hampton Road, Mortlake—on Tuesday, 6th March, about 1.30 a.m., I was at home and heard a cry outside my front door—I had heard no knock before that; I was in the kitchen—I listened and then heard another cry, and went to the front door and saw a baby lying on the doorstep, crying; it was dressed—I then went to Mortlake Station and got a policeman, and he came back with me, and took the baby away—when I first saw the baby I did not see anybody near it—I did not recognise it—the prisoner had called on me on the 13th February, bringing her baby with her, and asked me if Mr. Darby was in, and I told her he was not—she said she wanted to see him respecting the child, and asked me if she might come in—I said "Yes," and she came in—she then said the child belonged to Mr. Darby—her aunt was with her, and her aunt said if she could get some money she would go away altogether—she said her husband was in Australia, but she should never go and live with him again—in the meanwhile my son came in, and he told her to go out or he would turn her out—she then went out—on this night it was not so cold as we have had it; it had been a nice sunshiny day—my husband is a builder, and the prisoner was living in one of his houses.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I listened and the child cried very loud after that—I had the kitchen door open—I offered to light a fire for you—I told you if Darby came to you you should have shut the door in his face, told him to go home to his wife, and not have encouraged him if you knew he was not a single man.</p>

I am barman at the Olive Branch public house, Waterloo Road—on 21st February last, about 9.30, the prisoner came in with two others, and asked for three two-pennyworths of hot rum, and put a gilded Jubilee sixpence on the counter, head downwards; I took it up and looked at it, and saw it was a Jubilee sixpence, and took it to the manager, who was at the other end of the bar—as I was going to the manager, the prisoner called out and said "I have made a mistake"—that was just at the time I was giving the coin to the manager, and the other two men who were with him then went out—the manager then came back to the counter with me, and I saw the prisoner standing at the counter alone, the other two men having gone out—I noticed the glasses I had served these men with, but did not notice if</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Olive Branch—on this day I heard the prisoner call to the barman that he had made a mistake; that he did not call for three two penny worths of rum cold, but two hot and one cold—after that had been cleared up the order was given for two hot and one cold—I saw the drink given to the prisoner—he then said to the barman he never called for them at all—he saw me standing by—I walked to the further end of the bar, and while there Evans brought this coin to me and said something to me—I examined it—I took no notice of the prisoner, but sent another barman for a constable—I went to the prisoner and asked him where he had got it, or if he had any more like it—he said nothing for a few minutes, and at last he said "I suppose it is a mistake"—there is always a constable on the fixed point at the door—he came in then, and the coin was handed to him, and he searched the prisoner, and the prisoner was given into custody—when I got up to the counter I noticed the glasses of the prisoner's two com panions that had left were full, and the prisoner's was just upon empty—I did not notice the two who had left the full glasses go out of the public house, but they were standing by the prisoner—the barman who went for the constable went out by the side door, not by the door out of which the two men went.</p>

I saw at once that the coin was a wrong one, that it was a sixpence—I did not see the prisoner come in; I saw the other two men by the side of him—the two glasses were not touched—they were about half full—I cannot say whether the men had drunk or not—the barman went to a different door to that of the compartment in which the prisoner was—I believe there was a race on at Sandown Park—I never allow a customer to be served when he is the worse for liquor—if he is so he is discharged at a moment's notice—the prisoner was afterwards a little thick in his speech, more so at the station—I had no opportunity of speaking to him before he had the rum—when I went and asked him</p>
