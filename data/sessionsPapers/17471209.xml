               <p>Q. Who had the key of the lodging?</p>
               <p>Elby. She had the key: she had a husband, but not at the time when we mist these goods; she left her lodgings, and carried the key away, and I sent after her; she took a lodging by Red-Lion square when I sent to her, and she sent the key; then I examined the lodging, and I mist these goods; after that I saw her the first time in the street, and I askt her for the things, and she said, she would bring them if I would not hurt her; she said she had pawned some of them at Mr. Sayer's in Wild-street, and some in Hart street, and some in the Savoy. We got a search-warrant, and she went with us to the pawnbroker's: we went to Mr. Sayer's first, and there we found the quilt, blanket, &amp;c. then we went to Mr. Crew's in Hart street, and there I found the stew-pan and iron; we found all at these several pawnbrokers, except a tablecloth and two pillowbears, and the stew-pan; the stew-pan was taken out of a lodger's room.</p>
               <p>- Sherwood pawnbroker. The prisoner brought to my shop about eleven months ago a tea-kettle and two blankets, and about seven months ago, two sheets; I have known the prisoner seven years, she used to work for a shoemaker, in our neighbourhood: at another time she brought a quilt.</p>
               <p>- Parry. I am a pawnbroker. Last June the prisoner brought me a glass, and about two months ago she brought me a stew-pan, and at the same time a flat iron.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say for yourself?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did it in my husband's time, I did not intend to wrong them of the goods: I intended to bring them again, and it was out of mere necessity.</p>

               <p>Pearce. Yes, Sir, she came backwards and forwards to assist me; and about the 11th of September last I mist the goods; I lodged at one Mr. Jones's in <placeName id="t17471209-3-crimeloc11">Newtner street</placeName>

The goods were in different places in my lodging, I know it must be the prisoner, for there was no body else there; the apron was taken off her side, I found nothing else upon her, I took her up, and had her before Justice Burdus.</p>
               <p>The prisoner swore she borrowed the apron of the witness.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did the Prisoner confess the fact?</p>
               <p>Trotter. She confest it to the constable of the night, she had pawned them at Mr. Wilson's, in another name, and she confest she had stole the tea-kettle.</p>
               <p>Clark. I live at the Rose in St. Bride's-alley, the Prisoner brought the tea-kettle and box-iron, and I lent her half a crown uponthem; she confest before the Alderman, she took the tea-kettle, and another woman gave her the box-iron.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trotter came to our shop to ask for these things, and we told him we had them; Mr. Trotter took her up on Saturday night, and carried her before the Alderman on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner said in her defence, that the tea-kettle was given to her by Mr. Trotter's kinswoman.</p>

            . I lost this lead the beginning of Oct. last, my wife found a hole into our house from another house adjoining to it; I went upon the house, and there I saw the lead missing, and the witness with me saw a parcel of lead took from the gutter. On the 20th of October, I saw another great hole in the house joining to mine; I went upon that house and I saw a hole; I went upon another, and there I saw the Prisoner behind a stack of chimnies: I asked him what business he had there; he said he fled from a press gang, and I found a couple of case knives, and a porter's knot, and a bag at the side of him. I asked him about the knives, he said, he knew nothing of them, but he owned the knot.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found your own lead again?</p>
               <p>Carpenter. Yes, my Lord, in my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge him with your lead?</p>
               <p>Carpenter. Because I found him in the other house.</p>

            . On the 3d of December, a witness in court saw the Prisoner go out of my house with a bundle, and she told me of it, and I pursued him, and took upon him one camblet coat, a cloth coat, a linen apron, and one linen shift: All these things were taken from my kitchin; and I took them upon the Prisoner, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, about an hundred yards from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the worth of these things?</p>
               <p>Mc Culla. I valued them at 4 s. and 6 d. when I took the goods from him, he joined both his hands to a stick, which I will show, and it had a tuck in it; I did not give him an opportunity to draw it, for we laid hold of his arms.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether I made any Resistance.</p>
               <p>Court. He swears, that you put your hand to the stick, in order to draw it.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say for your self?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These things and the stick was given to me, by a person to carry for him to the other side of Tyburn.</p>

            , otherwise Poison, are now indicted for having been arm'd and assembled together with other persons above the number of three, arm'd in order to aid and assist in the running uncustomed goods. And they are indicted for the offence in transgression of a statute made the 9th year of his present Majesty's reign, that if any persons to the number of three or more, after the 17th of June, 1736, shall be assembled, arm'd with arms, fire-arms, and other offensive weapons in order to be assisting in running, landing, and carrying away uncustomed goods, and upon conviction of such an offence, shall be judged guilty, and shall be transported.</p>
               <p>The Legislator has been forc'd since to make that offence capital, but the present charge against the prisoners is within the act of the 9th of his present Majesty, which is transportation. You need not be told, because it is very notorious the different steps the government has been forc'd to take in order, if possible, to get the better of the crying offence of smuggling; they have try'd all methods, indemnit ies and punishments; they have from step to step try'd different degrees of punishment: in the 9th of his present Majesty it was thought it would be sufficient to break the practice by making it felony by transportation. You very well know that smuggling is carried on without paying duties to answer the expences of the public; and it is not barely defrauding a little, but 'tis carried on by a kind of rebellion in defiance of the Magistrate; therefore they go arm'd 30 or 40, and perhaps a 100 in a gang: there is no magistrate, or officer where they reign (if I may so say) can put any laws in execution against them. Therefore the legislator found it necessary to come to another act, and 'tis by vertue of that law it is now made capital, that was an act made in the 19th of his present Majesty: for 'tis now a struggle between the government and this banditti, which shall get the better. All offences against this act, or any former acts of this kind, may be try'd in any county; and it is on the former act it now comes before you. The Prisoners before you are of a gang well known by the name of the Hawkhurst gang. A great number associated together, to carry on this lawless practice of theirs, and they carry it on in an open public manner.</p>
               <p>The two Prisoners at the bar are the two principal, or perhaps ringleaders of the Hawkhurst gang; the particular offence they are now charg'd with, was on the 22d of December 1744. It may be material to state to you, that we have one that happens to have an opportunity to prove the fact so clearly upon them, that they were armed themselves, together<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174712090020"/> with other persons: and the witness will prove the species of goods they run, and all the circumstances belonging to it; and it may be material to observe to you, that

            , one of a good character and reputation for 14 years in the government's service, but his Integrity had like to have cost him dear; he thinking the law would be sufficient to justify him in the exercise of his duty, thought to check some of their practices in the county of Kent; when he was returning back, he put up at an Inn to refresh himself, call'd the King's-Head-Inn in Shoreham; he happened to be there with two other officers, and they were soon alarm'd with a great noise and shouting, and they found the Hawkhurst gang was come: upon this, they went to hide themselves; when this gang came to the house in pursuit of these officers, they swore they would have them, or they would pull the house down; and they found the witness, Bolton, and the other two persons, Jones and Floyd; they did not get back again, but he did, and is now able to do his country justice. As soon as they found them, they tied their hands behind them, and tied their feet by the stirrup; then to strike a terror to other people, to shew how dangerous it was to oppose them, they whipt them towards Tunbridge; and when they came to Hawkhurst, then they disciplin'd them with their stirrup-leathers; and when they had done this, they carried them afterwards to New-Rumney; they were afraid of their escaping, so they carry'd them, and particularly Bolton, the witness, upon the 22d and the 24th of December, to Lidlight in the parish of Lid in the county of Kent. They took the prisoner with them, and took out the goods before him, and he was kept in their custody for a while; but afterwards he providentially got away from them. While he was there he saw the goods brought from on board the cutter. The goods that are generally run for the ease of carriage and stowage are tea, brandy or wine in small casks. The tea, when it comes from Flushing, Boulogne, or any of the opposite coasts, they put on board the cutter all in oil-skin bags; and these bags are tied together, so that when they come to shore, then they have nothing to do but throw them across the horses; sometimes they ride upon them, and sometimes they have drove horses.</p>
               <p>No fair merchant ever imports tea in oil-skin bags; 'tis well known by all the people in the country, when they see oil-skin bags, whose they are. Neither can any brandy or wine be imported in any cask less than 60 gallons, but they always import it in casks they call half-anchors, and they fling them the same way. Another witness saw the Prisoners on the 27th. in another place in the county in the same gang with oil skin bags and brandy, carrying it from the coast. If you are satisfied with this evidence, you will do the country justice, and prevent a great many other people from entering into such associations.</p>

            , and one of our horses being lame, we were obliged to have the horse shod; while we were there, in about an hour and a half, all of a sudden we heard a prodigious firing, and it was a gang of smuglers.</p>
               <p>Q. How many?</p>
               <p>Bolton. Eight of them. They came up to the ale-house; hearing of such a number coming, we went and hid ourselves, but they seeing our horses, threatened they would have us, or they would pull and fire the house down; and upon searching, they found us, and robbed us of our arms and money, and they tied us to the stirrups, and had us down to Hawkhurst; after they had us there some time, they stripped us naked all above the waist, and then they began to cut us in a very terrible manner: They put horse-locks about our legs, and kept us in chains. On the 20th, there was a vast number of horses collected together, and then we were put upon horses again, tied, and carried to New-Rumney, and eight or ten with us; and Hodges was with us at New-Rumney, and sat up with us two nights. I am positive to Hodges, he hit me three or four blows.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue there?</p>
               <p>Bolton. We continued these to the 22d, and word was brought that the Boulogne boat was come in; then the horses were got out directly, and we were put upon horses and tied: Hodges went down with me in company with the horses to Lidlight; when we came there I believe there were two hundred horses and one hundred men.</p>

               <p>(The Continuation.)</p>
               <p>Q. WERE the men arm'd?</p>
               <p>Bolton. Each of them with a carbine and a pair of pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Tickner at Lidlight ?</p>
               <p>Bolton: Yes; I was as near to him as I am to you. Hodgers had a pair of pistols and a carbine; to the best of my remembrance, Hodger's was a brass carbine, and Tickner's was an iron one; and most of them were arm'd, some with a carbine and a pair of pistols, some in bags and some on their backs.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came to Lidlight, what did they do?</p>
               <p>Bolton. Some were standing about, and some were landing of tea in oil-skin bags. I believe, to speak within compass, there were five tun contained in oil-skin bags: I saw their loaded horses, and there was a waggon with four oxen and two horses, and a cart with two oxen loaded with brandy and wine. As to the brandy, I drank some of it upon the Beach. The prisoner Tickner, after he had loaded the horses, went away, and left a great many people upon the Beach.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you to apprehend it was tea?</p>
               <p>Bolton. By all their discourse, and it was in the same package as I always seiz'd it; and the brandy was in half anchors.</p>
               <p>Q. From what discourse did you conclude this to be tea and brandy?</p>
               <p>Bolton. By their discourse of its coming from Boulogne; and they intended I should be sent over to Boulogne.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them aiding and assisting in carrying away these goods?</p>
               <p>Bolton. As for Tickner, I saw him loading the horses; as to the other, I did not see him load; but I saw him there armed with the rest: I saw three or four boat loads come from the cutter.</p>
               <p>Sol. Gen. How long have you been an officer in the customs?</p>
               <p>Bolton. Twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the package of tea and brandy?</p>
               <p>Bolton. There is a canvas within side of the oil-skin, and the tea is within that, and generally put up in quarter of hundred bags; sometimes there will be two bags tied together,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174712090023"/> then they tie knots, and throw them across the horse; they did it the same as I always saw it.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Council. How many times have you been an evidence against people concerned in this practice?</p>
               <p>Bolton. I believe twice.</p>
               <p>Council. Was you ever an evidence at Rochester? and was you not an evidence the last Sessions?</p>
               <p>Bolton. I answered the question as to the manner of their smuggling tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know that Tickner was in custody in Maidstone ?</p>
               <p>Bolton. I don't know whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Council. Did not you know that he was to take his trial at Rochester assizes ?</p>
               <p>Bolton. I heard he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Council. Surely you can recollect the time. How came you not to remark the time, when you first heard that Tickner was in custody? can you tell whether it was two or three months ago? when did you first give your information against Tickner ?</p>
               <p>Bolton. I can't say.</p>
               <p>Council. When you first heard he was in Maidstone goal, how came you not to prosecute? how came you to recollect this 18th of December?</p>
               <p>Bolton. I can't but remember it.</p>
               <p>Sol. Gen. Do you think any man whipped as he was, could ever forget the day?</p>
               <p>Council. What habit had they?</p>
               <p>Bolton. They had both of them light coats; Tickner loaded his horse near to me.</p>
               <p>Council. Can you pretend to say you knew what was in those bags ? can you tell that it was tea ?</p>
               <p>Bolton. I believe it was; they pegg'd one of the casks of brandy, and I casted it.</p>
               <p>Council. How do you know it had not paid duty?</p>
               <p>Bolton. I believe it had not, they waited two or three days for the boats coming from Boulogne.</p>
               <p>Council. So it is upon your belief, that these goods had not paid duty?</p>
               <p>Bolton. I saw it brought from the sloop, and the brandy I drank of.</p>
               <p>Council. How came you to be in that country?</p>
               <p>Sol. Gen. They carried him there and whipped him.</p>
               <p>Bolton. We were to have been put on board the vessel, but the sailors belonging to the smuggling cutter would not take us on board; the smugglers fired at the sailors, and the sailors fired at them.</p>
               <p>Serjeant Hayward. I am sorry to hear that.</p>
               <p>Council. How long have you known Tickner?</p>
               <p>Bolton. I can't say that I ever knew him before I saw him upon the Beach.</p>
               <p>Council. How many times have you seen him since that?</p>
               <p>Bolton. While I was with them I saw him four or five times.</p>

            . Do you know Tickner the, Prisoner at the bar ?</p>
               <p>Anderson. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I saw him at a place called Waddon, in the county of Surry, about the 6th or 7th of September, 1744, he was loaded with oil-skin bags and half anchors, and five or six men, and six or seven drove of horses loaded with oil-skin bags and half anchors</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in that county?</p>
               <p>Anderson. Many years; I was bred and born thereabouts, I never saw any tea belonging to smugglers, but what was packed in oil-skin bags; all that I ever seized was in oil-skin bags.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Council. How often have you seen Tickner before?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174712090024"/>Anderson. Several times before, and since; I have drank with him, I was in his company at Waddon.</p>
               <p>Council. When had you the first information that he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I saw him brought to town through the Borough.</p>
               <p>Council. How long ago did you give your information ?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I gave information to his Majesty's Solicitor, that such a person was guilty of such an offence; I did it voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Council. Did not you hear he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I went and told that I knew such a person.</p>
               <p>Council. Did not you know that he was a farmer ?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I was not acquainted with his farming business, he was always accounted a notorious smuggler.</p>
               <p>Sol. General to Foster. Give an account in what manner tea and brandy are stowed.</p>
               <p>Foster. I have been an officer of the customs above thirty years, and in the course of that time, I have seized large quantities of run goods, forty or fifty tons at different times from gangs of smugglers, and I never met with any goods in oil-skin bags but tea; and whenever I found these bags, I was certain they were nothing else but tea, and when I opened them they always proved to be tea. Now as to brandy, it is much the same as to package, especially when it comes from the water-side; they bring it in half anchors, in order to carry them easily upon horses. I don't know that I have found an half anchor, but has had brandy; as to the difference between tea that has paid the duty and what is run, I apprehend is this; no tea can be imported into England, but must be brought to London, no private person is permitted to bring it any where; I never knew any tea imported but in casks or tubs, nor do I know that liberty is given for any body to import, but to London.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you take to be the reason of their stowing it after that manner?</p>
               <p>Foster. I apprehend the reason is, that it might be portable; they generally when they are loaden, are tied with cords to be put more readily into sacks; and when they are so tied, a man may easily set upon the bags.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Council. Suppose a person had a mind, could he not put lace in those bags?</p>
               <p>Foster. I don't say they might not, but I never met with any such thing.</p>
               <p>Sol. General. Five tons of lace for instance.</p>
               <p>Foster. If they were lace or silks, it would appear in another shape, you would see the rolls; if silk was put into bags it would appear, if there is tea in those bags, it will appear as oats or other corn to fill it around.</p>
               <p>Council. Suppose a man had a mind to lay out five hundred pounds in linen, and carry it in that manner ?</p>
               <p>Foster. I think there is no doubt at all, but when any man sees these bags he can tell; he can tell whether it is piece goods, or tea, or coffee; besides, linens are never imported in oil-skin bags, they are commonly in casks.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Council. They that purchase tea at the Custom-house have proper authority to put it into these bags, have they not?</p>
               <p>Foster. Yes, but I never knew it done; for it hurts the tea, and gives it something of a taste.</p>
               <p>Court to Tickner. What have you to say by way of defence?</p>
               <p>Tickner. I never saw Bolton but once, and for curiosity, I got off my horse and went and saw him; I heard a great noise, I was plowing in the field, and went out of curiosity. I went up to the hedge to see them go down; it was on a Friday, and the next day he swore to me. I never saw the man before, I never saw nor knew any thing of him. I could prove that I loaded five bags of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174712090025"/> hops, and sent them to London that morning.</p>

             (tried the last Sessions) since the 24th of July, 1746, about the month of August, 1746, were assembled with a great many others armed, and they armed in order to be aiding and assisting in running uncustomed goods, and goods lable to pay duty, that have not been paid or secured,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174712090026"/> it is the same, gentlemen of the Jury, as you have heard before; therefore I would save you the trouble of speaking to the nature of this notorious offence, but shall proceed to speak of the particular offence.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner at the bar is indicted upon a statute which hath made the offence more penal, because he is indicted on an act of Parliament made in the 19th year of his present Majesty's reign; by that act, if any persons, to the number of three, with arm'd force, be concerned in running and landing uncustom'd goods, they are guilty of a capital offence. The only question will be, whether this person is guilty of that offence? As to that, the case stands thus: In the beginning of August, 1746, the Prisoner with about twenty or thirty others, all of them arm'd with fire-arms, blunderbusses, and other offensive weapons came to a place call'd Lid, in Kent, to an Inn known by the name of the George-Inn, they came on horses, and drove horses with tea in oil-skin bags, and brandy in half anchors : and in this manner they came about the beginning of August to Lid in Kent. They came from a place call'd Lidlight, near the coast, into the country with those goods. These men were the greatest part of them arm'd, and with goods flung upon their horses. And, Gentlemen, you will find it prov'd by the witnesses, that the Prisoner now at the bar, this Austin, was one of them; that he was aiding and assisting, that he was arm'd, carrying goods in oil-skin bags, and liquor in those casks towards London. We have another witness that saw them a mile distant from the George-Inn, and will prove the Prisoner to be one of them; but I imagine before I mention it you will easily believe your selves, that neither of the witnesses had courage to stop the gang, nor dare desire to see what they had there; therefore 'tis impossible for them to say they opened the oil-skin bags or half anchors. If the Prisoner can give evidence, and show what was in those oil-skin bags and half anchors, and that it had paid duties, this would be a defence; then you will consider it as the general method for stowing tea and brandy. You know the law in that case, that brandy can't be imported under a sixty gallon cask; tea cannot be imported into any place in England but London. They import it in large chests lined with lead; but smugglers that bring it from Flushing and Boulogne, from the opposite shore, the general account, you have had it already prov'd by several witnesses, that there is not, nor never was any package in these bags but tea. The witnesses will tell you, upon seeing them, they verily believe it was tea and brandy. If they can make a defence, and prove that it had paid duty, that would be a defence.</p>
               <p>Another circumstance ought to be taken into consideration, which is, the behaviour of the Prisoner, to shew how far from hence guilt is to be infer'd; 'tis always look'd upon as a material circumstance, that if a man attempts to escape, if he uses extraordinary measures for that purpose it is no argument of his innocence; and as he might expect to be try'd in two or three days by his country, if innocent, he could be under no apprehension of a long confinement, why then should a person make so desperate an attempt to escape as he did on Wednesday morning ? It was not the bare apprehension of lying long in prison, that this person (with some others) attempted to cut off his irons in an extraordinary way, but the hopes of a great gang in the heart of the city of London being ready to carry him off. This shews that what the dreaded was a trial.</p>

            ?</p>
               <p>Wills. Yes, Sir, I wish I never had; I have known him four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him since July 1746 in company with smugglers, running and carrying off uncustom'd goods?</p>
               <p>Wills. I saw him particularly, to the best of my knowledge, in the year 1746.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174712090027"/>Q. Can you recollect the day?</p>
               <p>Wills. All I have to say of the day, I think it was the 5th of August, that day I was carrying a pair of shoes home to the George-Inn, about eight o'clock in the morning, for the landlord's daughter, and I saw him, Fuller, and several more at that time; and I believe there were threescore horses with him: when I had intelligence they were there, and saw them, I did not go, having been abus'd several times by the same man; so I went into another house, where I stay'd a little time; then I went home with the shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner was there?</p>
               <p>Wills. Yes he was; and there were forty men and sixty horses, and the Prisoner had a carbine flung over his shoulder; but I cannot say whether he had pistols or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in general arm'd?</p>
               <p>Wills. I believe there were twenty arm'd on horseback: as to the Prisoner, he had a little matter of tea upon his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Were their horses loaded ?</p>
               <p>Wills. They were loaded with oil-skin bags and tubs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they seem to you to be full?</p>
               <p>Wills. They were full of something.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what size?</p>
               <p>Wills. Four gallons a-piece by my computation; then they all march'd away from the George towards Old-Rumney road, and the Prisoner was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the way from the coast?</p>
               <p>Wills. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Council. Wills, you was here the last sessions, was you not? what time now was it you saw the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wills. It was between the hours of six and nine.</p>
               <p>Council. Think once more?</p>
               <p>Wills. No, I won't think any more, it was so.</p>
               <p>Council. How long have you been acquainted with the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wills. I have been acquainted with him too much for my profit; he has done a great deal of damage to myself and my family; and had it not been for him, I believe I never had been a soldier.</p>
               <p>Council. I know you are angry?</p>
               <p>Wills. I am not angry, I wish the man had more wit; he sent me word from Wardon fair the 20th of September, that he would kill me upon the spot.</p>
               <p>Q. What arms had he?</p>
               <p>Wills. A carbine flung upon his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Council. You did not know what was in those bags ?</p>
               <p>Wills. No, how the D - I should I; as for seeing the bags, or that person, I did not venture to see him for fear he should know me; for he once shot me through the arm and has abused me several times.</p>
               <p>Sol. General. When you saw him ride towards Old-Rumney, did you appear publickly?</p>
               <p>Wills. No, I retreated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask the soldier one question, whether ever he saw me with fire-arms; or whether I ever shot him?</p>
               <p>Wills. I have seen him with fire-arms ten times, and can bring many other persons to prove it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever shoot at you?</p>
               <p>Wills. Yes, he did, over-against one Mr. Plumber's shop a grocer.</p>

            . I have seen the man more than twenty times in company with the Hawkhurst gang, and with oil-skin bags and half anchors. On or about the 5th day of August, 1746, I saw him within a mile of the town with several other persons, to the number of twenty, arm'd at that time with a carbine over his shoulder, and those in his company arm'd after the same manner, and about fifty horses. Austin did not ride with goods at that time, but I know he had drove horses, being within thirty yards of him: he had threaten'd my life before that, so I could not appear in view of him.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174712090028"/> There might be fifty drove horses, they were loaded with half anchors and oil-skin bags, which hold about a quarter of a hundred of tea. I have had tea from the Prisoner out of these bags, I had a bag of that tea, and 1 l. 8 s. in exchange for a horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he about a mile from Lid?</p>
               <p>Weyman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in that country?</p>
               <p>Weyman. About ten years; and I am sure the Prisoner was one of them at that very time.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had ask'd him what was in the bags?</p>
               <p>Weyman. To be be sure he would not have told me.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Council. Had he any goods with him at that time?</p>
               <p>Weyman. That I can't say, for I did not dare to see him, because he threaten'd my Life.</p>
               <p>Council. How came you to be afraid of him?</p>
               <p>Weyman. He had a notion that I betray'd the boat where they work'd their tea, which was taken by the officers; tho' I sent to them to let them know that I was not the person that sent to the officers to discover the boat.</p>
               <p>Council. May not English brandy be carried in that manner ?</p>
               <p>Weyman. Yes they may.</p>
               <p>Sol. General. Do you know what gang this was?</p>
               <p>Weyman. The Hawkhurst gang.</p>
               <p>Court. You have said you have had dealings with the Prisoner about exchanging a horse, and you had tea from him out of the oil-skin bags : I ask you whether you knew at that time that he dealt in such a way?</p>
               <p>Weyman. I am very sure he did, because he had four or five horses loaded of his own.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Now is your time to make your defence ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have not a great deal to say for myself; I am as ignorant of the thing that is laid to my charge, as a child that is unborn: and I never saw the men.</p>
               <p>Court. But you hear what they say, that they saw you?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can only say that I know nothing of the affair.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, Sir, they are to prove where I was at the same time.</p>

               <p>Q. What occasion had you to see the Prisoner in bed that morning?</p>
               <p>Cook. I went in to return him thanks for the use of the horse, which I did not do over night; and this was at six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Council. So you went into the chamber where the man and his wife were, to return him thanks for the horse.</p>
               <p>Cook. Yes, and then they would have me to stay and breakfast with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who breakfasted with you?</p>

               <p>Solicitor General. Can you answer why you told this gross untruth but just now?</p>
               <p>Attorney General. I ask you that question, why did you tell that untruth, that you was no relation?</p>
               <p>Court. Why did you conceal that fact with relation to the Prisoner at the bar, and swear a fact directly contrary?</p>
               <p>Cook. I was afraid it would not go so well with him else.</p>
               <p>Solicitor General. Who was the person you conversed with, before you came into Court?</p>

               <p>Cook. At the Old-bailey coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you besides these persons?</p>
               <p>Cook. I did not know them, there were a great many people.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any people concerned in this cause?</p>
               <p>Cook. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Attorney General. Now give me an account what was your conversation about this cause; recollect, don't repent of your crimes by telling falshoods.</p>
               <p>Cook. I had conversation with his wife.</p>
               <p>Attorney General. What did she desire you to say?</p>
               <p>Cook. She asked me whether I did not remember it, and I said I did.</p>
               <p>Attorney General. Did she desire you should not own you was any relation to her ?</p>
               <p>Cook. She did not tell me so.</p>
               <p>Attorney General. Now recollect, was this your own invention to tell such notorious untruths to the Court? was it your own inventions or somebody's else? how came you to say you did not know whether he was a farmer, nor what horses he kept, nor what house he lived in? how comes it to pass you have been guilty of such gross perjury as this in open Court ? I will ask you again this one question, and it is the only way you can make satisfaction; who is it that hath set you upon coming hither to give this account of things?</p>
               <p>To all these interrogatories the Prisoner kept himself very close, and would not acknowledge any thing of his being put upon this dreadful practice by any; upon which he was deservedly committed to Newgate for wicked and corrupt perjury.</p>

             for her evidence, so that the cause is now supported by new persons; but if they come under suspicious circumstances it will greatly increase that suspicion. The first witness examined is a youth, and I am very sorry to find that one so early is so steady, he comes at the age of eighteen, goes through it correctly, sticks to his story, and swears to circumstances to give credit to it. For instance, it must be proved that he was at home in the morning, therefore it was necessary to fix that instant of time; he says he went up to him in his bed at six o'clock in the morning, because he omitted over night to thank him for lending him his horse; going up to thank him he invited him to stay breakfast, he stays breakfast 'till eight. He knows little of the Prisoner. Is he a farmer? hardly knows that. Do you know what horses he keeps ? No And whenever he speaks of his mother, 'tis the Prisoner's wife; and at last it providentially came out, that he was actually the son of his wife; after he had been giving an account of the Prisoner's wife, I interrupted him by asking him the question, what relation he was to the Prisoner's wife? he had some presence of mind, but not all, he thought it would certainly hurt the whole evidence if he acknowledged the relation; that presence of mind he had; but he did not go further, and considered that there might be a possibility of people's knowing him; at first indeed he absolutely denies it; upon which I began to think it might be a mistake as to the degrees of relation: upon his denying that he was a relation, had we not pretty strong assurance of it, we might have gone no further; but when the whole of the family is inquir'd into, the children's names and age, at last he own'd that he was her son; this brings an imputation upon the whole, that the other is dress'd up too; certainly you cannot believe any thing from the credit of that man's evidence.

Hayward swears that he (the Prisoner) was with them at ten o'clock several times. Turner swears that he went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174712090036"/> by her door, about eleven o'clock that day: But here is a witness that comes to swear to an hour and particular, a year and a half ago; she is never called upon to recollect any thing of that time, till about five weeks ago. Gentlemen, it is a most melancholy consideration, when all justice depends upon the truth of what witnesses say, when neither you nor Judges can do right, but what comes out of the mouths of witnesses; all our lives and fortunes depend upon their veracity; therefore, 'tis a melancholy consideration, for people to dress up stories of this kind. There is another circumstance exceeding material, between the boy and the woman; the boy comes home with the Prisoner, and another person, a man without a name; she was there before they came in, and there was no body with them.</p>

             very plain; I am as sure I saw him then, as I see him now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner do any thing?</p>
               <p>Figgins. He bore upon me with his elbows against my breast, and kept my arms up, as if I were pinioned; and in less than half a minute I felt my watch go from my pocket, as plain as ever I felt my glove go from my hand: Then they all began to withdraw from me; and I caught hold of him by the collar, and said, you have robbed me, you have stolen my watch! he said he had not, and was an innocent man. He being a stout fellow, broke from me, and endeavoured to conceal himself among the mob in Lombard-street; but a gentleman here assisting me, we took him again. He said, here Sir, you may see I have not your watch, I am an innocent man, when, in my conscience, he had the watch in his left hand at first: We were carrying him to the tavern, when he broke away again; and here is a gentleman that run after him, and overtook him, or he had got clear off.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the gentleman's name?</p>
               <p>Figgins. William Paterson; when we got him again, he trembled prodigiously, and said, don't use me ill: We carried him into the tavern, and I searched him; we found a gold watch upon him, but it was not mine; then he said, you are now satisfied; no, I said, I am not satisfied, I am sure you assisted in robbing me; nor will I be satisfied, till I know what manner of man you are.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Paterson that assisted you present at first?</p>
               <p>Figgins. He said he was just by me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Council. How many were there when they came about you first?</p>
               <p>Figgins. There were to the number of five or six.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sensible of the watch going from you, are you sure that was the man that took it?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174712090037"/>Figgins. I am sure he was the man that took it, or that held me while it was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. to Council. I think you describe that he was close up to your elbow.</p>
               <p>Figgins. I am sure he robbed me himself, or assisted in robbing me; for I was in such a position that I could not stir.</p>

            . Do you know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Paterson. Yes, Sir - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of the affair?</p>
               <p>Paterson. On Friday the 30th of Oct. last, about seven o'clock in the evening, I went to Lombard-street to see the lights at the Post-office; I was standing just by Exchange-alley, and I saw the Prosecutor, Mr. Figgins, pass by me. He had hardly got three steps up the gate-way, but I heard a number of persons hussling, seemingly in confusion. I turned about, and saw five or six; I saw a white wig, but could not discern the gentleman's coat, but as for the Prisoner, I am positive he is one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they doing?</p>
               <p>Paterson. They were hussling the gentleman in the light wig, and I am sure the Prisoner was one of the persons that was hussling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing?</p>
               <p>Paterson. I did not hear one word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Figgins say any thing?</p>
               <p>Paterson. He came out in a prodigious surprize - I am robbed, I have lost my watch. The Prisoner came from the gateway and run three or four yards towards the mob. As soon as he got there, he immediately raised his right arm, at which time I thought I saw a blue string.</p>
               <p>Q. to Figgins. What was your watch made of?</p>
               <p>Figgins. Of gold, a polished steel chain, and a gold cornelian seal.</p>
               <p>Paterson. He raised his arms, and I thought I saw something blue in his hand; I thought it to be a blue string, which I spoke before my Lord the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body by to take any thing ?</p>
               <p>Paterson. I kept my eye so much on the Prisoner, I did not see what Mr. Figgins did - As Mr. Figgins cried stop thief, he ran away and dodged me across the way - I caught hold of him at Mr. Brace's door, and by his company interposing, he broke my hold. - Then there was a hussling of their hands again, that I could not get at him - Then Mr. Figgins came and caught hold of him - Then he lifted up his hands and said, Sir, I have none of your watch. - Then he immediately run through Change-alley, breaking loose from Mr. Figgins. There were two men lay'd hold of my shoulder, I pushed them away and ran after him - I did not close with him in the alley, he being such a lusty man; but when he got into Cornhill I got up close with him, and got hold of him the corner of Pope's-head-alley. When I laid hold of him, he said in great confusion, you are mistaken, I am not the man. - I said, I could not hold you before, but I have got hold of you now, and will keep you. He desired we would not use him ill, and we carried him into the Pope's-head tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then ?</p>
               <p>Paterson. He was examined, and there was a gold watch found upon him; but it was not Mr. Figgins's watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am sorry they should know so much more of this affair now, than they did before my Lord-Mayor. He said before my Lord-Mayor, it was a blue watch-string.</p>
               <p>Court. He thought it was such a thing in the night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I was going home, I was stopped in the street, as Mr. Figgins was, when they cried out, a barber, a barber; I ran out of the crowd, and they ran after me and cried, a robber, but I knew nothing of it.</p>

So I came to the Pope's-head tavern, and this gentleman, the Prosecutor said, at the time they searched him, that they could find nothing upon him. - He said, he believed he had not his watch, and if he had any body to his character, he said he would discharge him - That is all I know - His master came directly, and I believe, had it not been for his master, the gentleman would have discharged him.</p>

She applied at the time of Lord Lovat's being beheaded for the key of my room, for a relation of hers to lie there. It was in the month of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she deliver to you the key again?</p>
               <p>Clapp. I ask'd her for it, but could not get it 'till four or five weeks after, when I came to examine the room, for I never laid in it in my life. I live in Virginia-street. When I went into my own room, there I miss'd a napkin and a pillow-case; there was a blanket, a pair of tongs, one pillow-bear, and a napkin upon the table; all these things I miss'd. The Prisoner was not gone away, I thought I should see her the same day, but I could not, so I put a padlock upon the door, in order to prevent her taking more things. The day that I miss'd the goods, and that I searched, was the 5th of June; on the 6th of June I told her she had robb'd me. I had information some few days after, that there were some of the goods at one Elizabeth Sibly's in East Smith-field. I saw her several times after: she said that the glass was broke in sweeping the room. I went to enquire of several people I knew to be her correspondents, to endeavour to find the things. I had information first by my son of some of the things at

               <p>Q. Was there not something of an action against you for taking of her goods?</p>
               <p>Clapp. There was an action of Trover brought against me for locking the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the action brought against you.</p>
               <p>Clapp. The fifteenth of June.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor appear'd but in a bad light to the Court; his keeping a gaming-table; his conduct in seizing the Prisoner's goods to occasion an arrest on himself, and his doing this so long after the time that the fact is charged. The Prisoner reported to the Court the behaviour of the prosecutor to her, that when he met her in the street how he would call her a thieving B - h, and such language as this. The Court reply'd to her that she might prosecute him if he offered to insult her again.</p>
