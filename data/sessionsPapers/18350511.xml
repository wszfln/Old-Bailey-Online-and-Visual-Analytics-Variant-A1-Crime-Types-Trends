                  </hi>. I am parish-clerk of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. In consequence of information, on Thursday morning, the 2nd of April, I went to the church about nine o'clock—(Mrs. Browning is a pew-opener, and is employed as a char-woman to clean the church)—I entered the church by the chancel-door—I was in the burial ground at the time an alarm was given—I think it was Mrs. Carroll gave the alarm—I found the chancel-door open—I went into the minister's vestry, and found the drawers broken open, and the closet where the minister's robes are kept, likewise broken open—the surplices were strewed about the floor—I missed three keys from the drawers, two of them belonging to the registry, and the other was a key of one of the other drawers—I went from there into the churchwarden's-room, which is on the other side of the communion-table—I observed the cupboard in which the maces were kept had been broken open—they had silver heads—there were four of them—the sticks of them lay on the ground, the heads were gone—the cupboard where the sacramental wine is kept was broken open, and part of a bottle of sacra<lb/>mental wine was left on the mantle-shelf—there is a plate-chest in the churchwarden's room—the padlock was forced off that, and the chest had apparently been attempted to be forced open, but they had not succeeded in opening it—there had been an attempt made at the crevice of the lid to open it—there if a smaller iron chest fixed in the wall in that room, and an attempt had been made to open that—I believe it is used to keep papers in—I found a piece of iron lying on the ground of the church<lb/>warden's room, which appeared to be broken off a crow-bar—it was two or three inches from the plate chest—I sent for the churchwardens and sexton—I delivered the piece of iron to Mr. Chappie the churchwarden—I went outside the church while I had sent for the churchwardens, and observed one of the fire-ladders placed against one of the windows, which is very similar to the windows of this Court, with a ventilator, but it has no flap at the top; it shuts out instead of having a flap—I have no doubt a person of the prisoner's size could effect an entrance into the church through that trap by means of a ladder—I asked Mrs. Carroll to try it, and she got her head and shoulders through it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you since seen any of the keys that were lost that evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I have seen all three, but I can swear to two of them which belong to the registry—I saw them in the possession of Bedford the Inspector—I have seen several keys in his possession—one of the church-yard and the burial ground-gate, as I believe—I have since seen a portion of iron in Bedford's possession, which has been applied to the plate-chest—it formed a crow-bar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the chancel-door is secure, can the church be opened from without? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it must be opened from within.</p>

               <p>they carry the head and staff together—the head and staff together form the mace, I apprehend—the stick part was found in the church—I believe the heads were invariably locked up in the churchwarden's room, but I cannot be certain of that—I have seen them frequently locked up—a person of the prisoner's size could get through the space left by the open<lb/>ing in the window—Mrs. Carroll is not very corpulent—she did not stick at all in attempting to get through; she only did it to show me she could get through if disposed—the top of the pew under the window is three or four feet from the top of the window—the back of the window seat is not more than four feet from the opening, I should think—it is a lower win<lb/>dow—not in the gallery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could a party get down without treading on the window and breaking it as he came through the glass? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is an iron frame—I think the party might get out the same way they got in, but they could get out much more easily at the chancel-door—the iron I found by the plate-chest appeared to be a portion of a crow-bar—I do not remember whether any body else was present when Mrs. Carroll got through—she went up the ladder and put herself through—I believe there had been a meeting of the trustees at the church the night before.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you get your living? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a very unfair question to answer—ten o'clock was the first time I saw the prisoner on Monday morning—I had not seen him in the house before ten o'clock—I have stated all the conversation that passed at the outer bar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was nothing said about Mrs. Browning's intention to report him at the barracks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was before he came into the house—she intended to do so—she said nothing to him about it in my hearing—I had seen him the night before—there was no beer drank after elven o'clock that night—I saw nothing drank by the prisoner after eleven—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183505110031"/>
               <p>I was sitting in the side-room that night—I was backwards and forwards because he was abusing everybody about—there was no beer drank after eleven o'clock—if it had been drank I must have seen it—I do not mean to say I was there exactly every moment, for I was up and down stairs to Mrs. Browning, as she got out of his way—the bar was locked up then—I did not hear the prisoner say he would rather destroy himself than that she should report him at the barracks—nor that he should not be the first man who had destroyed himself for her sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What space of time intervened between their going into the inner room and you hearing her say, "Don't begin to ill-use me?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was before I turned into, the side-room, about two minutes after the door was shut—I was just turning from the bar—I was quite near enough to hear any con<lb/>versation that passed—I heard no word pass till I heard the scream—when I saw the prisoner at three o'clock in the morning before, he had been prinking, but was not drunk, he was rather wild and frantic—he was very troublesome, and was taken into custody by the watchman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the Sunday afternoon had he been at the public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and all the evening, he was very much there; I think he was nearly always there, except when on duty—Mrs. Browning had had com<lb/>pany on Sunday night—a gentleman came to see her and staid to tea—the mother was there also—they drank tea in the inner bar—the prisoner was in the parlour, not in the inner bar—I heard him say he would pay her for not inviting him to tea—they quarrelled very much after the tea party was over, both of them, and she went up stairs after locking up the liquor—there was no bar-maid—she and her mother served in the bar—I heard the prisoner call her names while she was up stairs, and said he would do for her—he staid there till near three o'clock in the morning—a watchman had come there about eleven o'clock, but he got quiet, and Mrs. Browning wished he might be left alone, and begged the watchman not to take him—after the watchman was gone he began his usual fury—he was taken away at three o'clock by the constable—Mrs. Browning had sent William Owens, a lodger, for the constable, who came and took him—the prisoner was in his usual fury when he said he would do for her—Oweas was present when he used these expressions.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the deceased, Elisabeth Browning—she was a widow—I was at the house on Sunday, the 26th of April—I lived there—I know the prisoner—he used to come to the house occasion<lb/>ally, not a great deal—my daughter had somebody to tea with her on Sun<lb/>day, and I was one of the party—the prisoner was at the house—he was not asked to join the party—I do not know that that occasioned any quarrel between him and my daughter—I did not see him at the time—I might sit up that night till about twelve o'clock—the bar was locked up at about eleven o'clock—I do not know of any disturbance in the house after that—on Monday morning, about eleven o'clock, I was sitting in the inner bar—my daughter was with me—the prisoner came into the house—my daughter was in the inner bar—she did not go out—she had not an opportunity—I did not hear any one ask for any liquor—the room</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183505110032"/>
               <p>door was not shut—the prisoner came into the inner bar where my daughter was, and struck my daughter three times on the side of the head with his fist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before he struck her did any words pass between them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She ordered him out of the bar—I did not hear her say any thing before he struck her—I do not remember her calling him a brute—she was standing on her feet when he struck her with his fist—and she fell down across the chair from the effect of the blow—she said nothing after she was struck with the fist—she lost her senses entirely—the prisoner then retreated back from her, drew his bayonet which hung at his side, and then ran it through her—he ran her through more than once or twice—I am certain he gave her two wounds—I attempted to interfere all I could, and got wounded in my thumb with the bayonet—my daughter was picked up dead directly—she did not live five minutes I am sure, from the time she received the first blow with the fist, down to the time she was picked up dead—she did not speak at all—I screamed out, and Blake and Owens came in—I gave the bayonet to Chittenden.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before the prisoner struck your daughter had she attempted to raise her hand to him, or do any thing to him in the way of provocation, except desiring him to quit the bar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had you been sitting in the inner bar before the prisoner came in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say exactly, not long—we had breakfasted in that room, we always breakfast in the inner bar, we had break<lb/>fast that morning between eight and nine o'clock—I might have been out into the outer bar, but not further, from the time we had breakfast till the pri<lb/>soner came in—the inner bar-door was open—I did not hear him ask her for a pint of beer, nor hear her say she would not speak to such a brute as him, but it might have occurred—the outer bar is not very large—they are both small rooms, but long—I did not hear him ask my daughter for a pint of beer; if he did, I might or might not hear it—I do not know how Blake gets her living—I believe she is a woman of the town—she did not bring men to my daughter's house—I did not see him push my daughter from the outer bar into the inner bar—he might have done it, and me not see it—I was not constantly in the bar—I did not go further than to the outer bar—I did not see him push her in—it might have happened while I was in the other bar—the bar opens at one end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the prisoner drank tea with your daughter on previous occa<lb/>sions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know but what he might—he had not been intimate at the house more than any one else—the Magistrates have, ordered the houses to be shut at eleven o'clock—the bar was closed at eleven o'clock on Sunday night, and unclosed again because the prisoner came in, and the watchman took him out—we opened the bar to give the watchman refresh<lb/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any general drawing for customers, or only to give refreshment to the watchman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was all—there was no liquor given to any body but the watchman after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At what time did you go to bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About twelve o'clock—the prisoner struck my daughter directly he came into the inner bar—he stabbed her as soon as he could get his bayonet out of the sheath—the night before, when the man took him away, my daughter told him she would report him to the commanding-officer for what he Had done—she did not say it in the morning—I screamed out directly he used his violence—he did not ask her in the room not to report him to his com<lb/>manding-officer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183505110033"/>
               <p>—not in my hearing, I will swear—I will swear he did not say he would rather she should run him through than report him to his commanding-officer—he did not say so, or I must have heard him then, because I was close to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she not, in the room, at that time, say several times, she would report him to the commanding-officer, before he struck her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She did not, I will swear—Owens was in the lower part of the room—he came in through the outer bar—they came in to my assistance when I screamed out—there was nobody in the inner bar before, I screamed out directly—he Struck her with his fist three times directly he came in, and then she fell down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is true that it was ten minutes from the time he came in till you screamed out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was dead in ten minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not appear in a great passion when all this took place in the inner bar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear whether he did or not—I did not hear him pretend that he was in a passion—I do not think he was tipsy.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly in the marines, and am now a pen<lb/>sioner. I have resided at the Britannia upwards of nineteen months—on Sunday, the 26th of April, I saw the prisoner there almost all the evening—he was not to say sober towards the latter part of the evening—he was very abusive to the deceased—I went to the barracks to get assist-ance to remove him—I afterwards brought a watchman to the house—that was about eleven o'clock—the deceased wished the prisoner to be taken out of the house, but he was not taken—he remained in the house using abuse till three o'clock in the morning—he was then removed by two watchmen—on Monday morning he came in about ten o'clock or a quarter after—he was sober then as a roan need be—I saw him in the serving bar—the deceased and him were both in the bar together—he wanted to speak to her, and she told him to go about his business—she said she should not speak to him—I did not hear him say any thing to her then, for I left and went into the side room—I heard a scream, in five or ten minutes, and ran out of the side room into the inner bar, and saw the prisoner using his bayonet on the deceased as fast he could stick her—he was stabbing her—the deceased was then sit<lb/>ting down—I immediately ran out to get assistance from the parlour where there were two sergeants, but they went away—when I came back I saw Mrs. Browning and her mother and the prisoner in the inner room—he was using the bayonet when I returned, and on my going in he tried to stab me—I had not been absent for a second—I kept him off as well as I could till I got behind him, and held his two arms—the bayonet was then in his hand, and the deceased's mother drew it out of his hand—he was taken out—I turned round and saw the deceased lying down bleeding at the mouth—I picked her up in my arms, and she died, I dare say in five minutes—on the previous evening I had seen the prisoner go up stairs—he took the poker in his hand, and ran up stairs—I did not hear him say any thing.</p>

On the 27th of April, in consequence of information, I went to the Bri<lb/>tannia public-house, and saw several marines in the passage—it was about a quarter after eleven o'clock—I asked the corporal which was the person who stabbed Mrs. Browning—the prisoner was present, and was pointed out as the person—he said, "Yes, I am the man that stabbed Mrs. Browning"—I said, "You are my prisoner"—I took him into custody—on going from the house under the bar window he said, "it is a bad job but I have done it, and I know my doom"—I took him to the station-house, and returned to the house directly—I saw the deceased in a chamber on the first floor—she was then dead and undressed—I saw five wounds on her bosom—I produce a bayonet which I received from Mrs. Tomkins—it is exactly in the same state as I received it—there was a quantity of blood on it—it still has the marks—I looked at the prisoner's hand—there was blood on his right hand, and likewise on the left cheek.</p>

On the 27th of April, in consequence of information, I went to the Britannia public-house, and saw the body of the deceased being brought out of the bar—I followed it up stairs and directed it to be laid on the sofa—she was then dead—there were five wounds about her breast, a wound over her right breast, two flesh wounds, apparently inflicted by one thrust—they were not dangerous—I examined and probed the other wounds—there was another wound underneath the right breast, which passed obliqely down and transfixed the liver—that was a triangular shape, corresponding with the figure of this bayonet; this was a mortal wound—there was another wound on the left side, which had passed through the right and left side of the chest—that was also a mortal wound, and appeared to have been done by the same instrument—there was a slight puncture on the left arm—the bayonet appeared to have slipped off the arm, and entered the side below the arm-pit and passed into the lungs—this was also a mortal wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Wood-street, and am a warehouseman. On the afternoon of the 22nd of April, I was at the door of my house, opposite Mr. Roberts's—I saw the male prisoner, who was in his service, come down the warehouse stairs into the street, and cross the street with two parcels of ribbon under his arm—I suspected him, and followed him into Bull's Head-passage, about twelve yards from the door—at the top of that court is a bend which comes into St. Alban's-court; in that bend I saw him give the goods to the female prisoner, who put them under her shawl, and instantly said, "I shall see you to-night"—he said "Yes;" and away he went—I followed her through Falcon-square, down Hart-street, to London-wall—she then ran—I believe she saw me, as she turned round—I followed, and took her in Milton-street, with the goods on her—I put her into a baker's shop, and sent the baker for a constable, who took her into custody—the place where Wiles gave her the goods was not in sight of the warehouse at all—she could not see it where she was—I had not seen her before.</p>

               <p>not one belonging to me—I said, I had reason to suspect they were numerous—he begged me to give him time to make up his accounts—he said it was not like my usual plan to be so hard upon him, and would I give him time to make up his accounts—I said I would give him time—nothing else pas<lb/>sed—I pursued my inquiries and made a great many fresh discoveries—I discoverd Park's and Miller's amounts afterwards, which I was not aware of at the time of the conversation—in consequence of that, I had him taken into custody on the Saturday, and he delivered me an account that day—this is it—he debits himself with these amounts in that account.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and lire in Whitecombe-street, St. Martin-in-the-fields. The prisoner came to my shop on the 10th of April, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, and said he wanted a pair of trowsers; that he had got a pair on that he had bought of me, which he approved of, and that was the cause of his coming for another pair—I showed him a pile of waistcoats and trowsers—he pulled down three waist-coats and a pair of trowsers—there was a man at the door in the passage—that man opened the shop door, and the prisoner went off with a pair of trowsers and three waistcoats—he walked out—I called out "Stop thief," and he was shortly secured—I have seen the property at the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Sweet Apple-court. On the 20th of April, I came up the court, and on looking up to the prosecutor's house, I saw two persons climbing up the tiles of the roof—I gave Mr. Castle information—he went and got two officers—I placed myself against the door, and when the officer came down, I went out of Mr. Castle's window, and came down the house to the first floor—I found the prisoners, Nixon and Duncombe, behind the door, it was then very near eight o'clock—Charles Duncombe pointed forward to another room, and Brown was found in there—I went out on the roof and found the lead of two roofs had been taken away, and was in the prosecutor's passage ready to be carried away.</p>

Great, however, as is my love to your daughter, I would rather have perished than married to satisfy a sordid and selfish desire; but, being fully aware I could provide a comfortable home for her, and feeing I could not live happy without her, and knowing, too, that my love was re-turned, I did not hesitate to propose an immediate union, without asking your consent. I hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing you and Mrs. Thorburn on Sunday, and then I hope to explain all to your satisfaction. I cannot say more, as my time is limited to ten minutes, for I expect to be called every moment; and must conclude, with kind respects to all, and believe me, yours to command, S.

Bass and Ratcliff, ale brewers, at Burton—on-Trent, and I knew Rowley had been in Mr. Holt's employ—the whole twenty-eight casks were the property of Messrs. Bass and Ratcliff—they were to be shipped to go back to Burton—on-Trent—I placed the ten casks which they brought in the evening, by the side of the eighteen, but kept them separate, though Gwillim wished me to mix them—after the casks were out of the cart, the number was taken down, and I went with Gwillim to Mr. Kemp to get his book signed, and left Rowley with the cart—Mr. Kemp signed the book, with the number of the casks—when I came back, the two prisoners were in the cart, going away with it, and were standing before a cask, which was then in the cart—there had been no cask left in the cart, when the ten were delivered—I missed a cask from the yard, and went after them; and when they had got about a hundred yards, I stopped them, and asked what they were going to do with that cask—Gwilliam said, "God bless me, how came it here?"—I said, "One of you must have put it in, and if you do not roll it back again, it will be the worse for you"—I gave information to Mr. Tibbett, and Rowley was taken—he rolled the cask back, and Gwillim went off with the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 26, Man-chester-square, in the parish of St. Marylebone—I keep the house—the prisoners were in my service, one as butler and the other as lady's maid—the ladies' maid had been with me seventeen yean, and the butler two years—in March last my son was on a visit at my house sleeping there—the prisoner Handcox slept in the same room as me—there is a dressing room immediately adjoining the room in which I slept; it communicates with my bed-room, and there is another door to the dressing-room which opens on the landing-place—on Saturday, the 28th of March last, I had in my house the articles named in the indictment—they were altogether of the value of about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were kept in a jewel-box in a drawer in a chest of drawers in the dressing-room—the jewel-box was a deal box covered with paper, resembling morocco-leather—it had a lock and an old fashioned white plated handle—the drawer was locked—I usually kept the keys of the jewel-box and drawer in my pocket—Handcox always had to put away those jewels when I used them—I thought her so very trust<lb/>worthy, and trusted her very often with the keys to open the box, and get them out and to put them away—I had dined out on Friday, the day before, and she got out my rings which I wore that day, and she also put them away—I went out in the carriage on Saturday, about two o'clock, and returned about five or half-past—I did not use any of the jewels in the box on that day—I went to bed that night between eleven and twelve o'clock, I believe—Handcox slept in my room that night—when I undress, my pocket was generally left in the dressing-room on a chair, and was so that nigbt, I be<lb/>lieve—it contained the keys of the jewel-box and drawer—I was disturbed between three and four o'clock in the morning—Handcox came and stood over me and said, "Madam! Madam! do not be frightened, there is somebody in the house; I am sure there is, because I heard something fall in the dress<lb/>ing room, and a scuffling noise"—I started up in my bed very much frightened and said, "For God's sake what shall we do I what shall we do!" and after a few minutes' consideration, I went into my son's room on the same floor, and alarmed him and his wife—he got up immediately, took up the poker and went over the house to search; and his wifo put her head out of window and called to the police—Handcox told me almost immediately after, that she was excessively glad she had locked the dressing-room door that night, if she had not, she should never have forgiven herself—in con<lb/>sequence of what appeared on an examination afterwards, I discharged the two prisoners on the Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's son. I was on a visit at my mother's, with my wife, sleeping at her house—on Sunday-morning, the 29th of March, I was awoke at three o'clock in the morning by Han<lb/>cock and my mother coming into my room, which is on the same floor as the dressing-room—there are three room doors opening on the same landing-place; it is on the second floor—I got up, and went down stairs with the poker, and on my way down stairs, I found a window on the same landing-place open—that window is below the drawing-room floor, and there was a shawl hanging out of it—that window looks out behind the house—it does not communicate with any place—it does not open into a yard; it goes down ten or twelve feet on a skylight, which is underneath it—the house is on the east side of the square—I laid hold of the shawl, and put my body out of the window to see if any body was there—it happened to be a still night, and every thing was perfectly still—on my way down, I pulled the bell on the landing-place, to awake those who were below—the men-servants slept below—I then ran down stairs, and down the kitchen-stairs along the passage—I saw Hall coming out of the pantry, or out of the room where he sleeps—he was in his shirt—the police were then knocking at the door—I went up with Hall to the door, and when I got to the hall they were let in—I took them up stairs to the different rooms—the female prisoner was present—the dressing-room door was pointed out to them by Handcox—she said something about "destruction" or "confusion"—she said, "See what is done; the door is open"—I looked at it; it appeared to have been cut down with a knife or chisel, or something of that sort—Handcox pointed out the circumstance, and said, "Look here! look here!"—we went into the dressing-room—I saw the chest of drawen—the drawer was open where the jewel-box had been kept, and there was a little chipping as if somebody had attempted to push the lock down—there was a small cabinet at the top, which opened like a door—I think there was a mark on that, but none of the drawers appeared to have any marks, except the one which the diamonds had been in—that drawer was open when I saw it—I and the policeman inspected the lock of the drawer, and of the door likewise—it was evident to me that it had never been broken open or picked—the two prisoners were turned away on the Sunday morning—I heard nothing more about the matter till the following Sunday—a com<lb/>munication was then made by Sumpter—it was made first to my lady, she sent for me, and Sumpter then made a statement in my presence and my wife's—a piece of metal was afterwards shewn to me, which is here—it was given to me by Mrs. William Collins—it was given to her by the footman, but not in my presence—I know the jewel-box had a handle on the top, and I think the metal was like this.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 81.) On Sunday morning, the 29th of March, I heard a cry of "Police," in Manchester-square—I went to Mrs. Collins's house at a quarter before four o'clock—the prisoner Hall opened the door—the footman was there, and the female prisoner—she said to me directly she saw me, "Oh, policeman, we have robbers in the house; there is such destruction; if you follow me, I will show you what they have done"—I followed her to the back drawing-room on the first floor—she said, "Look, here is destruction"—I saw a number of papers scattered about the carpet, and two small portable desks appeared to have been broken open—two or three parcels of pictures put as if ready for the purpose of being conveyed away—they were just merely packed in lots, one on another—she said, "If you will go with me, I will show you where they have broken open the dressing-room door and drawer"—I followed her up stairs—she showed me the dressing-room door, and said, "See, they have broken this door open"—she also showed me a drawer which she said had been broken open—it was one of a chest of drawers in the dressing-room—she took this chisel off the top of the drawers, and gave it to me, and said, "See, this is what they have done it with"—I did not then examine the door or drawer—I kept the chisel in my hand, and said to her, "There appears to be something very mysterious about this, for this is not an instrument generally used by regular housebreakers"—she said, "Indeed, do you think so?"—I said, "Besides, it is very strange they should have passed three bed-rooms, all of which were occupied, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183505110070"/>
               <p>break open the door of this room; when, had they been strangers, how should they have known but what there was somebody in this room also?"—she said, pointing to one of the rooms, "But they looked into this room; they opened this room, and looked in"—she pointed to the next sleeping-room to Mrs. Collins—I said, "But ean you tell me where they came in at?"—she took me down stairs to the landing of the first flight of stairs—I there saw a window open, and a small piece of a chisel without a handle lying there—it had been broken—I found it on the cill of the window, just as it is—there was the ordinary sash-fastening between the two sashes of the window, but no shutter—that fastening did not appear at all forced—I put my head oat of the window to see the situation of the premises—I saw an immense iron railing, sharply pointed at the top, apparently about seven feet high, on the right-hand side, looking out of the window—the railing occupied the whole of the space on that side—the whole space outside that window is six or eight feet square—the railing forming one side of that square is on the top of a lead flat belonging to the next house, and about the level of the floor I stood on, and the railing above it—opposite to the window is a dead wall, forty or fifty feet high; and on the left-hand side is the window of a water-closet, and the water-closet ran the height of the house, two stories higher—it was the water-closet of the same house—the whole of the space was filled up at the bottom by a glazed sky-light—none of the sky-light was broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person to have left the house by that window, could they have got out of that space without the assistance of a ladder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am sure they could not—I tried it myself—they must have gone over the leads of the adjoining house, and no other way—on looking info the space, I saw this portfolio standing on the lead flat, within about an arm's length, through the rail—a person standing at the window could put it there without going out—I asked Handcox how long it was ago since she heard the noise, before she gave the alarm—she said, not more than five minutes—I said, "I must go and get more assistance, for I suspect they are not off the premises"—I ran down to the front-door, and found the house was surrounded by policemen, so that it was impossible any one could have escaped without their notice—I found, among the others, Inspector Tyrrell, and accompanied him back to the dressing-room, and more particularly examined the marks on the door of the room—Handcox was there the whole of the time—Hall was more particular in attending to the street-door—I particularly noticed, that the side of the door, near the lock, had been chipped down; but we particularly observed, that there was not sufficient chipped off to admit the chisel to force open the lock—it was the post of the door that was chipped; there was a brass plate on the door-post, into which the bolt of the lock shut; the chipping did not make an opening wide enough to admit an instrument to reach the brass plate, so as to open the door; I considered it impossible—the brass plate had no marks or scratches of any kind—my superintendent arrived with a locksmith, and I went on the lead flat—a person must come over an immense high wall, from a mews, to get on the lead flats—the wall is two stories high from the ground—they would have to pass over the roofs of out-houses of three or four-houses, and then they would come to the iron railing, but they must have ladders to go up and down into the different yards—I got over the iron railing by a common pair of steps, seven or eight feet high, but could not do it without such assistance—I went along on my knees, not to make foot-marks—there was a quantity of black dust, as is usual in such places,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183505110071"/>
               <p>but no foot-marks whatever—I had candle with me—the dust was in such a state that it would most assuredly have foot-marks if persons had been there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a dozen persons had been in the area or coal-shed, might they not have escaped? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They could not have got there—while I was up stairs, persons might have got away, but the coal-cellar was locked, and the doors leading to that, and the area, were all locked and bolted—all the servants were called up, three men, including the coachman, and three maids—I saw the butler and footman, but not the coachman—I do not know how many servants there are—nobody but Handcox was present at the search till I got on the landing-place—at the time of the further search, I believe, three female servants were present—it was possible for persons in the house to let somebody out and bolt the doors—I inspected the leads about half an hour after the alarm—I could see no foot-marks for me to suppose any body had escaped—I did not examine them at any other time—it was light when I made the search—it was a quarter before four o'clock when I first heard the alarm, but by the time I got on the leads it had got day-light.</p>

I went to the house, and examined the marks on the dressing-room door very minutely—I took the chisel which was given to me by Mr. Lincoln—I had the door locked inside, and saw the chipping—I tried to put the chisel in between the door cheek, but could not—there was not sufficient cut away—the door itself was not cut at all, not on that side—I then had the door unlocked, and turned the bolt to see if there were any scratches on the bolt of the lock, which any instrument must have made, and there would have been an indenture in the wood, from the pressure of the instrument—but there was no scratch nor mark whatever—I went to the staircase window and confirm the previous evidence—I searched the female prisoner's box, but found nothing included in the indictment—Handcox's mistress having said in her presence, that she had been with her seventeen years, I asked her if she had got any money—she told me she had none—she said she had a sister who had been out of place two years, and she had been supporting her—I searched Hall's box, and asked him if he had any money—he said, he had not a halfpenny in the world—on Monday, the 6th of April, I took Hall from the station-house to the police-office—I saw a female on the steps of the office with a baby in her arms, and he told me she was his wife—she said to him, "Hall, you see what you have brought yourself to"—he said, "I may thank you all for this"—she hung down her head, began crying, and walked off.</p>

                  </hi>.—I am an ironmonger and locksmith, and live in Welbeck-street. I was sent for to examine the locks—my attention was called to the dressing-room door—I examined the external appearances in the morning, and decidedly said the mortice-lock had not been forced open, neither had the patent lock in the drawer been picked—in the evening I made further examination—I took each lock off and examined them, to see if there was any appearance of a pick-lock being introduced to open them—there was not the slightest appearance of it whatever—the patent lock of the drawer could not have been opened but by the key—the mortice-lock</p>

                  </hi>. In March last I was in the service of Mrs. Collins, and had been so eight years next July—the two prisoners were also in her service—I was in the habit of conversing familiarly with them, as ser<lb/>vants do—I remember the night of the robbery perfectly well—about a fortnight before that I had some conversation with the prisoners on the subject of robberies—we were talking about so many robberies taking place of jewels and various things, and we said we thought servants were always errconcerned in the robberies—Hall asked Handcox what she thought mis<lb/>tress's jewels were worth, whether she thought they were worth 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the reply was, yes, she thought they were; and then he said, "Shall we all three agree to part with them?"—the reply from all three of us was, "Yes"—Hancox and I said, "Yes"—we talked further about it several times—we were to take an opportunity of taking them—the time was fixed—it happened on the 28th or 29th of March—it was to be fixed about then, but it was not settled till the night before it took place—I and Handcox were to take them out of the box, and give them to Hall—Hall was present at that arrangement—I had seen my mistress's jewel-case several times—it was a red box—I do not know whether it was covered with red paper or leather—it had a handle on the top—I saw the inside when I emptied the contents out—I cannot say I had not seen it before that, but not to know the particulars of it—there were two trays in it, covered with white satin and wadding—mistress went out on Saturday afternoon, but at what time I cannot say—but while she was out, I and</p>

               <p>Handcox took the jewel-box, placed it on a box by the side of mistress's bed, and emptied it—Hancock placed it there—it was there when I went into the room, and was open—I did not see it unlocked—it was unlocked—Hall was not there—I took out the two trays, and emptied the contents into two fine brown papers—I emptied out two head ornaments, necklaces, rings, a watch, and some foreign coin, and other things, and sparkling stones—I do not know whether they were set in gold or silver—when we had emptied them out, we both wrapped them up and took them down stairs into the back parlour, and gave them to Hall, who was there—his reply was, "Now I have got you both;" or "Now I have done for you both!" I do not know which—he then went down stairs to the kitchen floor, and after that, (but I do not know how long after that,) he went out—I saw him again before he went out—he went out about half-past five or a quarter before six o'clock—I let him out, and be asked me to wait till he came back; as he should be gone a very short time—I did not see whether he had the brown paper parcels with him or not—I waited for him—he came back in about ten minutes, and I let him in, and I let Evans the coachman in at the same time—he said, "Thank God, they are gone!"—Evans did not hear what he said, he was gone down stairs—when I took the jewels out of the box, we put the box underneath mistress's bed—it had been settled before what was to be done with the box—there were other servants in the house—the cook was down stairs—the footman was out with mistress—Mrs. Collins's nurse was up stairs in the nursery—my mistress dined at home at six o'clock—the footman was at home when the jewels went out of the house, and I think he was at home part of the evening, but I was up stairs a good deal—the coachman went away in his room about his busi<lb/>ness—I cannot say what time in the evening the footman was in the house—I did not see him sent out the first time, but the second time I was present when Hall sent him out, and told him to go and inquire after some man's health—I do not recollect the name—I think he was to go some-where to Lisson-grove, or the New-road way—Hall sent the cook out to get half a pint of gin—he said there were no good spirits anywhere near the house, but if she would go somewhere towards King-street, (I think it was,) she would get some good gin there—he gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get it—she wanted to know why he wanted her to go so far, and hesitated about going—she said it was a good way to go—he said she would oblige him if she would go that distance for it—when both those servants were out, we three burnt the remains of the box—some part of it was burnt in mistress's dressing-room, another part in the pantry, and some part in the kitchen—I and the two prisoners were present, but not at all the three places—I was chiefly in the dressing-room, but I saw part burnt in the kitchen, and I put some part of it on the kitchen-fire myself, and likewise in the pantry—I had mistress's dressing-room fire to do, and threw the ashes into the dust-hole next morning, but I have nothing to do with the other ashes—the cook returned first, and we four sat down to play at cards—the foot<lb/>man came in about ten o'clock, and told Hall the man was perfectly well that he went to inquire after—there might be more pass, but I did not pay attention to it—my mistress went up stairs about half-past ten, or I think at nearly eleven—I heard Handcox make an alarm in the course of the night—I knew it was going to take place—it was planned at what hour it should take place—all three of us planned it—I came down stairs after hearing the alarm, and went into Mrs. Collins's bed-room—Mrs. William Collins opened the window, clapped her hands, and called the police—when</p>

               <p>the police came in, I went into mistress's bed-room, and remained with her the chief of the time—the two prisoners were afterwards turned away—I did not tell any thing about the matter till the Sunday following; I then told Mr. and Mrs. William Collins—they had not made any inquiry of me about it—my mistress asked me about the robbery; she thought Martha was guilty—she never charged me with it—I had no fear of being turned away at the time I told this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of hearing of the robbery, I saw the prisoner Hall on the 5th of April—I said, "Hall, this is a bad job"—(he was in the cell at the time—I knew him be<lb/>fore)—he asked me my advice—I told him I had no business to give advice under such circumstances—he said he wished me to give him advice, for he meant to tell all about it—I said it was of no use his telling all about it now, for Mary Sumpter had told all about it—he asked me what Mary had said—I told him she said he took the jewels down as far as Maryle-bone-lane, but she did not see which way he turned—he said that was false, for he did not go so far as the lane with them—I told him I would not hear any more there—if he liked to go in a coach with me to the office, he could tell me what he liked—I then left him, intending to go in a coach with him, but I did not go—I saw him afterwards at the office—I was</p>

               <p>standing alongside him—that was in the presence of the Magistrate—Sumpter was, at that time, giving her evidence—he directed his conversa<lb/>tion to me, as I stood by him—he was not being questioned by the Justice, but was in private conversation with me—Sumpter was giving her evidence, and he said, "Oh, the d—b—, it was her that planned that herself"—he afterwards turned round to Handcox, and said, "I gave you twelve sovereigns, Handcox"—she said, "Yes; you did"—he said, "You tell all about it, and I will do the same"—Handcox said, "Yes, I will."</p>

On the 27th of March I went to Croydon—I left my workshop closed, except an opening at the top; when I returned, I missed a smoothing-plane—I mentioned it to the men in the shop; and on the Thursday afterwards I called the prisoner and told him I had lost a plane, and he must look till he found it—he said he would go and ask his mother; and I said why need he go to her—he then said, "Do you suppose I have stolen it?"—this is my plane.</p>

Oliver"—he said it was his signature, and that he had delivered the letter, and taken a receipt, which he produced—this is the paper he produced—it was his duty to keep the receipt, as his voucher—he said he had delivered the letter to a boy, near Mrs. Martin's house, No.</p>

I accompanied Mr. Lawrence to the prisoner's lodging, on the 23rd of April—I was present when the book was shewn him—his attention was called to his signature in the money letter-book—he said it was his writing, and that he recollected the letter very well, as there was some writing with red ink on the face of it—he said he received the postage the next morning, after he delivered the letter to the boy—he was asked for the receipt, which he produced, and said it was the receipt he received for the letter—I went with Mr. Lawrence, Mr. Peacock, and the prisoner, to Mrs. Martin's, in Bryanston-street—as soon as we got to the door of No. 33, it was opened by a boy—the prisoner said, "That is the boy I gave, the letter to"—he said he had met him in the street on the morning the letter was to be delivered, and knowing him to be Mrs. Martin's boy, he asked him if there was a person of the name of "Strong," or "Stong," in the house, and the boy said yes, it was all right—that he gave him the letter and the receipt, and told him to get the receipt filled up, with the sum of money that was in the letter, and the postage was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was to call for it next morning; and that as he was delivering his letters, or collecting postage, next morning, opposite No. 33,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183505110100"/>
               <p>that the boy came over to No. 11, and gave him the postage, and the receipt, which he produced—he said all this before he saw the boy—when we got to the house, the boy was asked about it, and denied ever having received the letter, and having paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. postage to the prisoner, at any time at all—he said so at once, and when he was confronted with the prisoner, he persisted in denying having received the letter from him, or a receipt, at all—I desired the prisoner to write on a piece of paper, "one sovereign"—this is his writing—I asked him to write his name, and "No. 33, Bryan-ston-street," then "one sovereign," and "Miss Spong"—he had written a figure "1," and spelt sovereign, "sovering."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did all this pass on the subject of the letter before you got to the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

I went with Mr. Lawrence to the prisoner's lodging—his evidence is correct—I went to Mrs. Martin's—the boy positively denied having re<lb/>ceived such a letter from the prisoner, addressed to Miss Spong, and said that he never at any one time paid him the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor had he ever seen a paper like the receipt produced before, until about a fortnight previous, when a letter was delivered by another letter-carrier, with a similar receipt—the prisoner made the statement Leadbitter has given, and the boy said he never received a money-letter for Miss Spong, and that he never in any one instance paid him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. postage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you examined before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not—the boy appears about fifteen years old—he did not use the words "in any instance"—I did not take down his words.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old, and am in the employ<lb/>ment of Mrs. Martin, of Bryanston-street, and have been so nearly twelve months; this is the second time of my living with her—Miss Spong lives in our house—there is no person named Strong—I know the prisoner by his delivering letters—he never delivered a letter at our house, for which I afterwards gave him a receipt—nor in the street—I never paid him a postage of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on any letter—I never paid him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at No. 11, or there<lb/>abouts—I once paid him 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at No. 11, but I did not give him a receipt—I cannot recollect when that was—I have never received letters from him in the street—I did not deliver this paper to him—no part of it is my writing—I know nothing of it—I can write—Mr. Sykes taught me to write.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About six months, as the letter-carrier of the district—I have never talked to him, but asking him if there was any letter, and he has said "Yes" or "No;" that is all I have said to him—I think I have asked him twice, (not more to my recollection,) once in Portman-street, and once in Bryan<lb/>ston-street—I think Portman-street was the last time, but I cannot be certain—it was about a week before February—I think I did not receive any letters from him on either occasion, when I asked him if there was one—he answered me both times, "No"—I remember when the officer, Mr. Peacock, and the prisoner, came to my mistress's house—I think it was on a Thursday night—I think four persons came—nobody had spoken to me on the subject before that—I had had no conversation about the letter before that night—I never asked the prisoner if there was any letter for Miss Spong—I never asked him if there was any for Mrs. Martin—he once asked me for that name, but it was not a money-letter, and it was some time before that—I cannot recollect how long, but I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183505110101"/>
               <p>think it was about three weeks—Miss Spong had not told me she expected a letter—nobody had said any thing to me about one—they had not said they expected a letter from Ireland—when the four persons came to the house, they asked if Mrs. Martin was at home—they told me to wait out<lb/>side a little, that I should be wanted, and after that, I was called into the room—I do not think Mrs. Martin was in the room when I went in—they had said nothing to me on the subject of a letter, before I was called into the room—the prisoner asked me whether I recollected taking in a letter—Mr. Lawrence was by at the time—I said, "I did not do such a thing"—that was all that passed before I went into the room—that was in the presence of the prisoner; and Mr. Lawrence, Leadbitter, and Mr. Pea<lb/>cock were up stairs in the room at the time—I said, in Mr. Lawrence's presence, that I did not recollect receiving the letter—that was in answer to the first question put to me—I never saw a letter given to a servant in the street—I never took one in the street myself; it has always been at the door—I should not have had the money to pay the postage in the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why was it you asked him on two occasions if he had got any letters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should have gone back with him, and taken them up stairs to Mrs. Martin, and got the money—I never received a letter from a post-man in the street—I was in the room about a quarter of an hour—I was asked a good many questions, and I had to write my name down—I was asked if I ever had a receipt for a letter put into my hands—I think Mr. Peacock asked me—he and Leadbitter questioned me—the prisoner was in the room at the time—he said what I said was false—I was examined twice at Bow-street, and I went twice to the Post-office, where they asked me some questions—I went from there to Bow-street both times—Mr. Peacock asked me some questions at the Post-office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to say you did not recollect any thing about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I did not at first; but when I <hi rend="italic">stood up</hi> and recollected myself I recollected not receiving the letter—I was uncertain at first whether I had received it or not—I recollected about a letter which we had up in the second floor, where Mr. Jeffries lived, but that was not from this postman; that was one without a livery—I heard the name mentioned of the person who signed the receipt for Mr. Jeffries's letter, which was a money-letter, but I did not sign that receipt—the postman offered me that letter, and I said I would go and fetch Mr. Jeffries down; that is since this—I never received a money-letter in my life, or signed a receipt—I do not remember paying the prisoner any postage higher than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that was the highest I ever paid for a letter—it came from Paris, I think for Mrs. Martin—I do not know whether there was any thing in it—I am almost positive it was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I would not say it was not 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I never had any quarrel with the prisoner—there is a boy about my size living at the shoemaker's, next door to us—there are two boys at No. 11—there is one at No. 31, and one at No. 32, and there is one more in Mrs. Martin's house, named Roberts—he is about fifteen or sixteen years old—he lives there with his mother and father who keep the house—Mrs. Martin is a lodger, and I am her errand-boy—Miss Spong lives there now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at New Brentford. On the might of the 17th of March, I went to see a friend go off for Scotland—I went with him as far as the Salutation, Old Brentford, about three o'clock—I parted with him about six o'clock, close to the Salutation door—I went in and stopped there afterwards; and about seven o'clock I was going home—I was in the street of Brentford, near the Chapel of Ease; I had my hand on my watch, and all in a moment I was accosted by three men—I am postive the prisoner was one of them, he tripped me up, and then he pretended to pick me up, and while he was doing that, he took my watch out of my pocket, and gave it to the other two men, who ran off with it—I secured him—I felt my watch gone in a minute—I had had a glass rather too much, but could conduct myself very well—I had seen the prisoner in the public-house, but whether the other two were there I do not know—it was rather dark in the street—I lost my watch exactly by the free-school, at Old Brentford—Chapel-alley is just by there—I was bruised in the scuffle, and could not lift my arm for a fortnight—that injury was done to me while I was holding the prisoner—it was after I lost the property—he tripped me up with his foot—it was a slight touch—he put his foot out, and I was down and he on me in an instant, just at the corner of the alley—the other two men-came and assisted him, and they ran away with my property—I got up, missed my watch, collared the pri<lb/>soner, and he knocked me down, and broke my nose—I am quite sure I did not fall, but was tripped up before I lost my watch—this must be the man that took my watch, as the other two were not close enough to me—I heard the other two say they had <hi rend="italic">"napped</hi>," and it was all right, and off they ran—the prisoner got away from me before the police came up—I held him nearly ten minutes, and then he got away, and absconded for a month nearly—I knew him from a child—I have no doubt at all of him.</p>

About nine o'clock that night three young men came in together, and one of there brought this sack of flour on his back—the prisoners are two of the men—they staid drinking about an hour—I saw the sack in the room after they were gone—Mr. Edmonds and Whitelock, and the officer came afterwards and took away the sack—it was the same that the prisoners and the other person had left, they had had some ale, which they did not pay for—they went to the door, and I thought they were coming back—Johnson remained longer than the others.</p>

My dwelling-house is at No. 1, St. George's-court, in the parish of St. George, Middlesex—I never saw the prisoner but once—he married my wife's sister's daughter, but was never at my house till the Sunday fort<lb/>night before this—I had seen the box secure at half-past five o'clock on Monday-night, the 6th of April—I put tome money into it, and went on my watch—it was under my bed—it contained the articles stated, and three shillings and five sixpences—I bolted the back-door, and locked the front-door or the spring-lock at half-past five o'clock, when I went out—it was all secure then—I returned at half-past six o'clock in the morning—my wife had been out all day—she had come home at half-past nine o'clock in the evening—the staple of the front-door lock was forced off—the bed-room door was bolted at the top and bottom when I went out.</p>

I went out before him, and returned at a quarter after nine o'clock—I found the box of the lock wrenched off the street-door—I went into the back-room, where we sleep, and found that door open, and the box gone from under the bed—the bed-room door was unbolted—the prisoner is my nephew—I had seen him on the Tuesday evening previous—this is the box; I know the contents.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy to the Bank of England public-house, in North-wharf-yard, Paddington. On Sunday night, the 26th of April, I went to the Hope, in Berkley-street, and saw the prisoner—I was rather the worse for liquor, but not drunk—I went into the yard and was sick there—I remember a hand being introduced into my pocket in the yard—Moore, my brother-in-law came out into the yard—he said, "If you touch him, I will split your head"—he said so to the prisoner—I at that moment was so sick, I could do nothing—there was nobody in the yard but me and the prisoner at the time—I missed from my pocket two half-crowns, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a button—I charged Moore with taking it at first, and searched him, and found he had but 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he was in the privy—I then went into the tap-room and charged the prisoner with taking two half-crowns and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had done no such thing, and that he had 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. about him—we had a scuffle—I struck him, and he struck me—I had two half crowns and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a button in my pocket before I went into the yard—I had the button in my pocket for a fortnight—it had not come off my dress.</p>

I was at the public-house with the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor in the yard when I went out there—I went into the water-closet, and left the door open; and presently I saw the prisoner touch the prosecutor, and say, "Well, comrade, how are you?"—I saw him put his hand into his left-hand pocket—I said, "If you don't let him alone I will split your head off"—the prisoner then caught hold of the door, and went into the tap room—my brother-in-law said, "Joe, have you taken my money?"—I said, "No; feel;" and he searched me—I had only 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he went into the tap-room, and accused the prisoner of taking two half-crowns, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a button—the prisoner said, "I have got 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket now?"—the prisoner was intoxicated—Williams came in, and asked him to let him see what money he had; and all he could produce was two half-crowns, two sixpences, and a button—he had paid for a pot of half-and-half with a shilling, about three minutes after I came into the tap-room—he had the beer before he went out, and the waiter asked him for the money—I did not see what he paid for it myself, but the waiter says he paid a shilling—he is not here—that was about seven minutes after he came out of the yard—I did not charge him—my brother-in-law accused him, and I said, "I saw you put your hand into his pocket"—he said, "I did not"—Walsh fetched a policeman, and he would not give the money up till he got to the station-house—he carried it in his hand all the way to the station-house—I charged him with it seven minutes before the policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Samuel Light<lb/>foot—we are merchants and foreign banking agents. I know the house of Glaster and Co.—they are exchange-brokers—Mr. Daniel Glas<lb/>ter Foster is the only person in the firm to my knowledge—the prisoner Foster has latterly been the managing person in the business—Mr. Glaster Foster has been in infirm health for the last eighteen months—the prisoner is his nephew—we have had extensive bill transactions with that house, for many years—it is the business of exchange-brokers to negociate bill transactions between one house and another, receiving a com<lb/>mission from both houses—it is the custom, on those occasions, to state the particulars of the instrument, and as soon as the contract is passed, the seller sends the bill to the buyer, indorsed—in December last we had taken several bills, with the name of "B. Chesterman" as the indorser—I placed one in the prisoner's hand, which was returned from Dublin, protested in Feb<lb/>ruary, this year; the amount was 790<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Q.</hi> What passed further on that interrview? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He stated that there was no doubt as to his respectability, and if I would allow him to take the bill, he would fetch me the amount and charges—I placed the bill and protest in his hands for that purpose—he then left me—I think this was on the 14th of February—the repre<lb/>sentations that he had made of Chesterman were, that he was a man of the highest respectability, of property to a considerable amount, and was well known to his uncle and himself for many years—that his uncle had done business for him formerly, and he knew him to be worth at least 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that he was in the wine and spirit trade, and carried on business in Lincoln's inn-fields, and he believed he had a house at Brixton; and, finally, to induce me to take the bill, that he considered him of equal respectability to any house in London—this conversation was when he first presented the 790<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill; and he confirmed it when the bill was re<lb/>turned in February. I perceive by a contract I have in my hand, dated the "13th of December, 1834," in the prisoner's hand-writing, that I took from him a bill of Thomas Wilson, of London, on Belfast, for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; three bills on Dublin, of Messrs.

Chesterman—the custom in London is to take the bills on one post-day, and pay for them on the next—Foster after<lb/>wards presented other bills with "B. Chesterman" on them, but we refused to take them—this was the last bill I took of him with the name of "Chesterman"—I had made some inquiries, and told him, from the in<lb/>quires I had made, no such person, as the acceptor was living at Sligo—he said there must be some mistake in that information, as he had been assured that Murphy had extensive dealings with Chetterman, and he stated that I might be perfectly satisfied; the bills I had ranning were perfectly safe, and any others I chose to take would be equally so—I told him I thought Mr. Chesterman had not exercised proper caution in trust<lb/>ing Murphy—he replied, that was his affair; Mr. Chesterman was perfectly safe, if the amount had been as many thousands as it was hundreds—he stated, that I might take it with as much safety as I could the indorse<lb/>ment of Harman and Co.: that house, is one of the first respectability in the City of London—whenhe came in February to ask me for the 790<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill to take to the indorser, he was gone about an hour and a half—he then returned, and paid me the amount and charges—the 880<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill would be due on the 14th of March—it should be paid in Dublin on that day—I received this note that day—it came by the Twopenny-post—it was after<lb/>wards shewn to Foster in my presence (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Messrs. Trye and Light-foot, Crosby-square, Bishopsgate-street—Sir, The bill for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and up<lb/>wards, is a forgery—due to-morrow, in Dublin—Foster is going; see to it"—I read the note "Foster is going to see to it"—I did not suppose but</p>

               <p>what he was going to look after it, and it did not excite my suspicion—I had occasion to go to Grosvenor-place shortly afterwards; I was gone nearly three hours—during my absence Mr. Lightfoot had an oppor<lb/>tunity of seeing Foster—on my return, Foster followed me as I went up stairs to the counting-house—Mr. Lightfoot read the note, and said to Foster, "Why, Foster, this is as much as to say you are going;" and that directed my attention more particularly to the note—Mr. Lightfoot bantered him about it—neither of us had any suspicion whatever—I told him it looked rather suspicious—he stated that it did; and requested that I would preserve the note, in order to show it to his uncle—when we bantered him as to his running away, he said, it was perfectly safe—I thought so to, seeing the other bills were paid—I ex<lb/>pected the 880<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill from Dublin on the Monday—that is, the account of the bill, if it had been paid—this was on Saturday—I required that Foster would call on Monday to learn its fate—he agreed to do so—the bill did not arrive till Wednesday—Foster did not call on Monday—Tuesday was foreign post day—it was his custom always to call on that day—I did not see him that day; he did not come—I was not on Change myself, but my partner was—the bill arrived on Wednesday protested—it is a promissory note—this if it—I never saw Foster after that, till he was in custody, about the 1st or 2nd of April—the indorsement is, "Pay to Messrs. Trye and Lightfoot, or order, value of them; London, 13th of December, 1834. B. Chesterman"—I have frequently seen Foster write, and had consi<lb/>derable means of ascertaining the character of his hand-writing—I believe the words "Pay Messrs. Trye and Lightfoot" to be his hand-writing—I have no doubt of it, and I believe the signature "B. Chesterman" to be his, by a comparison of the letters and the way I have seen him write—I do believe it to be his.</p>

                  </hi>. I am executor to Mrs. Jane Matilda Coghlan. I produce the probate of her will—I was in the habit of going to her house almost every day—she lived in Buckingham-street—the prisoner Benwell was in her service twice—she left her in June, came back in July, and lived with her till her death, which was on the 2nd of January, at half-past ten o'clock at night—I heard she was dead the next morning; Benwell told me she had been insensible for the last two days—she was the only ser<lb/>vant in the house—there was a charwoman used to assist—I went the next morning, and missed several articles; some of which are here produced—I repeatedly asked the prisoner for Mrs. Coghlan's three rings which she used to wear; one was her wedding-ring, another a diamond ring, and the other had a blue stone in it—she denied all knowledge of them—I was rather severe with her, and the next day she brought the gold and diamond rings, but not the other—I spoke to her about the umbrella; she denied all knowledge of it—I spoke to her about the stair-carpeting; for when the auctioneer's clerk came to take the inventory, there were only seven yards of it—I said there must have been much more; she denied all knowledge of it, and said, "It must be on the top of the stairs"—this is the ring with the blue stone in it, and this is the umbrella and carpeting.</p>

These things are my husband's property—the prisoner lived at home with us—he has lived in very respectable places, but turned out so wicked, he could not keep them—he has wronged me, and then gone away for three or four days—I left him locked in my room on the 3rd of May, while I went after my little girl, at five minutes after eight o'clock, and when I returned, I found my door broken open, and the prisoner and these things were gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister. On the 8th of May, between four and five o'clock, I was in Dover-street—I was informed by a woman that my pocket had been picked by three boys—I turned back, and went into Albemarle-street, where I asked a servant if he had seen three boys—he gave me information—I saw three boys at a distance—I pursued and laid hold of one of them—I taxed him with having robbed me, and at the same time called out, "Stop thief!"—he told me he was not with the others, and persuaded me to let him go—in the meantime, my calling had attracted some persons, and they took the prisoner, who was one of the boys—this pair of gloves fell from him, which are my property—the rest of the property I have not recovered—I lost my purse with five sovereigns in it—my seals were attached to my purse, which was with my gloves in my hind pocket.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 28th of April, between twelve and one o'clock, I went to No. 16, Union-court, Orchard-street, Westminster—I saw a light in the parlour; and suspecting something was going on, I went through the passage of the next house, on to the wall, which is about four feet high; the window is about five feet from the ground—I stepped from that wall on to another wall, about a yard from the window—there was an old gown hung about half-way up the window—I could see from there what took place in the room—I could see over three-parts of the room—I saw Bantin with a plate, and a tin band in his hand, and a shilling on the plate—I heard Bantin say to a girl,</p>

               <p>who was lying in bed, "What is this tied in such a d—d knot for?"—he took a knife from the mantel-piece, and cut a string off the tin band, and tied it afresh with another string—he placed the band on the plate, over the shilling; and I saw him take something white out of a cup, and pour it into the band, on the shilling—I communicated this to Banister, my in<lb/>spector, at three o'clock in the morning—I went to the house again the same morning, at near ten o'clock, with Banister and Goose, a policeman—we went to the front-door in the court, which was bolted with one bolton the top—Banister and I forced the door—the bolt gave way, and it flew open—we went into the passage, and found the parlour-door fastened with a small bolt in the middle—the door broke asunder in the middle—the whole half of the door went in, and I could see what was in the parlour—I saw Bantin stooping, with the mould in his left-hand, and a tobacco-pipe in his right<lb/>hand—he was pouring something from a tobacco-pipe into the mould—he was holding the mould in his hand, in a piece of rag—the whole door went in entirely in a moment, and he then looked round over his shoulder and saw me—he then dropped the tobacco-pipe—he then took the mould out of the rag, and broke it in pieces—he was going to rub it, but part of the metal came into his hand, which was hot, and he dropped it—I caught it, but could not hold it, and was obliged to let it fall—Banister forced him back on the bed—I kept the piece of the mould in my hand, and took this piece of spoon off the hob; it is the handle—I have part of a shilling which was in the mould; that is the hot metal which I spoke of—Bantin said, when Banister was keeping him back, "Ah, Ford, you may pick it up; that will of be no use to you"—he said, "Good luck to the little bolt, he has saved me this time"—I heard him say the same to Banister and Goose again.</p>

I went with Ford and Goose, to Union-court—the first thing I saw on entering the room was the prisoner, Bantin, in a stoop<lb/>ing position, as described by Ford, with something in his left hand, which he appeared to be crushing—he put it from one hand to the other, and tried to crumble it—he dropped it on the floor; and while he was in the act of stamping on it, I knocked him backwards on the bed—at the time he had the mould in his left hand he put something in the fire with his right hand, and partially upset a pipkin, which was on a strong fire with white metal in it, in a state of fusion—I attempted to take the pipkin away, but it was so very hot, I could not succeed at that moment—I after<lb/>wards saw Goose take it into his possession—I likewise saw Ford pick up the piece of mould, and the piece of white metal, which I believe to be part of a counterfeit shilling—on searching the room further, I found a file on the mantle-piece, with white metal in the teeth of it, and an iron spoon on a shelf in the corner of the room—a short distance from the fire, I found a box of plaster of Paris—I saw Goose find a tin band, and a new white metal spoon—I secured Bantin, and Goose arrested Shields, who was in the room smoking a pipe, when we went in—there was a female in the bed in the corner of the room, in a complete state of nudity—she jumped up in her fright, and had not even a shift on—Bantin said, "You have been looking after me a long time, but it is no <hi rend="italic">pull</hi> this time"—I also heard him say, "Good luck to the little bolt, it has saved me this time."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hatter, and live in Upper Cleveland-street, Fitzroy-square. I was in Mark's employ upwards of twelve months, three years ago—I knew Silk as a hatter—I always considered him as a master, as keeping a shop—I have seen him at Marks's, with goods to sell—not very often—he had beaver hats unfinished, just as they came from the die—</p>

               <p>sometimes he brought them in a string, sometimes in a handkerchief, but not doubled up—I have seen others bring hats doubled up and folded in a handkerchief—Marks lived where he does now when I lived with him—he had two shops in High-street—I defy any man to judge the value of stuff hats within 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this hat is damaged (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—in our neighbourhood we are obliged to buy cheap—I would not give more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it at the utmost—this other hat is perfect—I would not give more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—this other is better, and I might go as far as 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it in St. Giles's, but not more—I have known Marks six or seven years—I never heard any thing against him—Davies was his shopman, and worked with me; he bore an honest character.</p>

On the 24th of April I gave this witness an old shilling, with the King's coat of arms on it—he went out, returned in half an hour, and said, "This is a bad shilling which you gave me," and he gave me another shilling which had a lion rampant on it—I had had one returned from that house on the Wednesday night before—I put the bad shilling which Hore brought me into a bit of brown paper, and gave it to the policeman on the Saturday evening, when the prisoner was taken.</p>

On the morn<lb/>ing of the 25th of April, I marked eight good shillings—Slater and I went to the White Swan, in the evening—I gave him one of the marked shil<lb/>lings—he called for a pot of half-and-half—another waiter served him, and gave him the good change—we then called for half-a-pint of gin—the prisoner brought that, and I gave him one of the marked shillings—he took it up in his hand; after he put the gin down he, put it to his mouth, and said, "That is a bad one"—I said, "No, it is not;" and pretended to be groggy—we kept him talking till Slater had drank one glass of gin—the prisoner then pnt a shilling down on the floor, and said it was a bad one—I took it, jumped up, and gave him in charge—I gave the shil<lb/>ling to the watchman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist, and live in the Edge<lb/>ware-road. The deceased applied to me on the 27th, about a quarter of an hour after he received the injury—I examined his knee; it appeared very much swollen, and as if he had received a severe contusion on the left knee, such as might be caused by a severe kick—I gave him leeches to apply, and cold applications—I did not see him again until the 1st of May, when he walked to me, which, in my judgment, was an imprudent thing at that time—I live five or six houses from him—his knee appeared less swollen then, but he complained of more pain—it appeared to have had an application of leeches, which would reduce the swelling—I ex<lb/>amined it; and although the swelling appeared very much reduced, still, over-exertion, or other causes, might have brought on that pain—I applied my hand to it—he complained of much pain upon that—I applied more cold applications, and more leeches—I saw him again that day or the next—he appeared some days better and other days worse—I attended him occasionally with Mr. Gerdwood until the day of his death—there was always inflammation more or less about the knee since the 1st of May—the inflammation gradually increased and extended up and down the limb—it might have been brought on by various causes—in the present instance, I think it more than probable, that the inflammation was brought on by his own exertion; I mean the increase of it—if he had not received an injury on the knee it would not have been inflamed—it finally brought on erysipelas; and he died, on the 12th of May, of delirium, the result of erysipelas, pro<lb/>duced, in all probability, by the blow—I know of nothing else which could produce it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital, and live in Brook-street, Grosvenor-square. I was called in to the deceased on Sunday, the 10th of May; the disease had made progress, so that the examination of the knee was of less importance—he was in a state of high delirium; and that sort of delirium which is attended with great de<lb/>bility—I inquired into the cause—I found he had erysipelas on the left thigh and leg—the cause was then apparent—I inquired farther, and found he had received a slight abrasion or injury on the top of the shin-bone—I saw that the inner part of the knee was tender, and that there had been the injury—the slightest abrasion, puncture, or bruise, will, in some constitu<lb/>tions, produce erysipelas—the knee was slightly swollen—when the con<lb/>stitution is debilitated, either by excess or any thing else, a very slight injury will produce that effect.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Maiden-lane, Battle-bridge, and am a general merchant. I employed the prisoner to pawn some silk goods for me at Mr. Upsall's, on the 13th and 14th of June last—the first parcel was four hundred yards, pawned for about 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the latter parcel was rather more—the prisoner gave the duplicates into my hands—they have never been out of my hands—they are in the name of "John Taylor, by Shields"—the prisoner had no right to have any money upon them, but as pledges—he had no right to redeem them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you state before the Magistrate that they cost you 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—it will appear by the invoices, that they cost 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-yard? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> This cost near 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—I have not had the invoices for months—we were not in partnership—he had no interest in the business—he was employed as a friend—I did not think it a re<lb/>spectable way of raising money myself—he never pawned any thing for me before, to the best of ray recollection—I remember giving him some guns to pawn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. We jointly took the premises at No. 12, Diana-place, New-road, in October, 1833. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You took them, I did not—I do not owe you any thing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you supply him with money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—if there had been any profit, I should probably have received it—all connexion ceased between us at the end of May last year, and what money I lent him, I considered lost, and <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> gone—I was not in partnership with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you and I take a public-house in John-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I advanced money to John Lynch to take the house—the pri<lb/>soner introduced me to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. There was a partnerhip between the prosecutor and myself, and the profits were to be equally divided between him, and Lynch, and me—with the money we got for these silks, we took the house. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was no partnership whatever—I know the whole gang of them, and I shall rout them out—the prisoner stated last year, that he had no claim on me—and in January last he went and took these goods—he got a per<lb/>son to personate me, and to state that I had lost these duplicates.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He always knew me and Mr. Taylor to be in partnership. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I do not know how you were situated, whether partner or servant—I did not consider you a partner.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner, in a long address, stated that the prosecutor and himself were engaged in various transactions together, but made no allusion to the charge in question.)</p>

About eleven o'clock at night, on the 9th of April, I stopped the prisoner with a bundle, and asked him what he had got; he said his own property—I desired him to open it, and I saw it was part of a ham—I told him to come to the watch-house—he called out, "Jones," Jones then came across the way—I said to him, "Jones, I know you, and if you offer to rescue him, I will have you to-morow;" he then kept back—the prisoner and I had a scuffle—I threw him down—I saw the errand-cart going by, and I called the man; he said he could not leave his cart, but he would take the bundle, which he did—I then had my hands at liberty, and the prisoner went pretty quietly to the watch-house.</p>

On the 22nd of April, I met him with George Rogers, who had been in my employ—I went to a public-house with them—I went to one or two pub<lb/>lic-houses with Rogers, and to one with the prisoner—I had something to drink, and was a little intoxicated—it might be about eight o'clock in the morning when I met the prisoner—I left the company of Rogers, went home, and went to bed between twelve and one o'clock, as near as possible—I do not think I was in the prisoner's company above an hour and a half, but I was with Rogers till about half-past twelve o'clock in the day time—I left him close by my own home—I was in bed at one o'clock, and slept through the day and the night; and about a quarter to one o'clock in the morning I was awoke by my dog barking—I was certain there must be somebody in the shop, by the barking of the dog which was in the shop—I was quite sober at this time—when I came down, I saw the prisoner in the shop—I had the gas burning—I gave an alarm backwards—I <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "Murder! thieves!"—I could see nobody in the shop but the prisoner—I was quite sure he was there—I was not the first person who got into the shop—I called out backwards, seeing the prisoner in the shop—while I was calling out, Mrs. Cox jumped out of bed, and flew into the shop—we got the street door open, and gave an alarm there—I sent my boy, Jenkins, with some goods to the other shop, in the New-cut, next day, and on his return he made communication to me.</p>

Yes, he is"—Rogers then asked me if my master was in bed and asleep—I said yes, he was—this was rather before eleven o'clock at night—I had left my master's at ten o'clock—next day I was sent by my master down to the New-cut, and on the road I saw Rogers with two other girls, by the side of Mrs. Slater's shop, where the prisoner works—I overheard a conversation between Rogers and the girls, and informed my master—I saw the prisoner in Mrs. Slater's shop on my return.</p>
