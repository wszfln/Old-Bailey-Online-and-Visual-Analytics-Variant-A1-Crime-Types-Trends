                  </hi>. I live at 96, High Street, Kensington, and am a builder—I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> in consequence of which I went to Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, to see a horse—I saw the prisoner and a stableman—I told the prisoner I had come to see the large horse—he said he had sold that one, but there was another one there that he thought would answer my purpose—he asked for what purpose I wanted it—I told him for a builder's brick cart—he told me that his name was Conolly, and he was in business with his father as an ice merchant at 9a, Irongate Wharf, Caledonian Road, and that he had been driving that horse in an ice cart all the summer, and in consequence of the weather getting colder and the ice trade falling off he no longer required it, that he had driven it with 27 or 28 cwt. of ice and would go at the rate of 7 or 8 miles an hour—I asked to have the horse brought out and he had it brought out<lb/>side—he said it would be impossible to run it on the stones as one shoe was off, but he would have that put on and I could send for the horse next morning and take it on trial for a week—I did not agree to purchase it—I was going to take it on trial and not pay for it, but he objected and said he must certainly have the money as I was a stranger; that he was perfectly respectable and that I need not be afraid of depositing the money with him.—I was induced chiefly to take the horse on account of the statement that he had been driving it all the summer with 26 or 27 cwt, and if it would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187411230004"/>
               <p>do that it would do all that I required of it—I should have taken the horse on trial, but I should not have deposited the money if he had not said anything about his business as an ice merchant—he said I must pay the money as he did not know more of me than I knew of him—that was on the Saturday—I left 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Saturday night; I had no more money then, and for that he gave me this receipt in the name of Conolly—I objected to there being no stamp on the receipt—he said he could not get one as it was evening, but he would write it out with a proper stamp when I sent for the horse on the Monday—the receipt, Alfred Conolly, was written in my presence by the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Oct. 3, 1874. Received of Mr. Hussey the sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of bay mare according to agreement. Alfred E. Conolly.") On the Monday I sent my man round for the horse, and I sent a cheque for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the balance of the money—the man was three or four hours gone—when he came back with the horse, it had got the shoe on—I have had the cheque back since—it was cashed on the same day—the carman tried the horse in the cart in my presence—it would not go; it would not draw an empty cart—we had to put two chain horses on to him—we took the empty cart to where we were removing some trees and put a little earth in the cart, but he would not draw it at all—we had to put two horses on to pull him out—other people were present at the time—we put him away for the night, and next morning we tried him over again and we could not even get him out of the mews with an empty cart—I told the carman to take him out of the cart and take him back to Charlotte Mews and I would come there too, and on the way I called at Irongate Wharf to see if I could find Conolly—I made certain inquiries, but I was not able find him—I then went to Charlotte Mews and found the prisoner and the same stableman there—I said "Well, Mr. Conolly, I am obliged to bring the horse back"—he said "Why?"—I said "He won't suit me, he won't draw, and is no good to me; I must trouble you to give me the money back"—he said "I can't, I have not got the money"—I said "You will have to get it"—he said "Why?"—I said "The horse does not suit me, it won't do my work and I must trouble you to hand over the money"—he said he could only give me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was all he had in his pocket, and he would give me that—I said that would not do, he would have to find the whole 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I threatened to give him into custody, and he said it was no good, no policeman would take him as it was only a debt—I <hi rend="italic">sort</hi> my man for a policeman and when he came I said "I give this man, Mr. Conolly, into your custody"—he said "It is not Conolly, his name is King-well, I know him well"—the prisoner said would I give him a little time to see if he could get the money and his man went away and said he had scraped together 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., would I take that and he would pay the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at some future time—I would not take that and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not prepared to treat this as a debt at any time—I <hi rend="italic">let</hi> the man go to try and get the money—I should have had nothing to complain of if he had returned the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know that the horse is now being driven and goes admirably well—my carman has been in my employment some years—it was an ordinary brick cart he was put into and an ordinary brick cart collar—I don't know much about horses—I never bought a cart horse before—I think I could tell you a place where you could get a good serviceable horse for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know whether I mentioned before the Magistrate or not that the constable said he knew the prisoner's name was Kingwell.

               <p>begged the policeman not to take him till he had time to get the money—I don't think I said "You shall have ten minutes to get the money"—I did not take my watch out—we waited some time—he asked us to wait till his man came back—I did not see Mr. Tanner on that occasion—he was not present to the best of my knowledge—if the horse suited me I was to have him on trial for a week—he said "You need not be afraid, take the horse and try it for a few days, and if it does not suit you, you shall have your money back"—it was taken back on the Tuesday morning to Charlotte Mews—there are several stables there—I did not say if the horse had not been a <hi rend="italic">jibber</hi> I would have kept it—it was not strong enough to suit me whether it <hi rend="italic">jibbed</hi> or not—if it had been strong enough I think I should have kept it.</p>

On the evening of 21st October, from information I received I went to Gravel Lane—I there saw a van standing before the prisoner Howe's shop, No. 117; he is a retail coal dealer—Sutton and Feasey were there, and Howe was inside his shop—the name of "Rickett, Smith &amp; Co." was on both sides of the van and in front, in large letters, and the prices of the coal, 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I passed again Feasey was in the act of shooting some sacks of coals into a compartment in Howe's shop—at that time I saw two or three sacks in the van—Sutton was standing at the tail of the van shifting them—I went back into Houndsditch, which was about fifty yards, to get the assistance of a man in uniform—I then returned to the shop—Sutton was then in the act of lifting the sacks from the ground into the van—after speaking to him I asked Howe whether he had got any invoice—he said "No, I never ordered the coals; the man asked me to buy them. I was going to give him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them; I can buy the same coals for 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said "It is very singular that you should buy of a man in the street for 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when you can get them for 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the usual way"—I then left Howe and Sutton in the custody of two officers while I went to Fenchurch Street—I asked Sutton in Howe's presence for his delivery book—he gave it me, and I produce it—I pointed out an entry to him of the name of Scott, 17, Fenchurch Street, and asked him what it referred to—he said that he had two tons of coal to deliver there—I went there and saw the housekeeper, and saw four vans outside the door, and from what I stated the housekeeper had the sacks counted in my presence—there were eighty sacks—I then went with the housekeeper into Mr. Scott's office—Jones, White, Feasey, and Lucy presented their delivery books for signature—the housekeeper declined to sign them—they each said that they had delivered their coals—I asked them where the other man was—I did not know Sutton's name at that time—they said they did not know—I after wards took Feasey into custody—at the station that night, when the charge was taken, Howe remarked that he was going to give 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the coals—Sutton replied "Don't talk like that; we offered them to you for <hi rend="italic">ll.</hi>, and you were only going to give us 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and you were afterwards going to make it 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner.</hi>) I was in the service of Messrs. Rickett, Smith, and Co.—I and four others went to Mr. Scott's, in Fenchurch Street, to deliver 10 tons of coals—there were 5 vans with 2 tons in each—I can't say for certain whether White's, or Jones' van delivered first—Lucy's was the third van—I ton was delivered out of his van—Feasy and I took the other ton to Howe's shop—we did not take it without Lucy's permission—we were all together—he was agreeable to have it taken away as well as the others, because he stood at the tail of the van pulling back the coals for the others to take them in—the other men who are not here knew of their being taken away, one of them was the first that proposed it—Feasey and I went trying to sell the coals at different places till we came to Howe's shop—I called Howe out and asked him if he wanted to buy a ton of coals—he said "Yes"—he asked to see them before he bought them—the van stood over in a turning leading to Duke's Place, and he came and jumped on the front wheel of the van and looked at the coals—he asked me how much I wanted for them—I asked him <hi rend="italic">ll.</hi>—he said he would <hi rend="italic">give</hi> us 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I declined taking 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and asked him if he could not make it 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he said he would and we were to bring them over to his shop—Feasey was present—he asked me if it was all right—I said "Yes"—I had brought them from Fenchurch Street, at least me and Feasey had—I called to Feasey, who was with "the horse, and he brought the van over and we began to shoot the coals—the name of Rickett and Smith was on the van and the prices of the coals, 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we were then taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Moore and Prior, wholesale tea and coffee merchants, of Lime Street, City—many years ago the prisoner was in the employ of the prosecutors; he left, and went else where, and about 1st February, 1873, he returned to the employ, and was made warehouseman, at a salary of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he was afterwards moved into the office—he conducted himself with great propriety—a vacancy occurred in the traveller's department, and he was appointed to that vacancy about the middle of April—his first journey was made about 23rd April; he commenced that duty at a salary of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and seven guineas a week for expenses; he was afterwards advanced to 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, at the end of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187411230015"/>
               <p>the year—I had to make arrangements with the travellers—the arrangement I made with the prisoner was that he should return a full account of all monies be received daily, names, and amounts, at night by post, with any orders that he might take—he was to remit every night as nearly as pos sible—he was, from time to time, supplied from the office in London with the names of customers from whom accounts were owing—among other customers were Mr. Heath and Mr. Argyle, of Great Yarmouth, and Mr. Hickman—prior to Saturday, 26th September, a letter was sent to him—he came up on 26th September—I asked him if he was prepared with a statement of his accounts—he said "I shall be directly"—I left him and went into the office; he followed me in and asked me how much I made his salary due to him—I told him I made it 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he went into the sale room to check the amount—it was the practice to pay him his salary monthly, and it had been regularly paid—his travelling expenses were paid weekly every Saturday, remitted by cheque; he said to me "You had better give me my cheque for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—I said "No, I can't give you your cheque, give me your account first"—he said "I' am not prepared to pay you the full balance unless you hand me over my cheque"—I think he had shown me an account of monies received by him at that time; it is attached to the deposition; this is it—it is headed "W. F. Seobie, 19th September, 1874," and the total brought out is 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he had 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and that would balance it with the wages, which it would—I then said "I have an I O U here for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. lent you by Mr. Prior; you had better pay that; are you prepared to pay it?"—he said "No, I can't do it"—I said "Under the circumstances, you had better have some conversation with the firm, both members of the firm being on the premises at the time"—he saw them, and I saw no more of him that day—on Monday, the 28th, he attended at the premises again—he said "Well, I think, upon consideration, I had better pay that I O U of Mr. Prior's; are you prepared to receive it in full settlement; if I pay that can you give me my discharge"—I said "No, I can't, because you have not paid me the full amount, deducting is not paying"—he' paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said it must be left <hi rend="italic">to the</hi> firm," and it was left, the partners were then away—on the Friday following I went down to Slough and gave him into custody—he has never accounted to me for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., received from Mr. Heath and Mr. Argyle on 22nd August, or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Hickman—Mr. Hickman's name, with the amount, was forwarded to him on 12th September for collection—the prisoner has written against it "not due."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found him at home at Slough—I did not know at that time that he was in the employ of Messrs. Wyatt &amp; Edwards, of 66, Mark Lane—I know it now—they are in the same line of business as the prosecutor—there was a disputed claim between me and the prisoner upon what are called fictitious orders—they are orders returned by the traveller, not given to him by a customer—if there had been profits they would be divided between the firm and the traveller, if he was a commission traveller—the prisoner made a claim for it—I wanted to charge him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound on some of those fictitious orders—he had a verbal agreement with the firm—I did not make it with him, and was not present when it was made—I told him I thought he had better pay the claim on the fictitious orders before I paid him his salary—he said he would not do anything of the kind, because he considered the money was due to him—I have said when I was examined before that I felt that the claim was a little doubtful—I</p>

               <p>have known him about thirteen or fourteen years, or perhaps more—I have written to him—I did not call upon him for an explanation of these accounts from the Monday till I gave him into custody—I had not had any quarrel with him—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing—I do not consider that my master was getting childish, or that I am sometimes inclined to use the cane to him, or that I would have done so long ago but for the consolation of knowing that he could not last long, and that he was a regular old humbug—I am not aware that I have expressed myself in that way—about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has passed through the prisoner's hands in the fifteen months—I don't think he collected on an average from thirteen towns in a week—I would not say he did not—the whole of his defalcations amount to about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This list represents the various towns he collected from, and the amounts of each—he sent up remittances from time to time—I had no idea he was in Wyatt &amp; Edwards' employ at the time 1 gave him into custody—I know now that he was not actually in their employ, but waiting subject to references being given—the fictitious orders were sent up by the prisoner from the country—as far as I could judge at that time, they were orders that had been given by persons—in some cases goods were supplied on the faith of those orders—the goods were returned to us in all the instances, after an interval of over a week—we claimed from the prisoner for the loss of profit—the prisoner did not claim anything from us for those orders—he disputed the firm being entitled to anything from him—I did not make any claim from him on the 29th for that—I asked him for it; it was not in the account at all—I considered the account a little doubtful, and I did not press it.</p>

I am a surgeon, at 4, High Street, Bloomsbury—on Tuesday morning, 10th November, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I went to the police-station in George Street, St. Giles's, and found Flynn there—he had lost a great deal of blood; his coat was cut on the shoulder, but there was no wound on his flesh there—on the left fore arm there was a deep punctured wound, with an enormous quantity of blood infused into the cellular tissue of the arm; the nerve, I judge, to have been divided, because the fingers were and are now paralyzed, and I think will remain so permanently—I judge that an artery was cut by the effusion of blood into the fore arm and the extensor muscle of the fore arm—this knife is the sort of instrument by which it could be done—there was a stain of blood on it</p>

I am a sub-warder at the House of Detention—the prisoner was committed on a warrant to the House of Detention on a charge of assault—on the morning of Tuesday, 26th October, I went to the refractory cell where he had been placed; that is a cell used by persons who are guilty of insubordinate conduct—I went with Principal Warder Cape to take some clothes to that cell—the clothes are always taken out of the cells at night and given to the prisoner the first thing in the morning—the prisoner asked what the clothes were for and we told him to put on, and he said he would put no more b——clothes on in that place—Cape said "Very well, take the bed out Godfrey"—I went to take the bed out and he struck Cape in the mouth—I went to Cape's assistance, and the prisoner turned round on me and caught me by the whiskers and struck me several times over the face and we fell down—while I was trying to get my whiskers from his hand he bit me on the thumb—we went for the assistance of other officers and when we got back the prisoner had broken up the bed and smashed the window, and he swore he would break the head of the first man who entered the cell—he was secured and put under restraint—he had got a portion of the bed in his hand—I had to go under Dr. Smiles for the bite in my thumb—I suffered pain for about a fortnight or three weeks all up the arm.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> With the exception of my lady friend, and one other young lady, everybody on the platform were strangers to me—there was a crowd on the platform—the other man had a black suit on, a short coat, and round hat—I said "You have my purse with a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in it"—I said that to both of them, and the other man said "I have not it"—the whole matter occupied a very few seconds—from the time I first saw my bag open till I saw the prisoner in custody, would be about five minutes—I saw the prisoner in the custody of the police inspector afterwards.</p>

                  </hi> I have worked for you for about three years—I made some pleating machines for Mr. Gilliland—I believe there was a lawsuit</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187411230029"/>
               <p>about the infringement of the patent and Mr. Gilliland had to pay something, and was served with an injunction—you were served with a paper to attend—I believe you made some more machines for Mr. Gilliland after that, as far as I recollect—I can't say how many he ordered—I believe he had two or three and a part of one he bought—about two months ago you came home and told me you had got an order for another machine for Mr. Gilliland—that would be five machines and a part of one that you sold him—before you came to the City you did a little stove and gas fitting and lock picking—you have done a good deal of lock picking—men have come in when I have been there and they have waited an hour for you to go and pick them, and on one occasion there was a key broken at Mr. Gilliland's and you had to go and pick that lock—I don't know what the understanding was between you and Mr. Gilliand when you made the second machines after the injunction was filed—they were only parts of machines, what are commonly called <hi rend="italic">duffers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in a long defence, complained that the. prosecutor had induced Mm to make some machines for him which were an infringemnt of a patent, and that afterwards he asked him to make four more to substitute for the patent ones, knowing at the time there was an injunction against him; he afterwards refused to have one of those machines, and it was thrown upon his hands;. that the only reason he went on the prosecutor's premises was to destroy the machines, in order to do him an injury, and not with intent to steal. He also stated that the skeleton keys were used by him in his trade as a locksmith.</hi>

               <p>course we must get clean; they were not more dirty than they were obliged to be from their work—I never see them eat opium—I did not eat opium,1 see only one man, not everybody, that was Abdoolah, but I see very little of him after he leave Calcutta—he was not the Serang, he was second boatswain—I have sometimes hit some of the Lascars when the captain gave me orders, but I did it very easy, not hard; the captain made me do it; I did not strike them on the head, sometimes I give him a slap, sometimes I catch hold of a rope and give him a whack on the back side to make him work; that was by the captain's orders, I don't like to hit the people, I strike very easy—I never did it without the captain's orders—the last time I saw the captain strike the deceased with the belaying pin was about two months and a half before we got to London; so far as Cork he hit him, he strike everybody so far as Cork, he hit everybody all the time—the last time I see him hit with the belaying pin was when he was holystoning; that was about three months and a half after we left Akyab—there was a Lascar on board named Ameroodee, a big fellow, he was not called Cassaab,—Cassaab was another man, and Ameroodee was another man—I remember Ameroodee and a lot of us being ordered to wash the decks before we got to the Cape; we wash decks every day, all hands—one day the captain told them to turn to, everybody was gone to work, the mate came and told us to attend to the Serang—at first we refused, the mate come and say "What is the matter? Turn to and go and wash the deck;" at first we did not, and afterwards the captain told the Serang to turn to and wash the deck and everybody has gone to work and did it—we did turn to directly the captain ordered us—I am not Englishman, Sir, I am black man; I can't understand proper English, what I understand I answer, what I don't understand I can't answer—I did not see Ameroodee go up to the captain in a threatening attitude—when he got sick I see him sometimes go for medicine—I did not see him go up to the captain when he was ordered to wash the deck—I see the captain strike him, not at that time, I can't say proper that time he hit him; I did not see what he went for at that time—I can't understand what "threatening" means.</p>

I was second mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Emily Augusta</hi>, and sailed with her on the voyage from Akyab to London—I joined her in Bahia at the Brazils, and went with her from Bahia to Akyab—besides myself, there were on board nine men, Europeans, and two boys, who are here now—at Akyab we shipped a crew of thirty-two or thirty-three' Lascars, I don't know which—Fugeer Ali was one of. them—I observed him when he came on board; he was in good health—after leaving Akyab, about a month, as near as I can remember, I saw the captain beat him with the rope's end, and with his open hand, and sometimes with a wooden belaying pin—he struck him on the head-with the belaying pin, sometimes on the arm, and sometimes on the <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>—they were pretty smart blows—the first time the captain struck him I saw blood come out of his head, all over him—he generally struck him morning and evening, but it was continually kept up; I don't remember how often—we pumped the water out of the vessel every day and every watch at night—one day, about a month before we got home, I saw the captain strike Fugeer Ali three heavy blows one after the other on the head with a wooden belaying pin; the blood came out all over his head and shoulders—I did not overhaul his head—I did not see him use the belaying pin on Fugeer Ali again in this way between the first time and the time just before we got to England<lb/>I can only mention twice that I saw him myself, but I saw him strike him with the rope's" end and his open hand all about his shoulders and head and legs—on one occasion I saw him strike him twice with his open hand on the ears—on coming home one of his ears swelled up a great deal; it was greatly swollen up, and towards the latter end of the <hi rend="italic">voyage</hi>, a month before we got in here, he was not fit for anything—he was not fit to work, he was getting so weak and so unwell; whether he was diseased or not, I do not know—he was always complaining about being unwell.</p>

I never sailed with a Lascar crew before—we had not nasty weather in the bay of Bengal; as near as I can remember, about eight weeks we had hardly any wind—after that, from the Mauritius to the Cape, we had squally, cold weather—she was a large vessel of 1,279 tonnage—she was not a good sailer—we were a little over six months in making the voyage; it is an average voyage of about four months and a half—when I first went on board I did not notice Fugeer Ali particularly, so that I cannot say what his appearance was as regards health—the head of this lot of Lascars was the Serang; his name was Abdul, I believe—it was his duty to keep the men in order under the officers of the vessel—the Lascars are a difficult lot to manage, if you have to go amongst men able to speak no English, and you can't speak the native language—they were a lazy, sleepy lot, and they would sleep. for a week towards the latter end of the voyage, whether blowing or not, but not when they left Akyab—towards the latter end of the voyage they were a dirty lot too; that was after we got in bad weather, two months and a half or a month and a half before we got home; when we wanted</p>

               <p>the most work out of them they were the least inclined to do any—there were great complaints about their filth in their berths—about eight of them used to make their berths filthy, instead of leaving them for natural purposes—there was a great deal of difficulty, in fact it was not possible at times, to make them work—I myself have been obliged to rope's end them; as far as I know I never injured any of them—a decent, orderly crew of eighteen English seamen could have brought this vessel to England—a good many of these Lascars did not understand their work, and a good many of them shipped as able seamen who knew nothing whatever about their duties—two of them were shipped as steersmen, and they could not steer—the captain was a good deal on deck morning and night; it was an anxious kind of voyage to him, with a crew of that kind—I have seen the captain take the wheel myself in bad weather—I can steer, and I have steered the vessel too the first mate, Shurtz, has also steered—I do not know anything of one of the Lascars drawing a knife upon the captain—I saw one of the men who fell overboard draw a wooden belaying pin on the mate one day; the mate was getting the jib out at the time, and he had ordered the man to look after the halyards or one of the ropes; instead of fastening the rope with the belaying pin, which I saw him take from the rail, he hove it off and let go of it—he did no t actually hit the mate, and I believe the mate took the pin away from him—I might have had good reason to complain of Fugeer Ali myself, but I don't remember having done so—I have got him out of his berth for the purpose of doing his work, and directly my back was turned he would be off again—that occurred constantly for about a month before we got to London—I had not to complain of him before that—the captain was a good seaman, and always at his post—we were short of food for about a month and a half, and we were obliged to break into a cargo of rice.</p>

I have been in the merchant service since I was fourteen, I am now thirty—I have sailed with a good many captains—Captain Walters understood his business so far as I could tell, but he did not carry on so as to show that he did—the Lascard were an idle, lazy, dirty set of people—nobody has said that the question whether proceedings would be continued against me would depend upon how I gave my evidence—I do not know whether I shall be prosecuted, and I don't care—I do not suppose it depends in the least upon the mode in which I give my evidence—I did not beat the deceased about the head with a capstan bar, I never handled a capstan bar, and if any man on board the ship say that I lifted one it is a lie—I was not in the habit of doing so daily—I did not strike the deceased on the belly with a belaying pin or on the arm—I never used to strike anybody on board the ship; I never handled one from the time I joined it till I was in London, it is altogether a falsehood—I did not hear the deceased state that I had done so, but I heard the statement read out and he assented to it in my presence, it is entirely a falsehood—I never slapped the deceased's face <hi rend="italic">to my</hi> knowledge, nor did he take up a belaying pin to me, but another man did—I used that other man the same as the rest when they would not do their work; I used to give him the rope's end—I was charged and in the dock for four or five meetings at the Police Court, and afterwards I was taken out and became a witness—I had heard the statement read to the deceased three weeks before that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon practicing in the East India Road—on 19th September I was called to the Stranger's Asiatic Home, and saw the deceased Fugeer Ali—I also saw him next day, Sunday—his general condition was very emaciated and very weak—he had a depression of the bridge of the nose as if the nose was broken, and a scar extending from the top of the head backwards about four inches, the scalp, at the upper end being considerably raised, with a scab on it, and surrounded by dense thickening over an area of an inch in all directions—the wound on the bead was not wholly healed, a scab covered a certain part at the top of the raised portion—the unhealed part was covered by a scab; it was still a wound covered over with a scab; both ears were thickened, and in the left was an abscess which had discharged a little, both matter and blood, but it never emptied itself till two or three days after—it was an ordinary abscess, not very bad; it was about the size of a walnut—the right ear had a scar as well as thickening—I could see no scar on the left ear, but there was an abscess in it—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187411230038"/>
               <p>there were three other scars on the head, one about an inch long, and two others about half that length, quite healed—he had an abrasion on the left leg, and sores on both legs, and both fore arms—they were also healed, except the abrasion I mentioned before—he indicated pain in his belly, which was swollen and distended by fluid—his gums indicated that he was suffering from scurvy, but not badly—that was the only indication of scurvy I saw about him—the wounds and marks on the head and nose could not have been produced by any cause which I could account for except violence—I attribute the condition of the ear to concussion from a blow; a blow from this belaying pin would be sufficient to explain it, and the blows on the head too, except the smaller one—I know no case of abscess arising from poorness of blood and short diet—the smaller wounds were quite healed, and had probably been healed a couple of months—they must have been the result of blows—supposing the abscess to have been produced by a blow, I cannot form any judgment as to how long before the blow was given—it had discharged, from time to time, before I saw it, so that it had emptied itself and re-filled, but repeated blows would keep it alive—the large wound on the head had none of the character of an old scar, but I feel it impossible to put a date to it—he was in great danger the first two days I saw him from extreme exhaustion—I attended him day by day from his admission, and did everything I could for him, but he died on 5th October—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on 6th October, but discovered no other marks of violence than those I saw during life—he bad dropsy of the bladder, resulting from chronic disease of the liver—he had also evidence of old peritonitis and enlargement of spleen, which attends that same disease of the liver—under the scab on the scalp I found a channel or <hi rend="italic">sinus</hi> leading down to the covering of the bone, and around the opening the thickened fibrous remains of an injury—the contusion around accounted for the thickening which was noticed prior to the death—there was not much cutting about the face—when the scalp was cut into a copious discharge of serum escaped, that was the result of the attack of erysipelas on 30th September, which arose from the abscess and the wound in the left ear—the immediate cause of death was erysipelas—the brain and its membranes were perfectly healthy—the spleen was very much enlarged, some blood was effused into its structure, and its surface adhered to the walls of the abdomen from peritonitis, which is a common consequence of disease of the liver—the right lung was closely adhering to the lining of the chest; the lungs were in a similar condition to the scalp, and there was some bronchitis—there was no contagious disease, but there was a discharge of matter from the scalp which might produce disease in another person—assuming that the abscess was caused by the wound on the head which was caused by a blow, and the erysipelas supervened, I am of opinion that the death was caused by the blow received—that would be the more likely looking at the state of health in which I believed him to be—the discharge from the abscess would be weakening to a very slight degree—wounds on the head bleed profusely, and would therefore further weaken a patient.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. My opinion is, that the abscess in the ear was the proximate cause of death; that is, that it brought on erysipelas, which produced death; that is my calm medical opinion—I know no natural cause calculated to produce an abscess in that part of the ear—the construction of the ear is exceedingly delicate, but the abscess was in the part external to the head, not in the part run<lb/>ning</p>

               <p>in towards the brain—there must have been some irritant cause to have produced it—I think it quite probable that a sting from some poisonous insect might do it, but I never saw it—any violent irritant, whether a blow or otherwise, might bring on an abscess in that part—the structure of the liver was wholly altered; it was what in this country is called a gin-drinker's liver, but in Scotland whiskey gets the credit of it—it would not be produced by opium; it must be some alcoholic drink—a man could not work on long with such a liver as that, and there was adhesion of one side of the lungs—the peritonitis indicated that there had been inflammation of the peritoneum, the outer coating of the bowels; that must have been over two months before, and it may have been a year before; the symptoms were too vague to enable me to speak—there was no peritonitis then; it was simply the effects—the lungs did not indicate long-continued disease—the state of the stomach did not arise from external injury, but was a consequence of the state of the liver; it must have terminated in death, there is no cure—the disease of the liver may have begun years before, a slight attack gradually subsiding, and fresh mischief supervening—I cannot imagine that he was in a healthy condition when he shipped six months before, but he might appear so—there were no <hi rend="italic">live</hi> vermin on his head, but their eggs existed on his hair, showing that they had been there—his head had not been cleaned.</p>

                  </hi>. I hold a chief mate's certificate—I joined the <hi rend="italic">Emily Augusta</hi> at Akyab on 4th March—she was a British vessel sailing under the English flag and belonged to the port of Liverpool—the prisoner was the captain, Cook was the second mate, and there were two boys named Pyke and Mattison—those were the only Europeans, except the carpenter, who shipped at Calcutta and who was taken sick and did not come home in the vessel—there was a crew of about thirty-three Lascars who were engaged at Calcutta and taken across in a steamer to Akyab, a port in the Bay of Ben<lb/>gal—eighteen Englishmen would have been a sufficient crew for the vessel, but being Lascars we had thirty-three—she was 1,279 tons burden—we sailed from Akyab on 10th March—the crew appeared in good health at starting—Sheik Abdoolah was an able seaman, and in my opinion he was about the best on board the ship as regards seamanship—I did not see anything the matter with him when he first joined—I saw him every day—every man who was shipped to steer the vessel was incapable of doing so; those men are called <hi rend="italic">secunnies</hi>, which is equivalent to quarter-master in England—as not one of them was able to do the duty required, Sheik Abdoolah was put to the wheel—Abdul the <hi rend="italic">Serang</hi>, asked if there was a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187411230040"/>
               <p>man on board who could steer—the <hi rend="italic">Serang</hi> is about the same as boatswain in a white crew; he spoke very little English—he recommended Abdoolah to be put to the wheel to steer about fourteen days or three weeks after leaving Akyab—Sheik Abdoolah could steer a little, but not very well, he did not know the English letters on the compass—when he had been at the wheel a few days he was ill and refused to go there when he was told by the chief mate—he said that he did not sign to do that duty, he was no <hi rend="italic">secunnie</hi>, and declined going there, and the captain called him up on the poop and made him go there; he hit him a slap with his hand and sent him aft in a hurry and he then went to the wheel and stopped there—the <hi rend="italic">secunnies</hi> for steering get more pay than the seamen—Sheik Abdoolah died in the beginning of June; I can't remember the date—I have seen the captain hit him over the head, arms, and legs with anything that be to hand, sometimes a rope's end and sometimes a piece of leather which used to be there, which came off a sail; it was about a fathom long, and I have seen him use a belaying pin several times—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—I have seen him strike him with it on the head and arm and on two occasions I have seen him strike him on the head with a belaying pin and the blood used to flow from the wound—that was three weeks or more before he died—he also struck him with the belaying pin on the left arm while he was at the wheel—it had no effect on his arm at the time, but the same arm was swollen at the time of his death from the wrist up to the shoulder—the captain frequently struck him with the leather about the shoulders and back—after the leather came off the sail it used to be used almost every day on the deceased while at the wheel—it was about a fathom long and four or five inches wide, it would be hard when it was dry and soft when it was damp—I saw nothing done to him before he was put to the wheel, nor was anything the matter with him, but shortly after he was put to the wheel his ears began to swell—he was at the wheel the day before his death, he was not able to steer very well, but he had to manage, and after he left the wheel he went and turned in—he was very weak at that time and he seemed to be delirious to me, he was in his bunk talking—the captain asked me where he was and I told him, and he told me I should get him out and send him to the wheel—he had been his time, four hours, so he was wanted to go to the wheel again—I said nothing to the captain then about his state, but I went to the deceased and found he was delirious, and I went and told the captain that the man was not right, he seemed to be delirious, but he said nothing—the second mate and me went in and the second mate told the man to come out, but he did not come; he was lying in his bunk in a weak state and would not come, the captain said that he would soon come and get him out, and he came inside and got the man out, and got hold of him and threw him out the door—he picked the man up and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> him out and he fell outside the door—the captain then got a belaying pin and gave him two or three blows about the back and then the man got up and walked aft to the wheel—I did not go after him and I don't know how he got on—he had to stop there till his watch was up, four hours; he had been four hours off, and he went on in the regular turn of duty—on the day of his death he was in the forecastle, the captain asked me where he was and told me to get him out—I went and found him lying in his berth, he seemed to be very-weak; he would not come out and the captain went and hauled him out, and told me to send him to work—he had been making a mat some time previously, and he told me to set him to work to finish</p>

               <p>it—that was about 11 o'clock in the forenoon, or half-past—he had not been at the wheel, I am certain, since 8 o'clock that morning—I sent him to make the mat, and left him there—he could not use his left arm, and said that he could not work at the mat—when the captain told him to make the mat, he said that he could not use one arm, and I left him there, sitting by the side of the mat; whether he <hi rend="italic">done</hi> anything I don't know, I walked away—I next saw him after I came out from dinner, about 1 o'clock, tied up to the windlass bit—the windlass is horizontal, and there is a hitch on each side, and round that the rope was tied and round the man's body and under his arms, and one of the crew was throwing water on him—he seemed to be insensible, and the captain told me to cast him adrift, which I did, and he slid down on the deck as I was slacking away the rope, and appeared senseless—he was alive—I left him on the deck, and as I left the captain said he thought the man had had opium—I said it would be well to leave. him alone for a couple of hours, and if he had any he would be all right after he had had a good sleep—I went about my work, and about an hour after, as I was working at the fore rigging, a man said that he was dead—he was lying at the end of a spar—I went and looked at him, and found he was dead, and stretched him along the spar—that was between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon—the captain was told the man was dead, and he told the second mate and me to carry him aft into the cabin—we did so, and stripped him, and rubbed his arms and legs to see if there was any life in him; but there was not, and we were told to take him on deck again—we did so, and the captain told some of the crew to comer and look at him—several of them did so, and he was then sewn up in canvas, and buried—when I rubbed him I noticed his left arm was swollen from the wrist to the shoulder, and the skin was up like a bladder; there was water underneath the blisters on his arm—his ears were rotten; they had been swollen for some time, and had burst open, and out of the wounds was discharging matter and blood—the crown of his head was completely rotten; it was a mass of matter; you could see a few ragged edges of skin—he had a wound under one of his eyes, which he had had for some time, and which had never healed from the time he first got it till he died, and at the time of his death it was discharging a little matter—I did not notice anything else<lb/>next day I said to the captain "I don't half like the way that man died"—he made no answer—I kept the log, and made an entry in it of the death of this man—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he died on Friday, June 5th, 1874—I made that entry on the day he died, and the captain saw it—this is it: "4 p.m., Abdoolah, a Lascar, died suddenly, his ears being festered for six weeks, and several other places about his head; mortifica<lb/>tion set in"—that was my opinion at the time—ten days before we got to Cork, the captain said that he would make an extract of the log he was keeping, and state the way that he and some more of the men died, and have them all sign it, in case there was any difficulty after he arrived in England, and that being a black crew he thought it was necessary to have it done—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was written and read out to the men—I was in the cabin at the time—the men were not all there, there were only two men and the captain and me, one used to interpret what the captain said to the other men—I mean that they came in one at a time and Khalee Khan was interpreter—the captain read what was on the paper and Khalee Khan put his name to it and if he could</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: Extract of official log of ship <hi rend="italic">Emily Augusta</hi>, lat. 29-30 south, long. 40° 40' east. "At this time Sheik Abdoolah, Lascar, died from a disease bearing a close resemblance to that described by medical authority as erysipelas. He had never complained of sickness, and was at the wheel at 4 a.m. of the day of his death, and as usual eat his meals heartily. I had remarked his ears being sore looking and much swelled on his first arrival on board and had sent to the butler, who understands English well, to ask what was the matter with them; some time afterwards they seemed to get worse, and he said he did not know they were sore and it had come of itself. I cut one of them with a lance once, but nothing but black blood come out of it and in a few days it closed up as before. Though he never complained of sickness, I had compelled him to take opening medicine daily for about a week previous to this date, as any little sore he got never seemed to heal, but it was not until examining his body after death that we found the whole of the crown of his head was affected in a similar manner to his ears, the whole surface being apparently quite rotten and was spreading over his limbs and other parts of his body likewise. He was an inveterate opium eater and was caught several times under its influence, we supposed asleep on his feet, and at work asleep at the wheel once. The skin harassed from his face under the eye by the spoke of the wheel knocking against it two months before his death, and that small mark never healed up. He was an inveterate opium eater, and from the evidence of his shipmates his stock was just lately exhausted, which, while its use deadened his feelings of pain, must have fearfully aggravated his disease. He appeared to be under the influence of opium at bis death, for from noon, when called out of bed, he appeared just like a drunken man, sleepy and stupid, and lay down on a spar by the fore rigging, falling into a deep sleep, from which he never awoke, dying without a word, sign, or struggle, though nearly all the ship's company were working near him, setting up rigging at the time.—H. Walters, master; R. Shurtz, first mate; William Cooke, second ditto. The above has been entered in the official log book, and signed as customary, but being surrounded by a crew of Lascars, all of one nation and language, and manners different to my own, and holding the prejudices naturally arising from such, I had deemed it advisable and prudent that a kind of inquest should be held, examining the crew as to their knowledge of his sickness and the cause of his death, that each one may subscribe to his own evidence at once in the presence of one of their own class, who speaks English well, and acts as interpreter, and my officers who act as witnesses. The following men were questioned, and replied as follows': Abdool Rahoman—'I first met Sheik Abdoolah on board a steamboat coming from Calcutta to Akyab. I noticed his ears bad; one swelled up much when he first came on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Emily Augusta.</hi> He never told me he was sick. I saw him eat his meals every day, and always about the same quantity, until he died. I saw him after his death; his head was all rotten, and ears had little maggots in them. His head was always covered up before he died, and I did not notice it so before.' Ameboodee (<hi rend="italic">Lascar</hi>)—' I first saw Sheik Abdoolah on the passage at Akyab, and noticed his ear swelled up on board the steamboat.

On board he afterwards told me he was in Calcutta for two months before he came here, and had been treated with medicine by the doctor without any good effect, and he did not think he would ever get better.

I noticed one of his ears swelled up then, but did not speak to him. I spoke to him once about his ears on board the ship, but he gave no answer. I saw a mark on his face, which he said he got by nodding asleep at the wheel; the wheel turned round and struck him in the face. It was about six weeks before he died; it never got any better. I saw it when he was dead. I noticed his head; the crown of it was all rotten.

I did not know it before; he never complained to me, and always had his head covered up when I saw him. I saw him when called out of bed after dinner (one o'clock); he was like a drunken man, first lay down on deck and would not get up, afterwards saw him get up and go to the spar and lie down and thought he had fallen asleep.

I saw him eat his meals every day; he had breakfast the day he died. He gradually got his ears larger, and marks about his skin never healed up. I saw him when he was called at 1 o'clock, he had been below from 8 o'clock; when he came on deck he was like a drunken man staggering, and then lay down on deck and would not get up when spoken to.

He was a great opium-eater, and took mine, and was buying all he could get from everyone.

After he got aboard this ship 1 noticed his two ears both get larger and worse every day. I saw the captain take him from the wheel below in the cabin once to cut his ear; he came back again to the wheel with something on his ear, or a white cloth, which the captain had given to him. When his opium was finished he complained of being sick, and after that he got more from the other men in the forecastle, and then he was satisfied. I was in the mizen rigging at work when the captain dressed his ear. I saw him when he was dead, but was in the rigging before that, when he was called out of the forecastle.

               <p>and then he went aft, and in one or two minutes Abdoolah sat down on bus backside close to a spar drawing himself along, crawling as far as from here to that table, and when he got to the spar he laid down like that to die—after that I was working in the fore rigging, and what time he die I see him, and I said to the chief mate "Go and see," and he looked himself, and he saw he was die—the captain told the mate to carry him away, but I do not know what they did, and after that they fetched him on deck again close to the fore brace, and he had a broken head in three or four places, and bus nose also—the captain said "You see that;" I said "Yes, that is all I see, sir"—Before we got to Cork I went into the captain's cabin, and he said "Khallee Khan make him understand, that man"—he said "What I write on the paper make him understand, that man"—the men came in one by one, and he told me to make them understand "what he read—he read one book, a log book, and I make him understand, and when I did not understand I said nothing—I spoke Hindostanee to him—I did not under-stand all the captain said, but what I understood I spoke to that man, and what I did not understand I said nothing—seven or eight men came up altogether, not together, but one after one—I did not sign the paper my<lb/>self, but the <hi rend="italic">Burra Tindal</hi> signed for me—the same thing took place with each of the seven or eight men who were called in; the captain spoke to them, and I spoke to them in Hindostanee—when we got close to Cork the captain said to me "We are going to London, do not go to a Magistrate, and I will give you fifty-eight rupees"—a rupee is about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was before the men were called in—Abdoolah had one shirt with blood, and I kept it in my chest with Mahomed the Serang's shirt—I went ashore, and when I came back I could not find it—I don't know when the captain opened the chest.</p>

You won't sign," and he hit me over the head and made the blood run out—then he said "<hi rend="italic">Go</hi> forward and clean yourself and come into the cabin," and I went into the cabin, and he ordered me to sign a paper—I said "What paper am I to sign, how can I sign a paper that I don't know"—the captain held a pistol to me and said "If you don't sign I will make you sign," and I signed in fear of my life—I signed at the same time several other men's names, three or four I think, besides my own (<hi rend="italic">looking at the paper</hi>), as many as there are on this paper, those are all my writing—this "Abdul Tindal" is my signature, that is the deposi<lb/>tion before Khallee Khan's—I know nothing about what is written here, all I was told was to sign the paper, I know nothing about it except that I signed it.

                  </hi>—I am an accountant having offices at 27, King Street, Cheapside—I am instructed by Mr. Smart to manage an estate in which a public house, the "Shakespeare," in Wheat-sheaf Alley, is in<lb/>cluded—I hired the prisoner on the 27th June—he commenced his work about the beginning of July—I did not at that time give him instructions as to the management of the house—I had a barmaid then—I subsequently discharged her, and made another hiring with the prisoner as barman and. cellarman, at a salary of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week, with his board—the bar and cellar were entirely under his management—he had a lad to assist him, but I told him he would be responsible for everything, that he was to be careful in keeping the cellar door locked that led from the bar to the cellar, and</p>

               <p>that in consequence of the accounts of the barmaid not being correct, I should have the till made to lock up, and that all the money he received was to be placed in the till, with the exception of what he took for wine and cigars, those being small items, he was to put that by separately, and he would have a sovereign in change, and to purchase any little things that might be re<lb/>quisite for the purposes of the business, and such disbursements he was to enter in a book, and produce vouchers for the same, and the money would be made up to him on the following morning from the money in the till, so that he might always have a sovereign intact each day—he said he could not obtain vouchers for everything, but he did for a great many—he was not to pay for anything, according to instructions, without a receipt—I used to open the till and take the money for the first month—I used to go every morning to the bar, open the till, and take an account of the money, and enter the receipts in the prisoner's book, and deduct from those receipts any expenditure he may have made, and then from the till money make good the amount he had spent, and replace the sovereign—when I discontinued doing this I put a clerk of mine named Howse in my place—on Saturday, the 31st October, I communicated with a detective named Lythel—I did not see him markthe money—on the Tuesday, 3rd November, Lythel called at my office—I went to Bow Lane Police-station to see Lythel—I did not go down to the house with him—the prisoner was usually paid his wages on a Monday morning—during the month I had charge of the bar, I allowed him to pay himself on Sunday out of the sovereign, thinking he might want the money, and made it good on the Monday morning—I gave instructions to Howse.</p>

               <p>present at the Police Court and heard James Pope, employed by Messrs.

I live at 19, Lombard Street, Mile End New Town, and am a stableman—the prisoner had been lodging with me, and was so still, up to the 26th October last—that night my wife, self, and children went to bed at about 11 o'clock, at which time all was safe and right—about midnight I was aroused, and found my sitting-room on fire; the Venetian blind and work-table were burning—the sitting-room was the ground floor back—there was a wainscot partition between the passage and the back room—we put the fire out with the help of two young men—the prisoner's room was at the top, and when we went there we found the sheet, bed, and everything burnt—the prisoner was not then in the house—he did not sleep there that night—we worked at the same place—I have heard since that there was some ill-feeling between the prisoner and my wife—she is here—the prisoner had a key, and could let himself in at once <hi rend="italic"/>; there was a candle in his room upstairs—there were no matches up there—the prisoner would have to pass the partition in coming into the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Finchley and am a clerk in the Bank of England—on Sunday morning, 1st November, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was in St. Paul's Road, Highbury, going to a friend's house in Dalston—I met the three prisoners there—at that time I had a parcel in my hand—the prisoners stopped me as I was running along by pushing up against me—I am sure Rust was one of them and I think Booth was the next man to him—when they pushed against me I turned and wanted to know what they meant by it—they commenced insulting me and asked if I wanted to fight—I told them I should be very happy to knock them down if they wished it, and after a few more words I crossed over to the' cabman and asked him if he would hold my parcel for me—the cabman refused and I went back to where the prisoners were on the pavement—Rust was taking off his coat and Booth and Coomb pushed me-about and then I received a blow in the chest, I believe from Booth as he was nearest to me—it sent me into the road—I went back on to the pavement again and they asked me jeeringly to go home—I turned to go home and they all! ran up St. Paul's Road towards Islington—I felt in my pocket to see if' my watch was there and found it was gone—I ran after the prisoners—I believe I called out "Stop you villains" or something of that sort—I over-took Booth—he had not gone more than 20 or 30 yards—I threw him down and I saw the cabman driving after the others—they were brought back shortly after by the cabman and a policeman to where I was with Booth—Booth said if I would let him get up and not strangle him he could tell me all about it—that was before the others were brought back—when they came back Booth said that the watch was in the garden, he had thrown it away in the garden—after that I went to the station and charged them there—I saw my watch on the following Monday at the Police Court in the hands of the police—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

                  </hi>. During 1871, 1872, and 1873, I was employed as porter by Mr. Brock at 28, Noble Street—Vyse had a room there on the second floor front—I know both the defendants—I went on duty about 7.15 in the morning, and remained till 6, and sometimes 7, and sometimes 9 o'clock in the evening; it depends upon whether we were busy or not—I saw Judd there sometimes—I have been there when goods and parcels have been brought by the railway vans—Vyse &amp; Co.'s office was not always open—I have known goods arrive when the office has not been open, and they were then placed on one side till Judd came, and then they were taken in by him—I have seen goods unpacked and taken upstairs, and I have seen goods go away again—a man came with a truck, and took them away—I did not know the man; he came with Judd—it was not always the same man—it was not the same man twice to my knowledge—the men were brought there by Judd—sometimes the goods were taken away in an hour, or an hour and a half, or two hours after they were brought by the vans—I never had any conversation with Judd as to where the goods were going—Jndd was most frequently at the place of business—on one occasion he left me an order to authorize me to take in goods when the carman came and he was not there—this is it: "To-Chaplin <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> Horne, from Vyse &amp; Co., to the carman; please leave the truss for us with bearer, who will sign for it on our behalf"—sometimes Vyse has been absent from the place of busi<lb/>ness for three weeks or a month; I have not seen him sometimes <hi rend="italic">fox</hi> that time, and Judd has been there while he was away—I have seen the door locked when people have come there and left a memorandum or message in the box, and I have heard someone inside, but I did not know who it was—there has been a paper on the door when I heard somebody inside.</p>

                  </hi>. I was master of the <hi rend="italic">Satsuma</hi> on her last voyage from Cardiff to Table Bay—she is a British ship, her owner is W. R. Abbey, of Knaresboro', she hails from Sunderland, her register is 355—on 13th December last she sailed from Cardiff with coals on a voyage to Table Bay—the crew consisted of twelve, all told—Richard Jewell was the chief mate, James Willey the steward, William Jones an able seaman, the prisoner who went by the name of Anderson, Robert Nelson the cook, Prospero Beltram an able seaman, and Richards second mate—Willey, Jones, Anderson, Nelson, and Beltram were engaged in this transaction—on the voyage, about 20th January, information was given me by William Dunn, able seaman, that Willey was wasting the ship's stores—I spoke to Willey about it and told him I should have him punished for it at the Cape—some time previous to that the prisoner had thrown overboard a dog belonging to the ship, and I called him aft and told him I should have him punished on our arrival at the Cape—he said the dog had come into the berth and eaten his food—I don't know whether that was so or not—Jones and Beltram had been disrated before this; they were not fit for able seaman's duty, not even fit for ordinary seaman's duty, useless, fellows—nothing more transpired until the morning in question, everything was quiet and right—on the morning of 29th January we were in latitude 31.8 South, longitude 23.38 West, we had passed the island of Trinidad a few days before—we had got about four days' sail from Trinidad and were about 1,000 miles from the nearest mainland—I went to bed at my usual hour that night and everything was as I believed calm and proper—at 5 o'clock in the morning Anderson, Willey, and Jones were in my berth; when I awoke hearing a noise in my berth I raised my head, which was hardly clear of the pillow when a rope with a slip noose was put over it and hauled tight; that was done by Jones—I turned round and saw him, it was a small newly-tarred rope, it sunk into my neck, it was a splice, not a knot, a noose, it would cut your head off if it was hauled tight enough; I felt it hauled tight—Willey had a revolver pointed at my face and the prisoner had a small hatchet belonging to the vessel—I made a dash at them and burst through them, endeavouring to get to Jewell the mate's cabin for assistance—his berth was in the fore cabin—my berth was in the after cabin; there was a communication between the two, down below and I tried to get by that communication forward to his cabin—I was struggling all the way, dragging Jones who had hold of the rope round my neck all the time—before I got to the mate's cabin I received three or four, I could not exactly say how many, blows from the prisoner with the hatchet, cutting my head open and covering my head with blool—Jones was tugging at</p>

               <p>the rope all this time, it was still round my neck—I cried out for help to the the second mate knowing that it was his watch, and one of them I am not sure which replied 1" He is all right," which led me to believe that he was over-board or killed; I got no answer from him—the chief mate heard the noise and sprang out of his berth to my assistance; he warded off several blows aimed at me by the prisoner—Willey was still there with the revolver, threatening all the time, but he did not fire then—I was almost exhausted when I arrived at the chief mate's cabin—I was covered with blood, and nearly suffocated, I could hardly breathe—I made a rush at the companion, the staircase up to the deck, and dragged Jones with me, who had hold of the rope round my neck all the time; the other men followed up after—when I got on deck Beltram was at the wheel steering, it was his watch—I asked him to render assist<lb/>ance; he would not—there was a good deal of struggling on deck, but I was unconscious for about a quarter of an hour, and hardly knew what took place—the next thing that I remember was some one calling "Look out"—I had cut the rope off before that in the struggle, but I can't say exactly whether it was with a cutlass or an axe that I cut it—I took the axe out of Anderson's hand; the rope lay across the top of the companion, and I cut it that way as far as I remember—I had very great difficulty in taking it off my neck; it was sunk right in—I was struggling on the deck with these three men, the mate was there also; it was then I heard the cry "Look out"—I then saw Anderson with a large handspike uplifted coming down on my head, and I either fell or jumped down the companion stairs, I don't know which, to avoid the blow—I don't know whether the blow missed me—the same blow smashed the top of the companion, the wood work made of teak; at the same instant a revolver was fired—I turned round and saw the mate lying on the side of the poop deck—I thought he was shot—I went into the after cabin and sat down exhausted—I hardly knew what to do—I was sitting on a chair with my head on, the table covered with blood—the next thing I remember was the sky-light being raised up nearly above my head—I looked up and saw Willey pointing a revolver down into the cabin—I can't say where Anderson was then—Willey said he was going to leave the ship, and asked what boat should he take; but before that, he sent Nelson, the cook, down to hand up six rifles which were in the cabin—Nelson came down and handed them up—I was not then in a condition to resist—I could not do anything; that was be<lb/>fore the mate joined me; I thought I was the only person there free—Willey said "What boat shall we take?"—I said "Take the one on the port side"—we had three boats—the rifles were handed up through the sky-light, and they handed up a quantity of provisions—Willey called down the sky-light "Are you much hurt"—I said I was nearly dead or half dead—he said several times "l am a gentleman, I am a gentleman"—when I said I was half dead he said he was sorry for it, but if I had not struggled so much I should not have been so much hurt, or I should have come better off, or words to that effect—<hi rend="italic">Willey</hi> sat on the sky-light and gave bis orders in a cool and able manner—he gave orders to lower the boat and provisions and called for everything he wanted—I heard him crying out for Dunn, and he said he would hang him at the yard arm before leaving the ship—Dunn was an able seamau, who remained faithful, but where he was I did not know—I begged Willey not to commit murder, and he said he would shed no more blood; it was Dunn who had told me about the wasting of</p>

               <p>the stores—they had a sort of log book written against me, some stuff or other—after this the chief mate called out that the boat was gone, and I went on deck and saw her sailing away about a mile and a half off—I was all covered with blood, consciousness had returned—I found the sails all aback and no one at the wheel—I afterwards missed a number of stores—I am not sure whether the boat had the name of the <hi rend="italic">Satsuma</hi> on her; she was peculiarly painted, I never saw a boat painted in the same way; she was a kind of jolly boat with a lug sail—the five men I have mentioned went in her, the prisoner being one—I had a gun on deck—I found that was spiked when I came on deck, and all my arms were gone—I did not know of the men having a revolver, it was not one belonging to the ship; they had several revolvers, I believe, but not that I knew of until this—there were only seven left on the ship, including myself, and two boys out of that—if a gale of wind had come on and we had been near land, the ship would have been endangered, and the lives, in consequence of the shortness of hands; fortunately we encountered no wind, we had a clear voyage out—they cut away the lashings of the boat, and some of the run<lb/>ning gear of the ship was cut—some time after I heard a voice crying out, which I knew to be that of the second mate—Mr. Jewell released him—I saw Dunn come out of the fore hatch covered with coal dust—we ar<lb/>rived at Table Bay on 23rd February—I had then entirely recovered from my wounds, they had healed up—I still felt giddy and very nervous—I eventually got two hands from a Swedish ship to navigate my ship—I spoke an Australian vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Trevilian</hi>, and the captain came on board and took a copy of my official log of this occurrence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> You did your work on board well enough as a sailor—I did not give you any work that you were not able to do—you did your work like a man as far as I saw; you were treated better than any man I ever saw—I was not on deck at the time you threw the dog overboard, I was in the fore cabin at breakfast when I was told of it—I was not drunk, I never was drunk—I remember the day before New Year's eve—I don't remember the mate trying to jump overboard, or his going into the galley and beating the cook—I was not so confused when you came into my cabin that you had to catch hold of me to make me fast—the thing was done instantaneously, if I had taken time you would have had my head off or I should have been shot—I swear you had a hatchet and Willey a revolver—it was you who struck me and cut my head open and would have killed me, I suppose, had not the mate interfered—I did not threaten to throw you overboard when I heard of the dog being thrown over; I said you ought to be served the same as the dog, but I would wait and punish you at the Cape—the provisions that were wasted were flour, sugar, tea, butter, and others—I know they were taken away, for after Dunn told me I went and looked and found more than a month's stores gone, taken into the forecastle—Dunn told me that he had used some of the stores himself, but he said it was such a shame—I did not go into my cabin and smoke my pipe after this occurrence—the night Dunn told me of the wasting of the stores he brought a book to me, it was full of lies and I threw it overboard; I did not read it; Dunn told me it was a lot of lies—I did not go into the cabin and seize the steward by the throat—I did not on the Saturday before this Sunday go into the forecastle and drag anybody out.</p>

                  </hi>. I was chief officer on board the <hi rend="italic">Satsutma</hi>—she left Cardiff on 13th December—nothing occurred until the 29th Jauua-y—no complaints were made before that—it was the second mate's watch—at 5 o'clock in the morning I was in bed in my cabin—I was awoke by a noise; I looked out and saw the captain covered with blood and struggling with three men, Anderson, Willey, and Jones—Jones had hold of a rope which was round the captain's neck, it was a small piece of rattlin line; he was trying to strangle him—the captain was blue looking and all covered with blood—the prisoner had a hatchet, Willey had a revolver, he was standing by pointing the revolver at the captain—the prisoner had the hatchet over the captain's head making a motion as if he was going to hit him down, but I <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> hold of him and the captain rushed up the companion and I and the rest followed, all three of them; Jones had hold of the rope till he got up—I can hardly tell what then occurred, but the first thing I saw was the prisoner come with a handspike and was going to aim at the captain's head—this was on the poop close by the companion; it is not a flush deck, but a poop, the companion comes up on to the poop—I don't think the handspike hit the captain—I sung out "Look out!" and just at the time the captain fell down, I think, and the handspike broke the top of the compa<lb/>nion and smashed it all to pieces—the captain went down the companion stairs—then somehow or other the prisoner and I got scuffing; he had a revolver in his hand then, sometimes it was-at my head and sometimes it was knocking against me, but he could not discharge it—he had not got the hatchet then; I don't know what had become of it—I was trying to save myself and he threw me down and I lost the revolver somehow—when I came to myself I got up as quickly as I could, seeing I had nobody to take my part I rushed down to the cabin and just as I went clown somebody discharged a shot, I think it was Willey; it flashed past my eyes—after that I went into the cabin to the captain—he was lying with his head on the table exhausted—I whispered to him—Willey, who was at the companion with a revolver pointing down, ordered me away, and said "I know what you and the captain are talking about"—the captain was not able to speak—I then went into my berth and stopped there—I could not see from there—I heard Willey send down Nelson, the cook, to pack up things, all kinds, brandy and whiskey, the boat's sails, and everything they required—they took six rifles first—after a while Willey sung out and asked the captain which boat they should take—the captain said the one on the port side—after a while I heard that they had gone, but they were an hour or more before they went—they asked me for a South Atlantic chart—I said I had not got one, I had one for the Brazil coast—they said that would do, and I passed it out to them—Willey like made game, telling me that I dared not refuse them because they had us in their power—he also asked me for tobacco, pipes, and matches, and they took a bag of bread, tins of preserved meat, and a new log line—when they had gone away I found the second mate down the after hold with his hands and feet strapped together and tied round the body and legs as well—I released him—I think the name of the ship was on the boat which they took away—they took black and white paid, and I missed some paints and brushes after they had left—I cut the, hair off the captain's head and put some sticking plaster on the places, and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> The captain did not kick Beltram about one Saturday morning in the forecastle, he never kicked or touched anybody to my knowledge; he did not tell the men to scrape down the fore-to pmast—I remember George Simmonds being sick—I did not go in to his berth and haul him out; I was not <hi rend="italic">tight</hi>—I never put my hald to one of you, but you pretty well killed me—I never went into the galley and beat the cook—I did not try to jump overboard—you did your work as well as you could; there were many things that I could have done better, you did the work very carelessly—I don't think I ever spoke an uncivil word to one of you while you were on board, I am certain I did not—you had plenty of everything to eat and drink—you were never kept short of anything—I did not on the morning of New Year's eve come to you at the wheel with the steward and ask you what work had been done for a couple of days that I might make up the log—I did not have a cutlass to defend myself on the morning of the mutiny, I never had a cutlass in my hand—I did not see one with the captain, you took us by surprise—I twisted the revolver out of your hand somehow or other, but you threw me on the deck and broke my knuckle over it, and my hand was bad for sir weeks after I got to the Cape, I had to go to a doctor.</p>

               <p>him away to the ship, but Cassin was passing along coming away from the ship, and the prisoner pushed me away and ran and seized hold of Cassin's clothes who said "I don't want to quarrel with you," and tried to get him to go away—they spoke together in the Malay language and I don't know what they said. (<hi rend="italic">The witness spoke Hindoslanee.</hi>) Cassin pulled off his coat and said to the prisoner "You strike first"—he said "No I will not, you strike first," and then Cassin struck him on the head with his open hand, a gentle blow—after that the prisoner drew out his knife, held out his fist, seized Cassin by the hair and struck him with the knife, and in about half a minute he turned round and fell—I went and looked at him and saw a little blood from his temple and the knife sticking in his head just above the ear—I could not see the blade only the handle—I spoke to another sailor and told him to take him—when Cassin fell the prisoner used a very offensive word which it is impossible to put into English.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not a Malay, I came from Deccan—the other three men were Malays and so was Cassin—the prisoner is a native of Siam—I saw the prisoner alone first and I saw Cassin in the middle of the road with his hands on his hips—the prisoner only struck one blow—I had not been to a public-house with him, I only met him in the road and was only with him half an hour—I did not see the knife in the prisoner's hand when he struck, but I saw it in the man's head afterwards—I never saw Malays fight with knives.</p>

On Saturday night, 24th October, I was in North Woolwich Road with Cross—Martin came to me about 11.30 and pointed out the prisoner—I directed Cross to take him, and went with Martin to the Victoria Dock Road, where I found Cassin lying in the road on his back, and the knife still sticking in his head—the blade was completely buried in his head behind his left ear—he was insensible, and appeared quite dead—I sent for Dr. Norris, who took the knife from his head in the road, and removed him to a shed at the back of the Bell and Anchor, which they call a dead house—the doctor examined him in the shed and found he was still breathing—he found a large gash in his left arm also—he dropped a little brandy into his mouth—I went to the station and reported to Inspector White, and the man was removed to Poplar Hospital at about 6 o'clock—I read the charge to the prisoner of feloniously cutting and wounding—he said that he knew nothing about it—I found nothing on him—I measured the knife—it was rather over 4 1/2 inches long, and the tip of the blade was a little turned.</p>

I was house surgeon at Poplar Hospital—at 6 o'clock on Sunday morning, 25th October, Cassin was admitted—he had a stab on his left arm 5 inches deep, and another on his head, just above his left ear—he remained insensible till he died—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the stab on the left arm was 5 inches deep, going upwards—the wound in the head passed through both lobes of the brain, downwards to the base of the skull—I should think it penetrated 4 1/2 inches—this knife would produce it—the wound in the arm was also done by a knife, and a blunt-pointed knife.</p>

               <p>time to close—they went out and I followed them out, and saw the six soldiers all round the woman as though they were trying to take away her nuts—she said "Don't take my nuts away"—one of them said "Who is he?" referring to me, and another said "It is a b——policeman"—Wragg said "Give the b——<hi rend="italic">onions</hi>, kick his b——brains out"—I said "Yes, I am a police-constable, and you ought to be ashamed of yourself to ill-treat that woman at this time of night on a lonely road"—the moment Wragg said "Kick the b——brains out" Duffy seized me, struck me on the side of the head and knocked me down, and the other prisoners all came round and kicked me and struck me with their whips until one of them said "I think we have given the b——enough"—I then got up and picked up this pair of gloves (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which were lying in the road where I was knocked down—I put them in my pocket and one of them saw me and said "'The b——has got our gloves, give the b——<hi rend="italic">coals</hi>, let him have it again," and the whole six of them knocked me down and kicked me again, but I kept the gloves—they went away and I handed the gloves to Traveller, who came up, and I went up to the guard with him; we met the picket on our way with three soldiers in custody, but I don't know who they were—in the middle of the next day I found myself at the hospital with a wound on the back of my head—I was cut and bleeding, my hands were damaged, and I have been off duty ever since—I was in the hospital nine days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the landlord of the Earl of Moira—on 7th November I was in the bar when the house closed—there were five soldiers and one Scots Grey man there—Duffy and Wragg are two of them—the woman went out first, and King last—I closed the door, heard a noise, went upstairs, looked out at a window, and saw Duffy <hi rend="italic">pilch into</hi> the prosecutor—he knocked him about with his fists, and knocked him down; and the others pitched into him when he was down, all but the Scots Grey—King halloaed out "Murder"—I did not notice the woman—I heard Wragg say "Give the b——onions"—he was then about 4 yards from them, and they were <hi rend="italic">pitching into</hi> him—I called out "Leave off," but they would not—I ran down, went out the back way, and over a wall to the guard-room, and as I got over the wall they threw four flint stones at me—when I got over the wall the Scots Grey was at the bottom—the guard-room is 500 or 600 yards off—I fetched the Artillery picket, and as I came back with them we met three of the soldiers, about 500 yards from the public-house—the picket took them in custody; it was Duffy and two other artillerymen—they did not take the Scots Grey; he went across the fields.</p>

I then turned back and went to the Earl Moira. After being there a short time I came out and was going home, and I saw five artillerymen fighting a policeman.

I am attached to the Missing Letter Branch of the General Post Office—on 16th November I addressed a letter to "Mr. John Latrielle, 99, Lorrimore Street, Walworth, Surrey"—I placed ninety postage stamps in that letter and put them in an envelope in the usual way—I sealed it with gum and also with sealing wax—I posted the letter about 12.15 at the South Eastern District Office, having previously drawn the attention of the inspector to the letter—that letter should have been deli<lb/>vered by the prisoner in Lorrimore Street between 2 and 3 o'clock the same afternoon—at that time I went to Mr. Latrielle's house and waited behind the door—about 3 o'clock the prisoner knocked at the door and 1 saw him place some letters in the hands of Mr. Latrielle's sister—I immediately took possession of them—I examined them, but the letter which I had addressed to Mr. Latrielle was not there—I came out into the street shortly after and saw police constable Butler, and after waiting twenty-five minutes I saw the prisoner come down the street—we walked in the direction he was going and followed him home to 24, Cardigan Street, Kennington Lane—I went and knocked at the door—it was immediately opened and I walked in—he was sitting at the table—I said "I think your name is Meads"—he said "Yes"—I said "I am attached to the Post Office; I wish to ask you two or three questions; have you finished your delivery?" <hi rend="italic">V</hi>—he replied "Yes"—I said "Have you delivered the whole of your letters?"—he said "Yes, with the exception of two or three which I can't deliver" he gave me four letters from his breast pocket—Mr. Latrielle's letter was not amongst those—he explained his reasons for the non-delivery of the four letters, the first was an unoccupied house, the next was not known as directed, the third was addressed 49 or 59, Lorrimore Lane and the party was not known at either place, and the fourth one was at Camden Town—I said "A letter addressed to Mr. John Latreille, 99, Lorrimore Street, is missing; do you know any<lb/>thing about it?"—he replied "No"—I said "Have you got it about you?"—he said "No"—I then directed the officer to search him, and I saw him take from his trousers' pocket a pocket handkerchief, and underneath that was the letter which I had been speaking to him about, crumpled up, doubled into three—I said "That is the letter that is missing; how came it in your pocket?"—he said "I don't know; it must have dropped there,—he was then taken into custody—the letter was opened before the magis<lb/>trate, and the stamps were found in it—Mr. Latrielle advertises recipes to</p>

                  </hi>. I am Inspector of letter carriers at the South-Eastern District office—on 16th November I took this letter from the letter box at 12.15—I stamped it with the date stamp at the back, and placed it with about fifty letters, which were tied up and placed in the Walworth letter bag, and that bag was tied up and placed in the Kennington bag, which was tied and sealed—I saw the bag despatched.</p>

I am overseer at the Kennington Branch Post-office—the prisoner was a letter carrier in that office—on the afternoon of the 16th of this month he was on duty for mid-day delivery—he would take the letters out received at the Kennington office at 12.45, and take them out for delivery about 1.15—if he had any letters which he could not deliver, it would be his duty to endorse at the back the reason why he could not dispose of them, and then tie them up together and post them in a pillar box, or take them to a receiving-house for a further trial—he would know that as postman.</p>
