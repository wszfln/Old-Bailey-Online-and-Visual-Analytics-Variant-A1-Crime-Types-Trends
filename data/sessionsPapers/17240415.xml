That he being at work in Mr. Bushel's Yard, saw the Prisoner about the Prosecutor's House, and saw him go in and out, and to come out at last, and go away in a great Hurry; and a little after the Prosecutor came out and complain'd he was robbed, and thereupon seeing a Gentleman riding by, he acquainted him with the Matter, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172404150002"/> desired him to ride after the Prisoner, directing him to the Way he took, but the Gentleman not caring to do it himself, lent him his Horse, and he rode after the Prisoner, and overtook him, but he kept at some Distance from him, fearing he might have Pistols; that then one Whittington came up to his Assistance, and he Dismounting advanced nearer to him, and caught hold of his Collar, and the Prisoner drew out a Tuck out of a Stick he had, and made several Passes at him, which he avoided, defending himself with his Whip, and with it cut the Prisoner across the Face; that then he mounted his Horse again, and rode at a little Distance, and ordered the Prisoner to surrender himself, and also his Tuck, telling him there was a Man had been robb'd, and that he being suspected to have committed the Robbery, they would secure him; that the Prisoner seeing no likelyhood of getting clear of them, pretended he would deliver his Tuck; he ordered him to throw it on the Ground, fearing least if he adventured to take it out of his Hand, he pretending to deliver it up to him, might have stabb'd him with it, he having nothing to defend himself with but a Horse Whip; that at last he did throw it down, and Whittington holding his Horse, he went and apprehended him. That he ask'd him who it was that had robb'd the old Man, and bound him in his Chair; that the Prisoner did not deny the Fact, but took the Money 31 s. and offered to give it them to let him go. - Whittington depos'd, That he hearing a Woman cry out William Zouch is robb'd, pursued, and when he came up within sight of the Prisoner, the former Evidence had got him by the Shoulder, and he attempted to throw Greenbury off from his Horse; that they afterwards apprehended him, as has been before depos'd, and carried him back to near the Prosecutor's House, and the Prisoner would have gone into his House, and offer'd to return the Money to the Prosecutor, but they carried him to an Alehouse; and the Prosecutor said, Give me my Money; and the Prisoner did neither deny his having taken it from him, nor refuse to return it, but they sending for an Officer, secured the Money in his Hands, carried him before the Justice, who committed him to Goal. The Prisoner at the Bar did not absolutely deny the Fact, but pleaded, seeing the Door open, he went in to light a Pipe of Tobacco, and drank 2 or 3 Pints of Cyder, and asking the old Man for Money, he went and fetch'd a pint Pot, in which was 25 Shillings, and lent him; and said, That though he was an old Man he was but a young Thief.

That thereupon she went to Mr. Moses Hart's, to enquire if the Prisoner had been there with the Goods, but was inform'd he had not, and they pitied her for intrusting him with the Goods on those Pretensions, telling her that he was not the Reader of the Synagogue, he having been turn'd out long before. The Prisoner in his Defence pleaded, That he actually bought the Goods of the Prosecutor for 30 l. and design'd to pay for them, but was prevented, in that a certain Person had come to his House, and under pretence of buying the Goods to carry Abroad, had taken the Opportunity to take them away from his House, and pawn'd them for 10 l. and was gone beyond Sea. But being call'd upon by the Court to prove what he said, he had no Witnesses to the Disappointment he pretended; and as to his having actually bought the Goods, that was deny'd by the Prosecutor. He called several Evidences with intent to prove the Prosecutor's having sold him the Goods, but they all appear'd, if true, to be after his having gotten the Goods into his Possession, and had not perform'd the Conditions on which he obtain'd them.
