I was mov'd, and sorry for her; but the People about us bid me carry her back to my Shop, and there she fell down on her Knees, and again ask'd Forgiveness: I told her, she had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050003"/> offended me, and bid her ask Pardon of God; then the Beadle came up, and took her before Mr. De Veil, and so she was brought here.</p>

About three Months ago, - I can't tell the Day of the Month, but it was the Night the great Thunder and Lightning happen'd, about One or Two o'Clock, I heard the old Man cry, - For God's Sake don't murder me! for Christ's Sake don't murder me! Several Times he (thus) cry'd out, but I did not go out of my Room, for she was an obstinate Woman, and used to quarrel with him. I have saved him from her a great many Times. I believe that she was at this time in the Room with him, but I did not hear her Voice, - I did not hear her say one Word to him; and after he had cry'd out (as above) for the Space of a Quarter of an Hour, I heard no more of him, nor did I see him till the Coroner's Jury sat upon him, which was the Night following.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw this Witness at that Time.</p>

               <p>Allen. I was sent for by the Coroner, to give an Account of the Words which I heard the Man speak; and then he was dead, - I am sure he ought to be so, for I never saw a Man so cut in my Life: He had a great Cut quite cross the Calf of his Right Leg, and two Cuts in his Thighs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever see me take up a Knife to my Husband in your Life? But because he was a naughty, bloody Man, have not I hid the Knife in your House?</p>

               <p>Allen. She did bring her Goods to my House, and I bid her carry them back again to her Husband . There was not a more quiet Man on Earth than he was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you let me a Garret, that I might live from him?</p>
               <p>Allen. She asked me what I would have a Week for a Garret; I told her Six pence; and she brought some Goods into it, and she lay in it a little while herself: but the Room in which I heard the Cry was that in which they lived together. She was the wickedest Woman on Earth</p>

            . About Ten o'Clock in the Morning, after the Man was killed, Mr. Mangham, who lodged in the same House with the Prisoner and the Deceased, told me, he believed Mr. Broom was murder'd, and that his Wife had kill'd him; and he desired the Neighbours to open the Door: They did so; and I went up Stairs with them, and found the Deceased lying on his Back, upon the Bed, but his Legs hung down, and his Feet were on the Ground. He was cold and stiff; but his Eyes were open, and he was cut in a very vile Manner. There was a great Cut cross the Calf of his Right Leg, (I think) 'twas almost to the Bone, two great Wounds in his Thigh, several upon his Shoulders, and a Cut across his Belly as if he had had a great Scratch with a large Pin. All his Cloaths were upon him, except his Shirt, and there was no Blood upon him, for he seem'd to have had his Wounds wash'd. The Prisoner was not in the House when we view'd the Body; I saw her go out in the Morning, about Seven, all over bloody, and Mangham was with her, Cheek by Jole. Tho' there was no Blood upon the Deceased, yet there was so much upon the Floor; that as soon as I had stepp'd into the Room; the Blood was over the Sole of my Shoe: The Bolster, the Sheets and the Blankets were likewise all over Blood. This Cap and this Handkerchief I found on the father Side of the Bed, [they both appear'd as if they had been dipped in Blood] I know them to be the Prisoner's, and have seen her wear them. Mangham lodg'd in their House, and at this time there was nobody therein, but Mangham, the Deceased and the Prisoner. The first Witness (Allen) does not live in the same House with them, but at the next Door, and the Head of his Bed stands against their Room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have some Cuts in my Hand which he gave me before I went to Bed; and as to this Witness, - I would not take her Word for a Farthing. She'd swear any one's Life away.</p>

             . I sell old Whalebone in Rag-fair, and had lodged in the House where the Prisoner and Deceased lived about a Month before this happen'd. I lay in the Garret over the Room in which they lay; and that Night he was murder'd, about Three o'Clock, he came up into my Garret , to case himself in my Pot; after which he asked me to let him lie down with me, I told him he might, but in half an Hour the Prisoner came up, and fetch'd him down again, after which I heard no Noise at all. At Six in the Morning I got up and drest me, to go out about my Business, and as I pass'd her Chamber Door, I saw the Prisoner at the Bed's Feet; she had pack'd up her Things to carry them out, and said, she would not stay with her Husband. I went into the Room, and it being Day-light, I saw him cover'd with a Blanket or Rug, but I did not know he was dead. There was a great deal of Blood in the Room, but she told me, she had lost much Blood herself, in a Quarrel (I suppose she meant) with her Husband, and I did not suspect he was dead then, for she said she would not stay to be murder'd, and having packt up her Things in a Bundle, she put them in her Lap, and we both came down Stairs, and I went out with her. She lock'd the Door, and took the Key with her, and when we had got about half an hundred Yards from the House, she gave the Key to me in the Field in the Back-lane. - What Harm is there in that? I was going at that Time about my Business to Rag-fair, and she went that Way with me, but she walked faster than I could, and left me at the Corner of White's-Yard; where I went in for a Pint of Beer, and did not mind which Way the Prisoner went: Then I return'd home, and went up Stairs, and found the Man warmish; he was laid upon the Bed, and cover'd with a Blanket or Rug: He had a black Waistcoat on, and his Eyes and Mouth were open; he was warm, but quite dead. This was about a Quarter of an Hour after the Prisoner and I went out together. I saw no Wounds, for I did not open the Bed, but I came down Stairs again, lock'd the Door, and carry'd the Landlord the Key of the House. As I went down the Alley I met this Woman [ Anderson ] - no, I don't know whether I met her at this Time, or whether I met her before I came back to the House.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Anderson . I saw him go out with the Prisoner, and he then did not speak to me: But when he returned I saw him and spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Mangham . I don't remember what I said to the Neighbours, nor whether I speak to any of them, but a great many of them went up Stairs with me, When I first went up. There were several People saw the Deceas'd, - a great Number, - five or six, besides me and the Landlord. I don't know any of their Names, for I never had any Society with them; but they went upStairs - I said noHarm, - I don't know what I should be afraid for. As to the Deceased, I never saw any Harm by him in my Life.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you no Discourse with the Prisoner as you went along?</p>
               <p>Mangham. I did not ask her any Questions, nor did she say any thing to me .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he knows that I ever took up a Knife, or any thing to do my Husband any Harm.</p>
               <p>Mangham. No, never in my Life.</p>

            : I live at the Head of the Alley, and the Prisoner lived next Door to me, down the Alley. I heard nothing of the Murder, till Mangham came back and brought the Key; but I saw him and the Prisoner go out together about Seven o'Clock in the Morning. Her Left Hand and her Face were bloody, and she had a Bundle in her Lap. I was looking out of my Window, and seeing a Neighbour, I cry'd, Lord how bloody Mother Broom is! I suppose they have been fighting To-night, says she, but if they have, they have been very quiet: For she has beat him out of Doors divers and divers (of) Times, and she has sent him divers Times to a Two-penny Lodging. Mangham did not bring the Key, till about Ten o'Clock; and I was afraid to go up with the People at that time; but I went about an Hour after, with several others, and he then lay strait upon the Bed. He was cut in one Part of his Leg, and had a Cut upon the Calf of the other, and across the Thighs , and three more across his Navel, and was likewise stabbed in the Breast. He was cold, but his Eyes were opens and there was a great deal of Blood in the Room. Mangham was charged in Custody of an Officer, and I went before Justice Jones with him. The Justice asked me, believed he had been concerned? I told him, I believed he was innocent, for he one Speck of Blood upon him.</p>

             . I live underneath the Room that Allen lives in, and my Door when opened, staps against the Prisoner's, in the same Passage ;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050005"/> but in September last, (I don't know the particular Day) between Twelve and One o'Clock at Night heard the Deceased in the Yard, cry, - Susan! Susan! Pray let me in, for I am very cold! The Prisoner looked out of the Window and said, - get away you Rogue, for you have brought no Money; you have been with your Whores. I heard no more 'till about Three; therefore I suppose she let him in; and about Three o'Clock, the Deceased cry'd out Murder! Murder! Murder! For Christ's sake! - What, are you going to kill me! I was in Bed, and my Door fastened against theirs; and by the Cry, I knew it must be the Deceased's Voice, in the Chamber. The last Words which I heard him speak were, - Broom! Broom! for Christ's Sake! for God's Sake! Don't kill me, - don't murder me in this Manner! I am positively sure I heard these Words, Broom! Broom! &amp;c. About Seven o'Clock in the Morning after this, I met the Prisoner and Mangham going out together: She had the same Cloak on then, that she has now, and a Bundle in her Apron, but I saw no Blood upon her, for our Passage is dark. I did not speak to her, nor she to me, - neither good, bad, nor indifferent. Mangham afterwards came back and called out, - Mr. Broom! Mr. Broom! come down and open the Door. But no Answer being made, he desired me to open the Door for him: I said. - Mrs. Broom is a very turbulent Woman, I will not meddle with her Door; and so I went to hang up a Gown to dry in the Yard. When I came back, the Door had been opened, and he ( Mangham ) cry'd - Lord! Lord! Mrs. Broom has killed her Husband, and he lies dead upon the Bed! I ran up Stairs, and found the Room like a Slaughter-house with Blood. The Deceased's Stockings were down: He had his Breeches on, and a dark-coloured Waistcoat, but no Shirt. He was cold as a Stone: His Right-hand was cut; his Eyes wide open; the Calt of his Right-leg was cut, but there was not a Speck of Blood upon him, for he had been washed clean, and there stood a half Tub of Water above Stairs. When I came down Stairs, in the lower Room, by the Side of the Dresser, there lag a Pillow, with a white Pillow-case, sprinkled all over with Blood. This was in the lower Room. The Bolster of the Bed on which the Deceased lay, and the Sheet, were all over with Blood, and were doubled up and thrust a little Way from him; but there was no Blood upon him, nor on his Cloaths, nor were any Cuts in them. There was likewise two Cuts on his Left-hand, two on his Thigh; one a-cross the Belly, like the Scratch of a Pin, and a little Stab under the left Pap , which I believe was an old one. On the Left side there were Marks as if he had been pricket , all black and blue, she was a mighty Woman for carrying a Pen-knife with two Blades, which she valued very much, and said, she had a great Respect for that Knife, and it would do her good Service. When she and her Husband quarrell'd , she used to beat him with the Poker, and say, she would win the Horse, or loose the Saddle. I have often taken her Husband's Part, and then she would call me his Whore.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever see me take up any Edge-Tool, any Scissars, or Knife, to abuse him with?</p>
               <p>Coombes. I have seen her beat him several times with the Poker, and have heard him cry out Murder! She came to Mrs. Birch, about a Month before this Fact was committed, in a desperate Passion and said, This Man won't pay my Rent, - I shall be murdered for him. I have seen her go down the Street with him, and as she has gone along with him, she has beat his Head against a Sash-Window, and broke it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Fye upon you! He went to get a Stick to beat me with; - did he not?</p>

            . I live in West's Gardons , at the End of the Street, in which the Deceased lived. The Prisoner came that Morning to my Shop. about Three o'Clock, for a Farthing Candle: Her Arms and Face were all over Blood, and likewise the Round of her Head. I asked her if her Husband had been beating her? She said, yes, - he had been beating her in the Garden. I said it was a cruel Thing to beat a Woman so. Aye, says she, - I have been married above forty Years, and have had seventeen Children. I saw no Wounds upon her; only a little Punch in her Arm, which had never bled.</p>

            , Surgeon . I saw the Deceased about Twelve o'Clock the same Day. He lay with his Back upon the Bed, and his Feet upon the Ground. He had several Cuts upon his Belly, and about his Thighs; but that which was mortal, was under the Right-calf, for the crural Artery was divided, and the Essusion of Blood must have been so great, that he could not live a Quarter of an Hour. The Blood upon the Floor ran from under that Leg. I believe the Wound was given with a Knife, but it must have been made by more than one or two Essays, because it was much hacked.</p>

I had been in London about a Week after the Murder, and had heard that she was charged with it; and seeing her in Burford , about three Weeks after, I took her before 'Squire London, and there she said, she heard that her Husband was murdered, and there was nothing left for her, tho' she should have gone to see after him. She told me, - he was always quarrelling with her, and she found a Pen-knife in the Bed with him, when she went that Night to Bed. I took her from her Sister's, at The Royal Oak, at Burford .</p>

               <p>Mr. Griffin. I don't know the Prisoner. I was robb'd about Three o'Clock in the Afternoon, on Tuesday the 13th of November, on Hounslow Heath, in the Parish of Heston , of twelve Shillings. I was coming over the Heath in a Chariot; and the Person that robb'd me, came up with a Pistol, and order'd the Chariot to Stop: It was stopp'd accordingly, and the Man demanded my Money and my Gold, and threaten'd to shoot me. The Glass was drawn up, but he swore he would fire through it, if I did not let it down. Upon this I let it down, and he demanded my Money and Gold, - those were the Words. I told him, I did not travel with Gold about me, because I had no Occasion for it, but I had some Silver, and he was welcome to that; so I put four Half-Crowns and two Shillings into his Hand. I could not discover any thing of his Face, because he had either a Mask or a Crape over it. When he had got my Money he went away, and my Servant told some People who came by, that I had been robb'd by one who was just gone before. They pursu'd him, and took a Man; but I am not certain whether he was the Person that robb'd me. I was coming to London, and so the Man was brought to Town likewise, and was carry'd before Colonel De Veil, and I was present when he was examin'd, but he neither deny'd not confess'd the Fact.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire he may be asked, whether he is pretty positive to the Hour?</p>
               <p>Mr. Griffin. I reckon it was about Three o'Clock , or between Three and Four; it was light.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask him, if he had a Watch in his Pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Griffin. I had; but I did not look at it. There was a Gentleman in the Chariot with me at the same time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I ask him, whether he put the Glass down himself, or the Gentleman that was with him?</p>
               <p>Mr. Griffin. The Gentleman who was with me let the Glass down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Just now he said he let the Glass down himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Griffin. He did it by my Order; - there's nothing in that. As to the Horse the Man was upon, I saw nothing but his Head, the rest of his Body was behind the Chariot Wheel.</p>

             . On Tuesday the 13th of November , I was driving my Master over Hounslow-Heath. About Three o'Clock a Man on Horseback stopp'd me; then he went up to the Side of the Chariot, and swore he would shoot through the Glass, if it was not let down. As soon as the Glass was down, he bid my Master deliver his Silver and Gold: He told the Highwayman, he never travel'd with Gold about him, but always with a little Silver to bear his Charges. When he had got what he could, he rode off, and one Mr. Stone coming along on Horseback I told him, my Master had been robb'd , and he got Assistance, and pursu'd and took the Prisoner, but I can't swear to him; I thought he had rode on a bayish Horse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask the Witness, whether he did not tell Colonel De Veil, when we were all before him, that he believed I was not the Man.</p>
               <p>Mascal. I did say, I thought he was not the Man. - I did not see his Face when the Fact was committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I ask him, whether he did not assign two Reasons before Colonel De Veil, why he thought I was not the Man? Whether one was not, - that the Man who robb'd the Chariot had a lighter colour'd Coat; and the other, - that the Man was something taller than I am.</p>
               <p>Mascal. I was so frighted, that I could not tell what colour'd Coat he had on; I said nothing like that, but I took him to be a taller Man than the Prisoner. The Prisoner was carry'd before Colonel De Veil the next Morning.</p>

             . I was coming from London the 13th of November, and about Three o'Clock, between Hounslow and Butcher's Grove, I saw a Chariot stopp'd, and a Man at the Side of it. I kept riding on, and saw the Man (who had been at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050007"/> the Chariot) move off When I came to the Chariot, the Servant said, Sir, we have been robb'd by that Person who is just gone along.

            's Steward at Cranford , and borrowed a loaded Gun, then I went in Pursuit of him again till I came to Uxbridge, and in a Lane near Lord Bolingbroke's Park , I saw a Man off his Horse, making Water, and I believ'd him to be the same Man I had pursu'd on Horseback; but as I was alone, I did not chuse to attack him myself, so I stopp'd my Horse, and turn'd him round, and saw a Man coming to my Assistance with a Blunderbuss. Then we went forward, and the Man fled; we rode very hard after him, but my Assistant's Horse's Bridle happening to break, we were obliged to stop a little, and so the Person we pursu'd got out of our Sight. For some little time we kept on in the straight Road, but not seeing him, we turn'd towards Arlington-Fields , and went down a Lane into an open Field, and there my Companion caught Sight of him again. He (finding himself pursu'd) rode into a Lane that leads to Lord Bolingbroke's Park , but there being a Gentleman's House at the End of the Lane, he turn'd his Horse short, and came up again by the Canal, where he met us full-but, and we were within forty or fifty Yards of him, only there were some Pales and a Ditch with Water between. When he saw us so very near him, he seem'd to be very much surprized, and put his Hand into his Pocket, or Bosom, as if he felt for his Pistol; upon which the Man who was with me bid him stop, or he was a dead Man. I cry'd, - for God's Sake don't shoot him, and then the Prisoner turn'd short again, his Hat sell off, and he rode away without it, through a Place where there were near twenty People grubbing up Wood. We follow'd him, and cry'd, Highwayman! Highwayman! but lost Sight of him again. We hunted after him an Hour; and Night coming on, we gave him over for lost; but as I was making the best of my Way home towards Drayton, in a common Field I stood still a little, to consider which was my nearest Way. While I stood still, a Man halloo'd to me and I saw three Men had got hold of the Prisoner. I am positive the Prisoner is the Man they had seiz'd. When I got up to them, I bid them carry him to a Publick-House, and I think I gave the Constable Charge of him myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would humbly request he may be ask'd, if he is sure I am the Person he had been in Pursuit of?</p>
               <p>Mr. Stone. I can't take upon me to say he is the same Man I pursu'd; for I never was so near him as to see his Face plainly, and his Cape was done up about it. The Horse he rode on was a brown bay Mare or Gelding.</p>

            . I was Servant to my Lord Berkley at Cransord . Mr. Stone came to my Lord's Steward to borrow a Gun, and to ask for Assistance to take a Highwayman. The Steward desired me to follow his Friend Mr. Stone, and assist him. I took a Horse out of the Stable, and a Blunderbuss in my Hand, and overtook Mr. Stone in Lord Bolingbroke's Lane . There we had the Prisoner in Sight, and rode hard after him, but my Horse's Bridle happening to break, I was obliged to clap my Hands round his Neck to stop him a little while, and in the mean time we lost the Prisoner. As soon as we could, we followed him again, and upon Enquiry, we were told he had rode hard down the Lane; so we made after him, and saw him; which he perceiving, made a short Turn, round a Hedge by a Canal, into a Place where there were high Pales, and a Ditch between us, and here we met him. When he saw us coming up to him, he pulled a Pistol out of his Pocket; upon which I presented my Blunderbus at him, and told him, if he did not stand, I would shoot him. He seeing this, turned his Horse short; his Hat sell off, and he made the best of his Way to get off. This was about Three o'Clock. We rode hard after him; he whipp'd, and I whipp'd; but I lost Sight of him near Lord Bolingbroke's. After this we enquired of some People who were grabbing up Roots , if a Man had not rode by, without a Hat? They told us he was just gone past, but I never got fight of him more: For Mr. Stone and I parted soon after: he turned toward Cranford , and I went to Hounslow .</p>

               <p>England. Yes; I am sure he is the Man. I was not very near him, but I was near enough to see some of his Face, when I came up with him against the Pales, but not enough to know it again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why then do you think I am the same Man you pursued?</p>
               <p>England. By his Dress: He had a Surrout Coat and a Hood on it, to pull over his Head, and it was pulled over his Head at that same time; he was a thin young Gentleman, and such he seems<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050008"/> to be now.

            . I saw the Prisoner come riding very hard down a wide common Field (in the Parish of Drayton ) without a Hat. His Horse was very much sweared, and in leaping over a Brook, the Horse and Rider had like to have been down . He turn'd the Corner of the Hedge, and in a Minute's Time I saw him on Foot; then I and two others pursu'd him down a little Lane, over a Hedge, into a Field, where we found him with a Pistol in his Hand, attempting to shoot himself through the Head: I begg'd of him not to shoot himself, and then he turn'd the Point of the Pistol toward me, and snapp'd it; I saw Fire, but it did not go off. I was fearful because of the Pistol, and fell back; but finding he could not make the Pistol go off, I went up to him, and took him with it in his Hand. He told us he would hurt none of us, and said, he was ruin'd and undone, for he had robb'd a Gentleman's Coach. We ask'd him how much he got from the Coach; he told us 12 s. but he had abused nobody, and therefore he begg'd upon his Knees we would let him go. We told him we dar'd not, and took him down the Field with us, and call'd to Mr. Stone. As we were carrying him along, he told us, there was a Man in Pursuit of him, upon a grey Horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stone. I rode after him upon a grey Horse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him, if he is positive I mention'd a grey Horse, and if I did not say 'twas a white Horse.</p>
               <p>Simon. He said it was a Man on a grey Horse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him, whether I surrender'd myself, or whether they took me by Force?</p>
               <p>Simon. At the very Instant that I took hold of him, he said, he would not hurt any of us. This is the Pistol he then had; 'tis in the same Condition as it was at that Time. [The Pistol was unscrew'd, and was loaded with one Ball.]</p>

            . As my Brother and I were coming along Dragon-Feild , at the Corner of the Hedge, we met the Prisoner riding, without a Hat. He rode a great Pace, and came up just against us, frequently looking behind him as he rode. He got over the Brook, and rode round the Corner of a Hedge, and was then out of our Sight. In a small Time he came up a Lane into our View again, and after he had stopp'd a little while, he turn'd round, and went back again. Then we follow'd him, and found his Coat and his Whip in the Lane, but I did not see him quitting his Horse; it was in a Place call'd Holloway-Lane . I saw him run out of the Lane, into the open Field, and I follow'd him thither, with a Stake I had got out of a Hedge: In this Field I saw him stand with a Pistol against his Head; then he put it into his Pocket, and pull'd out another: He made two Attempts to shoot himself. When I came up to him, he said, If you'll use me like a Man, I will surrender to you. We told him, we would not hurt him, and desir'd him to put down his Pistols; one of them he put into his Pocket , and the other he kept in his Hand, which the former Witness took from him. This is the Pistol he had in his Pocket: I took it from thence, and 'tis loaded with one Ball, but there's not above a Corn or two of Powder in the Pan. He fell down on his Knees, and begg'd we would let him go, telling us he was ruin'd, for he had robb'd a Gentleman's Coach upon Hounslow-Heath , of 12 s. and had been pursu'd by a Man upon a grey Horse. As we carry'd him to Drayton , we met Mr. Stone, who search'd him, but found nothing more upon him.</p>

Before my Dismission from his Service, I had Orders to go to Mr. Leak of Denham , to settle an Account between his present Wife and a Gentleman deceased, and I was now going to put the finishing Stroke to them. As to my carrying Pistols, I humbly hope I had some Reason so to do, the Roads being so much infested with Highwaymen, and as I was not of so much Quality as to ride with Holsters, I thought it more decent to carry them in my Pocket. I did not ride from these Gentlemen, till they in a most furious Manner rode after me, nor did I ride fast, till they threaten'd to shoot me; and I rode over common Fields, till I thought I was out of their Hands, but perceiving somebody at a Distance, like the Man who Pursu'd me. I got off my Horse to screen myself from him. The Truth is, I did not confess any thing to these Men, but they have swore thus for Lucre and for the Reward; and as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050009"/> to my offering to shoot myself, that is of a Piece with the rest.</p>

When he has not been employ'd in his Master's Business, I have employ'd him myself, and have observ'd him to be a very industrious young Fellow. He has engross'd Writings for me, (when he has been at Leisure) and has earn'd considerable Sums of Money: He has receiv'd several Sums for me, and likewise upon his Master's Account; the last Money I paid him was I think in July last .

My Brother has been out of Town about two Years and a Half, during which Time he has been intrusted with Affairs of great Consequence, and continu'd to act for him as his Clerk till very lately. My Brother has wrote me Word, that he has Effects in his Chambers to the Value of several Hundred Pounds, and if the Prisoner had been in such Distress as tempted him to illegal Courses, he believes he would sooner have disposed of some of those, than have run this Risque. In Confirmation of his Master's good Opinion of him, he de sired me to supply him with what he wanted in Goal. I have heard his Master often give him a good Character, and have heard him say, he intended to be the making of him. He intended to have been here himself, but some Affairs of Consequence prevented him, and he is at the Distance of 150 Miles from hence.</p>

My Watch was then in my Fob; but a second Man came immediately up on the other Side of me, and the Prisoner and the second Man held me, while a Third took my Watch out of my Fob* . Then they all three ran away, and I cry'd out, Stop Thief! The Prisoner turn'd down Arundel-street , and I pursu'd him till I was out of Breath, and could run no longer, but</p>

The other two got quite away. I am positive the Prisoner was the Man who held me by my left Arm, and I charged him with being an Accomplice as soon as he was taken. Indeed I think he is in some Measure accessary to the Loss of it; and 'tis very hard a Man can't walk the Streets of London, - 'tis a very hard Case. We carry'd the Prisoner before Colonel De Veil, and there he would confess nothing, only he said he had a Being in Rag fair; but when he was at the Roundhouse , he said his Being was in Broad St Giles's. I have advertis'd the Watch, and offer'd twelve Guineas for it again, but have not had it, and as for the Seal, I could not have such a one for two Guineas. In short, he's the Man that laid Hands on me first, and held me till the two others came up; and what could I do? They might have knock'd down three such little Fellows as I am.</p>

            . I have liv'd with the Prisoner ever since last Christmas. He keeps a Lodging-house next Door but two to the Hay field, the upper End of Rag-fair, and he has a Child that I look after in his House. I went to see a Friend, and staid out with the Child all Night at one Mr. James's in Belton street , St. Giles's. The Prisoner came there next Day, to see for us, and between Six and Seven next Evening we were coming home down the Strand, and there being a Crowd of People, he endeavour'd to push along, to make Way for me, and the Child who was asleep in my Arms. I had hold of his Arm at the same time, but I let it go in the Crowd, that he might push through. At the same time I heard a Cry of Stop Thief, and stood still a little while, but having lost the Prisoner in the Crowd, I went home, and next Morning I heard - he was in Trouble.</p>

I did not know the right Way back again, so I enquired of a Watchman, and he bid me keep strait along. It was then very cold, and I had had an Ague and Fever upon me, and began to grow very ill, so I asked the Watchman, where I might have a Glass of Liquor, so he directed me to this House, and the Door being open, I went in - into the lower Room, - a publick Room, and drank a little. Gin there. I intended to have gone home that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050012"/> Night, but I was seized with a violent cold shaking, soon after I got into the House. When I first went in, there were a great many People drinking Gin, but they all went away; they said they were going to Billingsgate. I did not know I was got into such a Den of Thieves. The other People sat with me round the Fire, and drank with me: But they were gone when the Prisoners robbed me. Mackartney told me (when he took my Money) that I had best be easy, else he would knock my Brains out. I heard a Watchman coming by, at the same Time, and I made all the Noise I could, but they made a greater, to drown mine, and so he did not come in. I staid two Hours alone in the House, after I was robbed; then I went (crying) out of the House, and saw two Soldiers (about Six in the Morning) I told them I had been robbed, but they went on. I enquired where I might find a Constable, and a Stranger coming by, directed me to Mr. Hull, and I told him the Truth. I am a marry'd Woman: My Husband is on Board the Graston Man of War, at Spithead . The Reason of my having so much Money about me, was because I had no Place else to put it in, and I thought 'twas safest in my Bosom. The Maid with whom I went home that Night, is gone to Bath. I went no further with her, than the Corner of the Alley, where they sell Shoes, ( Turnstile )</p>

Mackartney told her, she might have a Glass of good Gin; and so she sat down by the Fire, and called for a Dram. Then she put her Hand in her Pocket, and drew out her Purse, and gave me half a Guinea to change. I sent Mackartney out to get Change; he came in again, and gave her nine Shillings, the rest she had spent. Between Four and Five, Mackartney fill'd his Mouth with Gin, and spirted it in her Eyes; then Johnson held her, while Mackartney took the Purse out of her Bosom - 'twas a yellow and white Purse. He empty'd it into his Pocket-Apron, and threw the Purse in her Face, after he had put a few Half-pence into it, instead of what he took out. She complained immediately of being robbed; but he asked her where she should get so much Money to be robbed of, and turned her out of Doors. She got in again, and we all went to Harry Green's Beer-house, in Cross-Lane , St. Giles's , where he shewed me two Guineas, three Half- Guineas , and nine Shillings. One Guinea he changed, and gave Johnson fifteen Shillings, and I had fifteen Shillings myself. He gave me a Guinea, and I gave him a Crown out of it, to make up the Change for Johnson.

             , Constable. The Woman (Hopkins) came to my House, in Bow-street, Bloomsbury , on the 6th of November, between Six and Seven in the Morning, crying: She said, she had been robb'd, and believ'd she could find the People who had her Money. I went with her to the Coal-Yard , and from thence to Harry Green's, where I found Gaffney and the two Prisoners very much in Liquor. I told them, a Robbery had been committed among them, but-O they knew nothing of it, - not they, - and they all swore to it. Hopkins charg'd me with Mackartney and Nan Johnson , so I took them before Mr.De Veil, and left Gaffney behind, but Mr. De Veil ordered him likewise to be brought, so I went back and took him. Mackartney told me, he had borrow'd two Guineas of Green, and I asked Green before his Face if it was true? Green said, no, he had not loat him a Parthing. We searched him, and found 17 s. and some Halfpence, in his Pocket Apron, this is the Money. Upon Nan Johnson we only found some few Half-pence, but as we were carrying the Prisoners to Newgate, Green's Son brought her five or six Shillings. Gaffney was made an Evidence, but what he said to Colonel De Veil I know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050013"/> not, for he was taken backward when he made his Confession.</p>
               <p>Mackartney , This Money was my Creditors, 'twas none of mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hull . He told us, he owed one Mr. Collier, a Distiller, for Liquor; and Mr. Collier said it was true; but he did not say this was his Money. He gave him a bad Character, and said he should be glad to have what he owed him.</p>
               <p>Johnson. When I went to Gaffney's , this Woman was secting by the Fire, smoaking her Pipe, without Stockings; she called for half a Pint of Gin; then for another, and made six or seven People drink who were in the House. It snow'd, and was very cold, so Gaffney said, - my dear, you'll catch cold; how come you out without Stockings? Why my Landlady and I have quarrelled, said she, and I never can lie a-bed when I am in a Fret. Then Gaffney bid her pay the Reckoning, (it came to 10 d.) and he told her he would not trust. Do you think, said she, that I have no Money! I'll have a Gallon of Beer, and out she pulled half a Guinea from her Purse, and Gaffney gave it to Jemmy Mackartney , to fetch the Beer. Jemmy came back, and said it was bad Money, and the Woman gave him another. Then Gaffney lent her a Pair of Stockings, which affronted her, and she said she'd sit without. Gaffney swore before the Justice, that I picked Seven-pence Half-penny out of her Pocket, and she laid no more than this to my Charge.</p>
               <p>Hopkins. I charged her before the Justice, with taking Four-pence Half-penny from me. I would be within Compass. She picked my Pocket of Four-pence Half-penny, just before Mackartney took my Purse.</p>
               <p>Mackartney . There was one Carolins , and Nan Beaver, and several others in the House beside us; and the Woman was asleep by the Fire-side, when I went out for the Beer. When I came back again, she had lost her Money. As to Gaffney, - He'll swear a Cat's a Cucumber ; he wants Bread, and would steal a Morsel from a Cat.</p>
               <p>Gaffney . I took this Mackartney in, as a Partner with me in selling Liquors. The House is mine: I took it about three Months ago of Mr. Hilliard, and am to answer to him for the Rent; but on his coming in Partner with me, he was to pay half the Charges.</p>
               <p>Hopkins. I am sure 'twas all the Money I had in the World. I came up about a Fortnight before, from Bath, and had worked hard for it, at Chairing and Ironing. My Husband left me , and went a-board a Man of Wat , because he and I had a few Words. Both <rs id="t17391205-26-verdict121" type="verdictDescription">

Shields was the Person that had my Money; upon his threatening me, I toss'd it into his Hat; but at that Time Dent was gone to Marlow's Waggon , which was a little Way from us.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it dark or light?</p>
               <p>Read. It was not very dark, for I could see them very plainly. When they had got my Money, they went to my Wife, and took what they could form her: Then they bid me go on, and they went to ( assist ) the other Man who was at Marlow's Waggon .</p>

             , the old Man. Marlow's Waggon was about the Breadth of this Court before us, till they turn'd us out of the Road. I can positively swear, that first and last, all the three Prisoners were with us. The two young ones I never saw before that Time, but the elderly Man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050014"/> ( Spinnel ) I had some knowledge of, - I had seen him before. We made an Outcry, and somebody heard us, for they were taken the same Morning; a Gentleman happen'd to come by, he heard us, and got Assistance, so the Prisoners were taken directly. Some of the People who had taken them, came after me, - I was got about two Miles from the Place where I was robb'd, - and they told me, the Men were taken; upon which I came back to Paddington, where I found Spinnel and Shields; they were taken together, but Dent was not taken till Sunday Evening. Money was found upon the two first, but how much, - I can't say. The Pistol, the Stick and two Knives, were likewise taken from them.</p>

            : As my Husband and I were travelling home in our Cart, one of the Prisoners [Dent] stopp'd us, another of them stood at the Copses of the Cart, and the third Man stood behind the Cart. Shields damn'd me for a Bitch, and bid me give him my Money, so I took it out of my Pocket, and flung it into his Hat; 'twas about four Shillings he had from me. After this they swore they would over-turn the Cart, and I said, - Pray, Sir, don't over-turn the Cart! pray don't do us any Hurt, - you have got our Money! then the elderly Man (Spinnel) who was at the Tail of the Cart, told me, they would not do us any Hurt. This was between Three and Four o'Clock on Sunday Morning, and there was Marlow's Waggon just before us at the same time. I can take a safe Oath, that the three Prisoners are the Men, for 'twas light enough for me to see them. I did not go back to see the Prisoners when they were taken; the first Time I saw them was a Fortnight after, but I am positive they are the Men.</p>

            . I was coming from Clare-Market (at the same time) with my Waggon: I was asleep in it, and a Boy was driving it along before Read's Cart . We were stopp'd first, and the Noise they made at the Boy wak'd me. I saw the Prisoners, Shields and Spinnel , at Read's Cart , the other kept at my Fore-wheel. I saw them at his Cart , and hend them threaten Read, but I was so fritt (assighted) that I don't remember what they said, nor can I say whether Read gave them any thing, or whether they took any thing from him. Shields and Spinnel were taken about Five or Six o'Clock at Paddington , which is half a Mile nearer London han the Place where we were robb'd, and I saw them after they were apprehended. Spinnel own'd the Fact , and said, the Man in the Cart told 'em, he hoped they would be merciful, because he had just lost a Horse; he mention'd the Money taken from me, but I did not hear him say what he had taken from Read. Dent stood at the Wheel of my Waggon, and damn'd me, and told me, he had a good Mind to cleave my Brains out with his Stick, and I thought he would have dash'd my Brains out, so I shut my Eyes, and am not so positive to him as I am to the other two. He (Dent) is like the Man, and I believe him to be one of the Three: He kept swearing at the Fore-wheel, and said, he would break all my Baskets and Hampers to Pieces. It was so light when they met us, and I saw the other two so plain, that I knew them the Minute I saw them again; but I could not be so positive to the other.</p>

            . I was then traveling home in the Waggon with my Son, and saw Shields and Spinnel go to Read's Cart. I don't know what they took from thence, but I heard them say, they would overturn his Cart, and would kill them, if they could; and after they had stopp'd him, they drove it out of the Way, in order to throw them over into a Ditch. I heard them tell Read and his Wife, - if they did not give them more Money, they would throw his Cart over; and Read told them, he had given them all he had. Shields and Spinnel were two of them, but I am not so positive to Dent.</p>

            . As I was going home the 18th of November, about Four o'Clock in the Morning, I heard Marlow (the Woman) cry out in the Road, - don't kill me, I have given you all the Money I have in the World. Upon this I went up towards the Cart from whence the Cry came, and saw a Man stand with a Pistol in his Hand, and heard him say, - Damn you for a Bitch, if you say a Word I'll blow your Brains out. This was on Westbourn Green , about half a Mile beyond Paddington . I knew the Woman before, and then knew her Voice, so I intended to have rode up to her Assistance, and to have knock'd the Man down, but seeing the Pistol I retreated, and rode to Mr. Godfrey's ; but I could not get in there, so I went from thence to Mr. Russel's at Paddington , and call'd them up: A Watchman happening to come by at the same time, I likewise spoke to him, and bid him get another Man, for a Robbery was committing on Marlow's Waggon .

             , took the Horse way, and we agreed to take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050015"/> different Ways when we came to the Ponds; but we had not gone on above a Pole, before we met three Men all together by the Ponds on Paddington-Green . It was pretty dark, so I call'd out,-Who's there! No Answer being given, I turn'd my Mare, and kept close to the two hindmost, and call'd out, - Knock 'em down! shoot 'em dead, if they offer to resist! Spinnel and Shields were immediately taken; and I told Mr. Russel, I saw three of them, and ask'd him, what was become of the third Man; he told me the third Man was under his Gun, and, says he, if he offers to get away, I'll shoot him. I got off my Horse, and laid hold of Spinnel, telling him, if he offer'd to wag, I'd knock him down: He had been knock'd down before, and he desir'd me to let him get up; but I assur'd him, if he offer'd to wag one Jot, I would down with him again, because Russel was at a Distance from us, keeping Dent under his Gun. At the time we took Shields and Spinnel , a Quarter of Mutton dropp'd on the Ground, but I cannot tell which of them dropp'd it. He who was under Mr. Russel's Gun got away, but Shields and Spinnel we secured, and brought them to Mr. Russel's House, where Shields own'd the Robberies, and told us, the third Man's Name was Dent ; Spinnel likewise confess'd the same. Dent was afterward taken (the same Day) and I saw him, and heard him desire to be made an Evidence before Colonel De Veil. Both Spinnel and Shields (when they own'd the Facts) mention'd particularly the robbing the Cart and the Waggon; and Shields said, the Man in the Cart desired him to be merciful , for he had lost a Horse but just before. The Pistol was taken from Shields, and this Club from Spinnel.</p>

            . Mr. Newman rode into my Yard at Paddington , and call'd me up, and told me, he had seen some People robbing Mr. Marlow's and Read's Carts. He knew both Parties, so he desired my Assistance to take the Men. He said, he heard one of them swear he would blow Mrs. Marlow's Brains out, which gave him Reason to believe they had Fire-arms, else he would have assisted them then. Upon this I call'd my Man Harrison, and one Greenfield to assist us; and we agreed that Newman and I should take the Horse way, and the other two the Foot-way, if we did not meet them by that time we came to the Ponds. Before we came to this Place, we met them at the Turn-stile, coming on the Green. Mr. Newman was before us, and it was dark; but I perceiv'd his Horse stop, therefore I imagin'd he saw somebody; whereupon I levell'd my Piece, and ask'd, Who's there! Newman cry'd, these are the Men, attack 'em! knock 'em down! shoot 'em! Greenfield and Harrison immediately push'd by me, and caught Spinnel and Shields; and Greenfield call'd out, and told us, one of them was slipp'd away. I said I saw him, in order to 'fright him, tho' I did not see him, and that I would shoot him if he attempted to get off. Mr. Newman then got off his Horse, and knock'd down Spinnel, telling him, he would knock him down again, if he would not be quiet; and I pull'd my Garters off, and ty'd his Hands. I am sure Spinnel and Shields are the Men we then took, for before we went off the Spot, we had a Candle and Lanthorn, by which we look'd at them. I told them then, that we took them on Suspicion of a Robbery, and they then made little or no Defence; but when we had got them to my House, they confess'd they had committed a Robbery, and said it was the first Fact they ever had committed. I ask'd Shields the Name of the third Man who had escaped; he told me, - Dent , and gave me Directions to go after him to the Coal-yard, to his (Shields's) Lodgings. Accordingly Greenfield and I went thicher , and enquir'd of Shields's Wife, (who is Dent's Sister) where Dent was; she told us, he had been there about two Hours ago, but was gone. Shields having directed us to Dent's Lodgings, (if we should not find him in the Coal yard) we went according to his Notice, first to Golden-Lane, and then to an Alley in Whitecross Street, and to several other Places, but could not find him. At last we came back to Shield's Wife, and told her, if she would tell where Dent was, it might save her Husband: Upon this she told us, he would be in Newtoner's Lane in the Evening, and when he did come there, she got one Smith, a Constable, to apprehend him.</p>

            , Constable. I took Dent in a Cock-loft, under the Roof of a House, where he had conceal'd himself, flat upon his Face, with his Arms extended, in Newtoner's Lane . A Man in the House discover'd where he was conceal'd, by pointing to the Place with his Finger, upon which I got hold of him, in the Cock-lost, and jump'd down with him ten Feet, into the next Room. Having heard of this Robbery at Paddington , I sent to let Colonel De Veil know that I had got the third Man: He orderd me to bring him before him, add there he desired to be admitted an Evidence. Mr. Harrison was present, and having Spinnel's s great Club in his Hand, he ask'd him, if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050016"/> he knew any thing of that Stick; yes, says he, 'tis the old Man's Spinnel's. Marlow ask'd him, if he was not on the Top of his Waggon last Night, and if he did not tye his Horses together with a Piece of Cord; he said, no, he was on the Side of the Cart, and only ty'd the Horses on one Side of the Cart.</p>
               <p>Shields. What these Men accuse us of, is wrongfully, I will give you my Word. We had been out to see for Work that Night, and having met with two or three of our Trade, they gave us some Beer, and we being be-lated were making the best of our Way home, when we met these Men, and it being dark, we did not see them till they were just upon us, and one of them catch'd fast hold of me.</p>
               <p>Dent. Mr. Russel clapp'd the End of his Piece directly against my Breast, and told me, if I stirr'd he would shoot me, but I ran away, and was afterwards taken by Mr. Smith the Constable.</p>
               <p>Spinnel . We had been out to see for Work, and having Maid drinking till it was late, we were making the best of our Way home when these Men met us. They seiz'd Shields, and knock'd me down twice with an Iron Bar. You may see how they us'd me.</p>

             . I know two of them verywell, Shields and Spinnel . They wak'd me with swearing at the Lad that drove my Waggon. Shields came first up to me with a Pistol, and swore if I did not deliver my Money, he would blow my Brains out. I said, indeed, Sir, we have no Money; but he swore he would kill me, so I put my Hand in my Pocket, and gave him 17 or 18 Pence, in Halfpence. Then the other Man ( Spinnel ) came to me, and said I had more Money, and if I did not deliver it, he would beat my Brains out with a great Club, which he had in his Hand. This is the Stick (as near as I can guess.) Upon Spinnel's threatening me, I gave him two or three Halfpence more. Then they went to Read's Cart; and one of them told me, as they were going away, if I did not bring more Money the next time I came, they would kill me on the Spot. The other Prisoner (Dent) is like the third Man, but he never was so near me as the other two. He came by me with a Stick in his Hand, and threatened to dash my Brains out, so I shut my Eyes, and did not see so much of him. He asked me if I had a Watch about me, or any Geese in my Baskets or Hampers? I told him no, I had nothing but the Cloths. The Man that kept at the Fore-wheel of the Waggon, search'd my Boy, and took away a Tinder-box from him. I asked Dent when he was before Col. De Viel, what he had done with it? and he told me it was good for nothing, and therefore he had thrown it away. Shields and Spinnel were taken about an Hour after the Fact, and Mr. Newman came after us, to let us know they were in Custody. I went Home and took a Horse, and came back directly; and as soon as I saw them, I said they were the Men who had robbed me. I said so then, and so I say now. Shields took the first Money from me; then Spinnel came with Oaths to me, and I gave him the rest. I don't know what they took from my Mother; but when I saw Spinnel , he confess'd, and told me what Money he took from me.</p>

             . I know Spinnel and Shields very well; I am sure they are the Men: I knew them the Minute I saw them again. I was at this Time in the Waggon with my Son, but I put my Head out to talk to them. They demanded my Money with great Oaths, and I gave them what I had - two Sixpences, and the Value of Six-pennforth of Halfpence. They damn'd me, and asked me if I had no more? I told them I had no more. They said they would have more, or they would blow my Brains out. I assur'd them I had given them all I had about me; and then they went their way, and said, D-mn their Eyes, if we did not bring more Money with us the next Time we came that way, they would blow our Brains out.</p>

At last Walter and the Prisoner told me, if I would go to a Coffee-house, and say that Walter had bought so much Timber of me, and had paid me honestly for it, I should be paid my Debt in four Days: Butcher solicited me to do this, and Walter was with him, and said, he could have Credit for 300 l's Worth of Timber, if I would say so. I refused to do it, unless they would pay me; and finding they had bad Characters, I took out an Attachment against the Timber, had it appraised, gave Security to the Sheriffs, and then I carry'd the Timber to Nine-Elms. in a Barge: I saw it in the Barge myself. After this it was taken away, and carry'd to Westminster Horse-ferry.</p>

Simmonds told us he bought them of the Prisoner, and when we took him up, he offer'd to make us any manner of Satisfaction. I ask'd him if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050018"/> had nobody with him, to help him to get the Sheep out of the Ground? He told us, no; he had no body but himself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You have said they were lost on Saturday Night.</p>
               <p>Life. No - we follow'd them on Monday Morning to Smithfield, and there we found them. The Prisoner lives about half a Mile from the Ground where these Sheep were kept: He looks after Sheep there.</p>

On Sunday Morning I told 53 Sheep in the Field: On Monday Morning Nine were missing: I follow'd the Marks of their Feet Half a Mile into the the Road, and concluding they were gone to Smithfiels, I went thither, and found Mr. Simmonds killing one of them: I knew it, and asked him, if he had any of them alive? He said yes, and shew'd me four mark'd R.L. the Letters across, and a Dot on the near Shoulder: I found likewise five of the Skins there; all of them had the same Marks: I could discover by the Skins, that there were five Ews and four Wedthers. Simmonds told me he bought them all of the Prisoner; upon which I went to his House, and charg'd him with having sold our Sheep, and he offer'd to make any Satisfaction that my Father-in-Law desired. He did not say he took the Sheep, but when I ask'd him if he had any one with him when they were taken, he said no, there was no body but himself, and he said he had sold them to Simmonds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said he measur'd the Mark of the Man's Foot in the Field.</p>
               <p>Stevenson . I did so: And as I brought the Prisoner along, I measur'd his Foot: The Prisoner's Foot was a little longer than the Mark in the Ground; but the Ground being slippery, his Foot might draw back.</p>

            . I am a Goldsmith: On the 18th of October, about Nine in the Morning, I bought the Spoon of the Prisoner: It was broke in two, just as it is now. I gave him five Shillings and Five-pence an Ounce for it; it came to 10 s. 7d. and I gave him half a Guinea and a Penny. I asked him no Questions, for 'twas broke, and not fit for any Thing, but to melt. I never saw the Prisoner before that time.</p>

            . I am a Servant to Mr. Deane . The Prisoner came to our House, on Wednesday the 17th of October towards Evening, and called for a Drawer. I shewed him into a Room we call the Nag's Head. He bid me bring him half a Pint of Mountain. I drew him the Wine: He drank a a Glass, and then asked me what he had got in the Larder? I told him several different Things, at last he chose a Whiting. It was dressed, but it did not please his Palate, - it was not over and above good, he said; - so he ordered a poached Egg or two, after he had eat about half the Whiting. I was about the House, and was not at the clearing away of the Things, but I can swear the Cup was brought to him with small Beer, and the Spoon, I believe, was carry'd in with the Whiting. When he called to pay, I told him 15 d. He gave me a Guinea, which I changed, and he gave me 3 d. out of 18 d. for myself. When I went in to him, about the Reckoning, I observed him to be writing upon a Piece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050019"/> of blotted Paper, and he seemed to lean his Head from me. I won't be too positive to him, but I think: have seen him several Times before. I can swear he had on the same Wig, and as near as I can guess, the same Coat. He was at our House between Five and Ten, and I missed the Things about an Hour and a half after he was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask him whether he is certain he ever saw me before?</p>
               <p>Lord I think I have seen him at the Mitre Tavern, where I served my Time. I told him last Sunday in Newgate, I had seen him there; and he said, to be sure, Sir, you have.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask him if he was the Person that took the Things away?</p>
               <p>Lord . No: When I took the Reckoning of him the Things were all taken away, and the Table brushed clean. There was nothing then upon it, but a Half-pint Decanter, a Decanter of Water, and a large Water Glass.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am not the Person that conveyed the Things away from Mr. Deane's House; and that is the Substance of what I have to say. The Indictment is laid for a Silver Mug, and they swear to a Cup. There, my Lord, is a manifest Distinction.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fruchard . Last August was twelve Months, I was in Want of a Book-keeper, and the Prisoner apply'd to me, and told me he came from a Place called Kimlade in Worcestershire , and shew'd me a Recommendatory Letter from a Gentleman of the Law, - one Mr. Massey , of Shessinghurst . I told him, I should be glad to have a Line from that Gentleman, and he accordingly wrote me a Letter, and gave the Prisoner a good Character: So I took him upon Trial, and he behaved with me, in a very decent Manner, and I thought him religious. He continued with me, but a little while, - about six or seven Weeks, for he had wrote an Essay on the Divine Attributes, (which in some Peoples Judgement, was a very good Piece) and other Poetical Pieces; and I found when he should have been about my Books, his Imagination was in the Clouds. This was the only Reason I parted with him. He has received Money for me, and brought it justly to Account. It is a Par-dox to me, that the Author of such Pieces, as he has wrote, should be an Hypocrite. I would have served him since he he went from me, had I not been obliged to tell him; that his Inclination to Poetry would disqualify him from Merchandizing.</p>

               <p>George Rotheram . Last Thursday, as I was going to London, with another Farmer, between Whetstone and Barnet, I was attack'd by two Men. The first that came up I knew: What, Master Thompson, said he, won't you give me the Way! then the Prisoner came up, with a Pistol in his Hand, and said, - What Money you have I will have; so I gave him my Money: You have more, said he; I told him I had no more, and turn'd my Pockets out: Well, you have got a Whip, I'll have that. When they had done with me, I went to the Mitre at Barnet , and sat there an Hour and half; then I was told, that the Prisoner was taken with the Whip upon him. This is the Whip, and 'tis mine.</p>

            . One Mr. Palmer was riding Post, and was attack'd near Mimms-Wash, by two Men. The Post-boy, as he came by, told us Mr. Palmer had been robb'd, and there the two Men went that had robb'd him. I and my Fellow-servant assisted in pursuing them; and on Finchley-Common we saw them, overtook them, and seiz'd them. When I came up to them, the Prisoner pull'd out a Pistol, and said he would shoot me through the Head: I had a long Gun, and told him, If I dy'd, he should die. Upon this he put his Pistol up, and I threw down my Gun, and run in upon the Prisoner, and seiz'd him, and held him till my Assistants come. This Whip he had in his Hand at the same Time.</p>

I happened to be drinking at The Hog in Armour, in Field-Lane, and there was a Man forced his Discourse to me very much, seeing me a Soldier. He did not then tell me who he was, or what he was, but he asked me many Questions about military Affairs, and I resolved him to the best of my Knowledge. He told me he was an Irishman, and had travelled thro' Ireland and France, and asked me where I lived? I told him, at the Sheep's-Head-Shop, facing the Gulley-hole. He took it down, and shewed me his French Pass; but he might as well have shewn it to a Horse, for it was in another Language, and I did not understand it. I asked him his Name? He told me Ryan; I told him I could read that in his Pass, and that was all. He put his Pint of Beer into mine, and we drank together. He was mighty complaisant, and gave a good Account of the military Affairs in France. We had five Pints of Beer together, and he would pay the Reckoning; he would not let me club towards it. After this, in a very complaisant Manner, he made Motions for me to go with him to another Place, and I went with him to Bowl-Yard, in St. Giles's. There he called for Two-penny, and looked upon me very pleasantly; but upon his going out of Doors and whispering other Fellows, I suspected him to be a French Officer. We drank four Pints of Two penny, and he seem'd pleased with me, and told me he would call upon me To-morrow. Accordingly he came the next Day and wrapped at my Door. He was then full of Complaisance: he took off his Hat, and shewed his French Behaviours, and Mr. Jackson (says he) will you please to go drink with me at The Hog in Armour I told him, no: I had Work to do, and should disoblige my Master if I went. Then go and speak for two Pots of Beer, and we'll have them here. No, I told him, I did not chuse to drink; it would get into my Head, and I should neglect my Work: If you have any thing to say to me, sit down and say it. So he sat down, and talked again very much in Behalf of the Character of France; and I told him, I believed he was a French Officer, and was come over here to get Men. Yes, says he; will you go? I did not intend to go, but I told him I would, and that I had an Acquaintance would go with me. He said, if I had, he should be glad to drink with him, and I promis'd to bring him, as soon as I saw him. After this, I went to Lunard Armstrong , and told him, a French Officer had been with me, who wanted Men for the French Service, - for a Company of Fusiliers, which lay at Calais. I said, I did not understand it; therefore I desired him to speak to somebody upon this Affair, and in the mean time I would give the Fellow Encouragement to come to my Room. The next time I saw Armstrong, I asked him if he had enquired about this Business? The Fellow comes, says I, and pays me Visits, - I want to bring him to Justice, and if I bring him to The Old Baily on my own Evidence, he might bring twenty People against me, - yet I don't care to smother such a Thing: Ryan was then out of Town: He went to carry off some Men, and was gone four Days. When he returned, I told Armstrong; so he, and

             came to my Room, to hear farther into the Affair, and I desired Moore to go with me to strengthen my Evidence. Accordingly we all set out for Bowl-Yard; my Wife was unwilling I should go, and she followed us up Holborn, and there I troubled Armstrong to keep her in a Public House, while Moore and I went to Ryan's in <placeName id="t17391205-51-crimeloc244">Bowl-Yard</placeName>

When we came to the House, I asked the Maid for Mr. Ryan, she said at first, she knew no such Person; but when I told her, I was the Person that had been drinking with him, she knew me, and said she would go and fetch him. When she came back, she said, she had not seen him, but she gave me a Tap on the Shoulder, and bid me come to the Door. I did so; and she there asked me, if the young Man that came with me (Moore) was to go to France too? Yes, says I, he came with me for that Intent and Purpose, if we can see Mr. Ryan. She told us, she would bring a Man to us, who was going off To-morrow: I approved of it, and so she fetched the Prisoner at the Bar into the Passage, and told me that was the Man. The Prisoner shook Hands with me, and said, - Mr. Jackson, I know your Business. I am sure he is the Man that enlisted me; I know him by his Phisiognomy, and the deep Scar in his Forehead. He called me by my Name, and said the Maid had told him my Business, and ask'd me if I was willing to go? I told him, yes; but I came to speak with Ryan. Why, says he, I'll give you as much Encouragement as Ryan, or any body else; and I have as much Power to enlist Men as he has, or any belonging to the King of France's Service. Upon this, I called Moore, and the Prisoner shook Hands with him, and ask'd him, if he was willing to go? Moore said yes, if he liked his Proposals, then he asked us to go up Stairs, and we went up one Pair of Stairs, and sat down at a Table; we drank a Quartern of Gin, and a Pint of Two-penny , and there being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050024"/> three Beds in the Room, and a Man lying in one of them behind us, I pointed behind me with my Thumb, to let the Prisoner understand, I feared the Man abed would hear us: But he told us, he was one of our Sort, and we might talk what we pleased. While we were talking, another Man came into the Room, and undross'd himself, and went to Bed. The Prisoner knew him too, and told us, he was one of the same. We then told him, we were willing to have gone with Ryan; and the Prisoner said, we might as well go with him, for he would give us as much Encouragement . He talked much in the Character (in Praise) of France, and took Moore to the Back of the Door, and the Maid told us, - that was the Place where the Men were measured. The Prisoner took a Knife out of his Pocket, and having set himself against the Door, he put the Knife (over his Head against it, and he was not so high as the lowest Mark of the Small-coal him-himself. He held the Knife still, and called Moore to stand under it, and Moore was not so high as the Prisoner, by I know not how much, - two Inches I believe. After this, there was another Man came up into the Room, that neither the Prisoner nor we knew, and then he said - I don't care that any body should know my Business, so we went to the Stair-head, from behind the Door. There Moore asked him, what Bounty-Money he gave? Says I, I suppose he'll give us twenty Crowns, for Ryan proposed to give so much. The Prisoner told Moore , he could not give him so much, but he would to me, because I was a sized Man; however he would give him fifteen, tho' he was fit for nothing but a Drummer. Then says Moore , what Pay are we to have, when we come there? - I don't know but the Pay might be talked of, both at the Table in the Room, and at the Scair-head . - The Prisoner told us, our Pay would be Five-pence Half-penny a Day; which, with other Advantages, would be as good as a Serjeant's in a marching Regiment. Why that's a good Place, says I; and Money will go twice as far there, as it will here. I told him, I expected another Soldier every Minute , who was willing to go with us, and asked him; what I must do for Cloaths, for I had no other than what I had on to go in. You'll go, says he, in a Ship, and will not be seen; 'tis as dangerous for me as for you: You may take your Gun and Accoutrements with you, - you'll never be seen.</p>
               <p>Counc . Did he propose to go with you himself?</p>
               <p>Jackson . Yes, he proposed to go off with us the next Day, and was to give us a Note of his Hand for the Money on board of the Ship, which (Note) was to be paid us by the Cornet, when we came to the Regiment. The Money was not to be paid in England, and Moore question'd the Payment of it in France; upon which the Prisoner took two Shillings out of his Pocket, one he gave me, and the other to Moore , and said, - You'll as surely have it as you have this, - by G-d. This is to inlist you to serve the King of France. After this we went in, and sat down, and drank the rest of our Liquor, and he drank the King of France's Health, but I drank no Health at all, nor would I, had he insisted on it, though I gave him his Way as much as I could that Night.</p>

               <p>Counc . How long did you continue together?</p>
               <p>Jackson . We went in a little before Eight at Night, and we continued together till past Eleven. When we came away, we went to Colonel De Veil's to acquaint him with the Affair, but he was gone to Bed. I had inform'd Armstrong of it the second Day I was in Company with Ryan, - (I can't tell: he Day of the Month) - in order to have him apprehended.</p>

             the next Morning?</p>
               <p>Jackson . I went home to Bed that Night, and toward Morning Armstrong and Moore , with Newbury and Brough , called me out of Bed: I came down to them in a Minute or two, and went with them up Holborn , as far as Hatton-Garden, with my Stockings in my Hand, and there I put them on, and asked Moore if he had got a Warrant for the Prisoner: He said, no, we may take him without. I told them, there was no Occasion for all this Haste, and that if we went before Day-light, 'twould be but beating the Bush, for the Birds would all fly aways so we went to a House in St. Giles's and staid till 'twas Day. Then we got Sticks, for as we had no Arms, and there was so many Beds in the Room, I thought we should stand a Fagg. Moore went first, to see if the Prisoner was in the House; I follow'd in a Minute or two, and he informing me the Prisoner was a bed, I went back to give our Friends Notice , and then I return'd to Moore . He seeing them pass by the Door, went out after them, to se , where they would wait till we wanted their Assistance . But I went up Stairs, and desired the Prisoner to get up and drink with me: He raised himself up, and took his Breeches from under his Head; but the Maid having seen the Soldiers go by the Door, she came to me, and asked me if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050025"/> knew them; I told her, no, I did not; however she went to the Bed-side, and spoke something to the Prisoner, in another Language, upon which he immediately look'd angry and sulky. Moore was now return'd, and came up Stairs, and the Prisoner lay down again, and said he was sick. Then Moore said he should be glad to get a Rowl and Butter; I told him I would go and get him one, and having given him a Tap on the Shoul der to get him to the Room-door, I bid him not quit the Room till I came back; so away I went to Newbury and Brough, who follow'd me to the House, and when I got up Stairs again, the Maid was in the Room, and shut the Door; but when I saw the Red-coats coming up Stairs, I turn'd the Lock back (being stronger than she) and let them in (Newbury, Brough and Armstrong) and told them, that was the Man who had inned us into French Service, and the Maid having told me, that one of the Men in Bed was to have gone with us, we took him and the Maid too, and carried them all to the Bear Ale-house, till Col. DeVeil was stirring; but she made her Escape, and the Man was discharged. While we were waiting there, a Thought came into my Head, and I bid them take Care the Prisoner dropp'd nothing. We had ty'd his Hands, and he desired they might be loosen'd; after which his Pocket-Book was taken from under the Table. I forgot to tell you, that while the Prisoner was talking with Moore and me at the Stair-head in his Lodging, he told us, we should have new Cloaths, and two Shirts, not so fine indeed as what he had on, but two good strong Shirts.</p>
               <p>Counc . Did not you go with the Prisoner before Col. De Viel?</p>
               <p>Jackson . Yes, we all went, and the Man was committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if I went by the Name of Macguire .</p>
               <p>Jackson. After we got out of the Coach, when we carry'd him to the Gate-house, there was a Woman who abused us, and called him Macguire . Others call'd him Macguire too.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I name any Regiment in France?</p>
               <p>Jackson. He told us, we were inlisted into the Duke of Berwick's Regiment. I am positive of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I give you the Shilling above Stairs, or below?</p>
               <p>Jackson. As the Stair-head. Moore had the first Shilling , and I the next, and he told us we should have the rest as sure as we had that, - by God. Lord, I wonder to hear him talk so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I in this Dress at that Time?</p>
               <p>Jackson . I can't be positive to Dress . I am positive he's the Man that inlisted me. He had while Buttons, - metal Buttons, on both Sides of his Waistcoat [The Prisoner had a Waistcoat on him at the Bar, with such Buttons as the Witness described.]</p>

             I am a Scotsman, - a Shoemaker . I know the Prisoner. I saw him on the 22d and 23d of October last, at a House in Bowlyard, about Eight o'Clock at Night. 'Tis not a publick House, - they sell Gin and Twopenny in a cland stine Manner. Jackson and I went there the first Night, about Eight o'Clock, and Jackson asked for Ryan ; a Woman told us she knew no such Person, but when he told her he had drunk Twopen y and Gin with him there, then she said she knew him, and would go for him. She went out for a little while, then she return'd, and gave Jackson a Tap on the Shoulder to follow her. He went to the Door with her, and came back to me She went out of Doors, and in a short time the Prisoner and she came in together. Then she gave Jackson the second Motion to come to the Door, and he call'd me to him there, where the Prisoner shook Hands with me, and asked me if I was willing to go to France? I know the Prisoner is the Man though I saw him but twice, 'tis impossible I should not remember him, for he has a great Scar in his Face. - I told him I did not know but I might be willing to go Then let's go up Stairs (says he) and drink together. There was a Pint of Twopenny and a Quartern of Gin brought up, and he commended France, telling us how much it exceeded England, and what Encouragement there was to serve the French King. He did not dispute Jackson's Size, but he did mine, and took a Penknife out of his Pocket, and stuck it over his own Head in the Door; then he desired me to come under it; he scrupled my Height, but said I was a likely young Man, and would grow. - I have forgot some Part of my Story. - There was one Man a-bed in the Room, and another came in and undress'd himself, and went to Bed; the Prisoner told us, he was one of the same, and would be no Detriment to us. After I was measured, in came a third Man, and then the Prisoner beckoned us out to the Stair-head, and asked us again, if we were willing to go to France. Says Jackson , Ryan promised to give twenty Crowns, - you'll give no less, to be sure. No, says he, I can't give you so much, (meaning me) - you're not so tall as Jackson; I'll give him twenty, but I can give you but fifteen.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050026"/> and you shall have two new Shirts a-piece, and shall be new cloathed from Top to Toe; you'll have 5 d. Halfpenny a Day, which, with other Advantages, will be as good almost as a Serjeant in a marching Regiment in England. Jackson then told him, he had no other Cloaths to go in, but the Cloaths he had on (Soldiers Cloaths); the Prisoner said, he had a Ship provided to his Mind in the River, and he would not be examin'd , so he might bring his Gun with him, as well as the rest of his Regimentals, because they'd be of Service to him on the other Side of the Water. Jackson told him, he expected another Soldier every Minute, who would inlist likewise, to which the Prisoner reply'd, - So much the better - the more the merrier. I asked him, how we should be sure of the Advance; he said he would give us a Note for it, when we were got on board, and we should receive the Money when we were come to the Regiment. I was scrupulous, and desired the Money before; he told us, he could not do that, but (putting his Hand in his Pocket) he pull'd out two Shillings, one of which he gave first to me, and then the other, - to Jackson. I asked him what the Shilling was for; to inlist you (says he) to serve the King of France, and you are as sure of the rest of the Money when you come there as you are of this. - by God. I think he told us, we were to serve in the Duke of Berwick's Regiment then, - I am sure he told us so before. After this he shook Hands with us, and call'd us Brother-Soldiers. This was on the Stair-head. Then we went into the Room again, and he drank the King of France's Health: I did not drink it, nor do I remember that Jackson did. We drank a little more Gin and Twopenny together, and about Eleven o'Clock we left the Prisoner, and went to inform Col. DeVeil of the Affair, but he being gone to bed, we went and drank a Pet together in Drury Lane ; then Jackson and I parted, and I went and lay at a Friend's House. About Five or Six in the Morning, Armstrong (who knew where I was to lie) came with Newbury and Brough , and knock'd me up: He told me, he had acquainted the Captain of the Tilt-yard-Guard with this Matter, and I must get up, and go with them. We went and knock'd up Jackson, who came out to us with his Stockings in his Hand, and did not put them on till we came upon Holbourn-Hill. I had desired the Prisoner not to lock his Door when I left him over Night, for (I told him) I would only go and fetch my working Tools, and would return to him; but thinking that if the Door should be lock'd, our knocking at it so early would make a Discovery, I propos'd going to drink a Pot of Beer at a House where I was acquainted; but they not being up, we went to another, and asked for Arms, but they could provide us with none but a Mopstick saw'd in two. Then I went to see if the Prisoner's House was open. The Maid (who first brought the Prisoner to us) told me he was above Stairs I had not talked to her above two Minutes, before Jackson came in, and I believe we had a Dram together; and the Persons who were to assist us following Jackson, he made a Motion with his Hand to prevent their coming in, so they pass'd the Door, and I follow'd them, to see where they went in. Before I went after them, the Maid asked me, if I knew those Soldiers? No, really (says I) I don't. But under Pretence of going for a hot Rowl and Butter, I follow'd them, and bid them be easy till I came, or sent for them. When I came back to the House, Jackson was gone up Stairs, and I went up to him. The Prisoner was in Bed, and he seem'd before to be willing to embrace us; but the Maid coming up, and speaking something to him in an unknown Language, (Irish, I suppose) tho' he had his Breeches in his Hand, he put them under his Head, and laid himself down again, seeming much out of Humour, and to be very much startled. After this, I said, I believe the hot Rowls are come from the Bakehouse by this Time, be so good (speaking to Jackson) as to fetch me one. He tapp'd me on the Shoulder (to get me aside) and bid me not quit the Room till he came back. Jackson, under this Pretence, went and told our Men. He return'd in a Minute or two, and the Maid followed him up Stairs, very much surprized; then he peep'd through a Crevice in the Door, and seeing the Soldiers coming up Stairs, she and he struggled together at the Door; but he got it open, and let them all in. They immediately asked us, who gave us the Money to serve the King of France? I told them, - the Man that lay next the Wall: Upon which they bid him get up, for he must go along with them. The Appearance of Soldiers affrighted him, and he got up trembling; and both he and the Man abed with him, were bound with a Cord, - their Hands behind them. After they were pinion'd, I proposed carrying them before Colonel De Viel, and the Maid likewise. Prisoners and Assistants were now Nine in Number, and we all went together to a publick House, to wait for Colonel De Viel's rising: And remembering I had seen Papers in the Prisoner's Window wrote in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050027"/> French, (I am sure they were not in Latin, for I understand something of that) I said - Gentlemen, search him, - may be he has Papers about him, which may strengthen our Evidence. They did not think proper to search him till he came before a Magistrate, so I bid them take Care that he dropp'd nothing; but after Colonel De Viel had sent word he was ready for us, the Prisoner, by some means or other, got his Hands into his Pocket, and dropp'd something like a Book or a Letter-Case. I desired to see what he had dropp'd, and it was pick'd up by Newbury, (I think.) He shew'd it to Brough , and I look'd ever him while he was reading it. 'Twas French; and Brough told us 'twas a French Conge There was a Seal to it, and to the best of my Knowledge, this is the very Paper. I took Notice of the Spelling the Name - Loglin Rennells . I must be very much mistaken, if this is not the ver same . It was produced before Colonel De Viel (I think) by Newbury, and the Colonel asked the Prisoner if his Name was Loglin Rennells? and he told him, Yes. Is this your Pas Yes . What had it you for? To come to England, to see my Friends. Why did you drop in? He said any body might drop a Paper accidentally</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever see me before that Night?</p>
               <p>Moore . Never in the whole Course of my Life, - o my Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I go by any other Name?</p>
               <p>Moore . I don't know. The Woman was asked as we went along with them, what his Name was? and she said, Macguire .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do you know any thing of Ryan?</p>
               <p>Moore . No. From Jackson's Words I expected to have seen Ryan there that Night; but this Prisoner appeared in his stead, and was very fond of the Job: He said he could do as much, or more, for us, than Ryan; that he belonged to a better Regiment, and had better Quarters.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you strip yourself, to shew you had been whipp'd on board a Man of War?</p>
               <p>Moore . Yes, I did. I won't deny a Word. When I was on board a Tender to a Man of War, I got under the Denomination of having been an Informer, and was whipp'd for having the Name of an Informer.</p>

            . Jackson having inform'd me, a Man wanted to enlist him into foreign Service, I took an Opportunity to go down with Moore to Jackson's Lodging. Jackson was willing to go with us to the Man, but his Wife made words with him about it, telling him he would bring himself into Trouble. When we went out together, she followed us into Holborn , and then Jackson desired me to go to a publick House with her, and if I could, to leave her there, and come to them in Bowl-Yard. I did so, and between Ten and Eleven at Night I got to the House, and asked the Maid, if there was not a Soldier and a young Man there? She said yes, and I was let in, and saw the Prisoner and the two Witnesses there. I know his Face, and remember that great Scar. His Coat I can't swear to, but he had then on a Waistcoat with whitish Buttons on both Sides. The Prisoner was surprized when I came in; but Jackson told him, he need not be surprized, - this (says he) is the Soldier I spoke of, who is willing to go as well as we: Upon which he seemed content. I can't say there was any Health drank, while I was there. I had not been long in the House, before Jackson's Wife came to the Door; Moore and he went to her, and while they were at the Door with her, the Prisoner said to me - I understand you are willing to go; I have enlisted them, and if you'll go with them you may: I don't know but I may go off Tomorrow . I asked him what Encouragement he'd give? You'll have, ( says he ) Five-pence Half penny a Day, to serve in the Dake of Berwick's Regiment, and other Encouragments . I asked him if he gave the Money down? No; he said, he had been bit before. I could not have any more Talk with him, because Jackson's Wife kept making a Noise at the Door, and I was afraid, the Thing would, by that Means, be blown. So I bid him good Night, and we went to Colonel De Veil's; but he was abed, so we parted, and I went and acquainted Newbury and Brough with what had passed. They insisted on my acquainting the Captain of the Guard; and I went to him, but he did not think proper to send Men from Guard, without an Order from Kensington, so we went ourselves, as soon as it was light, and took him ourselves. He was abed, on the farther Side next the Wall. He behaved civilly , and pretended Innocence.</p>
               <p>Counc . Did not you carry him to a Publick-house , before you went to Colonel De Veil?</p>
               <p>Armstrong . Yes: and there somebody propos'd to search him: One more knowing than we, said, may be he has a Conge about him. The Prisoner complaining he was pinioned too hard, I eased him, and presently Moore (I think it was) cry'd - he has dropped something, and Newbury took up the Letter-case, which was produced before Colonel De Veil .</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050028"/>Prisoner. Was Jackson with you, when you first came to me, in the Morning?</p>
               <p>Armstrong. Yes; we called on Jackson, and not he on us. When we were all together, we went to St. Giles's to get Arms, but we could not be supplied. Then we sent Moore and Jackson to the House, who were to give us a Signal, when to come in. When we came there, the Woman seemed to have locked the Door, but Jackson opened it, and we went in.</p>

I read it, Word for Word to the Prisoner, in French, and he acknowledged it was his Pass. 'Twas produced to me, as a Paper which he had dropped. I asked him, why he dropped it? He said, a Man might drop a Paper by Chance. I asked him, if Loglin Rennells was his Name? and he said it was.</p>

            . I am the Man who came in and undressed myself, and went to Bed. I lodge in this House, in Bowl Yard: I came home from Work about Seven o'Clock, and this Soldier, (Jackson) and the Shoe-maker (Moore) there. The Shoe-maker enquired for a Man, but neither of them could tell his Name. The Woman knew who they wanted, by the Description they gave of him, and she told them his Name was Ryan . When the Prisoner came in, the Shoe-maker told a Story about his being whipped on board a Man of War, and said he wanted to be enlisted. Says I, they won't take you, - you are not tall enough. Well, says the Prisoner, what have I to do with it? If you will go, you may; I know nothing of the Matter, - I'll have nothing to do with it; but the Shoemaker was urgent to go, and said if the Prisoner knew any Body that would take him, he should be glad. After they had been some time in the House, they and the Prisoner went up Stairs; and I went up some time after to Bed. The Shoemaker was urgent, above Stairs, to get into the King of France's Service, and the Prisoner said, - If you'll go you may, but I'll not advise you to it.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did not you see the Prisoner measure him?</p>
               <p>Barret. No; nor I don't remember his carrying them out of the Room to the Top of the Stairs. They staid in the Room till they all went down together. They had a Dram, I believe, in the Room, but when the Reckoning came to be paid, the Prisoner had no Money, but went o'score for his Dram. They staid in the Room about an Hour, and I was awake all the Time. I had no Curtains to my Bed, nor did I lie with the Prisoner. I am a Carpenter, a labouring Man, and was to rise early the next Morning, but their Talking in the Room kept me awake; - indeed I did not endeavour to compose myself to Sleep, but I was willing to sleep if I could.

               <p>Barret. No, none at all, as I heard, - really I did not hear the King of France's health drank. I have lodged six Weeks in the House; there are three Beds in the Room, and I lay in a little one by myself.</p>

             . I am not akin to the Prisoner, but I was at this House, in Bowl-Yard, the 22d. of October, at Night. When Jackson and Moore came in, I was sitting by the Fire: They asked the Landlady for one Ryan; she told them, he was not there then, but if they'd call in the Morning she'd let him know, they had been there. The Witnesses drank a Pint or two, before the Prisoner came in; And then somebody spoke of a Soldier who had been in a Foreign Country, and the Shoemaker (Moore) said he wanted to go abroad; he shewed us his Back, and told us he had been whipped on Board a Man of War; swearing he would go any where to get his Bread, rather than ever go on board again. Then they asked the Prisoner about going to France; but he said he would not encourage them to any such Thing, - they might go if they would. After this, they went up Stairs for half an Hour, or better; what passed there I can't tell, for I was not in their Company above Stairs.</p>
               <p>Counc . Did you lie in the same Room with the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. No; I lay up two Pair of Stairs, and he lay up one Pair.</p>
               <p>Counc . When Jackson and Moore came first and enquired for Ryan, did she offer to go and fetch any one else to them?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. No; not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Counc . Did she go out of Doors after they came in?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. I cannot say whether she did or no.</p>
               <p>Counc . How long were they in the House, before the Prisoner came into their Company?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. About a Quarter of an Hour: They had drunk two or three Pints of Two-penny, and some Gin, or Anniseed, or Wormwood-Cordial.</p>
               <p>Counc . Did the Maid and the Prisoner come in together?</p>
               <p>Reynolds . I cannot say, - but during the Time they were waiting for Ryan, she was in the Room, - she remained in the Room till the Prisoner came in, except the Time she was drawing their Liquor. - I can't say whether either of the Witnesses went out with the Prisoner, when he came in, - or not.</p>
               <p>Counc . Did the Prisoner know either of the Witnesses?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. No: But the Shoe-maker was drunk and made a Noise, which I suppose was the Reason the Prisoner took them up Stairs, and the Woman of the House was then sick.</p>

            . I have made Hay with the Prisoner in July last, (for Want of better Employment) at Mr. Lewis's , in Tyburn-Road. In October he lodged at a Chairman's, - an Acquaintance of mine - in Bowl-Yard, who sold Liquors in his House. We did not make Hay together above a Week, - none in October; but I believe I have drank with him once at this House, - I believe it was in October, - I cannot be positive - I can't tell whether he paid his Reckoning, but he had Credit in the House, if he had no Money. The chief thing that I came here for, was (as he told me) to swear that his Name was Rennells , and not Ryan.</p>
               <p>Counc . Can you tell upon your Oath, where the Prisoner was, between the Time of Hay-making and October?</p>
               <p>Sommers. I can't indeed. He told me in Hay-making-time, that he had been in France to see an Uncle, and that he intended to go there again that Summer.</p>

On Saturday Night, November<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050030"/> the 10th, he came Home between Ten and Eleven, - I believe 'twas between Eleven and Twelve, and the Prisoner said to him, - So Dick, - Where's the Ten-pence Halfpenny you owe me? Says the Prisoner, - Mrs.Bradshaw, I can't give it you To-night, but if you'll stay till Morning, when I have sold my Greens, by G-d you shall have it. She told him she'd stay no longer, and if he did not pay her that Night, he should not come in; - he should come in there no more, till he brought the Money. There are four Steps at the Door, and he was upon the Top of the Steps; when he told her he could not pay her that Night. I saw the Prisoner (as I was standing in her Shop, near the Door) give him a push down all the four Steps. He stood with his Face toward her's; she push'd him down backwards, and he fell down all the Steps. Then she went to Bed, and the Deceased was shut out for Half an Hour: In which Time I heard him call out, - Mr. Constable! Mr. Constable! (the Landlord of the House) is a poor Man to be murder'd because he has got no Money? He spoke this very faintly, and I hearing him, let him in in the dark, so I can't tell what Condition he was then in, but he complain'd of his Head, and went down to his Cellar. I did not see him again till Seven o'Clock next Morning: He was then sitting upright in the Bed, with his Cloaths on; and he had bled a vast deal; his Shirt and Pillow were very bloody, and his Hair was matted with the Blood that came from his Head. The deceased in the Morning halloo'd out, Thieves! Thieves were come to rob him! That was the Occasion of my going down: I asked him how he did? He said he was very ill, - very cold. There was no Surgeon or Apothecary call'd to help him, but somebody got him an Hot-pot, which he could not drink, he was so weak. There was a Woman washing in the Cellar, and she saw all this as well as I. Mr.Constable cut off his Hair, and threw it down the Vault. The Accident happen'd on Saturday Night, and on Sunday Night, about Six, he died. I was present when he was wash'd: A Woman who liv'd at Constable's wash'd him, but she is not here. I saw his Head was bloody, and the Blood came from the back part of his Head; but the Hair was not cut off so near as that I could see any Wound. There was no Coroner call'd, and but one Searcher; and when she came, Mr. Constable call'd me up Stairs, and bid me take no Notice of the Cut in his Head. The deceased was drunk when he fell down, but not so much as to be insensible of what he said, or did; and I don't believe the Prisoner push'd him down wilfully; she did not do it with any great Force.</p>

After which I asked the Woman of the House, if she wanted any Greens, if she did, the deceased would bring her some? She said, he might if he pleased; and he went out and brought her his Greens, and she bought four Savoys and six Colliflowers. On Sunday I sent to the Deceased's Cellar for a Head of Sallory , and heard that Dick (the Deceased )<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050031"/> was fuddled, and was not up.

He told her he could not, and at that Instant I turn'd into the Back-Room, and he was push'd down the Steps.

             . I came Home (to Constable's House) on Saturday Night, between Ten and Eleven, and found the Deceased sitting in the Chimney-Corner: He called for hot Drink, Tranter warm'd it for him, and he seem'd brisk. I sat up in his Company till between One and Two. At One, I told him 'twas time to go to Bed; but he desired to stay longer. At last he took a Candle and went down to Bed; I follow'd him down, to see he did no Mischief with his Candle: He stood Sea sawing upon the Stairs, and told me, he was so drunk that he could not get into his Bed. I desir'd him to take Care of his Candle; for, says I, if we should all be burn'd in our Beds, - what shall we do. So I came up, and desir'd Tranter to look after him. In the Morning, the Prisoner went down, and gave him a Dram of Anniseed. He complain'd of no Wound given him by the Prisoner, nor did I see any Blood.</p>


               <p>Tranter . This was the Night before the Prisoner was push'd down.</p>
               <p>Atkins . No; 'twas the very same Night.</p>

            . The Deceased and I were great Acquaintance: We were Partners, and sold Fish and Greens together; he was the first that let me into the Business. On Sunday Morning I went to his Cellar, and serv'd Belville a Ha'p'orth of Greens. I called, Dick! Dick! but nobody answering, I push'd open the Cellar door, and went down, and found him lying stark-naked on the Ground, with his Knees up to his Mouth. I lifted him up, and put him in Bed, and call'd Mr. Constable . He came down with another Friend, and gave him Part of a Pint of hor Liquor , with Gin or Brandy, or something, put into it. I saw no Blood on him, - there was a Scar upon his Head, just upon his Crown, - you may call it a Scratch, and I believe the Pebble stones behind him might do that, for I found him lying upon them. When the hot Pint came down, he look'd very hard at me, but could only say, - Joe! very cold! - very cold, Joe! I staid with him till Four o'Clock; then I left him.</p>

             . I went down into the Cellar on Sunday Morning, and saw the Deceased leaning on his Elbow: I ask'd him, what ail'd him? Mrs. Constable, says he, I am so cold, I am like a Post, - feel me! I took hold of him, and found him very cold and chill'd, all one Side of him. Upon which I bid Tranter give him a Glass of Anniseed, and I supported his Head while he drank it. God bless you, Mrs. Constable , said he, I am cold as a Post. He made no Complaints, and as for Blood, - I saw none. I have known the Prisoner about seven or eight Months, and never heard but that she was and honest virtuous Body. When Tranter came from the Elephant and Castle, where the Body was brought, after it had been taken up, the People asked her how she could swear the poor Woman's Life away wrongfully? and she said, she would not have done it if she had not been prompted to it, and if she had not done it, others would.</p>

            . The Prisoner is an entire Stranger to me; but I live opposite to this House: And this Tranter coming to my Shop for a Quartern of Tea, told me that Dick who sold Greens was dead. Then God rest his Soul, says I. He came in late, she said, on Saturday Night, and was so drunk he could not stand; that he complain'd of being cold, and drank some warm Ale: but still complaining of Cold, he went to Bed, and died suddenly; and now my Mistress is laying him out; and washing him: I am surprized, says she, how they can touch him, he's all over Seabs s and Sores. She said nothing of his having been push'd down, nor of his being bloody, but that he was a frightful Corps.</p>

             the 15th of September, between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock at Night, I was robb'd of all the Things mentioned in the Indictment. They were taken out of my Shop in <placeName id="t17391205-53-crimeloc256">Water Lane, in Fleet-street</placeName>

I was gone to Bed, but my Wife was in the Shop, at the same time; though she did not miss the Things till between Seven and Eight the next Morning. On the 24th of October last the Prisoner came into the Shop, (I was present at the same time) and he asked my Wife, if she had not lost some Tea, and two Tea-cannisters? yes. Did not you lose a Coffee-cannister, and some Coffee? Yes. Did not you lose two Brass Candlesticks and a Drudging-box, and Pepper-box? Yes. Did you not lose a light Peruke , and a Poker? Yes. Was not your Money-drawer like to have been broke open? Yes. Why then, Mrs.Foster, I am the Thief. I am not drunk; I come to tell you that I am the Thief, and here I am, and will stay till you get a Constable. My Wife asked him, where she sat when he took the Things; you sat, (said he) asleep by the Fire-side. She told him, she had rather sit down with the Loss, than have any Trouble, and so she bid him take himself away; but he damn'd his Eyes, and said, If you don't prosecute me, I'll prosecute you, and will make it cost you 40 l. he was then very sober, and wrote down an Account of the Things we had lost. Upon this I sent to see for an Officer, but we could not get one, nor find a Magistrate at home, so we let him go about his Business. On the Saturday after I took him again, and carried him before Mr. Alderman Lambert , where he deny'd all.</p>

               <p>Mr. Foster. I have known the Prisoner several Years: He is a Fellow that follows the Coal-Carts, he's what they call a Scuffle-hunter, and lives in Hanging-sword-Alley; that's no very good Place.</p>

He told them, They endeavoured to break open the Till with the Poker, but he would not tell who he meant by - They I asked him, if he knew what he was about? yes. Why, (says I) this is a Thing of bad Consequence. I know it, (says he) - I shall go to New Prison. I told him, no, he would go to the Compter: But he said, he knew better, for Evidences went to New Prison, I thought it look'd as if he intended to have made himself an Evidence. He told them, he knew he must go to Prison somewhere, and insisted on their charging a Constable with him, and would not stir out of the House till an Officer came. Upon this I went for a Constable, but the Constable told me, he was busy, and as the Prisoner came voluntarily, we might go with him ourselves before a Magistrate; and we went accordingly to my Lord Mayor's, and to Sir

               <p>Richard Cheshire . On the 14th of November, between Six and Seven at Night, I was attacked on <placeName id="t17391205-56-crimeloc269">Hounslow-Heath</placeName>

Where are you going? said he: What's that to you, said I. D-mn you, said he, I know you are going to Staines ; I know you by your great Coat. I told him, if he had a Mind to have my Company, he must ride faster, and I laid my Head down, clapp'd Spurs to my Horse, and endeavour'd to get off, but he cry'd, - d - mn you, if you don't stop, I'll shoot you dead. I made no Reply, but kept digging my Horse, and got Ground of him: He still hallo'd out, if I did not stand he would shoot me; and upon looking back, I saw him in the Road following me, and holding out a Pistol. He d-mn'd me, and I d-mn'd him, and bid him come along; for as I was well mounted, I did not fear him. But on the Top of the Heath, my Horse cut his Legs, and could gallop no farther. I thought if I surrender'd they would use me ill, so I clapp'd my Gloves under my Thigh, and prepar'd to refill . When the Man (who pursued me) got up to me, he turn'd his Horse round, and said, - D-mn you, why did you ride away? and clapp'd a Pistol to my Mouth, which I threw out of his Hand, and then struck him off his Horse, by a back-handed Blow, with the But-end of my Whip; then I endeavour'd to jump on him with my Horse, and to tread his Guts out, but my Horse jump'd over him, and another Man immediately came up, and said, - d - mn you, if you don't surrender I'll shoot you dead, I caught hold of his Collar, and then a third Man attack'd me on a white-fac'd Horse, and swore he'd shoot me, and fir'd off his Pistol. I d-mn'd 'em, and said, - if I must be robb'd, I must. They took from me a Silver Watch, a Guinea, and a Sixpence; and the last Man who came up to me, shot me. It was dark, and if the three Men were here present, I could not swear to their Faces. While they were robbing me, a poor Man came out of the Powder-Mills to assist me, and the Man on the white-fac'd Horse d-mn'd him, and gallop'd to him, and let fly, and wounded him in the Arm. After this they all got off, and the poor Man got back to the House to have his Wound dress'd. My Bridle was cut all to Pieces; my Coat shot thro', and a piece of my Shirt was shot off; but my Bridle having a Weymouth Bit, with two Headstalls and four Reins, I took them all up in my Hand together, and as I went on, I saw a grey Horse in the Road with a Saddle and Bridle on him. He would not let me catch him, but I drove him in the Road before me to Beont , and then cried, - Stop a Highwayman's Horse. The Horse was stopp'd, and carried to the Black-Dog; I examin'd him in the Stable, and told the People I had been robb'd, but I had given one of the Rogues a damnable Knock on the Left Side of his Head. The People of the House tell me I fainted away in the Stable; - I don't remember that, - but the Thoughts of my narrow Escape with Life, made me faint away twice in the House. I had not been long at the Black-Dog, before a Man came from the Prince William's Head , and demanded the grey Horse. I said no one should have him, but the Owner: Upon which the Man went back, and the Prisoner came for the Horse, with a Knock on his Head, which appear'd to be fresh done, and 'twas on the Top of his Forehead. I thought the Horse I drove to the Black-Dog, was the same the Man who attack'd me rode on, because it was a grey Horse, but I cannot swear to it. When the Prisoner came to demand it, he behav'd very civilly: He said, he had been robb'd himself, and that he belong'd to Mr.Barham of Staines. He and I drank together, and I think we spent 4 s. 6 d. or 5 s. a-piece in the House. I asked him, how he came by that Money, if he had been robb'd? He told me, he had lost one Guinea of his Money in London, but had found 6 s. or 12 s. (I don't remember which) in his Plad Waistcoat Pocket. After we had drank together, he offer'd to go Home with me; but I took two Men with me, (who rode on one Horse) and bid them ride before the Prisoner. In sont-Lane he got past them; I caught him again, at the Turning on this Side the Turnpike. He was to have gone with me to my House at Staines; but when we came to the Town, he said he had borrowed a Whip at the Anchor, and must stop there to return it. I went in at the Anchor with him, and there charged an Officer with him, and had him before Sir

I never went to Mr. Barham , to enquire if the Prisoner was his Servant, for several People said they knew him to be his Gardner, but I never saw him before in my Life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Distance was you from this Town ( Belfont ) when you was robb'd?</p>
               <p>Chester. About three Quarters of a Mile, and I discover'd the Horse without a Rider about 40 or 60 Yards from the Spot on which I was robb'd. He was about thirteen Hands and a half, or fourteen Hands high.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not the Landlord of the Black Dog, where we drank together, a Constable?</p>
               <p>Chester. Yes; but I did not know it then, else I should have charged him with the Prisoner then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I tell you I had been robb'd, and knock'd off my Horse?</p>
               <p>Chester. Yes, after which we spent 4 s. and 6 d. a-piece.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you first charge me with having attack'd you?</p>
               <p>Chester. At Staines ; I did not charge him at Belfont ; I was too much 'frighted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You say you went forward to Staines, and that I attempted to ride away: Had you charged me with attempting to rob you, before that?</p>
               <p>Chester. No; but we were to go solely, and he rode hard, and I caught him twice, and charged him with attempting to ride away: He said, he would go my Pace, to my own House, and I should charge an Officer with him. As we went along, I asked him, why he went away; I can't tell what Answer he made, but the Men rode before him again, and he rode away again, - I rode after him, and then we went altogether to Staines.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not my Stock torn?</p>
               <p>Chester. He said they had taken his Stock-buckle. - I thought I saw something ragged about his Neck, - about his Stock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had I any Arms about me?</p>
               <p>Chester. I did not search the Prisoner. If he had had any Arms, he would have been a Fool to have brought them with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How many Times were you before Sir

             ?</p>
               <p>Chester. Three Times; and the Prisoner attended every Time. The first Time Sir Thomas (on Account of his being Mr. Barham's Servant) took Fourscore Pounds Bail, and the second Time there was 200 l. Bail given for him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How came you to see the Pistol in the Man's Hand, when you say it was so dark?</p>
               <p>Chester. The Pistol shone bright, and I saw it. I told -the People at Belfont , that I had knock'd a Pistol out of a Man's Hand, and that my Glove fell near the Place. A Man went out, and found the Glove, but not the Pistol.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said, - he had given the Man a Knock on the left Side of the Head, - the Blow I had was on the right Side of my Head.</p>
               <p>Chester. I struck the Man back-handed, and as his Face was toward mine, the Blow must be given on the right-Side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If I was the Man who first attack'd him near the Powder-Mills, he says his Horse rode fastest at that time; then how can it be supposed that my Horse could outride his afterward? My Horse was very heavily shod, and that was the Reason of his growing resty; but when he got before me, my Horse went better, - so will any resty Horse.</p>

            . It was very frosty that Night, - hard Weather, and I heard Horses galloping hard: By and by there was a Cry of Highwaymen! Thieves! Rougues! Murder! I went out, and saw a Horse shoot out of the Road; hey, says I, you'll break your Neck! Stop that Horse there, says Chester, I have been robb'd, and have knock'd a Man off that Horse, and I believe if I have Help to go upon the Heath he can't get off. I stopp'd the Horse, and before I could get him into the Stable, one Blake came up and said, - the Man who own'd that Horse was at his House Chester said, - then let the Man come to me for-it ; so we put the Horse into the Stable, and Chester fainted away; we got him in Doors, and he fainted away again: Then he wanted me to go home with him, and told me, he would pay me for it. But the Prisoner coming in, and asking for the Man that wanted him, I told him that was the Man, (Chester.) The Prisoner asked him, if he wanted him: Says Chester, I have been robb'd; I want somebody. So have I, says the Prisoner; and after this they lat down, and drank together, for three Quarters of an Hour, and at last Chester told me, I should go home with him. The Prisoner said, there was no Occasion for that; for as they were both going the same Way, and had been Fellow-sufferers, he would lose his Blood before he should be wrong'd any more. Chester would not accept of his Proposal, but desired me to go with him, and another young Fellow who was present offering to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050035"/> go likewise, he got up behind me, and we all went out together. When we got to Staines , Chester took him into Custody, and the Prisoner asked him what he meant? I assisted in seizing him, and should have done so by Chester if the Prisoner had charged him. He said he belong'd to 'Squire Barham , but I knew not 'Squire Barham , nor either of the Persons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I attempt to get away?</p>
               <p>Sherman . He rode away foremost very hard; - he rode away twice, but once he made a very hard Push, - but I don't say he rode hard with a Design to get off. His Horse could not out-ride Chester's at fair Play; nor did he shew any Sign of Fear at Belfont . He was all over Blood about the Head, and the Button-holes of his Stock were broke.</p>

            . I have work'd at the Powder-Mills twenty Years, and happened to be coming out at the Gate when this Disturbance happened. I thought somebody had fell down in the Road; and cry'd, - I'll come to your Assistance this Minute . I ran up to the Place, and in a Moment a Man turn'd his Horse upon me, and said, - D - mn you, keep off, and at that Instant shot me into my Arm. I heard them cry, - d - mn you, where's your Watch, - and d - m you, I'll search you. I can't tell who they were; I wish I could, for I have suffer'd much by them. I saw three Men on Horseback; two of them had got Chester between them, but I saw no grey Horse. As soon as I was shot, I went to the Mills, to get my Wound dress'd, and the Slug came out of my Arm with a Piece of my Shirt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On Wednesday the 14th of November, I came from Staines to London. As I came along, I call'd at Mr. Green's at Brentford , about 25 Pear-trees and 25 Cherry-trees, which my Master (Mr. Barham) had bespoke for our Orchard. I put up my Horse (a little grey Pad) at the Nag's-Head in Hedge-Lane, till Four o'Clock; then I set out on my Return home, and the Man of the Inn persuaded me to leave a Guinea (which I had about me) with him. I rode alone till I came to the Turnpike, and 'twas terrible dark, very frosty, and no Stars. The Men at the Turnpike told me, 'twas Five o'Clock, and thought I should get home by Seven. On Hannslow-Heath I heard two Men coming towards me on Horseback, but I could not perceive the Colour of their Horses: As soon as they came up to me, one of them got off his Horse, and caught hold of my Bridlo, and fil'd their Pistols at me. I cry'd out Murder, and wheel'd my Horse away with all my Might; but before I came to the Powder-Mill Bridge, they came again on my right Side, and knock'd me off my Horse, and robb'd me: One of them d - mn'd me, and asked me why I rode away, and whether I imagined they rode with Broomsticks. They robbed me of fifteen Shillings, a Stock-buckle, and my Gloves: Which was all I had about me except a few Half-pence and five or six Shillings, which were in my Waistcoat-pocket , and which I saved by putting my Hand thro' the Folds of my Coat and pulling it aside. After I was robbed, I thought to have catched my Horse, but could not; 'twas so dark, I could not see him, tho' he never was out of my hearing. When I came to Belfont , I got a Man to help me catch my Horse, and told Mr. Blake at The Duke's Head, that I had been robbed, and that I thought the Men who had robbed me were following me. Upon Enquiry, it was found to be only Mr. Chester, who had drove my Horse into the Town. I went to him, and we drank a Bottle of Mountain, and two Bottles of Port, as Fellow sufferers together. Then I desired to have my Horse, and said, if Mr. Chester would go home, I would go with him: He did not say whether he would or not, but asked another Man to go with him. So we all set out together, and in Belfont-lane , my Horse happened to go before theirs; but before I got to the Turnpike, they halloo'd me, and I stopped and answered. From the Turnpike we rode together, till we came to the Road that leads to my Master's House; then Chester asked me to go to the Swan; I declined going, and upon that they seized me. They had not charg'd me at all, before they laid hold of me.</p>

            . I keep the Duke's Head at Belfont . On the 14th of November, the Prisoner came to my House in the Evening, with his Head broke, and his Face all over Blood. I hope, says he, you are Christians, and that you'll use me like a Christian. - I have been robbed on this Side the Powder Mills, and have been used very barbarously: My Horse is gone, pray send after it. I did so, and found the Horse was stopped at the Black Dog; and Word was sent, that the Owner of it must come there: The Prisoner said he would go immediately. His Head was swelled; which seemed to have been occasioned by a Blow with a Stick or a Whip; and there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050036"/> was a Cut in it like a Prick with a Sword or a Bayoner. He proposed to go by himself, to Chester, but I went with him, and as soon as he got into the House, he asked who wanted him? Chester said he wanted somebody; and, says the Prisoner, so do I. I have been robbed, says Chester; and so have I, said the Prisoner. After this they sat down, and drank two Bottles of Wine: I staid half an Hour with them, and then left them together. This was at a Constable's House, and where I have seen Chester stop and drink before this Time.</p>
               <p>Sir Thomas Reynolds. Chester did not charge the Prisoner with robbing him: He only said he was robbed by a Man on a Grey Horse. He could el her swear to the Man, nor to the Horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barham , Mr. Musle, Mr. Sedgewick, Mr. Morrison , and Mr. Read, gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest, industrious, sober Man. <rs id="t17391205-56-verdict270" type="verdictDescription">

The next Morning I examined my Drawers in the Bed-chamber, and missed nine Guineas, five 36 Shilling Pieces and a Moidore, which was all the Money I had there, except a Moidore: On the Thursday following, I took her to Task, but she'd confess nothing. No, said she, - confess and be hanged. Upon this I turned her out of Doors , and bid her be gone about her Business. On the Sunday following I was sent for to her Lodging, and she confessed she took my Money , and to clear her Husband of being concerned with her, she owned she put the Money in his Pocket. I had lost twenty Pounds all but four Shillings. She owned taking the Money, but said it was not quite so much, and she hoped I would be favourable . Her Husband asked her, - No , do I know any thing of the Money's being taken? No (she said) I took it, and put it into your Pocket.</p>

Mr. Groom found it himself, and was vastly surprised: 'Twas in two Papers in the Breeches Pockets; there was nine Guineas, a Thirty-six Shilling Piece, a Moidore, and eighteen Shillings in Silver. He sent for Mr. Sparrow , and delivered it to him, while the Prisoner lay upon the Bed, and to all Appearance was dying: For after Mr. Sparrow had turn'd her off, on account of this Robbery, she came home, and got blooded, and having opened the Bandage, she let herself bleed almost to Death. When her Husband found this out, he sent for me, and wondering what could induce her to do such a Thing, I told him she was charged with this Robbery: He searched, and found the Money.

After we had miss'd the Goods, one Mr. Andrews , a Carman, came upon the Keys with his Cart, and brought with him the Firkin and the Prisoner. We always land our Butter from on board the Hoys before Day-light; and as soon as I had landed them, I told thirty-one Firkins . In half and Hour afterward, I miss'd one, mark'd D.D. No.4. My Father marks his Goods with D.D. because he has a Brother named Joseph, and if our Goods were mark'd I.D. we should not know them from his.</p>

             . On the 22d of October, about Five in the Morning, I met the Prisoner with a Firkin of Butter on his Back, by the Postern on Tower-Hill. Hey, says I, where are you going with that Firkin so soon this Morning? He told, me, he was going to Iron-Gate with it, in order to carry it by Water to one Jones's at Deptford . I ask'd him from whence he brought it; he said he had it from Butolph-Wharf , from a Waterman. Aye, says I, but I am afraid you stole it yourself, and I bid my Man (who was with my Cart) get me a Candle, and when I saw the Marks, I knew it to be Mr. Delafield's ; so I threw it up in my Cart, and took hold of the Prisoner's Shoulder to bring him back. As we came along, he endeavour'd to stip from me. Nay, now, says I, I find you are a Rogue, and I gave him a Polt with my Whip. When I came to Dice-Key, I found them searching for the Butter. Here, here, says I, here's your Butter, and here's the Thief. When he was carry'd before Sir

On the 27th of October, the Prisoner (who used to go on Errands in the House) came up into my Room with a Gold Ring enamel'd, upon her Finger. I asked her, whose it was? She said, it was Mrs. Renward's. I bid her carry it down Stairs again, and put it into Mrs. Renward's Room. She went down, and said she would do so. After this Renward gave her a Guinea to fetch her a Gill of Wine, and she not returning again, I was employ'd to search after her. The third Time I was at her Lodging, I found her, and she had deck'd herself up very handsomely. I ask'd her, where the Rings were? She told me, she knew nothing of them. As I had seen one of them before upon her Finger, I got Mr. Jones at the Elephant and Castle in Fleet Lane, to take Charge of her; and then she acknowledged, she had taken one of them. I took her at her Lodging over against the Three Daggers upon Saffron-Hill.</p>

It was fast as we could make it, but it had receiv'd such Damage by a Cart, that any one might get into it, provided the Bars and the Iron-work should be wrench'd. The Bars I found wrench'd, and I suppose the Prisoner got into my House that Way. I lost between Three and Four Pounds out of a Cupboard in the Back Counting-house. I had bolted the Door at the Top of the Stairs (that lead into the House) myself, when I went to Bed, but I found it open. The Counting-house Door was latch'd, but not lock'd. In the Morning I found the Lock upon the Cupboard wrench'd, and it hung only by one Nail. The Prisoner was my Servant, and I suspect him, because I sent him out on an Errand that Night' and he took the best of his Cloaths away with him. My Son, another Servant and I, sat up for him, but he did not (as we know of) come home that Night, and next Morning I found the Money gone, and the Door at the Top of the Cellar Stairs, and the Cupboard Door broke open, and my Money gone. My Husband at this Time was out of Town.</p>

About Eleven o'Clock I saw him at her Door, and told him his Mistress sat up for him: He did not care to knock at the Door, so I told him, I would. No, says he, you shall not, - I'll get down the Cellar Window. The Iron Bars were fell so much, that any body might get down, and he said he would sit in the Cellar till his Master Franky (his Mistress's Son) got up; and so down he got directly, but I know nothing of his getting out again. He was taken about seventeen Days afterwards, and was carried before Mr. Adderman Parsons.</p>

He confess'd Abundance of these Things; I can't name all the Particulars. He work'd in a Garret next the Room in which the Plate was kept; and he owned he begun with the Cover of the Cup, and that he hammer'd it down upon his Lap-stone, and then knocked off the Handles of the Cup: The Candlesticks (he said) were the next Things he took. I can't say I heard him mention how he got the Door open, but he confess'd he took the Plate out of this Garret into his Room, - the Knives and Forks, the Cup, Salvers, and Candlesticks, and had sold them to one

            . On Saturday Night, the 24th of November, about Eight at Night, I was sent for to a Room up two Pair of Stairs, in a House in Hanging-Sword-Alley, in Fleet-street. Mr. Haslop had told me of the Affair some time before, and had laid wait to catch the Prisoner. When I came there, I found two Men, a Woman, the Prisoner, and Mr. Haslop, who was surpriz'd with Joy, at having taken him. He at first would confess nothing to us: But I took him down Stairs into another Room, and in a little Time Mr. Barnard coming to us, I left him and the Prisoner together. Soon after this, Mr. Barnard came and told me, he had confess'd. Then I took him into Custody, and in my hearing he own'd how he open'd the Door. He said, there was a Padlock upon it, which he open'd with a Nail, and the common Lock, he strain'd open with his Breech. He confess'd he carry'd a small Piece of Plate out first, and offer'd it ten or twenty Goldsmiths at least, but none would buy it. At last he offer'd it to Pope, and he bought it of him for 3 s. 6 d. an Ounce. He told us, That he afterwards carry'd the Cover of the Cup to the same Place, and sold it him for 3 s. 6 d. or 4 s. an Ounce, - I can't tell which. He mention'd the Cup, the Cover, and the Candlesticks, and said he had bruised them, and carry'd them all at different Times to Mr. Pope. Upon this Confession, I had him to my Lord-Mayor's, but he was not at home: From thence I carry'd him to Sir William Billers, and he was so good as to give us a Hearing: Before him the Prisoner confess'd all the Things, and describ'd the Man he had sold them to, - Mr. Pope, at the Queen's Head in Newgate street. He confess'd all the Things in general before Pope's Face, - Six Candlesticks, a Cup and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050040"/> Cover, and the Knives and Forks; and told Pope, that when he took one of the Knives out of the Handle, to weigh the rest by, the Cement flew all over him. I carry'd him to the Compter that Night, and on Monday I had him before Mr. Alderman Westly , where he confess'd the whole Affair again; but Alderman Westly referr'd him to Sir William; and on Tuesday I carry'd him to Guild-hall, and Sir William being obliged to go out upon Business, we were heard by Sir

He said he first broke off the Handles of the Cup, and offered them to all the Goldsmiths in Foster-Lane, but none of them would buy them. At last he offered them to Pope, and he bought them, without making any Scruple. After this he said, he bruised the rest of the Plate upon his Lapstone, and carry'd it to Pope, who gave him 3 s. 6 d. an Ounce for some, and 4 s. for other Pieces: The Salvers, the Candle sticks, and the Top of the Cup, he mentioned in particular, and that he had bruied the Plate to get it out of the House undiscovered. The Dozen of Knives and Forks he said he sold to Pope all at one Time.</p>
