Then Goodwin cried out, Murder him, shoot the dog! Then I cried out, Murder! thieves ! Some men heard me, and said, Where are you? Here, says I.</p>

               <p>J. Flemming. To the best of my knowledge, he said, Damn you, your money. This was at the time he struck me with the pistol. Goodwin was close to him at that time; he did not say any thing then, but he struck me several times. The man I called came up to my assistance, and they ran away. In about nine or ten minutes time, they came into the field again, and we took them both.

I was sent for about a quarter after seven to Sir John Oldcastle's, to take the prisoners into custody; I searched the prisoners, and found this (producing a pistol tinder-box) upon Noon; I asked him who it belonged to?

We let his mother and he go up into a corner of the room together for six or seven minutes; then she said, who can hang my son, for he found it. I was along with Mr. Temple's young man when we found this waistcoat in Ainsworth's garret; it was hanging up to dry; it was just dyed black.</p>

My servants used to tell me the prisoner used to often come after the warehouses were shut up, and sometimes say he had left his waistcoat, sometimes his cap, or hat, and so go in for them. I have told him oftentimes I did not know what he meant by such behaviour, and ordered my servants not to let him go in any more after the warehouses were shut up; yet I still employed him, till Mr. Noble told my son there was some Hamburgh yarn sold in Spital-fields. Upon inquiring, Mr. Goodwin's servant told me, they had sold some to a weaver, that is now in court; the servant came to my house, who said the prisoner was the man that brought the yarn there; upon which I gave a constable charge of the prisoner. The prisoner said, it was some damaged yarn that I had given him about two years ago. I had given him, I believe, fourteen or fifteen hundred weight of damaged yarn, which had been drove back by bad weather, and stunk like poison, and was rotten, which we tried skain by skain; some by shaking with a jerk, the ends would fly out, and discover them to be rotten; the others we pulled by twenty, thirty, or more threads at a time, and all that broke: we flung the skain down. There was never a whole skain in what I gave the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me twenty-five or twenty-six hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. If I had given him the whole of that parcel, it would not have amounted to above a ton; but I did not give him the whole. The prisoner confessed the selling thirty-six bundles of yarn : I, knowing all to be rotten I gave him, said, I fansied he had some in his house. He said he was willing to have his lodging searched. He lived in Crown-alley, Moorfields; we went with him; when we got into Moorfields, he was for going to Mr. Goodwin's, in Hog-lane. I said, we are not going there, we are going to your house. He said, we should not go there without a search-warrant. I said, this looks very guilty, after you have invited us to go, you will not let us. Then he said we might go. When we came to his lodgings, he opened the door; there I took up a quantity of yarn. The moment I laid my hand upon it, he laid hold on it, and laid it on the bed, and sat upon it, and swore we should not search that parcel without a search-warrant. The constable then said, he had opened his door and admitted us in, and he insisted upon seeing that. At last he suffered as to see it. I said, this is very good yarn, Boroughs; this is some of an extraordinary nature; how came you by this? He said, I acknowledge that was your yarn; but I bought it of one of your servants, one Nathaniel Hargrove, my footman that had been, but went from me in September was twelve-month to my son-in-law, by my recommendation. I had given him some damaged Hamburgh yarn when with me; I can swear this was not part of that yarn ( the yarn found in the prisoner's house produced in court). This is not Hamburgh yarn, but comes from another part of Germany. We took the prisoner before my Lord Mayor, there he equivocated, and said it was not that man that sold it to him, but one Alfusious, a German, who had been my book-keeper, and is now in Germany, gave it him, as it was damaged. I don't know any merchant in all England that imports this sort of yarn but myself; my son was upon his travels, and he sent me this out of Germany, as a particular sort of yarn, and this is also all sound. As for the Hamburgh yarns, that we all import. There are five or six of us of the business.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner better than two years. I was at the opening the first parcel of yarn, there was a great deal of good among it that was saleable and sound.</p>

               <p>Juno. Upon my oath it was; three parts of it had never been opened when I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Juno. I am a Pastry-cook, but had worked at Mr. Farmer's.</p>
               <p>Q. to Deponthien. Did you pay duty for these Goods?</p>
               <p>Deponthien. When the goods were landed, I ordered them to open them at the Custom-house, and throw the damaged goods away, but they would not do that, but allow me seven-eights of the duty; there were some bundles that were damaged which I did not give the prisoner, but when I came to examine them there was not one single skain of them but what was damaged.</p>

I taxed him with taking my handkerchief; he had got a silk one in his hand, and said he was going over the way for some ham, and that he was a poor apprentice boy; I took him into the inn, and sent the drawer out with a candle; he returned, and brought my handkerchief, which he said he found lying on the ground where I directed him, at the place where I took hold on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after you took hold on the prisoner?</p>
               <p>T. Salter. It was in less than five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner own he took it?</p>
               <p>T. Salter. No, he did not. He told me he was apprentice to Mr. Alcock, a smith, in Swan-alley; I sent for him; he gave him a very indifferent character.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel his hand at your pocket?</p>
               <p>T. Salter. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that drawer that brought in your handkerchief?</p>
               <p>T. Salter. He being a servant, is gone home, and is not yet returned.</p>

               <p>I was walking behind the gentleman, he turned, and said, My lad, you have got my handkerchief; I must take and search you; there were two or three other lads by; I was going for six-pennyworth of ham.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Hurdle; on the first day of Barnet races, I came to London with a load of hay. Going to Whitechapel market, the prisoner came to me in <placeName id="t17541204-12-crimeloc63">Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you sell it to him?</p>

               <p>R. Deman. No, he did not; but I said I must either have money or a note, as I always have either one or the other. After it was unloaded, he had me to a butcher, who wrote a note by the prisoner's order; he said he could neither write nor read.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you write ?</p>
               <p>R. Deman. I can neither write nor read. He gave me the note the butcher wrote.</p>

He was put in Bridewell for another such fact, and I heard of it, and I took Deman to see if he knew him; when we came there, the prisoner was making water: as soon as Deman saw him, as we were going in at the gate, he said, that is the man that is making water against the tub.</p>

In the morning when I got up I could find no watch. I missed my snuff-box out of my coat-pocket; after breakfast I inquired after them, but the boy going down into the cellar, brought up this handkerchief, knife, and bludgeon; ( producing them ) the bludgeon was cut out of a stable-broom. There were meat and bread in the handkerchief. Upon examination I found all the doors fast.</p>

There is a confession in court which will open the whole affair. (

            . I live at Wallingford, am a barber and peruke-maker; I went into a neighbour's house on the 12th of October last, about nine or ten in the morning, there were the two prisoners. A neighbour of mine said to one of them, if you have a mind to do any thing in that affair, let the other sell his watch, which was Preston. I found there had been a man about buying it of him. I asked to see it; Preston pulled it out, and I looked upon it, and asked him how he valued it, he said at 3 l. I asked, what do you sell it for, gold or Pinchbeck? he said, d - n his blood, or some such words, if it was gold he would not sell it for 3 l, I looked upon it to be gold, so took them up on suspicion of stealing it. I took them before a justice, who sells gold rings and silver things; he looked upon the watch, and said it was gold. Then I went to the mayor of Wallingford and told him of the affair, and he ordered me to bring them before him, which I did. Preston told the mayor one Duke Dorril died, and left the watch to him for his wages. Then they were both committed on suspicion of stealing it. (The watch produced in court by

We have two rooms; I found a trunk was carried out of the first room to that backwards, and broke open; I found a knife near the trunk broke, which I had seen in the prisoner's possession before, and know'd it to be his knife, upon which I have got the knife in my pocket here now. (He produced it.)</p>
               <p>Eleanor M'Gann. I am wife to this man; I rent the ground-floor he speaks of. My husband does not know what I lost, or what I gained; he is only a new comer to me on friday last. I left my room door locked between eleven and twelve, and came home at night betwixt six and seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge with you at the time you lost the money?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. He did not, but he did about a year ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the court what you lost.</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. When I came home I found the door broke open; I called to my next neighbour, and said I, lord, my door is broke open, and I have lost every farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. Sir, I'll tell you that. I hope you'll give me leave to speak.</p>
               <p>Court. By all means.</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. I missed my trunk and box out of my own room, observe I have one room within another, the sheets and blankets were gone off the bed. I went backwards and found the box and trunk, both the locks were broke upon the bed, and one of my own knives I found by the box on the bed. I can't swear to nobody; but they took a guinea in gold, and eleven shilling in silver, and an apron, and carried away my linen, which I value to upwards of nine shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you put your money before you missed it?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. The guinea lay naked on the bottom of the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. What linen did you lose in the whole? name them.</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. I lost two sheets, two aprons, and two handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. No more was gone out of my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. Why, I'll tell you that. My husband got up and went into the room and found this knife, and he brought it to me to ask me if I had seen it before, and I said I never saw it in my life before. I have no other reason to suspect the prisoner at the bar; I don't want to wrong any creature.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of these things found upon the prisoner?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. No, I hope he would not wear sheets, or aprons, or handkerchiefs in the street, please your lordship, if he so kind to hear me, the prisoner is well acquainted with me; he knew what I had almost as well as I did myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been lately in your house?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. He was four nights in it of late, and he was the man that had nobody to give him a good word in the world that had dealings with him, but I never saw him guilty of any thing belonging to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him before a magistrate?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. An't please ye, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he charged there with taking any of your goods?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. No, not in my presence, except he had the money in his pocket, he had nothing, belonging to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Consider, and give an answer. Was he charged before the justice with having any of your goods?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. No, nothing in the world, only leaving the knife in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What said he to that?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. I can't say, for I never saw the knife before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say nothing about the knife?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. He said before the alderman that he lost a knife before, and that he had a mind<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040014"/> to give his wife a licking for it; said the alderman, how long is it ago? he said two or three days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. This was on Monday last.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you charge the prisoner with before the alderman?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. He was charged, as I am telling you, he gave an answer he lost the knife two or three days before that, and that he'd give his wife a licking for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all that was said?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not charged about the goods?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. He was not as I heard of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he accused before the alderman of taking these goods?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. He was not of any thing that I lost, either money or goods as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he accused of before the alderman when you carried him there?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. He owned he was guilty to the knife, and I know'd no one knew the house, or our way of living better than he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not have temper to hear, consider of the questions, and make proper answers. What did you accuse the prisoner with?</p>
               <p>E. M'Gann. Please your lordship I can't answer it. I do not know what is the business I am talking about; I never saw him breaking the door, nor a half worth in his custody, and so I know nothing about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of their being robbed?</p>
               <p>J. Burk. I saw nobody a robbing them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see?</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you see the knife?</p>
               <p>J. Burk. To the best of my knowledge I saw it before in the prisoner's custody in my room. I can say no farther.</p>
               <p>Q. How did those locks to the box and trunk appear to be opened?</p>
               <p>J. Burk. I was not there to see. I know the mark is withinside, the lid might be opened by a small instrument, as a pair of scissars or a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see this knife in your room?</p>
               <p>J. Burk. He lay with me two or three nights.</p>

            . Gentlemen, I came out of St. Paul's Church-yard betwixt six and seven o'clock last friday night; I went to the baker's that lives in Black-friars to light a candle, and left my basket of fruit at the door, Gentlemen. Eleanor M'Gann came at the same time. When I came again, Gentlemen, she said, what shall I do, my door is broke open. I went in with her into the farther room, Gentlemen, to see if the sheets were gone, and we found the box and trunk broke open, and what was in the box was emptied out upon the bed, Gentlemen; the prisoner that they took up lay two or three nights in our room, Gentlemen.</p>

               <p>M. Burk. Gentlemen I am.</p>

               <p>M. Burk. No, Gentlemen, only on suspicion of seeing his wife buying a knife at the Royal-Exchange; I have seen it up in my room, Gentlemen, and my husband, Gentlemen, offered to swap it for a little penknife, and, Gentlemen, after the time her room was broke open, I saw this knife with the point broke off on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you make any judgement whether the box was broke open with this knife?</p>
               <p>M. Burk. Gentlemen I will not for the world. I know no more; I don't, Gentlemen, indeed.</p>

            , Esq; On the 28th day of August last, two deer were killed in my park, which is in the parish of <placeName id="t17541204-17-crimeloc85">Little-Stanmore</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17541204-17-crimeloc85" type="placeName" value="Little-Stanmore"/>

                        targets="t17541204-17-off82 t17541204-17-crimeloc85"/>; the heads were cut off, and the entrails taken out, which were left behind, the bodies were carried away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had that park?</p>
               <p>W. Hallet. I have had it two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a park before?</p>
               <p>W. Hallet. I believe it was not:</p>
               <p>Q. How many head of deer were there in this park?</p>
               <p>W. Hallet. I had about forty-five head.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge that these deer were taken away, or do you imagine you lost two from your servants telling of you?</p>
               <p>W. Hallet. I saw the heads and the entrails lying, and I missed two of my number; seeing this, I sent to the man who keeps the turnpikegate, to know whether any people had passed through that looked suspicious of having deer? He said, that between one and two o'clock in the morning, there were three men rode through upon horses, they had sacks with them, and gave such a description of one of them, that I had reason to suspect him, he being employed by me as a hay-maker, which is the evidence of Cooper, upon which a search-warrant was got, and the constable is in court that searched the apartment of the evidence; I was not at the searching.</p>
               <p>

            . I was employed by 'squire Hallet to search for the venison; I went to the apartment of the evidence Cooper and one Coral, there I found this sack and snare, (producing them) he confessed he catched the deer; we put them in a coach; there the prisoner behaved unruly, and said to the evidence, Well, Cooper, we should have Deadman with us; as we are all guilty alike, we ought all to suffer alike.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body spoke of Deadman before?</p>
               <p>T. James. Not one soul. I told him, I thought he run a great risque to venture his neck for a deer. He said, he wished he had known nothing about the deer, and wished he had been taken about a week before, that he might have known his doom, and not have lain rotting in a gaol.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any part of the deer in that sack.</p>
               <p>T. James. No, there was nothing in the sack; but it was bloody, and a great deal of the coat of the deer upon it; but we found no part of the venison at all.</p>

            . We catched the two deer with this snare; I took one, Deadman the other, and the prisoner, who is the butcher, cut off the heads, and took the entrails out. He was with us in the park; we met at a public-house near Grosvenor-square; this was between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month?</p>
               <p>D. Cooper. I cannot tell what day it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner with you at the alehouse, or only you and Deadman?</p>
               <p>D. Cooper. The prisoner was with us; I was saying I worked there, and there were such things in the park, and we all agreed to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make the proposal at the alehouse, or before you went there?</p>
               <p>D. Cooper. Before: when we got there, the prisoner cut the heads off, and the entrails out.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040016"/> and left the heads and entrails behind; we carried them away upon horses; we had three horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Who produced the Snare?</p>
               <p>D. Cooper. Deadman brought the snare to me; I never killed a deer with him before, but I knew he followed that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was the prisoner with you in the park?</p>
               <p>D. Cooper. He was, and cut the heads off; we all three went together; we got over by the iron spikes; it was very nigh one o'clock in the morning: we put our horses into a lane, and tied them to a hedge; we took a horse's halter and tied it to the deer, and one pulled, and the other heaved them up over the wall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was there in my life, nor don't know the place.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cooper. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>D. Cooper. Four or five years; he lived at a place called the Old Ruins, Broad St. Giles's; he is a porter to a market.</p>
               <p>Q. How many horses had you, when you went for the deer.</p>
               <p>D. Cooper. Three, the prisoner brought one of the horses all the way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was at the alehouse when Deadman was there; they spoke for two horses; I said I would not go with them, I did not want a horse. The evidence told me, he had killed an out-lying deer; that he had been a hunting with this gentleman where he worked, that the deer had got out, and the gentleman had given over looking for it; and then he said they were any bodies: they would have had three horses; but I told them they might have but two, for I would not go; but if they brought them, I would cut them up for them; they gave me some liquor, and a trifle of money. I am innocent.</p>

               <p>W. Lay. I am. On the 27th of November last I missed thirteen guineas, and a thirtysix-shilling piece, from out of a box at my bed's head.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>W. Lay. She was my servant; my wife had occasion to go out between eleven and twelve o'clock, and left the prisoner in charge of the house; and when I came home at night, the prisoner was absconded, and I missed the money mentioned out of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box locked.</p>
               <p>W. Lay. It was not a lock box, it was a large tobacco-box, put into my wife's pocket, and put at the bed's head; the prisoner had packed up all her things, and left the key under the door. I sent in quest of her, and she was taken in St. James's-park by

            . I am a pastry-cook in Russel-street, Covent-garden; on the 27th of November Mrs. Blackman called me out of my shop to assist her in taking a person that had robbed somebody. The prisoner ran a good deal, but I overtook her at going into an alehouse near an alley; Mrs. Blackman came up to me, and said, that is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040017"/> the woman, and that she had robbed Mr. Lay of some money; I think she mentioned about twelve guineas. We took her there; when she came to the foot of the stairs, she took out the money from her pocket I believe, and slung it down; I heard it chink, and saw the witnesses take it up; they said there were twelve guineas and a half of it, and two gold rings; I saw one ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any money fall to the ground?</p>
               <p>P. Goadby. I saw some fall.</p>

            . Mr. Lay desired me to go after the prisoner at the bar; I went as far as Pimlico, to the duke's hospital; I could not find her there; but at last I found her at a centrybox at the end of the stable-yard; then I asked her to come along with me; she said she was not afraid to go along with me, for she had stole nothing; I said, I did not know of any thing that had been lost.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you say you wanted her to go along with you for?</p>
               <p>E. Blackman. I persuaded her to come home to go to washing, and said I was to help her iron. When we came into Pall-Mall, she went into a house; I said, I did not want to drink any thing. She went backward into the yard, and looked about for a door to get out at. I followed her, there was no door; then she desired me to go and fetch the soldier from the centry-box, saying, he was a poor man, and would be glad to drink. I said I would not. Then we went to go on; she endeavoured to get away, and jumped over the kennel; I took hold on her, and broke her petticoat-string: when we came to the end of the Mews, she would go no farther till she drank; we went into a house, and did drink; she went into the yard there; then we came on to Russel-street, there we staid to hear women sing; there she staid, I could not get her along. Then I left her, and went to the pastry cook, and desired he would come with me, and take a woman; in the mean time, she ran up Jackson's-alley, and we found her going in an alley near that alley. Then we had her to Mr. Lay's house, after which I went away, and saw no more of it.</p>

               <p>Q. to Blackman. Did you see her change any gold at any place ?</p>

               <p>I am ignorant and innocent of all they accuse me with, I never wronged him of a farthing or farthing's worth in my life. I have been a hard-working woman all my life-time; the money was my money, I saved it abroad. My husband went abroad in the time of the rebellion, and it was his hard fate to be killed at the battle of Val; I entered to be a nurse at the city of Maestricht, and I saved this to keep me in my old age. I always kept in secret to myself; I knew fifteen-pence and a bit of victuals would not keep me in habit; if they had been so full of money, they would not have sent me on the Monday to pawn a silver spoon for 1 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>To her character.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Coulton. I have known the prisoner a good many years to be a hard-working body; I knew her abroad. I am matron of the hospital to the third regiment of guards; I have trusted her with all I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she reckoned to be worth money?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Coulton. I never asked her what money she had; she was worth money abroad after her husband was killed.</p>
               <p>Q. to Burt. In what circumstances is Mr. Lay?</p>
               <p>G. Burt. He lives well.</p>

I followed her and she would not give it me. She was taken and had before the justice. I would have made it up if she would have acknowledged her fault.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it any more than a quarrel?</p>
               <p>A. Jackson. Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ask you for your cloak or money?</p>
               <p>A. Jackson. No, nothing at all; I would freely have forgiven her, if she would have but given me my cloak again. I never saw her before.</p>

             called upon me, and acquainted me he had recommended me to a Spanish merchant, that was just arrived from Spain. On the 13th of July he brought two gold enameled cases, for me to make two watch-movements into them. The next day, which was the 14th, Mr. Govers came with Mr. Tureen, who told me he was a Spanish merchant; that he not only had commissions from Spain, but from several other parts of Europe beside; that he had general commissions for watches and jewels. I gave him no credit at all then; he said he was in hopes I had put in hand the two movements for the cases.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak to you in English?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. No, he did not at that time; he spoke French to Mr. Tureen, and Mr. Tureen English to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the next time you saw him?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. It was on the of July; he and Mr. Tureen came to, he spoke French to Mr. Tureen, and Mr. Tureen, could not stay, so he left, then Mr. Govers went back into the parlour, in English, but I could understand him; he told me he had commissions from Spain for a gold repeater, and a plain gold watch, called and jeweled, which watches he must absolutely send away by the packet the next day. I kept a workman up the best part of the night to finish them, and finished them the next day by twelve o'clock; I not knowing him, insisted upon some security for these watches before I delivered them; he gave me his own note, payable to Mr. Lefebure at two months for 65 l. upon which I gave him the watches. The note was signed by

             payable to Mr. Lefebure, and indorsed by Lefebure to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you deliver them?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. I delivered them on the 20th of July last, at which time he told me he was going to be married to a lady of great fortune, and that Mr. Renea, a taylor, in Leicester-fields, was making the cloaths for the wedding. On the 26th of the same month he came to me, and told me a friend of his that came with him from abroad, who was then forty miles from London, wrote to him and desired him to buy him a horizontal gold watch, upon which pretence I let him have a gold watch, value 26 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what price must it be?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. No, he did not say what price his friend did fix for to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other security for the payment of that watch but his pretence of being a Spanish Merchant.</p>
               <p>W. Addis. No, none at all; that watch he was to return me again in a fortnight's time, or the money. Every time he was in my company he used often to talk of a lady that he was going to be married to; on the 24th of August he came to me again, and waited from twelve to seven at night, for two other movements, value 11 l. The fortnight was then expended for the 26 l. which he was to pay, or return the watch, that was the time I intended to demand the money of him, the time being expired, he waiting in my parlour for these two movements; I being obliged to go out among my workmen to get these movements finished. I intended to have brought an officer to have arrested him for 26 l. and likewise to have better security for the 65 l. but before I left him he pulled out several letters from his pocket, saying, I have commissions from Spain for four or five thousand pounds in watches and jewels.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew any letters ?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. He shewed me two, and said they were from his correspondent in Spain, with the commission; at that time he pretended he was a Spanish merchant, as he always did; upon these pretences, and at the same time his pulling out six gold watch cases, un, telling me he would bring them with six more for me to make movements to go into them, occasioned me to alter my resolution of arresting him, and I also let him have the two other watches, value 11 l. into enamelled cases that I had of him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deliver those six cases to you then?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you call the movements, watches, without the cases?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. We do.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you hear of those two watches that he had of you on the 20th of July, one of 45 l. the other 20 l.</p>
               <p>W. Addis. The week after we missed him, it was near the latter end of August. I was informed they were both pledged with one Mr. Watson, a pawnbroker, at the corner of Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you hear of his absconding?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. On the Wednesday after the 24th of August we made all the inquiry we could, sending<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040020"/> messengers to divers parts of England, where it was likely to find him. I heard he intended to go to Calais. I went with two gentlemen to Watson's, there I found the two watches, and gave him 31 l. 10 s. for them, the same money he said they were laid in for.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon whose information did you go there?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. I went there upon the information of Mr. Tureen.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the other watch?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. I have got them all again; I found the other watch at Mr. Dallin's and Warren's; they keep a register-office. That is the watch, value 26l. deposited for 14l. (all three produced in court).</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner taken before a justice of the peace?</p>
               <p>W. Addis, I was with him before justice Fielding; I charged him before the justice with taking these goods in the manner I have given my evidence here.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say in his defence?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. He said, he would make no reply till he came to a proper place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Tureen.</p>
               <p>W. Addis. About three months.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. He is a broker to the watch jewelers, that is, to deal between the jewelers and finishers, and he is a jeweler besides.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you deal in?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. I deal in jewels and plate.</p>
               <p>Q. How many customers had Mr. Tureen recommended to you before this?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. Never a one. I have a very good opinion of Mr. Tureen; he told me he believed Govers to be a rich man, and that he was a Spanish merchant, as he declared himself to be.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had known him before?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. He said he had known him in France.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he was of any trade in France?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. I do not remember he told he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any account of his family ?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. He did not; I believe Mr. Tureen believed him to be a man of credit, or he would never have been taken in for four or five hundred pounds by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he was a man of credit?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. He told me, before I saw Govers, he believed he was a rich man; but not to trust him on his word, but to take all the precaution I could, as of a stranger; he said, he told him he was a merchant, and did not distrust his being such.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, when M. Tureen applied to you, did not he tell you that Mr. Govers was a man of credit, and you might trust him?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. He did not; he told me he believed he was a Spanish merchant, which he pretended to be; but bid me take necessary precautions of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whether he knew he was a merchant?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. I did, and he said he did not know. The first time he came to me, he said he had met a Spanish merchant at Tom's coffee-house, whom he had recommended to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come with Mr. Govers the first time he came to you?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Govers talk to you in English?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. No, Tureen interpreted to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know not what Govers said, but from what Tureen told you?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. The next time he came, was Tureen with him?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. He was; but he left me immediately: then Govers told me he had a commission from Spain for a repeating gold watch, and a plain gold one, capt and jeweled.</p>
               <p>Q. If this man had come a stranger to you, and told you he had been a Spanish merchant, and if he had not been recommended by Tureen, should you have trusted him?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. I should not if he had not shewed me the pretended commissions.</p>

               <p>W. Addis. No, it was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the note given?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. On the 20th of July, payable in two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note ever paid?</p>

               <p>W. Addis. No, it never was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these two new watches?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. One of them was a gold repeating watch, it was not the worse for wear, though not quite new, but worth more money than I charged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Tureen come with him the third time ?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose his paying the 11 l. gave you the more faith in him.</p>
               <p>W. Addis. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he every time he came into your room say he was a Spanish merchant?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. He was always talking of his commissions.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you conceive of him as a Spanish merchant, when he talked of buying a watch for a friend forty miles off?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he, before he went abroad, write to Mr. Tureen, or any of his creditors, and desire a meeting of his creditors.</p>
               <p>W. Addis. Where the letter was dated I can't tell; his creditors were all of them waiting for him at Mr. Lefevre's, at which time he was at my house, and had I known it, I should have taken proper care of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. This was on the 24th of August; but I was not present at that meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you any names in those commissions?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. He shewed us two letters with names to them.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the names?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. I don't know what names they were; he opened them, and said there were commissions in those letters; I was not capable of reading them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he read them to you?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. He did in broken English, the purport of which was, for several thousand pounds worth of jewels, and three dozen of gold watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they might be real letters for aught you know?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. They might.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040023"/>Q. Was you at Mr. Fielding's ?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he committed?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. He was, to the Gatehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. At whose suit?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. At several more prosecutors suits besides mine.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecutor. We admit there were twenty of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you all sign the order to carry on the prosecution?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. I sign, I can't say they all do.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there more than five subscribe ?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. There are</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. I first knew the prisoner by the name Govers.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you first acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. Thirty-two years ago in Paris; I was in company with him in England seventeen years ago, when he and I were journeymen; he was a jeweler, and was an apprentice in Germany; after that time I never saw him till the beginning of last June, then I met him at Tom's coffee-house with Mr. Lefevre; I had not seen him for sixteen years before; he invited me, when at the coffee-house, to come and see him at his lodgings; I had heard before his father was reduced, and very poor. I went to Mr. Govers's lodgings on the 12th in Greek-street, Soho; he complained to me his workmen did his work very slowly, and wanted me to recommend a watchmaker to him. Then I said I knew a very good workman; naming Mr. Addis. Then he said, I will give you a couple of watch-cases to have them done, and afterwards I shall give you a couple of dozen of watch-cases, if he will do them quick, because he said he was in a great hurry, having some other goods to send abroad, saying he had four dozen then to do. This was on the 12th of July; he desired me not to forget to go to the watchmaker, and tell him; and I carried the cases on the 13th; then on the 14th he desired me to go with him to the watchmaker's, which I did, to Mr. Addis.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known Mr. Govers then?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. I had known him about a month.</p>
               <p>Q. In what character did he pass that month?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. He said he was going to be married to a lady of great fortune, and that he was a merchant for Spain and Portugal.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever heard he was a merchant before?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. No, I never had. He told me he had sold things to the king of Poland a twelvemonth before. I was present in his lodgings when he sent for his taylor to be measured for his cloaths, and he told the taylor (this for a ceremony) which induced me to believe he was going to be married. I recommended him, after this, to my acquaintance, under the character of a Spanish merchant, and one going to be married. I was with him when he agreed for the repeating gold watch and the plain one: they were ready made, but there was something to be done to them, and they were not delivered to him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you yourself dealt with him for any thing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. I have for 330 l. After he had bought these two watches, he gave orders for two other watches to be made.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any conversation between him and Mr. Addis, he telling him what he was?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. I have heard him tell Mr. Addis he was a Spanish merchant, &amp;c. but I was not with him when the commissions were produced.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Govers's father?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. I do, but I never had any dealings with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. He was a snuff-box-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not a jeweller?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. No, he was no jeweller, but he dealt in jewels.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner serve this time with him?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you know the prisoner in London?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. Seventeen years ago; I never saw him from that time till June last.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he was a jeweller or a merchant can you tell?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. It was to my great surprize to see the prisoner appear as a gentleman here. I have heard his father was very poor when he died.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath can you take upon you to say the prisoner was not a merchant?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. I cannot answer to that; I never heard he was one till he told me so himself; he told me he has been in Constantinople, and all over Europe. I don't know what he has been.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040024"/>Q. What do you call yourself ?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. I call myself a jeweler. I have been a merchant for seven years. I have been seven years without working.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if a jeweler does not work, but deals in jewels, he is a merchant?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. Yes sir, I am a jeweler now, and deal too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you apply yourself to him at Tom's Coffee-house in order to be employed by him?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. No sir, he desired me to come and see him; he was very polite and civil to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you apply to him as an acquaintance of his father's, and hoped you should be employed by them?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. No sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recommend him to Mr. Addis?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. I did, and said, I hoped he would be a good customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that true of false that he was going to be married to a great fortune; will you take upon you to swear he was not going to be married?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. I can't tell such a thing of a foreigner, he made me believe he had paid about three thousand pounds in less than two months time for goods sent abroad.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear he had not?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. I can swear nothing; but I think he cannot have done it; I know his goods were in pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear all the goods he bought were in pawn?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. No sir; but I wish they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know of your own knowledge he has made several payments?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. He has, some trifles ?</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what was done with the goods?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. He said he would send them abroad, but he pawned them directly.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that Mr. Govers told you he has employed workmen to whom he has paid three thousand pounds for work done for him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. Yes sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say he has pawned those goods done by these workmen?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. Part of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. I found it out by going about?</p>
               <p>Q. What part?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. Silver plates, watches, and rings.</p>
               <p>Q. How many watches?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. Above a dozen, and above a dozen watch-cases, either he or a man that he had to pawn them for him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were pawned by his orders?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. I know the man that pawned them for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that of your own knowledge?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. He told me so himself, and I went and found the identical goods in the pawnbroker's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you yourself did ever offer any goods to Mr. Govers for sale?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. Several times I did; the more is my misfortune.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever offer him goods that he did not buy?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. No, none but what he has bought, except when we could not agree in the price; but the reason why he did not buy was, that the people wanted ready money that the goods belonged to. When I offered him any other people's goods he would say, I will give you so and so, and a couple of guineas for yourself upon the nail; but the people wanting ready money, was the reason the price did not answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a creditor of Mr. Govers?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. I am; he owes me money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a letter sent to desire a meeting of his creditors?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. There was; but he only pretended, he never went abroad at all, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose goods were the silver plates ?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. They were Mr. Tamphire's.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose the watch-cases?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. They were Mr. Ferron's, and the watches Mr. Addis's.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of the advertisement had you any notion that he had deceived any body by false tokens?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. Yes, to be sure, I looked upon him to be a great defrauder.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was he brought to justice?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. He was discovered by a letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. Mr. Rennie brought him to an officer's house in the Strand; I saw him coming out of the house.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. You make these two distinctions, he that works in jewels, you call a jeweler, but he that deals in jewels unmanufactured as mere merchandize, you call a merchant?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040025"/>Mr. Tureen. Yes I do; this I call a merchant jeweler, a diamond merchant gets people to work for him, and sends them abroad.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. Do you believe now that was a pretence that he was going to be married?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tureen. I believe that was only a pretence in order to defraud the people?</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution to Mr. Addis. Look at that paper. Do you know that hand-writing, have you seen the prisoner write?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. Yes, I have several times. ( He looks at it) I am sure this is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Council for defendant. Where did you see him last ?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. I saw him before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that his rooms were broke open by Mr. Fielding's order?</p>
               <p>W. Addis. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Robinson. (He looks at the two letters.) I know Govers's hand-writing, and I believe them to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Robinson. I can.</p>
               <p>Council for defendant. Did you not promise to forgive that man if he would let you into the secret of making snuff?</p>
               <p>Mr. Robinson. I never thought of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Council for defendant. Did you know any thing of these advertisements?</p>
               <p>Mr. Robinson. (He looks at them.) On the 24th of August last, this man, instead of paying me a note that became due, ran away. When he had so done, he wrote a letter, and it came to us on Sunday, and there you'll if find he says expresly, I have ordered the person that I have left this letter with not to give if you till Sunday, that I may have time to make my escape. The gentlemen on the Sunday night got together, and did not know what to do, and Mr. Lefevre went post to Calais, and there he intercepted a letter that was wrote to Madame de La Chapelle. In this letter we found out many proceedings but when this advertisement was made out, I was out of town, and did not know of its being put in. We were first informed there were upwards of two thousand pounds in goods he had bespoke in hardware, quantities of lace, and other things that were looked out to be sent in to him on the Monday morning, but he ran away on the Saturday, therefore this advertisement was put in the paper in order to take him, but I find we are blamed for advertising this large sum.</p>
               <p>Council for defendant. Don't you know it was proposed in that letter to his creditors to pay them as far as it would go?</p>
               <p>Mr. Robinson. No, it is no such thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you made any translation of it?</p>
               <p>T. Leretondale. I have it here in writing. ( He delivers it to the clerk of the arraigns. It is read.)</p>
               <p>'' A thunderstroke which has just crushed me to '' pieces, obliges me to provide immediately for '' the security of my person; it is not that I am '' doubtful of the goodness of your intentions '' towards me, although I have the misfortune to '' owe you sufficient considerably to disorder your '' affairs; yet I flatter myself that you will lend '' your assistance to facilitate the means for paying '' you, in granting me sufficient time to enable me '' to settle my affairs. But there are others, who, '' perhaps, may seek my destruction, and who '' in destroying either my reputation, or otherwise, '' would, by endeavouring to seize on my '' person, deprive me of all the means to enable '' me to satisfy them so long as I live. I therefore '' beseech you to take upon you to call a '' meeting of Messrs. Addis, Tureen, Robinson, '' Tribe, La Basle, Ferron, Rennie, my silversmith '' for large plate, in order to give me '' a letter of licence for three years; I offer to '' pay down, on the signing of it, the first year's '' interest, at the rate of 5 l. per cent. by the '' year, the interest of the second year at the end '' of two years from this time; and in the third '' year your principal in full.</p>
               <p>'' I ask it as a favour of you, as well as of all '' the rest of the gentlemen, not to examine into '' the wrongs that I may have committed by '' dissimulation, and my bad behaviour; I '' thought it was necessary to enable myself to '' continue my commerce, and that I could no '' longer do so, but with ready money, and that '' I must consequently use the precaution of keeping '' by me sufficient effects to enable me to pay '' you in ready money for what other dealings I '' might have with you for the future, if you '' should grant my request.</p>
               <p>'' I hope neither you, nor those gentlemen, if '' they will but regard their own interest, will '' divulge to the world my affair, because I tell '' you frankly that I will not appear. If you '' don't grant me the time in good form, I shall<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040026"/> '' take care, even at Calais, to conceal myself '' so secure, that I will confer with nobody, not '' even with any one of you should you come '' there; and that in case you should think that '' in pursuing me to France, or elsewhere, you '' would compel me to do what is impossible, '' that you would be paid; I have the honour '' to assure you the contrary, and that you would '' put me to the hard necessity, against my inclination, '' to conceal, myself from every body '' living, and will consequently lose all your dues, '' instead of which, by a speedy determination to '' give me my liberty, and preserve my reputation, '' I shall instantly return and present myself '' before you, that you may be witnesses of '' my good conduct, and of the care and pains '' I shall take to fulfil my new engagements that '' I shall contract with you. Be persuaded that '' I shall give you, as well as those gentlemen, '' always the preference in my dealings for ready '' money, having no further hopes of any credit. '' You know my affairs require my residence '' in England, therefore don't compel me '' to forsake them. It is impossible for me to '' propose terms more for your advantage at present, '' I know my strength, and I can do no better, '' and I will not fall into the necessity of asking '' you further favours, than those for yours and '' my interest, which is to determine speedily, '' what you intend to do. I shall wait at Calais, '' time sufficient for your answer, hoping you'll '' write by Monday se'nnight, the 26th of August, '' beyond which time I must tell you, that '' I shall provide for my greatest safety.</p>

               <p>L. Lefevre. I set out from home on Monday the 26th of August, and got to Calais on the Tuesday about twelve or one. I went to the governor there, he directed me, to go to the king's attorney, which I did; I found the prisoner was not come there, the next day I found a gentlewoman who passed for Mrs. Govers. I examined her whether she had any goods of mine. She had nothing but her own cloaths. I asked her if she knew the prisoner, she said no; the post-man came in while I was searching her, and these and two letters I have in my hand which he brought in, one inclosed in the other; I know them to be the hand-writing of Govers. She said I used her very ill, but I told her what I did was by the authority I had from the king's attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. to the translator. Look at this, (the inclosed letter) have you a translation of it?</p>
               <p>Translator. I have here a true translation. (He delivered it to the clerk of the arraigns.)</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution to Leretondale. Is this a true translation?</p>
               <p>Leretondale. It is; I have examined it. (It is read.)</p>
               <p>London, Aug. 26, 1754.</p>
               <p>'' Will fortune never tire herself in persecuting '' me? Persidious and cruel as she is, I defy her, '' if she does but esteem her whom Ladore.</p>
               <p>'' The amiable qualifications of thy soul, dear '' and tender friend, which have inspired mine '' with a flame as lively as it is delicate, assure '' me, that if the capricious and barbarous don't '' do justice to your read, ment so much as she '' ought, at least she'll respect your virtue. I '' went home so soon as I left you; I surmised '' that my motions were observed; I kept myself '' upon my guard, and well I did; for my presence '' of mind urged me to take all necessary '' precautions; I sent a trusty person to my lodgings '' to get intelligence, and he was told several '' persons had been to inquire for me, one '' after another, who seemed very anxious and '' uneasy. I took a coach, and drew up the '' shutters, and was drove in and about my own '' neighbourhood, where I perceived I was watched '' by several persons who surrounded my lodgings, '' in expectation of seeing me go in or out;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040027"/> '' I therefore resolved to leave behind me my '' linen, my cloaths, my sword, and other effects, '' which I wanted to fetch away, thinking it rather '' better to leave them to chance, than risque my '' being surprised. I ordered the coach to drive me '' to the Post-office, to take post-horses; but there '' I perceived two persons who, upon Change had '' that day presented me with some notes for payment, '' just become due. What could I do? They '' perhaps might have planted somebody upon the '' roads to stop my journey; I then ordered the '' coachman to drive me to the further end of the '' city, and I left my coach, and went and took '' water, and got into a tilt-boat, and wandered '' about upon the Thames till night drew on: '' chance, which governs every thing, threw in '' my way the friend to whom you will direct my '' letters; upon seeing the regard he had to my '' welfare, I trusted him with my secret, and we '' immediately resolved to walk about without the '' city a part of the night, then return into the '' city and take a coach, and again go upon the '' water, and then walk again, and then went '' into a tavern, and lay at a bagnio, from '' whence I actually write to you, my dear friend.</p>
               <p>'' But what! adorable Beaujour, methinks I '' hear you sigh. My tender heart informs me '' yours suffers, and that your charming eyes '' drop tears on account of my fate. No, no, '' I mistake; my love informs me that is not the '' principal cause of their grief; it is because I '' am so unfortunate as not to be near enough to '' wipe them. Come, my sweet angel, let us '' take courage, and expect every thing from '' time and our intimacy.</p>
               <p>'' Stay at Mr. La'Sambier's until the storm is '' over, or a little calmed; I endeavour to give '' them the change (that is, to baffle them).</p>
               <p>'' I wrote to Mr. La'Sambier on the cover of '' this, that you are to arrive, if you are not already, '' at Calais, that he should give you this '' letter, that some letters are to come there for '' me, that I desire him to put them into your '' hands, in the name of

               <p>To Mr. La'Sambier, in Golden-head-street, at Calais.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lefevre. How long have you known the defendant?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. I knew him in France from a child; he was a neighbour of mine: he came to me about the beginning of May last, and told me, he was sent by a company, and that he was to deal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040028"/> very largely in several branches, of trade for Spain and Portugal, and that he had a great sum of money in Spain.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he lodge in London?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. He did lodge by the Tower. He told me he had correspondents very large; he looked over goods with me, a watch set with diamonds, rings, and other things, to the value of 100 l. He said he would sell some in Spain, and some in Portugal, and try which would do best. (Here he was going to give an account how he defrauded, him and of what; but the council for the defendant let him know he was trying for another fact, and that what charge he had against him was not in that indictment.)</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the defendant's father?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. A merchant and snuff-box-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the defendant at home with his father?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. I have, he was in a frock then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him when he was in England some time ago?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business then?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. I don't know that; he did something in the jeweling and trinket way.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he been in England this last time?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. The first of my knowing of him was in the beginning of May last.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to him, or he come to you?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. He came to me where I live in Bow-street, and told me he came here for very large dealings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe him?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. I so far believed him, that I gave him some credit, and recommended him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever paid for any goods you sold him?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. He gave me a little money to shew me he had some.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was that little?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. He paid me 22 l. out of 500 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know he had any more money about him at that time?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. No, I don't know that, he told me if I wanted a hundred pounds, or more, he would let me have it; but when he had got as much as he could, he went off. I had so good an opinion of him, that when he said he had a great order for plate, I took him to Mr. Stampair the silversmith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever ask him for money?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. I did sometimes, and he would always have some excuse, but I did not really suspect him to be a thief, till I found it out.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the Letter that was sent to you about meeting his creditors to compromise matters as well as you could, what prevented that taking effect, that you would not have compassion on the gentleman ?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. Because he does not speak like a gentleman on a tradesman neither in that letters</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear he was at Calais?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. I did, but he was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you think if you would have had compassion on him, he would have come back, had you compounded his debts by the letter he wrote?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. If he had given good security for what he offered, we might have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he never was at Calais?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. By all circumstances that appear.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not surrender ?</p>
               <p>L. Lefevre. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>J. Watson. On the 20th of July last, these two watches were pawned with me for thirty guineas; in the name of Jarmes. I never saw the defendant in my life; they were redeemed by order of Jarmes. I think they are the same.</p>
               <p>C. to Addis. Look at these and see if you know them.</p>
               <p>W. Addis. These are the two watches Govers had of me I saw them in the custody of Mr. Watson, I gave the pawnbroker a receipt for his indemnification.</p>
               <p>J. Watson. I remember you now, I have your receipt at home.</p>
               <p>Q. to Watson. What is the value of the two watches ?</p>
               <p>J. Watson. I cannot take upon me to set a value upon another man's goods; I believe I could sell them for forty guineas, and no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you give forty guineas for them?</p>
               <p>J. Watson. I would at this time. (The jury being some of them watch-number, looked at them, and deceased they were well worth the money the defendant was to pay for them ).</p>

            , and another, on the 26th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. What would you have given for it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Delven. I would have given 20 l. for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rennie. I had been acquainted with Govers from about the latter-end of last June; then I became acquainted with him at the prince of Orange's head in the Hay-market. (He is shewed a letter) About two days before he wrote this letter, he applied to me, and told me, he had met with a fatal stroke from abroad, and had sustained great losses; and said, he was afraid if his creditors should know it, they would trouble him; and asked my advice, saying, he had some notes to pay quickly, and he was incapable of paying them. I advised him to write to his creditors, and keep out of the way till he heard from them. He said he was fearful of staying in England. I told him, if his writing did not succeed, then to go to France. He said, he believed he should not be able to pay them in less than two or three years. When he told me that, then I advised him to go to France. He said he would; but he staid in town on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Mr. Rennie. Because I saw him. I was present when he wrote this letter in London to his creditor; I take it to be on a Saturday that he wrote it; I really believe he went to go out of England; he went to the coast of Sussex to embark, because he heard his creditors were gone to Dover. I took him to be an honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. In what language did you and he discourse?</p>
               <p>Mr. Rennie. In French; he can talk English, and but a little.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to be taken?</p>
               <p>Mr. Rennie. I went to a gentleman's seat in Hertfordshire, and the next day coming home, I met Mr. Tribe, one of his creditors, in Tyburn-road, who informed me he was gone off; and Govers sent Mr. Gibeard and Mr. Paris to me, before I had been at home two hours, for me to come to him in James-street, in the Hay-market. This was on the 7th of September; one of them called him to me at the door; then he took me by the hand, and said he was come to England upon seeing his name advertised in the papers, and he would have satisfaction for the affront put upon him. I told him I was very glad to see him come back, for that I myself had been calumniated about having a letter directed to me, and also about having had talk with him. I asked him if he really came to surrender to his creditors, or whether he was the honest man he had told him he was? He said, Yes; and that he had no other than fair dealings with his creditors, and he was not afraid of them, and asked me how he must go on. I told him, if he had a mind to shew himself, as he pretended, that in following my advice he would complete his design, and I advised him to come along with me to an officer's house, and give me leave to go and call his creditors that minute, without going into any other house. Then I went to Mr. Randle's in the Strand, a sheriff's officer, and told Mrs. Randle, there was a gentleman wanted a lodging, and I did not know but he might stay some time with her; that he was come to surrender, and desired her to let him have a good room. He willingly went with me, and called for a glass of wine; at my opening the door, he saw two gentlemen, one of them I knew; I asked him if he knew either of them? He said, he did one; and said he was fearful of being seen by that Man. I asked him for what? He told me, that by that man's intelligence he might be betrayed for the 200 l. mentioned in the papers, and make his affairs worse. I said that was very well thought of then I took him to my own house, and told Mrs. Randle I would bring him on the day following. He said at my house that night; the next day I sent a messenger to Mr. Deval, a friend of the creditor's, to let him know I had something to tell him. My servant returned, and said he was not at home. I went afterwards to Mr. Gosset, where I met Mr. Lefevre, and told him I should be able to bring the Defendant and his creditors face to face. He seemed to rejoice at it, and asked a farther meeting that evening at a coffee-house in King-street. I went in the evening, and told him I was in hopes I should shew him to him the very next day, and desired him to get writs to arrest him; then I thought I should have no farther concern in it. That very evening, which was on a Sunday, the 8th, I took the defendant to Mr. Randle's house again; there I sat and drank a glass of wine with him, and left him there, and went home; and as I was drinking a dish of tea on the Monday Morning, came a note to me, which I shewed to Mr. Deval; he begged of me to call on him before I went to his creditors; I went to him, he then asked me, if I had seen any of them? I said, no.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040030"/> but I would go. I went to Mr. Lefevre; he had got a writ in his pocket; I took him to Randle's house, and left him there, and went about my business, and when I returned, the defendant was in custody of a constable, and going before a justice.</p>

               <p>Q. What was your opinion of him as to his honesty?</p>
               <p>Mr. Rennie. I knew no harm or good of him. I did not know he had dealt for a shilling till the day before he went away; now the common cry is against him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole of what you say, as to the conduct of the defendant, whether it did not appear to you that he did it with an intent to satisfy his creditors?</p>
               <p>Mr. Rennie. He said he came with intent to face them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go voluntarily with you to the officer's house ?</p>
               <p>Mr. Rennie. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time that you first saw him after his return, to the time you surrendered him, might not he have made his escape ?</p>
               <p>Mr. Rennie. For what I know he might; I had no warrant, or gave any charge concerning him where I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lefevre. What did the defendant say to you in the officer's house?</p>
               <p>Mr. Lefevre. He said to me, in the officer's house, if he had met me upon the road, he would have blown my brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tax you with putting the advertisement in the papers?</p>
               <p>Mr. Lefevre. No, he did not; I was abroad then.</p>
               <p>For the defendant.</p>
               <p>Claud. Delacombe. (he spoke by Mr. Lamash an interpreter ) I am a captain in the Imperial service; I have been in England since March last; I know the defendant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Roberts, a merchant, in Brussels ?</p>
               <p>C. Delacombe. I did; but not as a merchant at Brussels. He was a merchant; I was acquainted with him when I was with the defendant; I know the defendant had given goods to his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Roberts had any money of the defendant's in his hands?</p>
               <p>C. Delacombe. I don't know that; I have heard them talk very much about trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that they traded together?</p>
               <p>C. Delacombe. I do not know; but I rather say yes than no. As I was one day at the custom-house, there was one Mr. Showler and Govers together; I heard Showler say to Govers, that Roberts was run away with some goods belonging to him; and Govers said, with a loud voice, I believe he has run away with too much from me: that he had four or five thousand guilders of his in his hands, and he feared he should lose them but don't know when it was he failed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear this talk?</p>
               <p>C. Delacombe. At the latter-end of last August.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Govers a trader, or not ?</p>
               <p>C. Delacombe. He passed for a trader while I was at Brussels.</p>
               <p>Mr. Openham. I knew the defendant at Frank-fort in Germany about five of six years ago. I saw him at Lipswick, at the great fair there; I have seen him transact business in wine-houses; I have dealt with him myself in jewels, watches, and tweezer-cases. My father and his were particular acquaintance together at Paris; his father was a jeweler; he was the greatest dealer in France. I knew the defendant at the Change, and at Tom's coffee-house; he told me he had got some coloured stones to dispose of, and he sold them to a person whom I recommended him to. I had so good an opinion of him, that I offered to be his ball body for body. I can swear myself worth four or five hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Paris (he being also a foreigner, spoke by Lamash the interpreter ) I have known the defendant twelve or fourteen years; I found him about four months and a half ago in England. I think he followed the trade of his father, he told me so in England. To my own knowledge he always paid his way very well at Paris, or where he went.</p>

               <p>Mr. Paris. In Northumberland-court, Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Mr. Paris. I am a doctor and chymist.</p>

               <p>Edward Tufnel. I live at Barnet in South-mims Parish; on the 6th of November, a little after four in the afternoon, I had been in the fields to fetch up master Peter Davis's cows at the waggon and horses; I heard a noise in the house; I went in, there was the prisoner (he is a <rs id="t17541204-23-deflabel115" type="occupation">soldier</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

               <p>Q. Were any body there besides they too?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. I did not see any body else but they.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the beginning of the quarrel?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room were they?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. In the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the soldier taking about?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. He was quarrelling with Mr. Emmerton.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any of the words he made use of?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see him do?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. He threw his coat about the house, and said, he did not mind this or that man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in his shirt?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. He was in his waistcoat, and I desired him to be quite.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. He was a little concerned in liquor. I desired him to go to bed; he went up stairs, I thought he had been gone to bed, then I went out into the yard to put the cows up as usual, Emmerton was in the kitchen all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Emmerton say when the other was in his waistcoat?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. He desired him to be quiet and go to bed, and said, he thought that was the properest place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you return into the house again, and how soon?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. I did, I came in again after a very small trifle of time; I had only put the cows in the stail and given them a bit of hay, and was coming into the house for the maid to come out to milk. She said, for God's sake go after the soldier, for he has got his sword, and came running to me. I went through the house after him, he was just entering at the gate after Mr. Emmerton, and Mr. Emmerton was just within the gate, going to shut it to save himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the yard, and how it lies from the house.</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. Emmerton had gone out at the door into the street, and from thence through a gate into the yard; the soldier, when I saw him, was in the street, at the yard gate, he burst the gate open before Emmerton had time to shut it te close; he rushed in and stabbed him with a bayonet, and left it in his breast, He made his escape into the street, then to the house, and into his chamber, and wrapped himself up in the bed-cloaths; I called out for help, and we went and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house when you went thro' it?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. There were nobody in it then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There is ne'er a man knows any thing of the matter but him, and he has said a deal that is false; there were four men in the kitchen, besides the deceased, drinking with me; ask him if he knows them.</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. to the Question. I saw none but they two.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The other four men all made off; I do not know who they were; I was at my quarters, and beat in a desperate manner before I took my bayonet out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any angry words made use of by Emmerton ?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. I don't remember any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any blows pass?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. No, I did not; Emmerton had received some, but I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner bloody or bruised?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Emmerton appear to have been beat when you went first into the house?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. His face appeared all over blood then.</p>
               <p>Q. Whence did the blood seem to proceed from?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. His nose had been bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner appear to be bloody?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. I did not see that he was at all.</p>
               <p>Q. If his face had been bloody could you have seen it?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem to have been beat?</p>
               <p>E. Tufnel. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He did not see the beginning of it.</p>
               <p>Juslin Duburgy Jones. I am landlord at the ship and dragon, and am a close neighbour to this house, the Waggon and Horses; I heard a noise like quarrelling in it on Wednesday the 6th of November, betwixt four and five in the evening.

            , a Wheeler, he was holding his hand to his eye, and said, the soldier had given him a black eye. Mr. Emmerton had got the soldier by the collar shaking him, and said, Sirrah, you rascal, you don't ought to strike them that don't trouble their heads with you, and he put him back into a chair at the side of a table. He said, you ought to be put in the stocks you rascal, for meddling with them that don't meddle with you, and disturbing people in your quarters; and he gave him a twitch by the collar, and said, Go to bed, you villain, and the soldier fell on his face to the ground. This twitch, I imagine, was with an intent to make the soldier go to bed; the prisoner got up again, and they shoved him partly up stairs, and I thought every thing was quiet. My house is about twenty yards from Mr. Davis's house; when I got to my own door, I turned my head and saw Mr. Emmerton come running out of the house along the street, and ran towards me to go in at my next neighbour's door, he could not get in, he turned back again to run into the yard, and went to go in at the gate; in a moment, before he could get in, I saw the soldier with this bayonet naked in his hand, run out of

Mr. Emmerton came bursting out at the gate, and this bayonet stuck in his right breast, I believe seven inches and a half, and down he fell before me; please to observe by the blood on it, it may be seen how far it was in the body, I went to help him up, and pulled the bayonet out, but he never had time to say, Lord have mercy upon me. I believe it pricked him to the heart.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people did you see in company with the soldier when you heard the quarrelling first ?</p>
               <p>J. D. Jones. I saw none but Mr. Purton and Mr. Emmerton with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was going into the country upon command, with three deserters; there was a serjeant, a corporal, and nine of us. My quarters were at the Waggon and Horses at Barnet, there was nobody when I came there first but the maid; after I had been there about two hours we had our dinner; then my comrade and I went to the Green Man, and had a pint of beer each; there was a corporal, two men, and the deserters. After having drank three pots of beer there, I returned home to my quarters, and my comrade went to the horse-races. I called for a pint of beer, there were three more men besides; Mr. Emmerton and they said, I might come into their company, if I would spend my pint with them. After that we had a dram or two of gin, and I drank a little more than did me good; then there was a spute who should pay the reckoning. Then I said, I would pay as much as they. One of them d - d me, and said, you are like the rest of the blackguard soldiers. The landlord said, pay your reckoning, that is the best way, to have no more about it. I paid four-pence; one of them stept up to me, and said, you scoundrel, that is not enough, and knocked me down; I got up and hit him again; then another struck me; then I lay down, and in a minute or two they came at me, and beat me in a terrible manner. I lay down on the stairs, and took hold of my bayonet; he struck me once or twice, and so did the rest; I was beat so, that I was perfectly senseless; I hardly knew what I did , or whether I stood on my head or heels. They went to take the bayonet from me, and they tore the scabbard all to pieces. Then I went up to bed, and pulled all my cloaths off but my shirt and stockings, and covered myself in the bed. I had never seen the men in my life before; but they were great villains.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. Did you make any observation whether the prisoner appeared to be bruised, beat, or bloody?</p>
               <p>J. D. Jones. Mr. Emmerton was bloody and he too; but I saw no blows struck.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they bloody?</p>
               <p>J. D. Jones. They were bloody in the face both; it appeared to me as if there had been some blows between them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Emmerton say to you when you went in?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040033"/>J. D. Jones. He said the soldier had struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say he had struck the prisoner?</p>
               <p>J. D. Jones. No; neither can I say whether Purton had struck the prisoner or not; the prisoner ran after the deceased with such vengeance, with the bayonet in his hand, that though there was a coachman just by, and a man coming with a pail of water, neither had power to stop him.</p>

I sent three times by a nurse, and a girl about six years old, and a boy about eleven; one laid out 16 d. the other 15 d. the other 3 s. the nurse, named Dadson, had 1 s. 6 d. and the six-pence she carried was afterwards found in the prisoner's pocket.</p>

               <p>E. Smith. That was in less than five minutes after it was laid out; Mrs. Bedford staid at my house till the money was laid out, and went home.</p>

            . We having several times missed money, on the 17th of July I sent all my people out of the way, but the prisoner at the bar, and went over to Mrs. Smith with some money, which my husband and I marked; there were five shillings and two six-pences; I desired Mrs. Smith to send some of her neighbours to lay out that money at my house. She sent a woman for two ounces of tea and some sugar that came to 16 d. another woman was sent for a quarter of a pound of tea, that came to 1 s. 3 d. there was 6 s. sent in all, and all marked; when it was all sent, I went home, and behind the counter to the prisoner; he said, I have received this money since you have been gone, which was 5 s. 6 d. he opened the till and shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it marked ?</p>
               <p>J. Bedford. It was marked with a cross on the woman's side. My eldest brother came in, and so did my husband; I said, the person that robbed you is now found out. Then he called the prisoner up into the dining-room; what he said I can't tell.</p>

            . We went over to Mrs. Smith's house, and marked five shillings and two sixpences, and ordered them to be sent to my shop for goods. I had sent all my other family out, except the prisoner. After it was laid out, we went home, and there were but 5 s. 6 d. in the till. I called him up stairs, and said, you are a rogue; he pulled out his money, and shewed me it, and said, that was all he had. Then I insisted upon sending for an officer; then he pulled out of another pocket this six-pence that was marked, (produced in court) I marked it myself; I told him it was mine; he said nothing for a considerable time. I said, I insist upon seeing your box; then we went up to it, in which I found rhubarb, and a quarter of a pound of tea, that I had missed before. There was three ounces or better of rhubard, I have valued it at 1 s. 6 d. it stands me in more than three times the value; there are many other things now in the box, that he cannot give an account off. I asked him how he could serve me in this manner? He acknowledged they were my property, and that he had gone on with that trade above a year.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>When I have laid any money out, I used to pay myself out of Mr. Bedford's till, and I had laid the money out before. I think it was on the 13th of that month I had been on board a vessel in the river, called the Carolina, and had paid six-pence to the waterman, and had not taken that six-pence till that day; and as I was going out again, I having no money in my pocket, took it out of the till. The goods in my box were none of Mr. Bedford's, neither were there any rhubard or tea found in my box.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. When had he been upon the water for you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He had not for seven days before, and that was only crossing at Executioned-dk to go to Deptford, and he had daily and hourly been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040034"/> behind my till after that; he never mentioned this when he was detected.</p>
               <p>Q. You hear what he says, that the rhubarb and tea were not found in his box.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Mrs. Smith saw them in his box, as well as myself.</p>
               <p>E. Smith. After the box was opened, I saw some rhubarb and tea, besides several other things, and he said all in his box was his master's, and that he took them from him.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How long had the prisoner lived with you ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This was the 17th of July; he had lived with me about fifteen months before that.</p>

On the morning I found the goods, which was the 17th of last month; he and my wife were going out of the town together; she was dressed in a green habit, and things which he had bought for her. I met them, and secured him; he confessed he had some cloaths of hers, and that they were going off together; and also that he had had criminal conversation with her; I have catched them together often; we went to his lodgings in Cecil-street in the Strand, and took the things mentioned in the indictment out of his trunk, by virtue of a search-warrant. ( The goods produced in court, he takes up a blue silk gown ) this I bought her, it cost me a good deal of money; this white gown cost me 25 s. these I laid at but 2 s. each; they have made me almost beside myself, that I hardly know what I do sometimes; the handkerchief is mine, and the rest I believe to be mine.</p>
               <p>In his cross-examination he said the prisoner had never struck him, but had threatened him; and he was afraid to demand his wife when he has catched them together. That he knows nothing of his wife's gowns<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040035"/> being pawned since the day she wore them last; and that he had seen them in her drawers since she had worn them.</p>

               <p>On his cross-examination he said, he did not hear the prisoner say how he came by the goods, nor did he hear him say he redeemed them out of pawn, but that the prisoner said if he would make no disturbance he would go and open his trunk, and deliver the goods belonging to Mr. Kelly.</p>

               <p>I had several complaints from Mrs. Kelly of her husband's beating and abusing her and pawning her cloaths, and turning her out doors; she was almost naked, and had scarce any thing to subsist on. She desired I would let her have money to take her things out of pawn, and keep them till she could redeem them. I went with her to a pawnbroker's in the middle of Germain-street and took them out.</p>

               <p>Q. When she asked for a handkerchief, did she say what was to be done with it?</p>
               <p>S. Gasterel. No sir; but it was on purpose to kill it, because she said she would serve it as she had the other. After the child was dead, Mrs. Maddox took and turned the foul linen out of the hat-box, and put the child into it, and put a piece of brown paper over it, and tied it down with a piece of packthread; then she desired me to go down stairs, and fetch up some water to wash the boards that were stained; which I did. Then she desired me to go to bed; but before I went up, I heard her say, that after the watchman was gone about at three, she would go out with the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say where she was to carry it?</p>
               <p>S. Gasterel. No, I did not; after I went up to bed I heard the door unlock, and lock after her; and about half an hour after I heard her come back again.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was she?</p>
               <p>S. Gasterel. I think it was she, because the door would not go of itself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the house after this?</p>
               <p>S. Gasterel. About a month after this; I was there five weeks and four days.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time of your speaking of this?</p>
               <p>S. Gasterel. It was about a week after I came out of the hospital, and was in the workhouse, I told the minister of Bow church of it; Mrs. Maddox had been taken up for keeping a disorderly house before I went to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this night you speak of, was it that she was taken up?</p>
               <p>S. Gasterel. About a month after; I went to the hospital, about five weeks after I was taken up, and put into Bow workhouse, to appear against Mrs. Maddox, and there I was taken ill, and then put into the hospital. I went into the hospital on the Thursday, and Mrs. Maddox came there to me on the Tuesday following, and desired me to be as favourable in speaking as I could; and also desired me to make it up, and not to appear against her about keeping a disorderly house, and not to mention any thing of the murder of the child. I told her I would not mention that a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any servants or lodgers in the house besides you three when this was done?</p>
               <p>S. Gasterel. There had been a maid, but she was sent to Billingsgate for some shrimps, and ran away with them about a fortnight before this thing. There was also a son of Mrs. Maddox's, about fifteen years old, that was a-bed in the garret the same night; but he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason you did not speak of this for above twelve or fourteen weeks ?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040038"/>S. Gasterel. Mrs. Maddox was always crying and begging of me not to speak of it; and threatening me, before I was taken up, to put me in the Compter, for a debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon whose information was she taken up?</p>
               <p>S. Gasterel. My father and mother did not know where I lived; I went into Honeylane-market, and my cousin saw me, and watched me home, and told my father, and he came and desired the door to be opened; she at first refused it, and said I was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many houses of this kind have you been in?</p>
               <p>S. Gasterel. This is the first.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you into the house?</p>
               <p>S. Gasterel. I was hired as a servant; she did keep a fish-stall in the Fleet-market, and she hired me there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were taken up, she could do you no harm, what was the reason you did not mention this fact then ?</p>
               <p>S. Gasterel. I was very loth to mention it; fearing I should hang her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you at last to mention it?</p>
               <p>S. Gasterel. The minister of Bow church came to me; I had violent fits, and he asked me if I had nothing on my mind that made me bad? I did not tell him at first; but upon his asking me two or three times, I told him. It was at the first time of his coming.</p>
               <p>Q. You are now upon your oath, and I hope you know the obligation of an oath, and the great sin you would be guilty of, to accuse a person of such a crime, if it is not truth.</p>
               <p>S. Gasterel. It is very true indeed.</p>
               <p>On her cross-examination, she said she never was in the prisoner Maddox's house till she went to live there, and did not know she kept a disorderly house till she had been there about a week; that she was to have three pounds per year; that every night girls used to be bringing men into the house; that Jenkin's room was up one pair of stairs; that when she went into the room, the door was upon the latch; that she saw a mould or mock on the left side of the child's belly, almost as big as a farthing; that she saw it was a male child. Being asked whether she was the person talked of to be bewitched, she said, she had been in a very odd way, being tied with cords in her bed at the workhouse, and untied, and did not know by who, but said she was certain no living person could do it. She was sometimes tied to the bed, and sometimes her legs were tied, but not to the bed, and it was very rare but she was thus tied every night, and sometimes a great many times in a night, and she in her senses at the time, and that Mr.

            . I live in George-yard by Bow-lane, next door but one to Maddox's. I was sitting at my door, I think it was on a saturday, I don't know the month, it was in the summer, when cherries were plenty, Jenkins was coming by, she desired I would wash her a cap, apron and handkerchief, and desired I would go with her to the alehouse, and she would give her a pot of beer; we went together to the Crown and Cushion in Trinity-lane, into a room by ourselves. She began to tell me her husband was come home from sea, and she was with child, and did not choose to live with him, till she was delivered, and had put it away, for he should never have to say he maintains another man's child; I said, I don't believe you are with child; she said, I am sure I am, but nobody can tell by my bulk. I said again, I cannot believe it; then she pulled her bulk out of her stays, and said, will you believe it now; then I said, I believe you are. She said, I have not above a month to go, and pulled out her left breast and milked some milk into her left-hand. She left her bulk at my house two or three days, and said it hurted her. Some little time after that; at the alehouse, I asked her if she knew whose child it was, she said yes, it was
