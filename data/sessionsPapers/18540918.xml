                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, employed at Mr. Burchett's brick field, at Isleworth. I know the three prisoners; they are labouring men like myself—last Whitsun Wednesday, at 6 o'clock in the evening, I was in the brick field, and could see the five cottages in Wood-lane—I heard a noise there, and saw a number of persons throwing things at the cottages, but I could not see what they were throwing, whether they were clods or bricks, as I was too far off—I saw one very large lump of brick thrown, about the size of six bricks; it struck the cottages, and I heard a smash of glass in the windows—I did not see the doors pulled down, but I saw them in the garden, and saw parties jumping on them—I was too far off to see whether that broke them, but I heard the noise of the wood breaking—about three quarters of an hour afterwards, when I went home from work, I went to look at the cottages, and found all the windows broken—I did not see any in—I saw the places where the doors had been; some of them were out—I went inside—I only saw one ceiling, and that was in the same state as when I lived in one of the cottages, eighteen months ago—some of the grates were pulled out—I saw the fragments of the windows and doors outside—I saw the prisoners among the people there, and I also saw Henry Mason, and Palmer, and Newman, and another man, named Browning—I have not seen them since—there were a great many besides them, I should think there were six and twenty.</p>

               <p>Wednesday in Whitsun week I was out with my team, between 5 and 6 o'clock—I passed these cottages, and saw a number of people about throwing brick <hi rend="italic">bats</hi> at the cottages—I only knew one of them, John Brown<lb/>ing; not the prisoner Browning—the bricks were flying about pretty thick, one of them hit me on the foot—I only saw two people, but I heard some more—I was passing the end of the lane, not the front of the cottages—I stayed about a minute—I have not since seen either of the men whom I saw.</p>

I live across a field, about 300 yards from the cottages on Mr. Burchett's premises—the cottages look across the field, and I can see the fronts of them from where I live—I had had an accident, and was lying on my bed; I was called up, looked from the window, and saw a disturbance going on at the cottages facing—I went back again, and was afterwards called again; I went down, went to the gap way, which is about 250 yards, or 200 as the crow flies, and saw a number of people running about, and making a strange rattle—I saw things which looked like bricks thrown at the cottages, but was not near enough to hear whether the glass rattled—I did not go nearer then, but I afterwards saw a lot of doors and windows broken up outside—I should think there might have been more than half a dozen people; I do not think there were a dozen—I saw three that I knew, Joseph Carter, Henry Mason, and Newman, but I cannot say hardly which of them threw anything, for they were running backwards and forwards—I did not see Carter do anything particular—Carter has worked there since, and I have seen Mason once or twice; I told the officers so when they came and asked me—they were not employed there at brick making; Mason has not been employed there since the job happened—I do not know whether they left their work, but I did not see them at it any more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Burchett, of Isleworth, who has a brick field there. The prisoners and others were in his employment at the time this happened—I was there on this Wednesday, and heard a great noise and disturbance at the cottages; there were about two dozen persons throwing something heavy, but I could not see what, at the doors and win<lb/>dows—I saw them pick up things to throw, which appeared to be two or three bricks together—I heard the things strike the cottages, and heard a noise of breaking, a crash—I saw one man carrying a door on his back; he threw it down and stamped upon it, which broke in two of the panels—I saw a man named Mason there, whose father lived in one of the cottages—I did not see any of the people again till I saw Mason, about six weeks ago; he stopped a few minutes, or perhaps an hour or two—they all left their work, and ran away for some time, with the exception of Carter—I do not know whether the people living in the cottages were friends or relations of those who were knocking them about; they were all brick makers, or fellow workmen—an ejectment had been brought, and possession given, a few days before this—I saw George Tyler there among the rest, but was not near enough to see what he was doing—I do not know of either of the other prisoners being there at that time—I have since been over the cot<lb/>tages, and found all the window sashes out, the panes of glass were out of them, the grates were torn up, the banister railings were broken, some of</p>

I lived with the prisoner as his wife—I am not married—I have been five months in the house—I do not remember in what month it was that we went there—when I went into the house I found these tynes in the coal hole—the prisoner was coming in with a bedstead, and I said to him, "Look here what I picked up in the coal hole"—he said, "Throw them down"—I threw them down, and when we had done moving in the things I put them up on the oven, at the corner of the fire place; there was no inquiry for them, I put them up there out of the way—I remember the constable coming to the house—they were then on the oven—I swear that—I was there when he searched the house—he did not find them in a cupboard under the stairs, he found them on the oven at the corner of the fire place—no wood had been burned off them—I mean to adhere to the statement that he found them on the oven, and not in the cupboard—a lot more rubbish laid there with it—there was only one fork there—this was of no use to me; if it had been inquired for I should have delivered it up to the person it belonged to.</p>

In July, 1853, I became acquainted with the prisoner, who represented himself as nephew of a great Mr. Mead, in the East Indies—he afterwards showed me some letters; I do not know what has become of them—the first way he introduced him<lb/>self to me was, he said he had large property left him by an uncle in the East Indies; that he had seen it in the paper, and he was to apply to a soli<lb/>citor in Covent-garden; that he had ascertained that he had 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the East India Company's hands, which he had become entitled to from the death of his uncle, who was an indigo grower or planter in the East Indies, and that he expected the money every day—he said he had had his pedigree made out and sent out by the East India Company—he wanted a little money, and he applied to me for assistance—I told him I could not assist him—he said if I could afford him a little assistance he would repay me—I lent him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a time—he had several sums—he called on me on 3rd Sept., and produced this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "East India House, Leadenhall-street, London, 25th August, 1853. Sir,—I am directed by the Honourable Board of Directors to write to inform you that there is a war<lb/>rant signed for you to call for the amount of 23,810<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I am, Sir, your most obedient, James Wassall, Secretary. To William Mead, Esq., 55, Margaret-street, Great Cambridge-street, Hackney-road")—I said I did not think Wassall was the secretary's name, as I had seen the secretary's name the night before, Melville—he said there were several secretaries, a secretary to each department—I believed that, and gave him some temporary relief—I think the whole that I let him have amounted to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some odd shil<lb/>lings; and in addition to that, I boarded and lodged him and his wife—I do not know what that cost—he was with me from 1st Dec. until 6th June—I boarded and lodged them, and found him in pocket money as far as I could afford—I received this letter from him—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "Half-past 2 o'clock, Oct. 4, 1853.

I am now in full possession of which in a few days will come into the public newspapers, and in nine days from to-morrow I must enter my name in the Herald Office, and choose my herald out which I will take; so that is how I stand, to my pleasure and comfort.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner put in the following written Defence:</hi> "In Oct., 1843, an adver<lb/>tisement appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, respecting the next of kin to Samuel Mead, of Bengal, and formerly of Stanstead, Suffolk; to this advertisement the de<lb/>fendant was induced to reply, being nephew to the said Samuel Mead; Joseph Fellows, of No. 13, Piccadilly, advised and assisted the defendant in tracing out the necessary pedigree, which was in due time sent out to Bengal, attested, and with the respective seals of the Hon. East India Company, City of Lon<lb/>don, and the Public Notary in Leicester-square, in May, 1844; the defendant's claim was admitted in 1845, by letters from India to the defendant, from Josiah Moul; the matter then lay dormant; in 1850 letters directed to the defendant from the Oriental Bank in Bengal were mislaid at the Post-office, in consequence of the defendant's change of domicile from Camberwell to Hackney; these letters were returned back to India from the Post-office in 1851; this fact the defendant ascertained from one Charles Pearce, a cousin of the defendant, who saw the name accidentally in the City, at the Post-office; the defendant had several interviews on this point with the secretary of the Post-office, Colonel Maberly, who informed the defendant that three days previous these said letters had been returned back to India; this was on or about the month of April; the defendant believes that the result of these letters being returned to India was, that the entire property was thrown into the Courts of Bengal by a process similar to the Court of Chancery in this country; since then the defendant has not heard anything further relative to his claim; the property in India was sold for 230,00<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there is now six years interest due, and Mr. H. Brown holds a letter from Bengal to that effect; Samuel Mead was the paternal uncle to the defendant; he left one son, named David, who died without a will in 1843; Benjamin Albeonella, of Bengal, came over to this country on or about the month of May, 1844, to identify the defendant, which he did, and specified all the documents, &amp;c., as correct, &amp;c.; unfortunately for the defendant all the papers, vouchers, letters, &amp;c., in this matter were placed in the safe keeping of one H. Brown, solicitor, No. 13, Union-court, Old Broad-street, who has absconded, and the defendant cannot by any means discover or learn the address of the said Brown; Sarah Ann Albeonella, cousin to the defendant's wife (born Harriet Pearce), willed the defendant's wife the sum of 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per year, in the French funds, by a will executed in Paris in the year 1844, and proved in March, 1845; this will the defendant expects daily from Paris, in order to produce; (the defendant can explain why this property has not been realized; there is now a sum of about 5,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due in Dec. next); in</p>

               <p>had been in possession of the said house for twelve months, and that the amount of principal which he should ultimately advance should be paid by instalments. And this deponent, upon the faith of this promise, applied to the said Mr. Volkman to grant him a lease of the said premises, which he consented to do; and upon informing the said plaintiff thereof, he desired this deponent to request the said Mr. Volkman to let the draft of the said lease be sent to Messrs. Turner and Sons, of Mount-place, Whitechapel-road, the solicitors of the said plaintiff, for perusal on behalf of this depo<lb/>nent; and this deponent at that time believing the said plaintiff to be his friend, complied with his instructions in that respect, although the said Messrs. Turner and Sons were wholly unknown to this deponent. And this deponent further saith, that sometime in the same month of June, he was sent for by the said plaintiff to his house, and was then for the first time introduced to one of the said Mr. Turners, who produced the said lease, and counterpart, and proceeded to read over and explain the said lease, and requested this deponent to execute the said counterpart; and having so done, the said plaintiff took possession of the said lease, and has kept it ever since. And this deponent further saith, that on or about 16th Sept., in the year aforesaid, this deponent was suddenly sent for to the private residence of the said Messrs. Turner and Sons, Cockburn-road, Mile End-road, when he was informed that they had prepared a warrant of attorney between him, this deponent, and the said plaintiff, as a security to him for the sum of 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which it was then alleged that he had advanced to, and paid for this deponent. And this deponent was informed by the said Messrs. Tur<lb/>ner, that it was a mere matter of form between him, the deponent, and the said plaintiff. And this deponent further saith, that he had no attorney present attending on his behalf, to explain to him the nature of the warrant of attorney he was called upon to execute, and attest his execution thereof; nor did the said Mr. Turner, nor either of his sons, propose his calling in any professional gentleman for that purpose, or even ask this deponent if he was willing that either of them should act for him in that capacity; but Mr. Turner, jun., at once proceeded to read over the warrant of attorney, when this deponent discovered that by the defeasance to the said warrant of attorney, the money which the plaintiff had advanced to him was made pay<lb/>able on demand; and this deponent remarked, that was contrary to the arrangement between him and the said plaintiff, when the said Mr. Turner, jun., replied that it would be all right, and that it was a mere matter of form between him, this deponent, and the said plaintiff, to prevent any other creditors taking precedence of the said plaintiff, or words to that effect; and having done so, placed it before this deponent for execution, and having executed the same according to the direction of the said Mr. Turner, jun., he signed his name as a witness attesting the execution of the said warrant of attorney by this deponent, to which this deponent did not object, being at the time ignorant that it was improper and illegal for one of the plain<lb/>tiff's attorneys to act on this deponent's behalf. And this deponent further saith, that on Saturday, the 3rd day of June last, he was served by the same Mr. Turner, who attested the warrant of attorney, with a notice demanding immediate payment of the sum of 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a true copy whereof is hereunto annexed; upon receiving which this deponent went to the plaintiff, and remon<lb/>strated with him on his sending such a sudden demand, so entirely at vari<lb/>ance with the understanding between them; when the plaintiff replied, that he wanted his money, and if it was not immediately paid he, this deponent, would have an execution in his house within an hour; but this deponent at length</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180011"/>
               <p>prevailed on the said plaintiff to wait until Monday, the 5th day of June, in order that he might try if he could raise the money to pay him; but this deponent was in the mean time privately informed that as soon as he opened his house on Monday morning, a Sheriff's officer would enter with an execu<lb/>tion; and this deponent, in consequence of such information, kept his house closed, and on Tuesday, the 6th day of June, the plaintiff, accompanied by two other persons, carrying a ladder, came to this deponent's house, and placing the ladder against it, attempted to get in at the windows of the first floor, but as they were fastened, one of the persons, named William Suffolk, broke a square of glass in one of the windows, and forced out the sash bead<lb/>ing, and three persons acting under the direction of the said plaintiff, entered the room, and finding the door of the said room, leading to the interior of the house, also fastened, they broke that open and descended to the lower part of the house, and let in the Sheriff's officer; and on the 8th day of June, the whole of this deponent's goods were sold in a most reckless man<lb/>ner by a broker employed by the Sheriff's officer, and were sacrificed at less than half their value. And this deponent further saith, that it was not until recently that he became aware that he had any ground for objecting to the said warrant of attorney, or he should have made an earlier applica<lb/>tion.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, carrying on business at No. 8. Mount-place, Whitechapel-road. I have two sons, who are attorneys—neither of them are in partnership with me; they are my clerks—I have a client named Samuel Kennard, the prosecutor of this indictment—in Sept. last I received instruction from him to prepare a warrant of attorney—I think I received them the latter part of the prior month, but the warrant was prepared on 16th Sept, 1853, to secure a sum of 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—on 16th Sept. this warrant was executed in my presence, at my pri<lb/>vate residence, about 7 o'clock in the evening—the prisoner came to my house, and Mr. Kennard came with him—MR. Kennard came to complete a purchase of some freehold land, and he brought the prisoner with him at the same time to execute the warrant of attorney—when they came to my house I told Johnson that it was absolutely necessary that he should have an attorney present on his behalf to explain the nature of the instrument to him, and to attest his execution of it—he said that he did not know any attorney—I said, "There are attorneys in Bow; there will be no difficulty in procuring the attendance of a gentleman for you, and if you please my son George shall go with you to an attorney—he said he did not know any attorney in Bow—I said, "There is Mr. Ellis, the vestry clerk, and Mr. Goddard, living close by; there is no doubt we can get the attendance of one of those gentlemen"-—he said he had not employed any attorney, and he had rather not—I told him my son George was an attorney, and if he</p>

               <p>chose to employ him he might, but it was a matter of his own choice and will—he said he should be very glad for him to do so—my son was then sent for—he came into the room where Johnson, Mr. Kennard, and myself were present—I said, "George, Mr. Johnson wants you to attest a warrant of attorney for him"—I left the room—I afterwards returned, and the defendant executed the warrant in my presence—my son acted as his attorney on that occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it true, as here stated in this affidavit, "And this deponent was informed by the said Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and reside at Bow. I know the defendant—in the course of last year I advanced him 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the pur<lb/>pose of his entering into business as a baker—I did not grant him a lease of any shop—I went with him to my solicitor, the last witness, to execute a warrant of attorney—when we got there we saw Mr. Turner—we went into his back parlour, and he said it was necessary for Mr. Johnson to have an attorney to act on his behalf before this warrant of attorney could be com<lb/>pleted—I heard him say that, and Mr. Johnson said he knew no attorney—MR. Turner said there were attorneys living in Bow, and if he thought proper his son should accompany him to one of them—I do not recollect the names he mentioned—MR. Johnson said he knew no one, and he had no wish for anything of that kind—MR. Turner said his son was an attorney, and if Mr. Johnson thought proper to nominate him, he could act for him as his attorney—he used the words that it must be with his free will and consent—MR. Johnson was quite satisfied with George Turner's acting for him, and he was called into the room—MR. George Turner told him it was necessary for him to have an attorney, and he commenced reading the war<lb/>rant of attorney—he read over the whole of it—I am quite sure of that—and the defeasance was read also—there was something read about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180013"/>
               <p>Mr. Johnson said he did not owe 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—MR. Turner explained to him that it was to secure me if I lent him more money—I saw him execute the war<lb/>rant—this is his signature to it, and this signature to the affidavit is his—I am quite sure that young Mr. Turner did explain the warrant to him, and Johnson made the observation that I could come and take every thing—I said yes, of course I ought, because I had advanced the money—he said, "After this the shop will be mine," and I said, "Yes"—I was present when this affidavit was used at the Judges' Chambers, when the discussion took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Turner or his son say it was a mere matter of form between you and Johnson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he had an attorney present on his behalf—when he states he had not an attorney it is untrue—when he states that neither Mr. Turner nor his sons proposed sending for any professional gentleman, that is not true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was your connection with this shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had taken the shop—Mrs. Brown had kept it—the prisoner had been in her employ—I took the shop for my brother, and then some circumstances arose that I did not wish my brother should take it, and I agreed that the defendant should take it—he did not take some time to consider whether he would take it or no—he was in a good situation before—I might say that I would rather pay 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than my brother should have it—the defendant did not take time to consider of it—I said, "I believe you had an idea of taking the shop of Mrs. Brown"—he said, "Yes; but I have no means"—I said, "We could get the means"—he said, "Could you lend me the money?"—it was the beginning of last year that the arrangement was made for me to advance the money—I think it must have been about June—it was in September that the application was made for the warrant of attorney—the money had then been advanced three or four months, I think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not a part of the stipulation between you and this man when the money was advanced that no interest should be paid till he had been twelve months in possession, to see how the business went on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said every pound would be of consequence to him, and I would not say anything about interest till he had been twelve months—I told him when the money was advanced that he might pay the principal by instalments, and in Sep<lb/>tember I took him to my own attorney's private house to get him to sign a warrant of attorney, and I believe it was in June I carried the warrant of attorney into effect, and seized on the man's property and effects—the argument I used when he said he did not owe so much money was, that I ought to be secured in preference to the other creditors because I advanced him the money—I think he has been carrying on business altogether about nine months—I believe the twelve months did not transpire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you think it your duty to press for the money in June? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had an impression that he was getting in debt—I knew he was neglecting his business, and I knew that property had been removed on the Saturday—I had seen him in the morning, and made arrangements to wait for my money, and I found in the afternoon that his goods were being removed—I then consulted with my attorney, and acted according to his advice—if I had not been overcome by Johnson's tears and prayers, I should have got the whole of my money, but I let it stand over too long, and lost my opportunity.</p>

Johnson must have heard this—my father then left the room in about three minutes after I entered—my first, question to Johnson was, "Do you wish me to act for you as your attorney?"—he said, "Yes, I do," or "Yes"—he cer<lb/>tainly said "Yes"—I said what the statute required, and he laughed at me with a half sneer—I said, "You laugh, but it is necessary that there shall be an attorney present on your behalf; if I don't do it somebody else must"—I said again, "Do you wish me to act as your attorney?"—he replied, "Yes," or "Yes, I do"—after that I proceeded to read over the whole of the warrant of attorney—I explained to him the nature of it, and the defeasance—after reading it over fully more than once, as I got to the penal sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he said, "That is not the amount"—I said, "You will under<lb/>stand that presently"—on his saying that I was to act as his attorney, I filled in my name, George Turner—he then executed it, and I attested it—that took place on my father being called into the room.</p>

Cook and Sons, St. Paul's Churchyard, London," on a card, which was nailed on the box—the box was delivered to the carrier, I entered it in the book, the carter signed it, and I saw him take it away—I have since seen two silk robes at the Mansion-house, which I recognized as part of what I had packed—the box was about two and a half feet long, fifteen inches high, and eighteen or twenty inches wide—there were parcels for other parties in it; a parcel of barege for Hitchcock and Co.; a parcel of woollen for Henry and Co.; a parcel of gloves and stock<lb/>ings to Morley and Co.; and another to Lycett and Davis—they were all enclosed to Messrs. Cook for delivery; we frequently do that to save having different parcels—the contents of the box were worth between 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two of the robes which came to us from Cook and Sons; I saw them taken out of the box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier, of the Oxford Arms, Warwick-lane. The prisoner Smith was in my employment, to clean the horses and the stable, and to take out goods with a horse and cart; he was a sort of porter—in the early part of Aug. I had a box of goods from Nicholls and Co., of Bridgewater, which should have been delivered to Messrs. Cook, of St. Paul's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180016"/>
               <p>Churchyard—I delivered it to Smith on Monday, 14th Aug., to deliver; he had other parcels in the cart to deliver at different places—he never came back, and I found the horse and cart at the green yard—on the following morning I went to Messrs. Cook's, and in consequence of what passed there, I had reason to think that the box had never reached them—I have seen both the other prisoners before with Smith, I think, but I cannot say when or where—I will not say positively that I have seen them in his company—Smith was only in my employ about three weeks, and I should think it was during that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Thomas Shackle; he is a brewer and maltster, at Uxbridge. On 28th Aug. I went to the premises of Duval—the brewhouse adjoins a garden belonging to the brewhouse—Duval is a cooper, and has a shop in Attwell's yard—a side door of the brewery opens into Attwell's yard—that leads into the brewhouse—you cannot get into the counting house without a key—the door of the brewhouse is twenty or thirty yards from Duval's workshops, on the same side of the yard—I was certain that I had lost a great deal of property, and on 28th Aug. I had a ladder put up to the wall—I looked over, and there I saw a quantity of my father's property in Duval's premises—there was a hen house built of what I considered our property, and three boards I could swear to—I called a policeman, and went into Duval's workshop—I told him that those boards belonged to us; that I believed all of them did, but those I could swear to;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180019"/>
               <p>and I said, "I shall give you into custody, without you can tell me where you had them from"—he said that <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Ransley, who had just left us, had brought them in, and put them up—Ransley had been in our service, as a stoker—we had dismissed him on 7th Aug.—it was Ransley's duty to come to the brewhouse at 2 or 3 o'clock in, the morning, and light the fires—the servants came generally about half past 6 o'clock—my uncle generally went up to the brewhouse, for ten minutes, about 4 o'clock, and then went back to bed—the premises would be in Ransley's charge from 3 o'clock till about half past 6—these are the boards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were the bottom of an old beer cooler—we have brought one from the premises to compare with them—I can swear to them by these marks all across—they are parti<lb/>cular boards; you would not find any like them—they have been in use these forty or fifty years—Duval knew that Ransley was in our service—this is the hen box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we found that in a little yard—it belongs to my father—it was made to fit into a place—we took Ransley into custody that same day—on the 29th we got a search warrant, and went again to Duval's premises—we then found these three hop pockets in his warehouse—they are my father's—I know them by the marks, and I have the invoice of them—I also found sixteen and a half bushels of malt, and 8 lbs. 6 oz. of hops, in flour barrels, headed up, in the same warehouse; I mean that the heads of the casks were put in—I have missed malt and hops for a long time, and some of my father's hop pockets—I cannot swear to the malt and hops—I found some tiles, I think 192—they were found on the top of the hen house—the hen house had been recently put up—we had lost some tiles—I should not like to swear to the tiles; I believe they belong to my father—we missed tiles of that description—they are of a peculiar make—I missed a few slates—I found some on the top of the hen house—there was one row—I did not count them—I saw them on the 28th—I told Duval that they belonged to my father—I said I believed that the materials of the whole hen house belonged to us, but the boards I could swear to, and the hen's nest—it was after finding those things that we took him into custody, directly we had found the malt—we then found the thermometer—I said, "That belongs to me"—he said, "Yes, it does belong to Mr. Shackle"—we found that in his warehouse—I have examined the character and colour of the malt, and also my father's bulk of malt—I have samples of both here—in my judgment, they correspond exactly—one of these hop pockets I had not seen for some time; the others I must have seen more recently, because the hops were only grown last year in two of them—we suppose that they went away full—I cannot say to a month or two when they had been last on my father's premises—on that same Tuesday I went to Duval's dwelling house, on Uxbridge-moor—it is more than a mile from his warehouse—I there found eight casks, and seven we found in the warehouse—we have a sample of them here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I cannot say whether this was found at the house or the warehouse—they were all put together when they were found—it is one of my father's casks—four of the fifteen casks I can speak to distinctly; there is a brand mark on them—I have the particulars of them—I got it from my books—my books are not here—the casks had been out, and came home, and they were missed off our premises, one of them a year or so ago, but the others very lately, some time in the beginning of the summer.</p>

I was called in to assist Mr. John Shackle, in examining Duval's premises on the 28th Aug.: I found a piece of plank which Mr. John Shackle identified—he also pointed out the hen box, and the tiles and slate he said he believed to be his—Duval was present at that time, and he said that he had the things of Ransley—he said that of all the things—on the 29th I got a warrant and went there again with Roadknight—I then found some malt in tubs, I cannot say how many—I was not present when the whole were found; Mr. John Shackle claimed some of them, he particularized them—Duval had then gone to the station; Roadknight had found some of the tubs and some malt before Duval was taken to the station, but they were not identified before he was taken away—I apprehended Ransley on Monday, the 28th—I told him that Mr. Shackle, and likewise myself, had been and identified some boards and tiles, and slate, and the hen box in Duval's yard—he said he knew nothing about it—I told him that Duval had said he had them of him—he said he knew nothing of it—that was all he said that day—he had lately moved from Uxbridge to Harefield which is near to Uxbridge, and there I apprehended him—he had left Mr. Shackle some time previous to his going to Harefield—I saw him again on the Tuesday, before the bench of Magistrates at Uxbridge, at the time he was under examination—he said something to me after his examination—I did not make him any threat or promise—I con<lb/>veyed him to the House of Detention on a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> from Uxbridge, and going along he commenced a conversation respecting the robbery—I told him I did not particularly want to hear it, but if he did say anything I should notice it—he said that he in the first instance assisted Duval to a lock on purpose to get a key made, to give access to Mr. Shackle's premises—he said it was a brass lock—he did not say what it belonged to—the lock of the side door that goes into Attwell's yard, is not a brass lock—he said that the agreement between him and Duval was, that he was to receive 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per week, on purpose to give Duval access to Mr. Shackle's premises—he said that he had seen Duval remove things at various times, and that he had left Mr. Shackle's because he should not be found out.</p>

I went, in company with Mr. John Shackle, to search the house and premises of Duval—when I went up the yard, Duval was standing there—I told him I had got a search warrant to search his premises—he took the key out of his pocket, and undid the warehouse door—I went with Mr. Shackle through his warehouse into a little workshop, in a little yard, at the back of the warehouse, and in his workshop I found this thermometer—MR. Shackle said, "That is ours"—Duval said, "Yes, that is yours, Mr. Shackle"—in a flour tub, in the same place, I found about a bushel of malt—I said, "This is malt; how do you account for this?"—he said, "It is for my fowls"—that answer did not satisfy me, and I said, "You must now consider yourself in custody"—I then went into the warehouse with Mr. Shackle—I found seven flour tubs headed down; they were about three bushel tubs; some were full and some not—the heads of the tubs were fixed in—one head was taken out, and I said, "This is also malt"—that was full of malt—I said, "Here are six more; do they contain malt?"—Duval said, "They do"—in another flour barrel I found about eight lbs. of hope; that was not one of the seven tubs, but a separate one—I did not at that time proceed to ascer<lb/>tain whether or not the other six tubs did contain malt—I did afterwards—there were sixteen bushels and a half altogether—nothing was said about the hops; he gave me no account of anything—as I found these things, Mr. Shackle claimed them, and I took them all into my possession—the seven casks had the numbers upon them—the names had been chopped out of them all—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were all cut in this way—the other casks of Mr. Shackle are marked "J. Shackle, Uxbridge," in the place where these are chopped—Mr. Shackle claimed these—I then took Duval into custody, and sent him by Beaman to the station—I then went with Mr. Shackle to the dwelling-house of Duval, at Uxbridge Moor—I searched the house, and found eight more brewer's casks, also with the brand mark chopped off and the numbers remaining—they were claimed by Mr.</p>

               <p>Shackle—on Wednesday, 30th Aug., I went to Howard's house, at Cowley, about a mile and a half from Uxbridge—he was not at home, but I met him in the road—he has been in the employment of a gentleman there for twenty-nine years, I believe, and I have known him fifteen years—I know the other two prisoners—I have seen them and Howard together—I said to Howard, "<hi rend="italic">Ben</hi>, you know Duval and Ransley are in custody, and I have been told you have been removing some of the things away from Duval's place down to his house"—he said he had moved nothing away but three flour tubs, and those I might go to his (Howard's) house and see, if I liked—we were a very short distance from his house at the time; I had just come from it—I went back with him to see the tubs, and there were three fowls feeding in the yard—I tasted one of the corns, and said, "This is malt"—he said, "No it is not, it is barley; my wife bought it at White's"—that is a person who keeps a corn shop in the neighbourhood, who sells barley—I then went into the house, and in the kitchen I found about a pottle of malt in a tub—I said, "Now this is malt, Howard; don't get yourself into trouble for other people"—he said, "It was Duval gave it me for my fowls"—I said, "You were seen up in Shackle's yard the other morning, moving some things away from Duval's shed"—he said, "I moved away three small brewer's casks empty, and something in some bags, which he told me was chips; I do not know what they contained"—he said he had taken them to Duval's house—the three flour casks that I found at Howard's were not Mr. Shackle's; they belong to Duval, who is a cooper, and makes tubs for a mustard factory—all I found in his house was this small quantity of malt—on the following Monday, 4th Sept., I brought Ransley from the House of Detention—I took him to my house to give him something to eat, and to change his shirt—the inspector was there—I had previously received a letter from him—I said nothing to induce him to make any statement, nor did I begin the conversation—he said, "I am very glad I have got away from Mr. Shackle's; I have been very uneasy in my mind for some time; Duval would never leave me alone; on Friday week Duval called me up at 4 o'clock in the morning; I got up and got over the wall into Mr. Shackle's premises, and let Duval in"—and he said it must have been then that he took away this property that we had found; the rest of the property he said Duval had taken away himself—Ransley seemed very sorry for what he had done—I have known him for some time—this is the letter I received from him while he was in custody—his wife brought it to my house—I do not know his handwriting—he afterwards asked me whether I had received a letter from him—I said I had, and he said he wanted to see me before he went before the Magistrate—he stated at the time that there were others of Mr. Shackle's men that had been robbing him for some time—he mentioned their names, and said, "If you go to such a man's house you will find so and so—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read:</hi> "Sept 18. Sir,—I do not know whether I am asking an impossibility, or not, but as most likely the Justice room will be full on Monday to hear our case, if you can prevent any one but the prisoner's relations being there I think it would be beat, as I shall in my evidence say things that perhaps master would not like every one to know. I am very glad it is found out, for it made me miserable when I knew such things were going on. I should have still been at Mr. Shackle's if it had not been for Duval; it was through him that I left as I did, and through him that I left Uxbridge as soon as I could, for he would not leave off. I should like to see you on Monday morning before we go in, if you can get there. Accept my best respects. I remain, your obedient servant, Benjamin Childe Ransley."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter at Uxbridge. On Monday morning, 31st July, I was working at Mr. Grimsdell's mustard mills, which are close to Mr. Shackle's brewhouse—between 5 and 6 o'clock that morning I saw Ransley unlock Mr. Shackle's side door in Attwell's yard, and lock it again</p>

               <p>—that door led to the open shed—I also saw Duval; they both of them loaded themselves with tiles, took them away, and locked the door—I am not speaking of the door leading into the brewhouse; it is a door that leads to an open shed—they took the tiles partially up the yard—I did not watch where they went to.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Justice Coleridge—I produce an affidavit purporting to have been made by the defendant Howe, on 19th April last—it merely verifies certain depositions taken against two persons named Blatchford and Scott—I know Howe—I have frequently seen him write—I believe the signature to this affidavit to be his writing—I cannot say that he was present when the affidavit was used; I presume he was.</p>

               <p>no other affidavit of Howe's—this one was sworn before me; I am a Com<lb/>missioner for taking affidavits—this memorandum directing the writ to issue, was made on 22nd April—on 27th April, I was in attendance at the Judges' Chambers—I saw Howe there—he presented a paper to me (<hi rend="italic">looking atone</hi>)—the summons was heard before Mr. Justice Wightman, and his clerk has the affidavit (<hi rend="italic">they were produced</hi>)—I cannot swear to the defendant Thompson's handwriting—I have a slight belief about it; I know him, and very likely I have seen him write, and acted upon his writing, but I cannot call it to mind—as far as my belief goes, I think I have seen him write, and I believe this signature of "William Thompson" to be his writing—the signature to this other affidavit I believe to be Howe's—they appear to have been made before Mr. Justice Wightman; I believe they were sworn before Mr. Morris.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued.</hi>) The paper that Howe produced on the 27th, was a notice with a consent at the back—I am certain that Howe produced it; this is it (<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "Notice. 25th April, 1854. The Queen against Mary Ann Blatchford; felony. Take notice, that I shall tender as bail for the abovenamed Mary Ann Blatchford, on Thursday, 27th April, at half past two o'clock in the afternoon, William Hughes, of the Sportsman beer shop, Grange-road, Bermondsey, beer shop keeper, and William Rock, of No. 4, Beaumont-square, Mile End-road, bookseller, pursuant to the order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Wightman, here-unto annexed. Signed, Reuben Simpson, No. 107, Blackfriars-road."—That order is, "Upon hearing the affidavits of William Howe and William Thompson, I do order that the prisoner, Mary Ann Blatchford, be admitted to bail as to this charge, William Blatchford, her husband, in the sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two sureties of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; the prisoner to give forty-eight hours' notice of bail to the prosecutrix"—I really do not know whose handwriting this "Reuben Simpson" is; I do not know Mr. Simpson's handwriting—I should rather think it is Howe's handwriting, but I could not swear it; it was produced to me by Howe—I really cannot say whose handwriting it is—that order would operate as a discharge of Blatchford, upon bail being put in—bail would not be accepted if the forty-eight hours' notice was not given, unless the parties come and consent—if no consent is given, then we require proof of the forty-eight hours' notice; but where consent is given, and parties appear on both sides, it is dispensed with—at the time Howe showed me the notice, he told me that he had got a consent to the bail; and at the same time he produced this paper (<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "I consent to the within bail. R. Hare, 27th April, 1854")—upon seeing that, I said, "Who is R. Hare," or "Mr. Hare?"—Howe said, "The prosecutrix's attorney"—I said, "If so, he must state himself as such," and I gave him back the paper—at that time there were several persons standing round; I did not notice any one, not to know the person—in the course of a minute or two Howe returned the paper to me with these words, "Prosecutrix's attorney" added to it—I did</p>

               <p>not notice anybody write those words—I cannot swear that I saw a person write the words; the paper was returned to me immediately by Howe, wet, the ink was not dry; he certainly did not write it himself—I know Gavin Rickards very well—I did not see him there on that occasion that I know of—upon that consent the order was made for the discharge—I have known Gavin Rickards acting at the Judges' Chambers for many years, as clerk to different attorneys—I think I know his handwriting—I could not swear to this being his handwriting—I have no belief as to the hand writing, I cannot say one way or the other—I could not say I believe it to be his handwrit<lb/>ing—I am not sufficiently acquainted with his handwriting to say so—Howe certainly did not write it, he was so close to me that I must have seen him, and I should not have received it if he had done it—the ink was wet when it was handed to me; I remember blotting it up.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I take it from you that the affidavit verifying the copy of the deposition is the usual mode of making these applications? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; an affidavit verifying a copy of the depositions is not required in all cases—it is very frequently done—the other affidavit of Howe is simply of the service upon the Magistrate—I did not know Mr. Simpson—Howe always professed to act as clerk to Mr. Simpson—I should say I have known him professing to act as clerk of Mr. Simpson for some years at the Judges' Chambers—I should think I have known him acting in civil pro<lb/>ceedings as well as in criminal—it is the constant practice for attorneys to act at Judges' Chambers by their clerks—the majority of them act there through their clerks, and they have audience before the Judge just the same as an attorney or barrister—I should say that the managing clerk more fre<lb/>quently attends to business than the principal—some of the great attorneys, I should think, I may never have seen—clerks have frequently signed the names of their principals—I believe the majority of consents given are signed by clerks—I think a consent to release a party from custody for debt may have been frequently signed in that way—I cannot call to mind any particular occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you take a consent for the discharge of a prisoner out of gaol for debt, signed by a clerk, as a sufficient authority for his discharge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say, if that clerk had been in an office that I knew, and had been conducting the proceedings throughout, I do not know that I should have had any objection, up to the present time—I should not in future, of course.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As a general rule, the majority of summonses purporting to have the consent of the principals are signed by the clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the majority of cases; but for the discharge of a prisoner for a large sum of money, I should not take it—I have known Howe practising for many years in the Judges' Chambers, and should say in all sorts of proceedings—when there is a summons at the Judges' Chambers, and one party is waiting for the other, it is the practice to call out the name of the cause over and over again—I did not on 27th April hear Howe call out, "The Queen against Blatchford," that I know of; I did not notice—I do not remember how long Howe was there upon that day—I cannot say whether he called out over and over again, "The Queen and Blatchford"—I do not remember at what time in the afternoon the order for the discharge was made—I have some-times known the clerks of Magistrates attend before the Judges with the depositions on questions of bail—it is a very noisy place sometimes outside the Judges' Chambers—I do not know that Magistrates' clerks have attended to oppose bail; they may have gone in—I do not attend inside, unless I am required to go in—another gentleman attends inside, but I take</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180037"/>
               <p>it he would not take any notice of what was going forward before the Judge—applications are frequently made to admit persons to bail, who have been committed for trial—counsel have frequently attended to make such appli<lb/>cations, and have handed in affidavits—attorneys have attended as well as attorneys' clerks—I do not remember a book of practice being looked at at the time these recognizances were being entered into—I do not remember assisting them as regards the form of the recognizance—they might have asked for the book of practice; I do not remember it—they would have had it if they had asked for it—sometimes it is asked for.</p>

Rogers—I do not know to what particular parties he was clerk—I do not know how long I have known him acting as clerk to Mr. Hare—I did not know for whom he was acting—I do not mean that he was acting as clerk to different attorneys at the same time—he has changed from one office to another—I have no recollection what offices he was in—I have seen him in the habit of attending Chambers many years—he is very well known there—he has acted before this, in criminal proceedings—I do not recollect any particular instance—I can state positively that he has, but I cannot say in what instance—the person who wrote the words "Prosecutrix's attorney" must have stood not far from me—Howe was the nearest to me—he handed me the paper—I gave it him back again, and in the course of a very short time he handed it to me again, with those words added to it, and not dry—that leads me to infer that the person who wrote it was standing near to him, and certainly not far from me—I did not see Rickards that day to my knowledge—I believe he lives in the same neighbourhood as I do—he once came to me to swear an affidavit—he said he lived near.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked about Rickards and Howe acting as clerks to attorneys; do you know anything about their being clerks to any attorneys at all, except from what they described themselves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From their attendance there as clerks to attorneys; from their own repre<lb/>sentations—I know now that there is such a person as Mr. Hare—he was pointed out to me at Bow-street by somebody—I have seen Mr. Hare at Chambers, if it was Mr. Hare who was pointed out to me at Bow-street—I do not know, except from what Rickards himself represented, that he was clerk to Mr. Hare at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether there is any such person as Reuben Simpson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A person was pointed out to me this morning as Mr. Simpson—I do not know, except from Howe's representations, that he was clerk to that person; I have no knowledge of it—I was in the lobby of this Court when some<lb/>body said, "There is Mr. Simpson"—Howe has on many occasions, indeed I believe always, represented himself as clerk to Mr. Simpson—it is a very common case, so many summonses as we have, to take the signature of a clerk representing the principal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that you would do so in such a case as the one in which the signature of Hare, as the prosecutrix's attorney, was signed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Know<lb/>ing the party in this case, Mr. Howe, who has attended us upon so many occasions, and coming through his hands, I accepted it, because I did not know who gave the consent, I supposed it was given by Mr. Hare—I sup<lb/>posed it to be Mr. Hare's writing—if I had not supposed it to be Mr. Hare's writing, I should not have allowed the writ to issue.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180038"/>
               <p>with a felony, is or is not the principal's signature necessary, or would the clerk's be taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I say again, that would depend upon circumstances—in some offices where I know the clerk, and where he has conducted the whole of the proceedings, and I know that he is authorized to proceed and act in the matter, I should take his consent—until Mr. Hare was pointed out to me the other day, I did not know him as Mr. Hare—I knew him personally—I certainly should not have taken the signature of a clerk of a Mr. Hare—I should not have taken any signature but the principal's in that case, but in some cases, where I am acquainted with the office, and where I know the clerk is authorized to conduct the proceedings, and where he has con<lb/>ducted them throughout, I should take his consent—in this case I should not have taken the consent of any person representing himself to be clerk to a Mr. Hare, because I did not know Mr. Hare—if Howe had not represented this to be Hare's signature, I should not have allowed it to pass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If Howe had called out "The Queen against Blatchford" several times in the Chambers, should you not have heard him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I very likely might have heard him, but I should have taken no notice of it; perhaps there may be fifty persons calling out at the same time the names of the cases in which they are attending; we pay no attention to it; it does not apply to us—I do not know who it was that pointed out Mr. Hare to me at Bow-street—it was when we were attending in this case before the Magistrate, and some one said, "There is Mr. Hare."</p>

Potter calls one week, and Mr. Gray another week, they come on Thursdays)—the other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in the cash box was clean—I paid Mr. Potter 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, one of which was the one that I received from the prisoner—it is my practice to put the Post—office stamp upon the notes I pay to Mr. Potter—this "Holborn Ban," in green ink is the stamp I so put on—I saw the prisoner leave the shop—there was no writing on the note when I received it—these two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), are the other notes I paid to Mr. Potter; they are stamped in the same way, and I swear to them—on the following day I saw Mr. Potter, and, he returned me the dirty 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note.</p>

On Friday, 11th Aug., the prisoner came to the bar between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and called for a quartern of gin and a cigar; he paid me with a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then asked me if I could give him change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, pulling one out of his pocket, and handing it to me—I handed it to my master in the bar parlour—I looked at it; it was pasted at the back with two strips of postage stamp edging, the same as this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here are to dis<lb/>tinct strips of paper in it—MR. Wakeford then came out, and asked the prisoner to write his name and address on the back of it; a pen and ink were supplied to him, and he wrote something on the back of the note and handed it to Mr. Wakeford again, who looked at it, and said that it was so small and indistinct he could not read it, and declined changing it—the prisoner then said that his was a foreign name, and gave Mr. Wakeford a card to prove his respectability; Mr. Wakeford still refused to change it—before he gave the card he asked Mr. Wakeford to produce another note; Mr. Wakeford did so, and handed it to the prisoner, who folded it up, rubbed it with his hands, and then said it was a new note and would not look the same as his, it had not been worn so, and that his was an old note—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the card he handed to my master—MR. Wakeford still refused to change the note, and the prisoner left the shop taking it with him—on Wednesday, 23rd Aug., I accompanied my master to the police court, Bow—street—I believe this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to be the one I handed to my master from the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a law stationer by business, and live at No. 39, Southampton—buildings, Holborn. In Aug. I was managing the business of Messrs. Atkinson, of 94, Chancery—lane—I have known the prisoner three years and upwards; he was in the habit of coming to see me at Mr. Atkin<lb/>son's daily, or nearly so—when I have been obliged to go away, I have frequently left him in charge of the shop—I remember his apprehension; about a week previous to that, he came to Messrs, Atkinson's to me, and said that he had hit upon a <hi rend="italic">dodge</hi> that would be of advantage to me as well as to himself, of making money—he enjoined secrecy on my part, that I was not to mention what it was if I did not approve of it—he then produced a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to me, told me that it was a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>, and asked me what I thought of it—I looked at it, and told him I thought the paper was too thick—he said that I should not have known it was a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>, if he had not told me—I said, "Perhaps not"—he said he could get them for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and if in receiving money for my employers in the shape of notes I would <hi rend="italic">ring the changes</hi>, we could divide the profits between us; that is, to take one of his notes, and substitute it for the other—I declined having any<lb/>thing to do with it, and said that my books would show all notes I had, and that I could not show any note transaction without producing the per<lb/>sons from whom I received them—a day, or not more than two days after<lb/>wards, he adverted to the subject again, and pressed me to have something to do with the notes; I declined, and he said that the notes passed without difficulty, and that they went to the Bank without detection; that there was no fear, and that he had done one himself in Holborn, and one down Commercial—road way, but did not mention the place—on a subsequent occasion, probably next day, or a day or two afterwards, he produced to me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and asked me what I thought of it—I said I liked the appear<lb/>ance of that much better than the other, but still I declined having any<lb/>thing to do with it—he still endeavoured to persuade me, but I declined, and was perplexed in my own mind as to what method I should adopt; I thought it dangerous having any connection with any such transactions—on the last occasion, or last but one, he said if he was detained, or any inquiry made, would I state that I had given him the note, and my being in a respectable position, and admitting it, no further inquiry would be made—I am frequently in Mr. Brown's shop, and I went in there accidentally when he was making a statement about a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; having heard which I gave information to the police, and the prisoner was apprehended—I had one conversation with the prisoner previous to my giving information—I gave information on the same day as the last conversation; that was the day before his apprehension, and a fortnight or three weeks after I had been in Mr. Brown's shop—on the evening before his apprehension, and after I had given information to the police, the prisoner came to me between 8 and 9 o'clock (I had given information between 4 and 5 o'clock that same day)—he came to endeavour to persuade me to pass some of these notes, and produced an old 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note with a patch on the back of it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—he said he had some difficulty in changing it, as it was so defaced, and he wanted to make it appear that it had been in circulation, by having some names on the back, and wanted me to put my name; I declined doing so—he said he thought I was going to be treacherous to him, as I would not aid him—I said, "No"—he said what hesitation could I have, "Write Brown, Jones, or Robinson, or any other name"—I ultimately wrote,</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The witness gave her evidence principally in English, with the occasional assistance of an interpreter</hi>). I am the wife of Antonio Janik; my theatrical name is Caradori; that was my maiden name.

Mr. Jarratt's management failed—they closed the theatre, without giving a reason, and for some time had not paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After that was an arrangement made by the principal <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi> to carry on the theatre if possible? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was Mr. Jarratt's intention to re—open the theatre, but not under his name, and he talked to the <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi> about it—</p>

               <p>first, all the expenses were to be paid from the receipts, the servants, car<lb/>penters, rent, illumination, scenery, and everything connected with the service of the theatre, and afterwards two—thirds of the salary of the chorus and orchestra, and one—third for the principal <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi>—I do not know the defendant by name—I saw him on the stage, but did not know his name—the term "association" would be applicable to such an arrangement as this—I do not know whether the prisoner would be one of the persons who would be favoured by this arrangement; I suppose he would—MR. Jarratt made all the arrangements, only his name was not put as director—he chose the committee—I remember Saturday night, 19th Aug.—the defendant had made no claim upon me before that night, either verbally, by letter, or in any way—he had never spoken to me but once, when I explained to him about a scene at the rehearsal of Semiramide; it was something which was going down, and I thought it should be straight—that was the only conver<lb/>sation I ever had with him; and next day there was another rehearsal, and he made it so as I had explained—I think that was on the Tuesday before the 19th Aug.—on Tuesday I explained to him how it must be, and on Wednesday it was done—I did not owe him a sum of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was not obliged to pay anything—he never demanded such a sum from me—I did not on Thursday, 17th Aug., state to Sloman that I intended to leave England—I had not seen Mr. Sloman on that day—I did not on that day state to any one that it was my intention to leave England—I had not the slightest idea to leave England, for I was waiting for another engagement—I did not before Saturday, 19th Aug., state to any one that I intended to leave England—I was arrested, between 11 and 12 o'clock on that night, by the house of Mr. Jarratt, No. 37, Alfred—place, Bedford—square—I had been performing at the theatre that night—I had. occasion to call at Mr. Jarratt's on my way home, to leave his lady's maid, who always dressed me at the theatre—I took her home; and when she was gone out, directly two persons came into my carriage—I should not know them again—Signor Pavesi was in the carriage with me—I took him always to the theatre with me, for he lives in Alfred—place—the two persons who came into my carriage said that I must go with them, before they told anything—I was so frightened, I thought they were bad men—I did not know anybody, and they came so <hi rend="italic">precipitous</hi> into my carriage, and they kept me—I moved myself and said, "What do you here?"—they said, "You must go with us"—"Why?"—"You must go with us; don't make a noise, and be quiet"—I was defending myself, for I was frightened, and did not know what it was for—I said, "Why must I go with you?"—"Don't ask; you must go"—Signor Pavesi thought they were bad men, and went out of the carriage and called the policeman—the policeman came, and the two gentlemen who were in my carriage spoke to the policeman, what I did not understand, and then they put Pavesi in the carriage, and brought us, and arrested us, and in the arrest I asked again, "Why, what for," and they said, "You owe 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Sloman"—I was quite astonished to hear that, for I did not know who Mr. Sloman was—he said, "You don't know?"—I said, "No"—"He is the carpenter of the theatre;" and I was the more astonished how it was that the carpenter of the theatre put me in prison—I said I did not know why, and they told me, "You owe that to him"—I said, "No, Sir; I don't owe it to anybody, for I am not obliged to pay"—I do not recollect what place it was they took me to—I was detained the whole night, and the next day, Sunday, till the evening—Signor Pavesi was also detained—I sent for Messrs. Lewis and Lewis, my solicitors, on the Sunday morning I do not</p>

               <p>know precisely the sum that I paid in order to got away, but it was more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw it paid, but I do not remember how much it was—I was tired with the performance, and I was brought into the house without supper, and without anything, and a very bad bed; I could not sleep in it—they said, "We cannot get anything, for it is Sunday"—I could not have a bottle of beer, or anything, because they said, "It is Sunday; we cannot get anything"—Signor Pavesi does not speak English—while I was here I hired a carriage—I had not given it up; I had always the same; I have it now—I reside at No. 57, Gower—street, now—I had not given any notice to leave—now I have given notice that on the 27th I must be at Manchester—before 19th Aug. I entered into an engagement with Mr. Knowles, of the Theatre Royal, Manchester, to sing there—I signed the contract on 2nd Aug.—this is the contract (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—I had intended to reside in England, to make it my home, for the purpose of following my profession—I had applied for letters of naturalization for that purpose—this is the answer that I received (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I received it on 17th Aug., at 8 o'clock—if I had intended to go abroad, it would have been necessary to have my passport <hi rend="italic">vise</hi>—I have my passport here—I have not since received the letters of naturalization.</p>

Q.</hi> You are not the lady who is known in this country under the name of Madame Caradori Allen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I know Mr. Smith, the lessee of Drury—lane theatre—between the time of Mr. Jarratt's failure and the reopening of the theatre I think about three weeks elapsed—in that interval I saw Mr. Smith upon the subject of myself and the other principal <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi> reopening the theatre—Mr. Reichart, the other first singer, who is gone away, told me to go and ask Mr. Smith in what manner it could be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the principal <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi>, yourself among the number, to form a committee for the management? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not in that way—the other <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi> would not sing if Mr. Jarratt opened the theatre, and I went to Mr. Smith to ask how it could be done—MR. Jarratt wanted to make eighteen representations, because if he could finish the eighteen perform<lb/>ances, the committee of the theatre would give him back his dresses and property, which were under sequestration—MR. Reichart was the first that told me so—he said it could not go on, and that they wanted the four prin<lb/>cipal <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi>, myself, Reichardt, Formoste, and Buri, to give a guarantee to the committee of the theatre that we would perform, a guarantee to the amount of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the engagement at Manchester, in order to relieve the sequestration that was upon the dresses and property of Mr. Jarratt—Mr. Smith said that he wanted 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give up the sequestration, and we said we could not give so much—I did not tell Mr. Smith that it was my wish to go on with the theatre for the eighteen nights in order to keep faith with the public—I had been performing under Mr. Jarratt's engagement for the whole season, previous to the week commencing on 12th Aug.—I had seen the defendant on the stage, but I did not know him—I believe he and his men had the management of the working of the scenes, but I never spoke to him—I have not seen him there every night, but I have seen him sometimes—we certainly could not go on without the head carpenter and his assistants—I do not know who the treasurer was, before Mr. Jarratt was unfortunate—MR. Lewis acted as treasurer during the week from the 12th to the 19th—MR. Oswald offered himself to do what was necessary in the theatre, for Mr. Jarratt could not sign anything, and he is a great friend of Mr. Jarratt's—I do not know by what name he was called; we called him</p>

               <p>what we liked, but be signed the free tickets and looked to the accounts—it was his business to sign the accounts before they were paid—I directed Mr. Lewis not to pay any of the workmen's bills at the theatre that had not been signed by Mr. Oswald, because Mr. Oswald said if he did not look over the account it would not go right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you yourself say that you would not have Mr. Jarratt as the manager of the <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi>, but that you would have a new bill published that the matter was under a new management? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We all said together, all the <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi> and all who were in the theatre, that the performance ought to go under a new management, or else the creditors of Mr. Jarratt would seize the receipts of the theatre—MR. Levy then said that we must take off the number of the representation (it was the eighty—third representation) for if that was left on the bills the creditors of Mr. Jarratt would come and take the money, seeing it was a continuation of the old direction—that was for the public to think it was another director, and not Jarratt—my dresser's name is Pamela; she is the lady's maid of Mr. Jarratt—I was tired in the course of the week ending on the 19th—before the performance began under Mr. Jarratt, I said I would not sing more than a week, and that he might provide himself with other <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi>—I do not know whether the week ended on the Friday—I never had to do with the appointments—I do not know that Saturday, the 19th, was an extra night—I do not know whether it was or not—I had promised to sing that Saturday, and all the rest did not concern me—MR. Jarratt was the director—he said what was to be per<lb/>formed, and was doing what was necessary, and I had nothing to do with the rest of the affair—I did not see the accounts of a night—one day they brought a mass of papers on the table, but I did not understand them—that was only on one day—I think it was the first Monday after the first performance—that would be the 14th—the mass of papers was not brought for me—it was brought into the theatre—I think Mr. Lewis brought it—I never stated to anybody that it was my intention to go abroad, and return to my engagement at Manchester after the Friday at the end of that week—I had no such intention, and I never said so to anybody—I never told any one that I should go away—I said nothing about going abroad, I am quite sure of that—Signor Pavesi was desirous of an engagement at Manchester—that Manchester performance was not under Mr. Jarratt, it was under Mr. Knowles—in the beginning I believe it was Jarratt, but afterwards Jarratt said he had nothing to do with it, it was Knowles—Signor Pavesi applied for an engagement, and did not get one—I was not angry at that—I did not after that say to the prisoner, or to any one, that I would go abroad, and not return until my performance at Manchester, or anything to that effect—I was told that I had not been residing in this country a sufficient time to naturalize me—I learnt English in this country for two months.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am a native of Naples—I sing under the name of Pavesi—I was one of the singers engaged at Drury-lane, by Mr. Jarratt—I speak Italian and French, I cannot speak English at all, and do not understand it—I have seen Sloman, the defendant, some-times on the stage, but I did not know his name or his employment—I never had any conversation with him—I did not see him on 17th Aug.—I did not tell him that I and Madame Caradori were going abroad—I did not tell him that I was going to Germany—I was in company with Madame Caradori when she was arrested—I was not aware of any claim that Sloman or anybody else had upon me at that time—I was locked up as well—I could not understand, that in London, the first city in the world, we could be arrested, and shut up by the law; I thought I was in the house of an assassin, and I called for the police—I have got no debt, I owe nothing to anybody, and never heard such a shame in all my life—I was released at the same time as Madame Caradori, by the advance of a sum of money—I have been in this country ever since—I am engaged for some concert, after that I shall see how my affairs will go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you state to anybody in the course of the week, from the 12th to the 19th, your intention of immediately going to Milan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said to Mr. Jarratt, before the engagement at Drury—lane, that I should go to Milan to seek an engagement, but Mr. Jarratt pressed me and begged me to remain, and I got persuaded by Mr. Jarratt, and remained—I said to Jarratt, that I and Madame Caradori would not sing further than the 19th—I never agreed with the chorus to remain for the eighteen nights.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there not a meeting on the stage, on Saturday, the 19th, and a disturbance on that very subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went on the stage, and there was some noise—there had been a disturbance on the Friday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the weekly performance end on the Friday, and was not Saturday an extra night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing at all about it, I never mixed about the direction—I was disappointed at not meeting with an engagement at Manchester, but it was a disappointment that every <hi rend="italic">artiste</hi> meets with at times—I did not, on Thursday, the 17th, tell Oswald, the secretary, that I would go to Milan, nor on any other day in the course of that week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you and Madame Caradori usually travel together, when you have engagements? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went to Edinburgh with the other performers, and that was the only voyage I made—I went to Amsterdam alone, and came back to London—last winter they offered me an engagement at Milan, but I did not agree on the price, and I went and sang in Holland—I remained two months in London last winter, and then they gave me a promise of an engagement to sing in 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Puritani</hi>—they gave me a part to study, but I never performed, and I went to Amsterdam—I went with all the <hi rend="italic">troupe.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On Saturday, 19th, were not the chorus so angry with you, that Mr. Smith was called in to explain, with you, why it was you did not perform your eighteen nights' engagement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Saturday I came upon the stage, and saw several of the chorus—I saw Mr. Jarratt talk with several persons, and then they called for Mr. Smith—I heard Mr. Jarratt speak with Mr. Smith, who was saying, "Yes, yes"—I went to Mr. Smith, and asked him to speak in French—I heard my name pronounced several times,</p>

               <p>"Pavesi, Pavesi"—MR. Jarratt said, "Is it not true, Mr. Smith, that Mr. Pavesi has come to ask you for the theatre?"—MR. Smith said, "Yes"—I said, "You tell a falsehood"—MR. Smith then made answer that this evening he would give the theatre for nothing, and then there was loud applause—on Friday I was on the stage, when there was another dis<lb/>turbance—MR. Levy called me into the green room, and said, "Come, come, I want to speak to you in private"—I said, "Speak before everybody"—Mr. Arnoldi, the baritone, was present—MR. Levy said, "If you do not sing the next week the chorus and the orchestra will go before the Judge, and obtain an arrest, to place you in prison"—I said, "Sir, do you speak the truth?"—he said, "Yes, they will place you in prison, you and Madame Caradori;" so I went to the orchestra and the chorus, and said, "Gentle<lb/>men, I do not know to speak English; I beg you will allow me to speak in French, and some one among you will translate what I say. Mr. Jarratt has come and begged and prayed for Madame Caradori and me to sing for him; we could not resist his prayers, and we consented; we said we would sing on Saturday, the 19th, and now the solicitor of Mr. Jarratt threatens to place Madame Caradori and myself in prison, if we do not sing after Saturday"—there was a great cry in the orchestra of "No, no, we will not do that"—MR. Jarratt came and said, "Oh, Signor Pavesi, you are mistaken; you are mistaken;" and Mr. Levy, who was rather behind, said loudly, "No, no, it is not true"—MR. Arnoldi said, "Yes, you have said it;" then the rehearsal was at an end, and every one departed—in an hour after I called on Mr. Jarratt, at the theatre, with Mr. Penini, and made him say that after Saturday we should not sing, and they were to place on the bills, that Saturday was the last night we would sing.</p>

Sloman sought me; I never sought Mr. Sloman—when he came to me to draw the affidavit, I was not aware what the contents of the affidavit were to be until he told me—I did not suggest to him the fact that Madame Caradori had informed him that they were going away; that was no suggestion of mine—I was in the theatre on the Friday night, and Mr. Sloman came up to me and said he wanted to speak to me about Madame Caradori; he was afraid that he could not get paid, and therefore he intended to proceed against them—I said, "Come down to my office to—morrow and tell me, because I can do nothing now, and then I will speak to you upon the subject"—he asked me where he was to come, and I gave him my address; he came down on the following morning; he then told me the nature of his claim—I asked him how much it was; he went out of my office to get the amount, and brought it back upon a card—he told me that Madame Caradori was going away, and that I should arrest her—I said, "When?" and he said, "On Thursday she told me they were going away, and I shall lock them up," and Madame Caradori having told me the same, I believed it was the truth, she having told me in that week that she intended to leave the theatre and go abroad, I thought it was true.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this the first time that you have made any such statement as this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was only examined in chief at the police court; I was not cross-examined—when Sloman came to me about the matter, I said that under the circumstances, having seen Madame Caradori, and also having been about matters connected with the theatre, and being Mr. Jarratt's attorney, I would rather not have anything to do with it—he said, "Well, then, I must get some one; do you know any one?" and I said, "Yes, Mr. Lewis will do it."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Sloman appear perfectly to comprehend what he was swearing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should imagine so; I read the affidavit over to him, and he had it himself; I left it with him to sign while I went into the inner room for about three minutes—I read the affidavit over after I had drawn it for him—I certainly did not draw it from my own imagination, but from what he told me—he did not dictate the words to me, but he told me that she told him she was going away, and I drew the affidavit accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he also tell you that Signor Pavesi had told him he was going away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes: he told me that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> said they were going away.</p>

Leader and Cox—I came into the theatre, and then Madame Caradori called me to know whether I had seen them—she said she would not be annoyed—she said, "If they intend to annoy me, I shall go from the theatre entirely"—I said, "It would be very unfair for you to go from the theatre"—then she went away—this was on the Friday—Signor Pavesi was behind with Mr. Arnoldi—in the green room after<lb/>wards, Monsieur Pavesi also asked me whether I had seen Messrs. Leader and Cox, and showed me a letter that he had received from Mr. Smith, and asked me what answer he should give to it—then they said they were going away—I said, "I have conveyed Madame Caradori's message to Mr. Oswald, and some of the chorus have been up stairs; and said, it is very hard you have got them to fall into an engagement for eighteen nights to sing, and now you are going away"—I was not in Court all the time Signor Pavesi was giving his evidence—I certainly did not threaten to arrest Monsieur Pavesi, on the part of the chorus—I said I had heard in the theatre that he was going to be arrested, and I said he had better stay the time out, but I never threatened him—when he called me on the stage and asked me, I said, "Certainly not, I never told you anything about the chorus; I merely said they complained that it was very hard after having made an arrange<lb/>ment with you for eighteen nights, you have broken the contract"—the contract was in writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tea dealer, and live at No. 4, Cloisters-court, Doctors' Commons—Clark was employed by me on 21st Aug.—he is not in my regular employ, he has been a porter for me for the last eight or nine years—on that day I wrote an order and gave it to my son to send Clark to the London Pocks for a chest of tea—while I was sitting at my tea, about half past 8 o'clock, I saw the prisoner, Spencer, pass my door with a box of tea which I at once recognised, and in consequence of that I sent my son out—Wardrobe—terrace is about one—eighth of a mile from my shop—I know the way from Thames—street by Bread—street—hill, and through Fish-street, to Wardrobe—terrace, perfectly well—it is not much frequented, it is a very secluded part.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Roger Fenton, of No. 2, Albert-terrace, Regent's—park. These silver articles and this card case are his; I saw them safe a week before they were stolen—this brooch is mine; it was safe in the kitchen at 8 o'clock, or half past, on this night—these sugar tongs were in the dining room; these spoons were kept in the kitchen—these buttons are my master's—on 7th Sept. I closed up the house, and went to bed about half past 10 o'clock; my master was from home, and there was no one in the house but me—all the windows and doors were fastened, except the landing window, and that was shut down when I went to bed—I heard a noise in the adjoining room about 2 o'clock, having first heard a noise on the staircase—(I slept in the front bedroom, on the first flight)—I got up about a quarter past 2 o'clock, and gave an alarm out of the window—a policeman came in about two minutes; he let himself in, as the front door was open—I had locked that door, and taken the key up stairs with me—I saw the policeman find this small screw driver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the dining room table—a small travelling chest had been broken open in the dining room, and they had found the key of the sideboard and unlocked it, but nothing was missing—the key was kept in a small box in the room—the entrance had been effected by the staircase window, I found it open—it opens by raising and is big enough for a man to get in at.</p>

In consequence of a communication I received, on Saturday morning, 16th Sept., I placed a con<lb/>stable at the door of the warehouse of Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons; I was house surgeon at St. Mary's hospital on 29th Aug.—the deceased child was brought there about 11 o'clock that night by the prisoner—it was dead when it was brought to me—from its being quite warm I should fancy that it had only just died before it was brought in; it was very much emaciated, and there were marks of bruises over its forehead, and near its mouth, and blood was flowing from its nose and mouth—the bruises on the forehead</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180084"/>
               <p>appeared recent, they were red; there Were two or three more on the left side, and one large bruise on the right side of the forehead, and there was a bruise on the left side of the mouth—they all had the appearance of having been recently inflicted; they were red puffy marks which afterwards turned to the black appearance that is called a bruise—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exami<lb/>nation of the head; in addition to the bruises that I have already men<lb/>tioned, I observed that the whole head was literally covered with marks of bruises—I also observed some small marks, something like scratches over the face—the body was very much emaciated, and there were also red marks, as of scratches, on its buttocks—I removed the scalp, and saw blood effused between the scalp and the pericranium—that effused blood corresponded with the external marks on the skull—I opened the skull, but before doing so, I observed a fissure over the right frontal eminence, corresponding with the large bruise that I mentioned before; it was not a fracture, it did not go through the skull, only the external plate, the pericranium was not severed; a blow might cause the bone to crack without lacerating the skin—on re<lb/>moving the skull cap, I found a great deal of blood effused between the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, the external covering of the brain, and the bone; and on remov<lb/>ing the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, there was blood effused between it and the surface of the brain—on removing the brain from the skull completely, there was blood effused at the base of the brain, more particularly on the left side, there was no laceration of the brain—those appearances were sufficient to account for the death by pressure of the blood on the brain—the organs of the chest and belly were perfectly healthy; the glands in the abdomen were slightly enlarged, but not actually diseased—taking the whole of the appear<lb/>ances together, I should say that the death was owing to external violence acting upon a frame very much weakened by inanition—my opinion is, that that inanition was caused by want of food, inasmuch as the organs of digestion were perfectly healthy; in fact I think they were the very healthiest I ever saw—if several blows had been inflicted upon the head of the child shortly before it was brought to the hospital, I should consider that sufficient to account for the death, and for the appearances I saw—I saw the mother of the child at the hospital some days afterwards, and the child was shown to her by order of the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you that the proxi<lb/>mate cause of death was the effusion of blood on the brain, caused by violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the immediate cause—I would not exactly attribute the violence producing the effusion of blood, to the blow which caused the fissure; I cannot lay the cause of death to any one particular blow, because blood was effused all over the surface of the brain; the fissure did not go into the brain itself—the shock of a violent injury to the head will cause effusion of blood in other parts, but in this case the blood effused between the scalp and the skull corresponded with the bruise on the outside of the head, and the effusion of blood throughout, corresponded in the same way with the external bruises—I do not mean that there was an effusion corres<lb/>ponding with each bruise, the head was covered with bruises—there was no large vessel wounded, it was the rupture of several smaller vessels, and a blow on one particular part would not cause the rupture of small vessels in other parts as easily as it would cause the rupture of a large body like one of the great vessels of the brain; several small vessels had given way, so that there had been a gradual effusion producing a gradual pressure on the brain up to the time of death—the greater portion of the effusion did not correspond with the fissure, the greater correspondence was on the left side, the fissure</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180085"/>
               <p>was on the right—it often happens if a blow is given on one side, that a vessel is ruptured on the other—I think the effusion is generally nearly mathematically opposite the place where the blow is inflicted; for example, when a man has fallen from a great height upon his feet, the blow is carried up through his body in a straight line, and the fracture is very often at the base of the skull, that is a well known surgical fact; in the same way if a blow is given in one spot on the head, it is carried in a straight line in the direction in which the blow is given—in a child the bones of the head are remarkably soft—the fissure was about an inch and a half long, and in breadth it was just a line, just perceptible—such a fissure might be occa<lb/>sioned by the forehead coming in contact with an angular or sharp body—it might probably be caused by that—I think if it had been something sharp and angular it would have caused some actual wound on the outside—it might be caused by coming in contact with some hard substance—I should say it was probably caused by some substance harder than the hand of a woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you attribute the cause of death to the fissure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the effusion of blood—the fissure was not altogether the cause of that effusion—I found an effusion which corresponded with the recent bruises that I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the prisoner brought the child to the hospital what did she say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She told me that the child had fallen out of bed while she was away from home, and struck its head against a box at the side of the bed—she cried for a short time, probably for two or three minutes—some of the bruises were of long standing, they were of all ages—nothing is more difficult than to state the age of a bruise; I should say that probably none of them were two or three months old—some flesh will retain the marks of bruises longer than other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon a child in that weak, emaciated state, the marks of bruises would probably remain longer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I think as a rule it would be generally rather shorter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the mark of a bruise removed by absorption? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; in a case like this I think that absorption would take place as quickly as possible, on account of the weak state of the child; because we often give medicines to weaken a patient, in order to assist absorption—the mark on the mouth appeared more like a blow than a sore—I saw no sore or abscess in the process of being healed—I opened the mouth to see where the blood came from, and found it was not caused by laceration, but it came from the mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you attribute death to a blow inflicted three months ago, or just before that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To blows inflicted just before that time, certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was partially intoxicated—very likely the fright at finding the child dead, might have made her a little more sober, but I can be no judge of that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Barnes, a coachman, and live at No. 10, Praed-street, Paddington. The prisoner lived in the same house—she said she had a husband—I remember her having the little child Groves, to nurse—on Tuesday night, 29th Aug., I went into the yard, about a quarter before 11 o'clock, and heard the prisoner making use of very shameful and abusive language—she said, "You b—b—, I will shake your b—guts out"—I heard blows at the time—I looked through the window, and saw her sitting on the foot of the bed with the baby in her arms; she was knocking it about its head and face with her hand—I went to the door and called Mary Ann Cork, and she came and looked as well as myself—I never heard the child cry at all, and never heard any sound at all from it—she struck the child twice after Cork came to the window—I saw the prisoner's little girl come out of the room—I went into the room, and told the prisoner she ought to be ashamed of herself to ill use the baby in the manner she had been doing—she said she had not struck the baby—I said it was no use denying it, for I had looked through the window and seen her for the last two minutes—she said, "I certainly have struck it, for the child dirtied itself, and it made me angry"—I said that was no reason why she should illuse the baby—I did not see the child's face, she covered it over with a night gown—she said she would get up, and put it into a warm bath—she did not do so—she got up, and I went up stain to the landlady, and told her what had occurred, and that she had better get up—she did get up, but before she got up, I went down into the passage again—I might have been gone six or seven minutes, and Mrs. Knight passed in with the baby in her arms—while I was in the room, I heard the rattles in the baby's throat, and I said to the prisoner, "I believe you have killed the child, for it has the rattles in its throat; and whatever I have seen I shall say again"—Cork and I were at the street door when the prisoner passed us with the child in her arms—we followed her, and saw her go into the hospital with the child in her arms, and saw her come out again without it—I asked her where the baby was; she said it was dead—I said to her directly, "You have killed it"—a man, named Matthews, who was there, said, "You ought to give her in charge;" and she was given in charge to a policeman—she was first taken to the hospital, and then to the station—I had heard her use bad language to the child before, but I never saw her beat it till that night—she said on the Sunday morning, "The little b—I wish it was in the flames of hell"—I have not heard her use any other bad expression with respect to the child—I have given the child milk and broth two or three times; I could not say whether it had food or not, it appeared to take the food ravenously.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on 29th Aug.—I heard some person say that the woman ought to be taken in charge for killing a child—I then asked what woman it was, and they pointed to the prisoner—I asked her where the child was—she said it was in the hospital—I took her to the hospital, and saw Mr. Ormerod, who said he had taken it from the prisoner, and it was dead—I then took her to the station—on the way there she said that she had not killed the child, neither had she illused it, but that it had fallen from the bed on to a box, and fell between the bed and the box—she said she had been a slave to the child night and day—in consequence of what she said I went to the house, and examined the state of the bed and the box—I found a box standing close to the bed—the child could not have fallen between it and the bed—I found marks of blood, apparently fresh, on the hangings at the foot of the bed.</p>

Lye was by the side of him—Mrs. Davies was up stairs with her daughter—I called for her, she did not come—I called again, and in the meantime Mr. Lye took Mr. Davies by the coat and shook him—MR. Davies</p>

               <p>then got up, and Mr. Lye took hold of him again by the coat and shook him, and threw him down upon the stairs—he was standing about half a yard from the stairs at the time—he fell from the violence of the throw, with his right side towards the banisters, and his head on the stairs; his heels were on the mat—he said, "Oh! oh my!"—his daughter, Mrs. Oram, came down immediately, and she took hold of Mr. Lye by the coat, and held him till such time as she got him out at the street door—he aimed three blows at her face while she was holding him, but one caught her on the cheek.</p>

Davies was not ready with them—I cannot say whether or not he tried to push the door in Mr. Lye's face, or whether it was in that way that he tumbled—I do not know with what intentions Mr. Lye took hold of him, I was excited at the time at such an uproar—MR. Davies tried and struggled to get up in the best way he could, and then Mr. Lye took hold of him and shook him—he did not fall on the stairs; I saw Mr. Lye shake him very violently, and throw him down on the stairs—he was a very old, infirm man—I have known Mr. Lye before—he is very deaf—I never quarrelled with him—I am quite sure about that.</p>

On Thursday, 17th Aug., I attended Mr. Davies, about 6 o'clock—I had never seen him before—I found him in bed, supported by pillows—his breathing was load, whistling, and short—I examined the chest, and found symptoms of fractured ribs—he seemed much agitated—there was pain beneath the right blade bone, increased by inspiration, by coughing and motion—he died about a quarter past 7 o'clock on Friday—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on Monday, 21st Aug.—J believe the cause of death to have been fracture of the ribs, producing a shook to the system of a man enfeebled by age and disease—he appeared to have suffered from asthma, as a symptom of a disease under which he laboured—I examined the lungs, and found them diseased, but there was nothing to account for death, except the broken ribs—it would not require considerable violence to produce the injury I saw, in a man of his age—it would require some violence—if he were thrown against the stairs that would in him be sufficient to produce what I saw—the bones are more brittle in advanced life—the ribs were broken on the right side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In feet, in your opinion, he died from a shock to the system, occasioned by the tumble? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the violence—I did not perceive that the broken ribs pressed upon any vital part so as to occasion death—there was no laceration of the lungs—they were the inferior ribs that were broken, the lower ones—that would affect the lungs during the application of the violence, by inward pressure—I discovered the lung on the right side to be of a darker colour than the left—that would be from congestion.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 300). I apprehended the prisoner on the Friday night—I told him I was a police constable, and the old gentleman was dead—I was not aware at the time that he was deaf, and I repeated it to him, putting my mouth close to his ear—I said, "The old gentleman is dead; you must consider yourself in custody for causing his death"—he said, "My God I never touched him"—he appeared very much staggered, and shed tears; I had to hold him—he said, "If he was injured the women must have trod on him; they were like lions; I was obliged to strike the woman, but I did not mean to hurt her, poor thing; my dis<lb/>position is different to that"—he showed me his face—I saw some marks on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was his face much marked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there were two long marks down the face—the deceased's wife had her lip cut—he appeared very much astonished when he heard that he was charged with killing the man—he staggered, and I fancy he might have fallen if I had not taken hold of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am professor of chemistry at the London Hos<lb/>pital. I have the remains of lucifer matches which I obtained from Mr. Bell; I got them on 13th April last—they are made of slips of wood, the composition on them is chlorate of potash; blue and colouring matter which is a preparation of iron—they are very combustible—I have made experiments as to under what circumstances they will ignite—the tempera<lb/>ture at which they will take fire varies from 140 degree to 200 degree, according to the condition of the atmosphere—the temperature of 140 degree is one that may exist, or may be produced in a shop window exposed to the sun enclosed in glass, so that lucifer matches may take fire when exposed in that manner to the summer sun—I found also that they were fired by very slight friction—some of Mr. Bell's matches have fired in my house from falling from the chimneypiece though I did not see them—the maid has told me so, and brought the box to me—I can also state that some of Mr. Bell's matches were standing on my laboratory table, and I was making some experiments with the pestle and mortar merely shaking the table, and they went off</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180099"/>
               <p>spontaneously, and set fire to the paper and everything about them—I be<lb/>lieve from this that the falling of a box from the chimneypiece might fire them—supposing there were a place where there were a great number of these, the rats running about and throwing down the boxes, might fire them—the phosphorus exists in the matches in the state of a powder, and if any of the powder remains on the surface uncombined with the other materials, it may take fire spontaneously at an ordinary temperature without any friction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If these matches had been kept for some time perfectly dry, would the phosphorus become powder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can hardly tell, but if it has not been carefully prepared it will do so—in my judgment it is dangerous to the house and the neighbourhood to have large quantities of these things kept.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say if there were dry powder on the match it might ignite, but if there were none it would not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there is phosphorus, and oxide of iron, and chlorate of potash in these—oxide of iron is known under many names—a man might purchase it and not know it—I cannot tell what other matters are in this preparation—I only sought for those things which I know to be mischievous—there is nothing that can be introduced into these lucifer matches, in my judgment, that will reduce the disposition to ignite—I have seen matches made in most of the large factories—I never attended Mr. Bell's—I have had to attend to the diseases of many persons employed in match factories—I do not know how Mr. Bell makes them, but I think there is no great secret in it—it is my opinion that these matches have no controlling matter in them to prevent the ignition—they will ignite at 140 degree—if they were in these boxes, enclosed in another box in a window, and there were a thermometer of 140 degree, they might ignite—I have only known by report of matches igniting in a shop—I have known a heat of 140 degree in a shop, and I have had it on my own premises, in my glass case outside my drawing room window, which, I believe, is in a southern attitude—140 degree is not an immense state of heat—the temperature in this Court now is, I suppose, about 89 degree—I know that the Germans make those matches also, but the Germans have no chlorate of potash in them; they use nitre instead, and, as a rule, they require a higher temperature than others do—they are what are called silent matches—the defendants shop was shut up, and it was in the night—there could be no 140 degree then.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am the solicitor to the Corporation of London. I remember this subject being brought before the Court of Aldermen on 29th Sept., 1853—there was a presentment from the Ward Inquest, a petition signed by a number of persons—the Court referred it to me to take such steps as I thought proper—I did not visit Mr. Bell's for a considerable time, having been informed that he was about to remove or discontinue the</p>

               <p>business—I did not take any steps for several months—I did go to the premises, and told the persons there who I was—I think that must have been in May or June last—I inspected the premises—I saw that there was no strong room for the deposit of these articles—I purchased a box of matches for the purpose of analyzing, telling them what I did it for—I placed it in the hands of Dr. Letheby, and took proceedings—MR. Bell was not in the shop when I was there—I had reason to believe that there would be a strong room made after I had been to the premises, but I cannot say that I knew there was a strong room till I first heard it here to-day—if I had known there had been a strong room before I preferred this indictment I should not have preferred it, but have referred it to the Court of Alder<lb/>men whether it would not have been a sufficient reason to abstain from the indictment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at present at No. 25, Harrington-square, Hampstead-road. About May, 1853, I resided at No. 16, Southamp<lb/>ton-street, Fitzroy-square, with my sister Martha—the two prisoners at that time resided in lodgings nearly opposite—I was sometimes in the habit of walking with my sister in the square, not in the enclosure; and in doing so I was accosted by the elder prisoner—he apologized for speaking to me, and said that he had been making inquiries, and found that I had just arrived from the country, and he wished he knew some of my friends, or else he would have had a regular introduction—I requested him to leave me, and he bowed, and did so—he wrote to me the same evening, I think it was, and appointed a meeting, but I did not go, I went with my sister somewhere else—he wrote again, and in consequence of that I met him, and an acquaintance commenced—I have neither father or mother—I had property in the funds, from my father, upon which I lived—the elder prisoner told me that his name was <hi rend="italic">Turenne 0'Keil</hi> (the younger prisoner was not with him then), that he was single, and that his intentions were perfectly honourable—I did not infer that he was single from his saying that his intentions were honour<lb/>able, he said so distinctly—he told me that he had been residing some years on the continent, and a great deal about himself—he said he had a title, which he did not make use of, on account of the whole of his property being tinder seal,</p>

               <p>or confiscated, in France, in consequence of his different political opinions—the next day he came up and spoke to me when I was with my sister (the younger prisoner was not with him at that time)—he merely told my sister what he had said to me, with respect to his intentions—he repeated, in her presence, that he was a single man, because she raised a great objec<lb/>tion to Mr. O'Keefe speaking to us—the second time that my sister was with me, he brought the younger prisoner, and introduced him to us both as his nephew; we were then in Fitzroy-square, not in the garden—the younger prisoner addressed the elder as his uncle—in these meetings marriage was proposed; he spoke of it constantly, because meeting him like that, he was obliged to say what his intentions were—he said at the very first meeting that such was his intention, and he confirmed that afterwards—he did not propose at the first meeting, but he said his intentions were honourable—he proposed about three weeks afterwards, and I accepted him—after this he was always exceedingly attentive and polite, and I looked upon him in the light of an accepted lover and an intended husband—this went on for more than twelve months—it is now a year and a half since the acquaint<lb/>ance began—about a month after our acquaintance began, we were driving in a carriage with my younger sister and the younger prisoner, whom he sent to make inquiries at several places, and when the younger prisoner came out, the elder one inquired of him anxiously, "Have you succeeded?" he said, "No;" and then the elder prisoner was in a dreadful state of mind, and told me that he was exceedingly annoyed for money, that he had given his word of honour to pay 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had not got it—when we returned home he asked me if I would lend him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I did so—he addressed the younger prisoner as "Turenne"—a week or two afterwards he asked me to lend him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I did so—soon afterwards, in July, he asked me to lend him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I did so—he told me, in his son's presence, how much dis<lb/>tressed he was for money; that it was through political affairs in France; that he had an action brought against him, and had to pay costs, and that it was utterly impossible for him to get any money, as it was all locked up—I had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash at that time—after that he borrowed 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me; it was in Aug.—we were in a carriage which he had hired, and he went into his solicitor's, Mr. Edwards, in Cannon-street—I and my sister were in the carriage—he sent down by the clerk a note, which has since been destroyed; it was torn up in the presence of the younger prisoner—it stated that he was very much pressed for money; that if he did not have it it would be the ruin of him, and asking me if I could let him have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sent him back a verbal message, "No"—he pressed the matter very much, but I had already promised to lend my sister money—he came out and spoke to me—he said it was exceedingly annoying, but he must have that amount, or else the case would fall to the ground—in the presence of all, my sister Martha said that she could do with less, if I liked to lend it to Mr. <hi rend="italic">O'Keil</hi>—we went home, and he waited—I went out into Fitzroy-square with my sister, and gave him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—between 18th and 31st Aug. he said he was going to Liverpool to try the cause there—he applied to me again for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he knew that I should be in the receipt of more money, because he had asked me all about it first, and I had told him—he afterwards went to Liverpool, and wrote to me to go down there—I did not go at first, and he wrote again, and I and my sister went; he had engaged lodgings for us; we had apart<lb/>ments in a lady's house, hired lodgings—it was in Pembroke-place, I think—he then asked me, in the presence of his son, in the drawing-room, for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave it to him; that made 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was not on the day we</p>

               <p>got there; we were there about a week or a fortnight, I am not certain which—we went about with him there, and on our return back to London, the elder prisoner asked me for more money—we were to have been married before we went to Liverpool, but he put it off because of this law suit—no day was fixed, but dresses and everything of that sort were prepared, and a travelling dress, as we were going abroad—when he wrote to me to come down to Liverpool I imagined that I was to be married there—after return<lb/>ing from Liverpool I took apartments with my sister, at North-crescent, Bedford-square—as we were going to Brussels we came to town, and chose them ourselves—the elder prisoner wished me to go abroad, because he said he should be obliged to go abroad himself, and he had rather be married at Brussels, because it must be kept very secret, an his friends wished him to marry some relation, and that there were other reasons—I went to Brussels with my sister, and he came to us there in about a fortnight—we went to Mrs. Matthews, who keeps a private boarding-house—we were recommended there by friends in England—he only had 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me there—I stayed there about three weeks, and then went to my married sister in Calais, who brought me up—her name is Mrs. Dangerfield—her being in Calais was the reason I was in London alone—I afterwards returned to England at O'Keefe's request, to sell out a Sun Fire Office share—my sister Martha did not come with me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The following letters were here read:</hi>—"Tuesday. 8th Aug., 1853. 11, Brownlow-street, Liverpool. My dear Miss East. Although I appreciate the motive for refusing my request, yet I must say that the tone in which you expressed your objection and determination, is, to say the least of it, extremely humiliating to my feelings. I feel the more deeply wounded, as you are the very last human being from whom I expected a doubt, much less a reproach. As I am a gentleman, I assure you that my motive in making the request was most religiously pure. In a word, I wished to see you on a matter of mutual interest, one which I cannot fully enter into in writing, and which I must defer till after my law suit, which I hope will be decided on or about the 16th or 17th instant. I believe I named to you that I had an important law question to <hi rend="italic">decide here;</hi> this, together with the utter impossibility of my leaving just now, urges me to trespass upon your good nature. As to scandal, you ought not to forget, that at the risk of great injury to my health (the consequences of which I have since felt), I prevented you taking a step which would have given food to scandal mongers. Do not suppose that I name this with any intention of finding fault with you; no, I am too sensible and grateful for the feeling which actuated you <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, and I now refer to it, to disarm your mind of any doubt as to the intention on my part I am not a man to pen honied words; I pride myself on my actions—time will convince you of this. I trust, <hi rend="italic">en attendant</hi>, that you will credit me when I say that I would not lose your good opinion or esteem for any worldly consideration; your undivided con<lb/>fidence, free from all doubt, would indeed be a treasure. I am sorry, very, very sorry, you indulged in that ridiculously common-place phrase, 'If I had been regularly introduced to you,' etc. etc. At the risk of offending you, I must say it is a sentiment unworthy of you; and when applied to me, it is unjust and offensive. Let me change the subject. I must tell you I am no longer bandaged up, my arms are free; I can write without pain, though not quite freely yet; this will now mend each day. Apropos, you also gave me a leetle rub about your health. Do you forget that you wrote to me that you were <hi rend="italic">quite recovered</hi>! only a little weak, etc. Ah! Mademoiselle Priscilla, you are somewhat capricious. There is, however, one consolation in your angry letter; and it is the kind manner in which you express your affection for, yours, most sincerely and truly, T. O'K. Love to the little fox; for she is one."—"Hotel de Normandie, 240, Rue St. Honore. 18th Oct., 1853. If you will be so kind as to examine or refer to my last, you will find that this very day I named as likely to me to return here. I hasten to answer your letter, my very dear friend; this will reach you to-morrow, on your birth day. To use a Spanish salutation, 'May you live 1000 years, and may your shadow never be less.' Indeed,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180109"/>
               <p>indeed, I am serious, in wishing you, my dear Miss Priscilla, many happy returns. You accuse me of being cold and laconic in my letters: I beg once more to refer you back to some of my London letters, in which I dis<lb/>tinctly told you that I was a man of deeds, not of honied words. As to my affairs, I am still in <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>, and uncertain; everything proceeds slowly. I hope to be able to run down to pay you <hi rend="italic">mes homages</hi>, in the course of a few days; that is if you do not leave for England before, in which case be good enough to send your address. Please offer my best regards to Miss Martha, and direct as usual to me. I will send every morning for my letters. I find I am too late to post-pay this; indeed I fear much this will not go before to-morrow morning, which I need not say will be a sad disappoint<lb/>ment to yours, most sincerely and truly, T. O'K. I write before I unpack, and yet I find I am too late.")—(<hi rend="italic">Extract of a letter, dated</hi>, "Bordeaux, Nov. 16, 1853. To-morrow, D. V., I start on my long journey; but rely upon it, neither absence nor time will ever cause me to forget for one single moment one who has given me such proof of affection and confidence. Let not long interval of writing on my part alarm you; attribute it to the right cause; and again I pray you earnestly do not credit any idle rumours in the papers.

My dear Miss East,—My uncle has been very ill all night; and this morning he was so poorly that he had leeches applied to his chest. He desires me to write this, as he is unable to do so himself Believe me, my dear Miss East, yours truly, Turenne. P. S. I will call to-morrow to let you know how he is."—"10 minutes to 5 o'clock. My dear Miss East,—My uncle has just tapped at the wall, and desires me to write you a few lines. He fears he was brusque in his manners when you awoke him suddenly, which would indeed be ungrateful for your kind thought and welcome present. The sudden start has brought on a frightful headache. The doctor, who has since called, and was very much annoyed at seeing anybody in the parlour, has given strict orders to everybody in the house to allow nobody whatever, under any circumstances, to see him. They expect a crisis one way or the other about 11 or 12 o'clock to-morrow. I earnestly implore you not to see my uncle again till I call on you to-morrow, which I will do after the doctor's consultation in the morning. I would call to explain this matter to you myself, but am forbidden to leave the house. Yours very truly, Turenne. P. S. I fear, from his manner and peculiar tem<lb/>perament, the least sound irritates him.")</p>

               <p>Yes—the whole sum I advanced to Mr. O'Keefe was 524<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took an acknow<lb/>ledgment of him of that advance—I did not take an acknowledgment from him on each occasion—I took no I O U's of him—he gave me a bill in the name of Turenne O'Keil—I only took two I O U's of him in the name of Turenne O'Keil one at Liverpool, and one at Antwerp—when I had advanced all the money, I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the Hotel St. Antoine, at Antwerp, from his direction—the money was not advanced for any specified period, but he agreed to pay the money back in twelve months when he gave me the I O U and the bill—it was not a distinct understanding, but it was so arranged afterwards—I was to receive 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year by way of annuity—that was when I gave him the last sum at Antwerp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does not that remind you that the money was to be advanced for twelve months at least? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At that time—that arrangement was made by word of mouth, and he also wrote it, but when I found out that his name was not O'Keil he asked me for it, and I returned it to him—I saw it among your papers last time—I understand that Mr. Cooper, the attorney, has taken additional security for the payment of the money, from the son, Turenne, but I do not remember seeing it—it was done by my directions, and at my particular wish—I instructed him to take security from the son—it was my wish and my suggestion to him that he should do so—I believe he has done so, and I should like to see it—I have lent other persons money—I lent a sum to my brother-in-law—he is not now in prison at my suit—my brother is in prison for that, and for a Chancery suit—I lent him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we are now the best of friends—I have not from time to time been in the habit of lending money, only to these few parties—I lent my bro<lb/>ther-in-law 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I have advanced money from time to time to my younger sister—I have not lent money to strangers, only the sum of 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a lady—I have not advanced any other substantial sum of money to a stranger—I know a person named Nott—I have not advanced money to him—I never lent him a farthing, but it was advanced to a lady for him; it was 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was the sum I mentioned—I think that was about Christmas, 1853—I have lent 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to some one; it was to my younger sister, and it has been returned—MR. Cooper, an attorney, who was introduced to me by Mr. O'Keefe, has brought actions for me—he is here—I am very sorry to say that he has acted for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your attention directed to Mr. O'Keefe, or his to you, before you met him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I used to see him sitting at the window when I was at dinner—I did not make signs to him, nor did he to me—I never held up music paper to him, and made signs—my sister was there; she is not here to-day—I cannot say for certain whether she has been examined before the Magistrate—I mean to say that I did not in the first instance make signs to Mr. O'Keefe from the window, certainly not—it was about three weeks after that that we met in Fitzroy-square—I bad seen him from day to day at the window before we met, and I am sure he saw me; he could see into the room—the window was open, and I sat at the head of the table—I did not shut the window when I saw a strange man; I was not at the window, I was at the dinner table—he did not offer me marriage the first time we met, but he said his intentions were perfectly honourable, and he spoke of marriage to me very shortly afterwards—on the first occasion when we met, I had seen him leave the house about two hours before, and he met me at the corner of the square—on that occasion, I requested him to leave me immediately, and he did so, I think, in two minutes—after that he wrote to me—all the first letters were destroyed by Mr. O'Keefe's particular</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180111"/>
               <p>request—I have produced letters from Liverpool—it was before I left town that he requested me to destroy all letters, as we were going abroad—when he wrote to me, I did not meet him at first—shortly afterwards I met him in Fitzroy-square again, in company with my sister; and I went out with him, in company of my sister, in a carriage, after he had introduced his son—we did not go to the theatre a few days after I had met him—I did not go and dine in the Haymarket with him, not until lately—it was just before we went to Liverpool; there was I, and my sister, and his nephew, and himself—I did not go to the play with him—I dined with him in the Hay<lb/>market, at the Hotel de Paris; and his son and my sister went to the play, because he wished Martha to see it; but Mr. O'Keefe was taken so very ill at the hotel that he did not go—he had told me that he had broken his ribs, but was much better, and if I would go to the Hotel de Paris, he would meet me—I represent that to be the truth, positively; but it was the man who brought the letter who told me, and he said in the letter that he feared he had broken his ribs—he and I remained in a private room at the hotel till my sister returned—she went about 9 o'clock; I do not know whether it was to the half price—they did not go to the whole of the play—they came back as soon as it was over, about half past 11 o'clock, because we got home about 12—on my oath, they did not go to the first part of the performance—the piece they wanted to see was Villikins and his Dinah—it was not the Haymarket, it was the Olympic—they went from the Haymarket to the Olympic, and came back to us at the hotel—MR. O'Keefe was exceedingly ill all the time he was alone with me—he had had an accident; he was going down stairs, and slipped, and injured his ribs very much—we were talking all the time we were alone—I had not to call in the attendance of a doctor—there was supper at the hotel when my sister came in; it was wine and biscuits—there was no wine on the table when my sister left us together, as Mr. O'Keefe was so ill—he was lying on the sofa all the time—I think I had known him about three months then—we afterwards all returned home—I went to Liverpool at the end of Aug.; it was just before that—MR. O'Keefe wished to be referred to my brother, but I could not then, on account of some family matters—none of my family, except my younger sister, were aware that I was engaged to be married to Mr. O'Keefe—he wished to be married secretly—my younger sister was aware of it; he spoke of it in her presence—there is no member of my family here, or any friend, to whom he spoke of marriage—I knew the parties I lodged with in Southampton-street, but Mr. O'Keefe never came there, it was kept so perfectly private—I did not, a few days after I knew him, offer to come to his rooms disguised as a boy, never—when he broke his ribs I wished to see him, and it was to prevent my going to see him that he proposed going to the Hotel de Paris—he said he was so much better that it would relieve my mind if we all dined together—Turenne had said that he thought his uncle was dying, and of course I was very unhappy about it—I wrote to him in Southampton-street, and said, "Shall I come and see you?" and it was to prevent my coming to see him that he asked me to meet him at the Hotel de Paris; he sent word round that he was so much better—I did not offer to go disguised as a boy, but as an old woman—I did not know how I could go without anybody knowing me—I did not know how I could manage to see him without the people of the house where I resided knowing it—I did offer to go disguised as an old woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you get a boy's dress for the purpose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I thought of it—I offered to go disguised.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180112"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As a boy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Disguised any way; this (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) is the letter I wrote to Mr. O'Keefe, offering to come over disguised—I had some thoughts of having a boy's dress; I did not know how to disguise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you had some thoughts of a boy's dress? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An old woman's dress, I thought it was—this was just before we went to Liverpool—the step which he prevented me from taking, which he mentions in one of his letters, was putting on the disguise—in Oct., 1853, I went over to Antwerp; Mr. O'Keefe was to meet me there, to receive the 262<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the reason I left Calais—I went to him with the money—I was at the Hotel de St. An<lb/>toine at Antwerp two nights—I went over by one boat, and came back by the next—I should have returned the same day, but there were no means—Mr. O'Keefe was not at the same hotel—he merely came to draw up a memorandum—he did not dine with me alone—he did not spend the evening with me; he was only there long enough to count the notes and to write certain documents—I most certainly did not invite him to come up to my room and spend the evening with me; but when I was at dinner, the chambermaid asked me for the key of my room, and when I went; Mr. O'Keefe was there writing some letters—I was not in his company during the time I was at Antwerp, because he only went to fetch me to go to Brussels with him and make purchases, and we came back—we dined together at Brussels, at the table d'hote—he did not take tea with me at Brussels, most certainly not—I was at Antwerp all night; I did not stay at Brussels, I only went there and made purchases—it was in the spring of this year that I first became aware that Mr. O'Keefe was a married man—I will not be certain whether it was as early as February; it was not as early as January this year—I became acquainted with the fact of his mar<lb/>riage and of his name being O'Keefe at the same time, on the same day; it was in the spring of this year, at the time he was expecting his son over—after he had told me that his wife was alive, he said that his son was coming over—I never was aware that this young man was his son until that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this letter of 27th Oct., 1853; do not you here ask him for his son's address? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I explained to you how that was; at that time I did not know whether he was the son, but I fancied that I saw a great likeness at times, and that is the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Reading the letter</hi>). "Martha has written to the Isle of Man to inquire if his letters have been called for;" was not the son at that time in the Isle of Man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Mr. O'Keefe had told me that—it was in 1853—I was in Brussels—my sister Martha corresponded with the son—he used to write to her constantly, and Mr. O'Keefe sent him to the Isle of Man to prevent the correspondence being kept up, as he saw that his son was getting very fond of her, because, he said, it would prevent our mar<lb/>riage, as the uncle could not marry one and the son the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Reading the letter</hi>). "I think, if possible, she will find out your son's address;" had not Mr. O'Keefe at that time told you that he was a married man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he never told me till the spring of this year, but I wrote that because I wished to find out whether he was the son, for three times Mr. O'Keefe, in speaking of different things, had said, "<hi rend="italic">my son;"</hi> I turned very pale, and he said, how very jealous I was; how could I suppose he had a grown up son of that age?—he told me afterwards that he had got a natural son in Paris, and that that was the reason he had made the mistake—I asked Turenne several times, "Are you the son?" and he told me "No" on his oath solemnly and sacredly—that was alter the money was advanced; he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180113"/>
               <p>told me his uncle was single at the first—I did not always call him the son; I did once or twice, to see if he was deceiving me or not—this is my sig<lb/>nature to these depositions; they were read over to me before I signed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say here, "I used always to call him the son?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a mistake; I told them at the time that there was a mistake in the depo<lb/>sitions—I said so before the Magistrate and before everybody—I pointed out the mistake when my depositions were read over, but the Magistrate said it should not be altered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the mistake, "Martha was not acquainted with the younger prisoner as early as October;" was not the "not" struck out by your desire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Show the Jury any other mistake which was not corrected by the Clerk. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Levine, who was acting for Mr. O'Keefe, would not allow anything to be altered—I mean to say that—that was after the depositions were read over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, after you learned that Mr. O'Keefe was married, make any appointment or seek any interview with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me that he was regularly divorced from his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Bid you after that make any appointment with him? (<hi rend="italic">The witness did not answer). Witness.</hi> This is my signature to this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that he wished to make use of certain letters written by the witness to Mr. O'Keefe, and would take the opinion of the Court, whether he could comment upon them in his speech without having them read in the first instance. The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that such a course would be irregular, at the circumstance of her being a witness for the prosecution would not make her letters evidence; but that if she denied facts put to her, the letters could then be put in.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that he was quite willing that the letters should be read.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you continued as lovers up to the conversation you had in Vine-street, Regent-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but he made me promise that I would wait a twelvemonth, and said that his wife could not possibly live a year, and that they were really divorced—I mean to represent that we continued as lovers during the whole of the time, till that conversation in Vine-street, Regent-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At Christmas, 1853, had you not entered into an engagement of marriage with a gentleman named Nott? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, for a short time, at my sister's request, because Mr. O'Keefe had not written to me for some weeks—that is the Mr. Nott on whose account I advanced a lady 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I met him at Mrs. Cox's boarding-house in Southampton-street—I never met any other gentleman in Southampton-street to whom I was engaged to be married—I kept the engagement with Mr. Nott about three weeks, and then Mr. O'Keefe returned—I had known Mr. Nott some time, but not before I knew Mr. O'Keefe; I cannot say exactly how long afterwards, I do not recollect—it was after I returned from Calais that I became acquainted with Mr. Nott—that was in Oct., 1853: I then became acquainted with him—that was just after I had lent the money to O'Keefe—I was acquainted with him very nearly three months before there was a promise of marriage between us—we were not lovers during that time—he proposed to me four times, and the fourth time I accepted him—he first proposed marriage to me I dare say about two months after he knew me—I used not to go about with him in the way of courtship—he proposed to me in Southampton-street, and he spoke to my married sister, who came over and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180114"/>
               <p>was stopping with me; it was at her instance that I accepted him, because she never approved of my acquaintance with Mr. O'Keefe—I told her that I was engaged to Mr. O'Keefe; he came as an accepted lover to her house—I told her I was engaged to him, and she was very much annoyed at my telling her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you, in the hearing of the Jury a short time ago, swear that your sister Martha was the only person who knew it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at that time, but I told my sister, Mrs. Danger field, afterwards—no one knew of it at that time except my sister Martha—when Mr. O'Keefe returned in January we were to be married, and as the marriage was so near, I thought I had better tell him everything, and I told him all about Mr. Nott, every single thing—O'Keefe was in France during the period I was engaged to Mr. Nott—this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one handed to her by Mr. Parry</hi>) is my writing, and so is this other; it is addressed to Mr. O'Keefe, but it does not refer to him at all—this other letter is in my writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have spoken of a conversation of a very extraordinary character between you and Mr. O'Keefe; up to the time of that conversation, do you represent that you had been on terms such as lovers are? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I men<lb/>tioned that conversation to Mr. Morgan before any steps were taken in this prosecution—I swear that—MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your deposition that does not appear? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Morgan said that there was a great deal which need not appear in my depositions, because it would all come out on the examination—I cannot say how many times I was examined—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">stated, that by this document it appeared that the prisoners debts were</hi> 1,364<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and his estimated credits</hi>, 5167.; <hi rend="italic">and the prosecutrix was not included as a creditor, or mentioned in any way.

                  </hi>, I was introduced to Miss East by Mr. O'Keefe, for the purpose of bringing some other actions—I was employed by both of them to make an arrangement of a claim which she had on him—I have brought other actions for Miss East—she did not bring an action against a Mr. Nott—the arrangement ultimately entered into was, that Mr. O'Keefe should obtain an acceptance for the amount due to Miss East, but on that day he said he had not his papers with him—these are the papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the original; it is signed by Miss East, and also by Mr. O'Keefe—(<hi rend="italic">this being read, was an acknowledgment by Thomas O'Keefe that he owed Miss East between</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">the exact amount to be here<lb/>after ascertained; engaging, as security, to hand her Turenne O'Keefe's ac<lb/>ceptance, at twelve months' date, to be handed to Mr. Cooper, as trustee of Mitt East, and which was not to be discounted, but was to bear interest at the rate of five per cent, per annum, and was not to leave Mr. Cooper's possession until maturity; both parties certifying this arrangement to be satisfactory. Doled, Wednesday</hi>, 12<hi rend="italic">th July</hi>, 1854)—Miss East made several objections to only receiving 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, interest, and said that he had agreed to give her an annuity of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I said, that in that case the principal sum would be lost—she started several objections, which I answered—she objected to the promissory note not being negotiated, and Mr. O'Keefe explained that the reason he made that stipulation was, that it might injure his son's name if she discounted it—she finally agreed to it—this is the bill of exchange (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this was an arrangement made in good faith, to the best of my knowledge, and was satisfactory to both parties—I am almost sure that a copy of the marriage settlement of Mr. O'Keefe was produced—I had a copy of it in my possession either then or shortly afterwards—that was produced to Miss East during the proceedings—that copy shows that the prisoner Turenne is entitled to about 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., between him and his brother, subject to the mother's power of appointment—I showed this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced, for</hi> 509<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) to Miss East after it was executed, after she came up from Brighton—in the account that was given</p>

               <p>there were some payments of interest, reducing the amount—there had been about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid in reduction by Mr. O'Keefe—this was not finally the balance between them, but I took the promissory note on my own responsibility, because I was anxious to get the security for her—she wrote to me from Brighton—this is the letter—(<hi rend="italic">part of this letter was read, as follows:</hi>—"Dear Sir, I was so flurried when I saw you in town with Mr., O'Keefe, that I dare say I did not make my wishes quite intelligible, and have to request that you will send me the document signed by Mr. O'Keefe, reserving a copy for yourself. Respecting the bill, I still feel that the date is too long; cannot you make it six months? failing in which, as my adviser, I think you should obtain some security beyond Mr. O'Keefe's name, and I trust you will do anything in your power to serve me," etc., etc)—on receiving this note, I did not delay at all in getting young O'Keefe's signature—this letter is dated 12th July, and the bill is dated on the 13th, so I must have got it instantly—Miss East understood what she was about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to Messrs. Peto, Brassey, and Betts; they are contractors, and are constructing the London, Tilbury, and Southend Railway. The prisoner was a clerk in their office at Barking—the course of business, as regards the payment of the men on Saturday, is this: there are two lots of men, and two sheets are made out; one is given to the time keeper with the money, and he goes up the line to pay one portion of the men; the prisoner and I go down the line with the other sheet and pay the other portion—it was part of the prisoner's duty to enter the men's time with their names, and their money due to them, in the pay book—he would get the materials for that from the time keeper; without that information he would be unable to discharge that duty—it was further his duty to make up from the pay book the pay list, previous to our going down the line to pay—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the original pay list made by him on 12th Aug.—it is in his writing—it was the time keeper's duty to supply him with the names of the men, the time they worked, and the amount due to them, not by word of mouth, but from the book; he holds the book in his hand, and reads from it while the prisoner makes his entries—the pay list ought to correspond with his own entries—I find in this pay list the names of</p>

               <p>"R.

Young or R. Jones being mentioned at all, and am not aware of paying them 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—the men do not come up in rotation, unless a man presents himself, his name is not called out—I have no recollection of these names being called out—one man might take another man's wages, if he gave a reason for it—the prisoner afterwards said, "There will be some men calling at my house, I will take the money for them;" and I handed over to him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I cannot recollect the exact amount, but to the best of my belief, I paid him sufficient to pay the rest of the workmen on the list—I knew what to give him, because he had the paper in his hand, and if he said 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I should hand him over the money directly—I do not examine the list myself—on the Monday the prisoner generally brings the list back to the office; he did so on this Monday—I do not make any memorandum of the amount I actually pay, or of what I leave in his hands—before we set out in the morning the prisoner calls out the amounts; he says, "17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and I put 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into the bag; "18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and I put 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into the bag, so that we have the exact cash—I make no memorandum of the sum I take out, but it is in the book which contains the time keeper's list—I cannot tell you what the whole amount was that the prisoner called out, or the specific sums—the aggregate amount contained these names, of R. Young and R. Jones, and I paid that aggregate amount on account of my employers—the prisoner has been in the office much longer than I have, and he knew more about it—I can charge my memory with giving the pri<lb/>soner 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at least, on this Saturday, in respect of wages of men who had not appeared; and out of that he returned me on Monday morning 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in respect of a man named Smith, by giving me a sick ticket, which is worth 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—when men are ill we pay them 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—on the Monday the prisoner returned the list, and said they were "all right," or "all paid," with the exception of Smith—I glanced at the list, and saw that all the numbers were ticked—I am able to state that it was in the same state then as it is now, but this heavy writing in pencil on the right hand side was not on it—it is my duty to look at the list when he produces it, to show me that it is all correct, and that they are all paid—these ticks are his, they were there then—I am sure that these ticks were against the names of Young and Jones that morning—this cross is Mr. White's, that has been made since—on the following Saturday, 19th Aug., I went down the line with the prisoner, and went through the same course of business—there was a list, but it is not forthcoming, as the prisoner never returned it; but he returned one in the place of it—these entries in the pay book on 19th Aug. are in the prisoner's writing—I find the names of R. Young and R. Jones in it—as the same entry does for the whole page, the names are only writ<lb/>ten once; but 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is entered for Jones, and 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Young, for the week ending 18th Aug.—the wages are calculated down to Friday evening, but we pay on Saturday—Jones and Young did not appear on the line, to my knowledge; and I paid closer attention than usual to the names—I made no memorandum—I did not take the list in my hand, the prisoner had it—I handed over to the prisoner that night on parting with him, 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

White said that it was no such thing, and handed it round to several people who were there, and to Mr. Lockey, a gentleman engaged on the line, in the prisoners presence, and asked his opinion; he said he should say, that it had not been written five minutes—he then gave it to me, and asked me if it was the paper he had taken away on Saturday evening; I said it was not, in the prisoner's hearing—MR. White then accused him of dishonesty, sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge; we then went over to Ilford to a Magistrate—I should not have parted with those sums of money, unless I had believed that those sums were owing by my employers, to Young and Jones—there were no such persons working in their employ<lb/>ment at that time.</p>

O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You do not mean to say that you know all the men working there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; for aught I know there might be ten Youngs and ten Joneses—we have paid the men in the same way, ever since I have been there—I did not pay the same men always, but I always went the same line of road—Strong was the other person who used to pay; I do not think that men used to go to his house to be paid; one or two might go—mistakes do occur; there was one some time ago, but it did not originate with me; either the prisoner or the time keeper detected it—the error was in paying a boy named Bicker a man's wages on one Saturday, and it was detected on the next, but it was a month or two previous to this—I do not recollect a man being paid double, and the prisoner detecting it; it was brought to my knowledge, not to Mr. White's—it generally happened that some four or five of the men used to go to the prisoner's house to be paid, sometimes more and sometimes less—while I am going down the line, I carry the money bag—when we return to the counting house, I hand over the balance to the prisoner to pay the remainder of the money—I should make no remarks—I take the balance from the pay sheet—the names are not read out, but the prisoner calls out the amounts, and I put them in the bag—the pay book of Aug. 12th, would be made up on Friday night or early on Saturday morning—the list is made out from the pay book, and the pay book from the dictation of the time keeper—the time keeper's list is here—I saw the list of 12th Aug. on Monday 14th, I did not inspect it item by item—the prisoner has been in Messrs. Brassey's employment about twelve months—I left him some money on 12th Aug., but do not know at all who he was to pay with it—on the second occasion, I left the money in respect of Young and Jones and some sawyers—there is a company of the sawyers, Cobb I think the name is; I left 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I did not make any memorandum of what I left in the bag, nor of the entire amount</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180122"/>
               <p>I handed over to the prisoner on the 19th, but I know that it corresponded with these items.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is supposing that the money in the bag originally corresponded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I distinctly counted out 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and handed them to the prisoner—some money remained in the bag, we generally put in a few pounds; because sometimes men call on a Saturday, and receive money who are not in the list at all; there is a man named Foster whose wages are 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—we have never been short—the prisoner has been out on bail.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell me exactly what passed when you got to Barking that evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked him if there were any men who had not been paid—he said, "Yes," there were these two men, pointing to the paper, Jones and Young—he mentioned the names—he had the list in his hand, and I saw them on it—he said, "These men, Jones and Young are not paid; they will most likely call at my house to night for it, and there is also the balance for the sawyers which I will take as well, and they will call for it"—we then made the calculation, to know what the balance would be for the sawyers—we made it from a small book which is kept by the store keeper, and found that the amount was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I then handed all three amounts to the prisoner in separate sums, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I counted them out separately, and they were placed before him in three separate lots—there were no others unpaid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am time keeper to Messrs. Peto, Brassey, and Betts. It is a portion of my duty to keep a time-book, in which I enter the names of the men, and the length of time that they work—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the week ending 12th Aug. I do not find the name of R. Jones or R. Young, nor in the week ending 19th Aug.—no such persons were employed there during that month—if such persons had been in the employment I must have known the fact—at the end of each week I read the time-book out to the prisoner, and he enters the names and items which I read out, into a book which is called the pay book—I did not give him the names of R. Jones or R Young in Aug.—there was a J. Jones the whole of the month—I took his time, but he was not on my list, as I did not pay him—I returned his name to the prisoner—I took one pay list, and Mr. Penny the other—J. Jones would be on Mr. Penny's list, not on this list—it is in a different portion of the line to where Mr. Penny pays the money—J. Jones is one of the gaugers of the plate layers—the money does not come into either of these lists—it would be put on a small scrap of paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Supposing that J. Jones was to be paid on Saturday night, who would pay him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Penny, in company with the prisoner, and the same on the 19th, I believe—MR. Penny always used to do so—Jones's wages were 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day—all the names that I read out are on this list—this is headed "from 29th July to 25th Aug."—each successive week I read the numbers and the time from this book, and so much time made each day—these men not marked were not at work at all—the plate layers numbers were put down from this book on Saturdays—I used to read the book over to the prisoner on Fridays—I read the numbers and time separately—sometimes I used to call the names, and sometimes the numbers, but most frequently the numbers—these names correspond with the numbers in the pay-book—the pay-book is made up by Mr. Penny or the</p>

               <p>prisoner—he enters into the book before entering into his list—the number of J. Jones is 66 (<hi rend="italic">J. Jones appeared in the book as No.</hi> 66)—there was no mistake made in putting "J. Jones" for "R Jones"—we have never paid a man double—the prisoner told me one Friday that he had detected that a lad had been paid double, and that he had told Mr. White of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you consider plate layers as men regularly employed on the line? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they are always kept separate in the books—I always call the numbers, and generally the names too, but some-times I omit the names—when a man enters the prosecutor's employment there is always a number fixed to his name, and he has the same number the whole of the month—there was no man named Young working in the establishment from 25th July to 29th Aug., nor was there in the month before; if there had been it would have been entered in this book—at the end of the third week of that month 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. would be due to J. Jones, but we do not pay them every week, we only sub them; it is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day paid monthly, but for that week he would be entitled to 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there may be now and then one or two men who come to my house in the evening to receive the money after I had been down the line.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing agent to Messrs. Peto and Co. for this railway. At the beginning of they month Strong, the time keeper, gives the names of the whole of the men employed to the junior clerk, the prisoner, with their numbers—that is done on a printed form, but in this case the printed form has been omitted, as they lived in the same village, and their business called them together—the numbers affixed to each workman's name remain for the month, and the next month also, if they remain—it is the daily duty to return the men's time, but it is never omitted on Friday, as that is the last day of our week—anything that is not entered ought to be entered on Friday, to make up the accounts for payment—the names are written only once for the month, but the time is put down daily, and the four weeks are made into a total at the end of the month—on Friday or Saturday the prisoners should assist Mr. Penny in making out the list—his first duty is to make up the pay book—I call Mr. Penny the chief clerk and cashier—strictly speaking it is the duty of the cashier, with the assistance of the prisoner, to make up the pay book, and then to take the sums out of the pay book, and make a pay list on the Friday or Saturday—whether Mr. Penny does it, or gets his helper to do it, is a matter between themselves s—two lists are made out—Strong takes the time for the whole of the district, but he can only find time to pay about half of it—the plate layers are not included in either of these lists; they are four or five men working in a gang—I do not know, of my own knowledge, that there was a man of the name of John Jones, a plate layer, but it appears so by the book—it is Penny's duty to see that the plate layers are paid—I know nothing, of my own knowledge, of Saturday evening, 19th Aug., but on the return of the list, on Monday morning, 21st Aug., I was in the counting house when the prisoner came in with the list, without being sent for—I was comparing the lists with a young man named Lockey, and as soon as the prisoner entered I caused the door to be shut, and said, "Are all these men paid, Mr. Penny?"—having got this memorandum in my hand, which I had just been making, he said, "I expect they are"—I said, "How do you know? did you pay them yourself?"—he said he had not paid the whole of them himself—I asked him how many he had paid, and how many he had not—he said there were two whom he had not paid on Saturday, besides some sawyers, and pointed out the numbers of the two men whom he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180124"/>
               <p>not paid in the pay book—he said he had not paid them for the whole of the month—I asked him who had paid them—he said he had given the money to Lord to pay them—they were No. 162 and No. 177, Jones and Young; but I forget which was first of the two—this was for the week, 18th to 25th Aug.—just at that moment Lord vanished from the office—nobody could tell where he had gone—this was before I had asked him for his list—I sent over to his house, to see if he was there—he came back in five or seven minutes, and I asked him if he had the list of those men for whom he had the money on Saturday night—he said he had—I asked him to let me look at it, and he showed me this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the ink was wet—I said, "Is this the list you took on Saturday night?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I see no name of Young or Jones"—I held it up to the light, and said, "Why, this has not been written five minutes"—he said, "I beg your pardon, Sir, it is the one I had on Saturday night"—I called him a scamp, and sent for a policeman—I should say that during the whole of August there were no persons named R. Jones or R. Young, in Messrs. Peto's employment, on that line of railway; but I do not know all the men—all the men in Strong's district should appear in the book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had the prisoner been in the service of Messrs Peto? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he had been employed under me eighteen or nineteen months—I do not know where he was employed before—he did not bring a four years' character to me, he brought a note to me from a clerk in the London office, to know if I could give him a job—I gave him one at store keeping at first, and then he got into the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The prisoner would know nothing of what men were at work but from the report of the timekeeper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that is the only means he had of knowing—he did not point out to me the week before, an overcharge paid to a boy—I do not even know that there was an error—the three first weeks the men are paid part of their earnings, what we call "subsist"—a man that is earning 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week would perhaps receive 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the end of the first week—the truck system is done away with now.</p>

On Sunday evening; 20th Aug., I received information, and went out and saw the deceased lying in the road, bleeding from the nose or mouth—I made inquiries, and in consequence of information, I went after the prisoner; I did not find him till the Tuesday; he was then at his master's, a Mr. Booth's, in a street leading out of the Old Kent-road—I said to him, "How are you Bill?"—I have known him from a child—he said, "How are you?"—I said, "Were you at Plumstead on Sunday night, Bill?" he said, "No, I was not"—I said, "I think you were, for I thought I saw you there"—he Said, "Well, the truth will always go the farthest, I saw you there in the Red lion"—I then asked if he recollected anything about striking a man; he said, "Yes, he struck a man, and knocked him down"—I asked if he knew the man; he said, "No"—I said, "How came you to strike the man?"—he said, "There was a woman running after a boy; my younger brother said, 'Run' (I think he said), Richard, or <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, don't let your mother catch you; the father was passing at the time, and said, 'What have you to do with that, you s—y puppy;' I said, 'I will show you whether I am a puppy,' for that was the reason that caused me to strike him"—I knew Smale—I saw his dead body at his own house after he was brought from the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Thomas's. On Saturday morning, 26th Aug., about 8 o'clock, I received the deceased into the hospital—he was suffering from compression of the brain—there were symp<lb/>toms of laceration of the brain as well—I could not detect any fracture of the skull externally—the coma became greater on Friday, and he died at 4 o'clock that afternoon—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the follow<lb/>ing Monday—I found a fracture at the base of the skull, extravasations of blood beneath the membranes of the brain, and laceration of the two</p>

               <p>anterior lobes, and left middle lobe of the brain—a violent fall on the back of the head would cause those appearances—the cause of death was com<lb/>pression of the brain; that compression was produced by extravasation of blood—the other organs were quite healthy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I had known the prisoner very nearly two years, and till this matter happened we had been good friends—on Friday, 25th Aug., I was in a public house with him—I passed the whole evening with him there, till half past 12 o'clock on the morning of the 26th—we had some drink, but only very little—when I came away I was not any the worse for what I had drunk, nor was he—we were both quite sober—he went to his mother's house, and I went with him; and we stopped there till half past 2 o'clock in the morning—I came out of the house before him, and was going home—I next saw him about ten yards from his mother's gate—he overtook me—nothing took place till we got to the Red Lion; I then wished him good morning—he said he should not wish me good morning, he meant to give me a d—d good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi> before he left me—I had not had any quarrel with him—I said, "What for, have you any particular grudge against me?"—he said, "No; not any particular grudge," but he should do it before he left me—I said, "You will have to get some one to help you, or to pray to God to make you able to do it"—he said he did not care whether he had any one to help him, but he should well make me suffer for it before he left me—after he had repeated those words I walked off towards my lodging, and he followed me—he was sometimes a short distance before me, and some<lb/>times</p>

               <p>a short distance behind—he got home to my lodging about fifty yards before I got to the door—lie did not lodge in the same house—I went up to the door of my lodging, and he was there—he stood against the door, and he said he should give me a d—d good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi> before he left me—I at<lb/>tempted to go in at the door, and he came up to me and told me he should make me fight before I went in—I told him I did not wish to have anything to do with him, I did not want to interfere with him—he said, "Well, I shall make you fight whether you door whether you do not"—I said, "Well, if you make me I suppose I must"—I did not prepare to fight, but he did—he pulled off his coat, and I asked him what for; and he said, for to give me a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi>—I did not do anything to my dress—I buttoned my coat up—I did not begin to fight, I stood with my hands in my pocket—he came up to me, and struck at me—I turned my back to him, and he struck me in the back—I held up my arm to keep the blows away from my face, and he struck me underneath my arm, and on the left side of my back—I do not know whether it was with his fist or with anything in his hand—he then caught hold of me with his right hand, and tried to throw me down—he put his right hand round my waist—I said, "It is no use your trying to throw me down, you can't"—he said, "I shall make you well suffer for it without that"—after he tried to throw me down, he struck me four or five times in the back—his arm came round me at the time I had hold of him—I could not see anything in his hand till I felt the knife going through my coat into my back—that was the fourth or fifth blow—I felt what I believe to be a knife going through my clothes into my body—I said to him, "George, you are stabbing me"—he said, "I know I am, and I mean to have your b—y heart out before I leave you"—after he had said these words, I saw the knife in his right hand—I do not know what, became of it—I tried to get it out of his hand with my left hand—he had the knife in his right hand—I tried to get hold of his right hand, and he raised his hand and struck me twice in the arm—once in the lower arm, and once just at the bend of the arm—the second time I caught his arm, and as soon as I got hold of his arm he dropped the knife in the road, and he stooped and picked it up, and put it in his pocket—heathen took up his coat and ran towards his own home—I was not able to follow him, I was bleeding very much from four places—I went to my lodging house—a doctor came to me—there was no one by at any time—I believe I have told all that happened—I did nothing to provoke the prisoner.</p>

I was on duty in Grove-street, Deptford—I heard a cry of murder about 3 o'clock in the morning—I went in the direction of it, and met the prosecutor—he made a complaint to me—he appeared to me to be sober—he was bleeding profusely from the left arm—I took off, his coat, and saw him bleeding from two wounds on the left part of the back, about the shoulder—I also observed two wounds on the left arm—I saw him home, and brought a medical man to him—I had not known him nor the prisoner before—I went afterwards and looked for the prisoner—I found him the same morning at his lodging, No. 8, Wellington-street, Deptford—I found him in bed about 5 o'clock—he appeared to be <hi rend="italic">drank</hi> then, but I had seen him before he stabbed the prosecutor, and he was sober—when I saw him at 5 o'clock he appeared to be drunk, but I believe he was not—I had seen him about half past 2 o'clock that morning, in company with the prosecutor—I spoke to the prisoner, and in my judgment he was then sober—he had no appearance of being drunk—the prosecutor was sober at half past 2 o'clock—when I found the prisoner in bed about 5 o'clock, I took him into custody—I asked him to get up and out of bed—he made no reply—I spoke to him again, and asked him if he had stabbed John Christmas about 3 o'clock—he said he knew nothing at all about it—he then got up and dressed, and came with me to the station—as I took him to the station I passed the door of the house where Christmas lodged—the prisoner saw the blood, and he said if he had caused the prosecutor to lose so much blood as that, he ought to be punished for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at Rotherhithe. On Saturday morning, 26th Aug., I was called to attend the prosecutor at his. lodging in Grove-street, Deptford, between 3 and 4 o'clock—he had two or three wounds in the back of a small character, and two larger ones on the left arm—they were incised clean wounds, as if cut with a sharp instrument—one of those on the arm appeared to be drawn across—those on the back appeared more of the character of punctured wounds—he was then bleeding slightly—he had bled much—one of the wounds on the arm was dangerous—it was near an artery—it was about an inch and a half in length—I dressed the wound, and attended him for a week or ten days afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Greenwich Market. On 12th Sept, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked for a drink of water—I gave her the mug to fetch the water from the pump—I missed nothing at the time, till after she came back—she sat down on a chair—I missed the shawl from the counter near where she had been—she said she had not taken it—I saw it in her pocket—I took it out—this is it—I saw her put it under her apron, not off the counter—it belonged to me—she said, "God knows I did n't mean any harm."</p>

On Friday, 25th Aug., I was on Camberwell-green, about 5 o'clock—I saw the two prisoners together talking—I passed them, and went into Mr. Smith's shop—after I had been there a few minutes Daley came in, and asked to look at some gloves in the window—she bought a pair for 9 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave a half crown—change was given her, and she left the shop, and joined the other prisoner—I examined the half crown—I then followed the prisoners for three quarters of a mile, to the White Hart, Southampton-street, Camberwell—I went in there—the prisoners were having some refreshment—Daly nudged Williamson, and I saw something in his hand—I walked round, took a black glove from him, and found in it five half crowns—I detained him, and sent for a constable—Daly had left the door, and the potman fetched her back again—Williamson said the money was never in his possession at all, and that I tried to get up a Mint case—Daly was within hearing when he said that—I gave the money to the police constable.</p>

In 1849 and 1850, I was living in the service of Mr. Hendry, at Leyton, in Essex—the prisoner was living there as coachman, for about five months—he came, I believe, in 1849, and did not leave till 1850—he represented himself as a single man, and paid his addresses to me—I left Mr. Hendry's service in the spring of 1850, and went to reside with my father for some time at Tottenham—the prisoner still continued his attentions to me there—I made some shirts for him, and lent him a sovereign—he told me that he would pay me for making the shirts, and I fully expected that he would do so, but he did not—I remained with my father it may have been two months, and the prisoner ceased to visit me—I did not know where to find him after he had got the shirts—I then went into the service of a gentleman named Heath, at Tottenham, for about nine months, but I did not say anything about that to the prisoner—I did not know where to find him; I sent him a letter or two by a friend to be for<lb/>warded,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180136"/>
               <p>but never got any answer—I then went into the service of the Duchess of Cambridge, about Nov. 1850, as still room maid—I was there about twelve months before I saw the prisoner, he called on me about Christmas, 1851, at the Duchess's house, at Kew—that was the first I had seen of him since I had made the shirts for him and lent him the sovereign—I was out when he called—I came home about 10 o'clock, and he told me he had waited two hours; very little passed, as I would not stop to speak to him; I would not have anything to say to him—he made a great many protestations that he was not as he had been represented—I told him that it would be better that he should not come to see me, as there were rumours about that he had been married, and I thought it was since I had lost sight of him—he said it was very hard that I should believe other people instead of him; but this was not on the first interview—I think he only stopped five minutes, then he wanted me to go out with him, and I would not—he called again, it might be a month afterwards, and it was then that I said I had heard that he had been married—he said it was very hard that I should believe other people before him, and he could take his oath that he was not married, and that he never had been—I told him that that was enough, and I believed him—he asked me how I was getting on, and what wages I had; I told him I was having 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week board wages—I do not think he asked me if I had any money—I had about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Bank—he continued to visit me after that, and we were married in 1852, at St. George the Martyr, Southwark, while I was with the Duchess of Cambridge; I had fourteen days' holiday—after our marriage we went down to Brighton—he said he wished me to remain in service three years as I was in a good situation, and that it would be better for us both—I told him I did not like to do that, and that it would be better if we had not married if he could not make a home—I went back to service and remained twelve months and a few days; he frequently came to see me, and wrote to me, but I destroyed the letters at his suggestion, as I received them—in Aug. 1853, I left the service of the Duchess, and lived with the prisoner; he took a beer shop at Coles-terrace, Barnsbury-row, Islington—I had told him that I found he was spending his money in dissipation, and it was quite time that he made a home, and I would not stop in service any longer—I had 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the savings bank, at Tottenham—when I left service my father drew it out for me, and gave it to the prisoner, as I could not go to Totten<lb/>ham—I believe there was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as there was interest—we remained at the beer shop about five months, and left because the business did not answer, and I went home to my friends again at the prisoner's suggestion; he wished me to go to service again and save as much money as I could, and then he said he would try to make another home—I went into the service of Mr. Griffiths, 28, King-street, Regent-street, and am living there now—I was there between four and five months before I found out where the prisoner was; and five or six weeks ago I heard that he was at Mr. Rice's, No. 12, Stockwell-common—I went there and saw the prisoner, he asked me how I was; I told him I wished to know why he had not answered the letters I had sent him, he told me that he did not mean to—I then asked him if he intended to allow me anything; he said, "No"—I then told him that I had heard rumours of his being married (I had heard of it since I had ceased to live with him)—I said that his conscience must tell him if it was true or not, and that if it was true, I was not his wife, but if it was not true, and I was his wife, he ought to support me in some way—he made no answer, and I told him that next day I should go to the</p>

Williams said that he was out in the street with some girls, and that a man said, "How can he be such a fool as to be romping with those girls? He knows that he can<lb/>not marry them, as he has got a wife already"—I believe it was after I had made the shirts for him, and lent him the sovereign, that I heard that he was married; but I will not swear it—he came to me at the Duchess of Cambridge's of his own free will—I lived there about a year and three quarters after he first came there—he afterwards obtained a situation at Mr. Dawson's, the ship builder at Limehouse, and he wished me to obtain the situation of housemaid there—I applied for it, but did not obtain it—that was before I went to Mrs. Heath's, and a few weeks after I left Mr. Hendry's—it was after I was aware that the prisoner had gone there—I was at that time living with my parents at Tottenham—I was not aware that after he left Mr. Dawson's he went to Mr. Wittin's, at Sydenham—when I renewed my acquaintance with the prisoner at the Duchess's, he had paid me the sovereign, because my father had threatened to summon him in the County Court—I did not ask him for the money for the shirts—it was not my suggestion, after I was at the Duchess of Cambridge's, to get</p>

Pyle is a ginger beer manufacturer—I saw his name on the van—when the van stopped I observed Foreman go info Florio's house—he came out in a few minutes, and took a box, con<lb/>taining ginger beer bottles, out of the van—I afterwards saw a boy, who was with Foreman on the van, take in two other boxes—after the third box had been carried in, I went in, in company with another officer—I found Florio taking the bottles out of the boxes which had been taken into his house—Foreman was in there also—I told Foreman that he must consider himself in my custody, for stealing the boxes and bottles from his employer—he made no answer—I afterwards told Florio that he must consider himself in custody also, for receiving the same, well knowing them to be stolen—he made no answer at the time—I searched the premises, and found three other boxes belonging to Mr. Pyle, with the name defaced—the name had been branded on the boxes, but there were no remains of the name—I found them in the front room—one of them was full of bottles, containing ginger beer, and the others were empty—Florio said they were his own boxes—a wooden tray was there also, which he said was his own make—I found about twelve gross of ginger beer bottles—MR. Pyle said, in the prisoner's presence, that he believed all the boxes to be his, and likewise the bottles, from the system of robbery which had been carried out—Florio said, I will give you half of the bottles, and the boxes you have got, if you will not charge us"—we were then taking the boxes out at the door—I have here a printed bill which was posted on the shutters—I also saw this card in the front room—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Foreman and Co., from R.

Harrington's aunt and sister, and another old lady, came, and then she got up and went away with them—I saw the child about 11 o'clock, lying on the bed, it was then very black in the face.</p>

On Tuesday, 5th Sept., while I was at breakfast, the prisoner came into my room—she had the baby with her—she was very dejected, she said she was very poorly—I asked what was the matter—she said that she had been up all night, owing to her husband's brother sleeping there all night—I gave her some tea and bread and butter, that seemed to revive her, she seemed better after it—she stayed about twenty minutes, and then left the room—she said she was going to the doctor's somewhere, she did not know where—she returned in an hour and a quarter afterwards, and came into my room—she appeared much more distracted, and worse than when she came in first, and the baby appeared quite different—I said, "Mrs. Harrington, what is the matter with the baby?"—she said, "I have given it laudanum "—I said, "How much have you given it"—she said, "Half a tea spoonful"—I said, "That is too much for a baby, how many drops were there?" she said, "Three or four"—I saw that the baby became worse and worse, and I said, "We had better take it to the doctor "—she said, "Yes, do "—a friend of Mrs. Harrington's was there, and we took it to Mr. Rendle—it was not dead then, it died on Thursday morning.</p>

On Tuesday, 5th Sept., between 12 and 1 o'clock, I went to No. 5, Harrow-street, Mint, and saw the prisoner there—there were three or four other women in the room—I saw a child lying on the bed, apparently dead—I asked the prisoner what was the matter with the child, what she had been giving it—she said, "I have made a mistake, I have given her a bottle that I had for myself"—I asked her what it was—she said laudanum, that she had for herself in her confinement—I took her into custody, and took her to the station—I afterwards took the child to the workhouse—in carrying it there it moved in my arms—I left it in the infirmary—on the Thursday after, I heard the prisoner make a statement in the jailor's room—her husband was there with an attorney's clerk—he said to her, "This is the man that I have employed to defend you; tell him the truth, how you got this laudanum?"—she said she had purchased 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth on the Tuesday morning previous, at a chemist's shop, at the corner of Lant-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at No. 33, Bridge-house-place, Newington-causeway. On Tuesday, 5th Sept, a child was brought to my house to be examined—it was a male child, about a fortnight old—it appeared to be thoroughly narcotised, and nearly dead—I administered some medicine—the prisoner was not there—I sent the child home after giving it some medicine, and then followed—I saw the prisoner, and said to her, "I fear, Mrs. Harrington, you have poisoned this child "—she said, "I hope not"—I said, "What have you given it; have you given it laudanum?"—she said, "I don't know"—I said, "Where is the bottle that you gave it out of?"—she began to look for it—a bottle was given me, and she identified it as the bottle—I said, "There is no laudanum in this bottle"—she said it had had some wine in it since; which was the fact—the child did not appear to revive, and it was taken to the workhouse—my assistant attended it that evening, and I attended till the death—it died early on the Thursday morning—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination by order of the Coroner—the external condition of the child was in no way injured—all the organs of the body, except the brain, were thoroughly healthy—the brain itself was congested, and the membranes covering it were full of blood—the centre and base of the brain also had a very large quantity of serous fluid—connecting those appearances with the symptoms I saw during life, I have no doubt the child died from the effects of a narcotic poison—I should say that that appearance of the brain is common in infants who die from apoplexy, or some disease connected with teething; but tracing it from the beginning to the end, I should say in this case it was the result of a narcotic poison—there was nothing in the brain itself to induce me to suppose that a narcotic poison had been used—I could not detect any by analysis, nor any in the stomach by analysis—the effect of a narcotic poison</p>

               <p>is to produce an extra fulness of the blood vessels of the brain, and that causes the watery part of the blood to escape from those vessels; they can hold it no longer—I did find those appearances—I found no poison at all in the stomach—the child might have died from the effects of a narcotic poison, and yet no traces of it be discovered in the stomach—there was a period of forty-eight hours between the administration and the death, and it would most likely have been absorbed into the system—I have admi<lb/>nistered laudanum to children of that age, but I never ventured beyond the tenth part of a drop—I think a drop might be fatal; it has been fatal—I have been very often obliged to leave off giving it to children when I have given only one-tenth part of a drop, on account of untoward circumstances; that is, they appeared stupified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The appearance of the brain was very much like what it would be in serous apoplexy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly the same—the serum had been extravasated from the blood vessels, and was collected in the centre of the brain—that is exactly the appearance of sanguineous apoplexy—if I had known nothing of the circumstances of the case, I should have said the child had died from sanguineous apoplexy—children are very sub<lb/>ject to convulsions, proceeding from bad milk, or anything of that sort—in such a case, I should quite expect to find the appearances I have mentioned, but the order of circumstances previously would be different—a child would be convulsed before it became stupified, here it was stupified first—I saw the child when it made in my surgery what appeared to me to be the last gasp, and I did not expect to hear any more of it; that was on Tuesday, but it did survive till the Thursday—within a second after I looked at the child, it ceased to breathe—I looked at it for several seconds more, and there was no sign of breath at all—I dipped my finger into a little ammonia, that being a powerful stimulant, and applied it to the mouth two or three times, and there was not the slightest sign of life—I then supposed it to be dead, and directed it to be taken home—it was not rigid—I followed the child with my assistant; it was still in the same condition, in a state of perfect coma—I put my ear and my face close to the child, but did not perceive the least sensation of anything like breath—I did not try a glass—I applied the ammonia simply to detect whether life was present, and to excite it if there was the least effort at recovery—it could not swallow—if I had given it anything, I should have destroyed the last remnant of life; it would have remained in the throat—I administered medicine, wine, and various stimulants, but no emetic—it vomited without—an emetic would only unnecessarily disturb—it did not vomit until all the laudanum, I be<lb/>lieve, had been absorbed into the system, and produced these narcotised effects.</p>

               <p>death—MR. Davis, Dr. Evans's assistant, came to see it, and about half an hour afterwards Dr. Evans himself came—there was no alteration in the child from the time it was brought in till Dr. Evans saw it—it did not get any worse—it took some warm milk, which Dr. Evans ordered, and swal<lb/>lowed it—I gave it with a spoon out of a tea cup—it took three tea spoons<lb/>ful—so far as I saw, it could swallow very well—it had seven warm baths at various times in the course of the day, from the time it was brought in till 7 o'clock at night—that was by the surgeon's orders—it appeared to get better on Wednesday morning—I have a child of my own—I suckled the deceased child on the Wednesday morning—it took the milk from me, and swallowed it—I have been nine months in the ward of the workhouse, and have had considerable experience of children and infants—I do not mean to say that the child sucked as though it was in full health, but it sucked from me, and enjoyed what it did suck, although it did not suck so strong as a child that was well—it sucked from me twice in that day, and I gave it arrow root and milk as well—it seemed to revive from about 12 o'clock on Wednesday till about 12 o'clock on Thursday morning; it got better—about 12 o'clock on Thursday morning it got rather poorly—it appeared to get faint and low—I gave it some sherry wine, and it took it—I warmed it, and put it into bed—it died about 5 o'clock on Thursday evening—it did not seem to recover after putting it to bed—it had two convulsive fits, one about 4 o'clock, and one about a quarter to 5 o'clock—it turned black and blue round the mouth, and clenched its hands—I have seen many chil<lb/>dren die in that way—I lost one of my own—it is a common way in which they do die in convulsions—I saw no difference in this child's death and that of any other child about the same age in convulsions.</p>
