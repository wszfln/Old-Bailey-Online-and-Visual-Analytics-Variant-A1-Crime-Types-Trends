            , Watchman. When we could not find the Watch in her Cloaths, I said, I believed she had hid it in a particular Place, which is easy to guess at without naming, for I knew such things had been done by other Gentlewomen on the like Occasion. So we propos'd to search her, but she refusing to let us, Mr. Hazledine, the Governor of the Round house, desir'd his Wife to do it ; but she bid him do it himself and he would, for she would not be concern'd in any such sobb. Whereupon he undertook it, and I and the Constable of the Night, assisted in holding the Prisoner, while he examin'd her, and in a little time he took the Watch out of the Close-Clipboard.</p>

            . When we had search'd her in the common Way, and could not find it, King told us, he believ'd he knew where it was, and that a superficial Examination would signify nothing, for if we expected to get it, we must search to the Bottom. So I held her Hands, and turn'd my Backside to her Feet while they made the Search, for I did not much care to see how they proceeded. I heard one of them say, that he felt it, and soon after, that he had got it out, and then I venture to look back, and saw the Watch in his hand. He wip'd it, and gave it to me, and it is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I and my Husband had quarrel'd, and I was crying as I went along the Street, when the Prosecutor met me, and ask'd me, what I cry'd ? I told him, I had got a wicked Husband that had abused me, My Dear, says he, will you leave him, and go along with me? o, says I, tho' he has been a barbarous Man te, I'll never do that, for I bare two Children by him, and am now big with another. Will., says he, you may go and drink with me, Forever. And so at last, he overpersuaded me and when we came to the Alehouse, he wanted to have to do with me, but having no Money he gave me the Watch to pawn for a Guinea, and then, because I refus'd to let him have his Will, he charged me with picking his Pocket, and sent for a Constable, who carried me to the Round-house, where they stumbled and strumbled, and trowd me about till the Watch was found.</p>

            . On Thursday, November 22, about five in the Evening I went with my Master, Mr. Wilmot, to the Globe at Mile-End; I expected to meet a Man with whom I had some Business to do, but he not coming, I told my Master, I thought there would be no Occasion for me to stay. My Master telling me I might do as I would, I concluded to go, but having received some Money at Stepney, I thought it would not be safe for me to venture over the Fields with it alone, and so I left 26 l. with him, and came away about six a Clock; but recollecting that I still had 7 l. 10 s. in Moidores and Silver, I put it into my Side-pocket for the better Security. Coming into <placeName id="t17331205-12-crimeloc55">White-horse-lane</placeName>

Why then, says he, you may keep it; go forward, and say you are well us'd. So we parted, and I return'd another Way to my Master at the Globe, and told him and Mr. Collingwood, who was with him, what had happen'd. I staid with them there about three or four Hours, and then we all three came away together. We took Links with us, and coming to the same Place where I had been robb'd, we saw two Men running towards us; For God's sake, says one of them, have a Care, Gentlemen, we are frighted out of our Wits; we met a wild Bull, and thought the Devil was coming for us. As they look'd like loose Fellows, Mr. Collingwood ask'd them if there had not been a Robbery there that Night? They said, they had not heard of any. I thought I knew them again, and taking hold of one of them, whose Name is Macdonald, I told him he was the Man that robb'd me. The other was Baxter, and him my Master and Mr. Collingwood took Care of. We carry'd them to the Sun Tavern at Stepney, where we search'd them, and found a large Fowl upon one, and two Chickens upon t'other. We provided them with separate Lodgings for that Night, - the Watch-house and the Round-house. I saw Macdonald next Morning, and then he confess'd that he was the Man who took my Money, and said, as he us'd me well in giving me my Watch again, he hop'd I would let him be an Evidence.</p>

            . Going over the Fields with Mr. Wilmot and his Clerk, two Fellows came running along, and crying out, Lord have Mercy upon us! - O Lord! - a mad Bull! - the Devil! - has frighted us out of our Wits. I thought they look'd like a Couple of Rogues, and the Prosecutor said, he believ'd they were the Men that robb'd him, and so we made bold to secure them both.</p>

            . I and the two Prisoners went out together upon the Account. We call'd at the Globe, at Mile-End, where we saw the Prosecutor taking some Money out of his Pockets, and so we went out, and watch'd him, and as he came over the Bank, I stopp'd him, and demanded of him his Money. He made no Ressistance, but gave me 19 s. and 6 d. out of his Pocket. Then I bid him deliver his Watch; he said, it was a Family-Watch, and hop'd we would not take it from him. Well, says I, take it again then, and say you was well used. So we left him, and went round by Bow, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050007"/> in 3 Hours after, came to the same Field again, where we were frighted by a mad Bull.

They were not in any unseemly Posture, I secur'd the Man, and call'd the Watch. The Woman said, God bless you, Sir, you have sav'd my Life, and my Money too. I ask'd her where her Money was? She said, in her Hand. But presently finding her Mistake , O Lord! says she, this is my Paper of Tea-dust !</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I desire to be search'd when I was in the Watch-house?</p>
               <p>Mr. Matthews. Yes; but I thought it would then be in vain, because in his Way thither he had opportunity enough to make away with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She had another with her before I came near.</p>
               <p>Matthews. Man but the Prisoner</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I heard her cry out in a bar barous Manner, and meeting a Man in the Alley, I ask'd, what was the Matter ? He said, No harm; and so he went away, and I went to her, and she gave me her Hand to help her up, for she was very drunk, and then Mr. Matthews came and took him.</p>
               <p>Matthews. The Woman a in a great Surprize, but I did not perceive she was drunk.</p>
               <p>The Jury found him guilty to the We of 10 d.</p>
               <p>The Court (before the Verdict was Recorded ) inform'd them, that in a Robbery, the Value was not material, and therefore they had nothing to consider, but whether the Prisoner robb'd the Woman or not.</p>
               <p>The Jury said, they believed he robb'd her of some Money; but were doubtful of how much.</p>
               <p>The Court again, told them, they were not to regard the Sum, but if upon the Evidence given, it appear'd to them, that he robb'd her, they ought to find him Guilty, or otherwise to Acquit him.</p>

            , Midwife. On the 30th of October, I was sent for to the Prisoner, and found she had been delivered of a Child. She said, something (she knew not what) was come from her, but it was no Child. I ask'd her, what she did with that which came from her? She said she did not know where it was. I told her it signify'd nothing to deny it, for I was sure she had had a Child, and therefore a Child I would find. Then she confess'd that it was a Man Child; but said it was born dead, and that her Father took it from her, but she could not tell what he had done with it. Her Father coming in I told him his Daughter had been Deliver'd - Deliver'd ! says he, Ay, so she has - of a Sir-Reverence. Those were his Words, begging your Worship's Pardon. I saw so much by his Behaviour towards the Prisoner, and some other Passages, that in short, I told him, I believ'd he was Father to the Child, as well as Grandfather; and that he had done my Business, and deliver'd her himself before I was sent for. So he went out, and I examin'd the Prisoner, and she declar'd to me, that her Father had lain with her, and that she never had to do with any other Man but him. On the 2d of November following, the Prisoner's Mother gave me a Note, I suppose it was sent from her Husband, who was then run away, and in this Note, it was said, that the Child was wrapt up in an old Curtain, and laid in among some Horse-litter in Tom Turd's-Hole (a Place where the Nightmen lay their Soil) and there it was found. I saw no Marks of Violence upon it; but I believe it bled to death for want of proper Help.</p>

I view'd the Body, and found no external Marks of Violence; upon which I proceeded to open the Cavities of the Thorax and Abdomen. The Lungs appear'd inflated ; I cut off one of the Lobes, and putting it into a Vessel of Water, it floated; I am therefore of Opinion that the Infant had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050011"/> breathed; I likewise found that the Blood-vessels in general were empty, and the Navel-string lacerated, and not ty'd; for which Reason, I believe, proper Help was wanting, and the Child might bleed to Death.</p>

               <p>Court. Privy-garden !</p>
               <p>Wild. I don't know whether they call it Privy-garden or Spring-garden, but its over-against the Meuse.</p>
               <p>Court. What Discourse had you there?</p>
               <p>Wild. Nothing but Here's to you; we drank but one Pot there, and then we came up and went into the Hay-market, and coming to the Corner of St. James's-street, as you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050013"/> go towards the Tennis-court, says Ogleby, Here's two Stalls where the People leave their Goods all Night, let's mill 'em, that is, break 'em open; we soon agreed upon it, and Anderson wrench'd one of the Doors open with a Chissel, but we found nothing there that was worth stealing, and so we look'd out for a better Chance. We came at last into Church-street, where, pushing against a Shutter, he said it was loose, and bid us stay a little; we stopp'd, and he put a Chissel betwixt the two Shutters, and, with a hard Wrench, forc'd it open; it made such a Noise that we were afraid it would alarm the Family, or the Watch, who stood at the Corner of the Street, and therefore we retreated for two or three Minutes, and stood at a little Distance to see the Event; but finding all safe, we went again, and blew out the Lamp that was at the Door. Then Anderson stood upon my Shoulders, pull'd down the upper Sash, and reaching over, undid the inner Shutters. Getting down again, he endeavour'd to push up the under Sash, but not being able to do it, Ogleby try'd at it, rais'd it a little with his Hands, and clapping his Shoulders under, forc'd it up high enough for us to enter. Anderson stepp'd over the Way, and getting up to a Lamp, lighted a Candle, put it into his Dark-lanthorn, and went into the House by himself, while we stood without to watch; he brought out a silver Mug, one silver Salver, a silver Stand for Snuffers, a silver Pepper-box, and a Man's Hat; if he took any Thing else he sunk it, for that was all we saw. By this Time it was between two and three in the Morning; we went thence to Stocks-market, and then it was near four. None of us having any Money left, I gave my Hat to Ogleby, and putting the Prosecutor's Hat upon my Head, went into the Brandy-shop on the left Hand facing the Market, and desir'd the Man to let us have half a Pint of Gin and 6 d. upon it till the Morning, tho' indeed it was Morning then.</p>
               <p>He refus'd to lend us 6 d. but said we might have the Gin, we agreed to it; the Gin was drawn, but while we were drinking, I thought he seem'd to be suspicious of us, for he look'd upon the Hat, and said it was a very good one, and then going to the Door call'd Lightfoot; we concluded Light-foot was a Watchman, so bidding the Man take Care of the Hat, we made haste away. Anderson pawn'd a Handkerchief for 6 d. and with that Money we went the same Morning and redeem'd the Hat. Thence we walk'd to

               <p>Wild. I first fell in your Company at Buck's Brandy-shop by St. Giles's Church, on a Thursday, between two and three in the Afternoon, which was the Day before this Gentleman's House was broke; there we drank together, and I desir'd you to sell a Handkerchief for me, for 6 d. which you did, and I spent all the Money there. When it was Dark we went out together, and pick'd Pockets till past twelve, and then meeting with Anderson and Ogleby, by Charing cross, as I said before, we went and broke open the House.</p>

            . I have had a World of Wrong done me, my Lord, a World of Wrong, indeed! I bought four Tons of old Iron, my Lord, and eight hundred Weight, my Lord, and a Quantity of old Rags, my Lord, and it was brought to London, my Lord, in Captain Hammond's Ship, my Lord, and, my Lord, it was brought to Iron-gate in the said Ship, my Lord; and so, my Lord, I went to the Custom-house to pay the Juty, my Lord, for, my Lord, I did not know there was any Juty to be paid upon old Iron, my Lord; and, my Lord, the Iron was put into Bray's Boat, my Lord; yes, my Lord, it was put into Bray,s Boat, my Lord, to be carry'd to Mr. Spencer's, my Lord, at Savorie's-dock, my Lord, from Iron-gate, my Lord; for I had agreed with Mr. Spencer for 4 l. 15 s. a Ton, my Lord; and I sold it him three Days before I sent it, my Lord, and Mr. Spencer paid me very honestly for it, my Lord; and it was Mr. Spencer, my Lord, that sent the Prisoner to fetch the Iron.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had sold it to Spencer, it was his Property. But the Prisoner is charged with stealing Goods that were your Property.</p>

Yes, my Lord, he is so, my Lord, and it was my Property, and my Goods, my Lord, and none of Mr. Spencer's, my Lord; it's true indeed, my Lord, and I'll tell my honourable Lordship how it was, my Lord, for when Bray, my Lord, had carry'd the Iron to Mr. Spencer, my Lord, Mr. Spencer would take but 18 hundred Weight, because he said, my Lord, that it was not fit for his Purpose, my Lord, and so I came and call'd a Sculler, my Lord, yes, my Lord, I call'd a Sculler, and Mr. Spencer told me, that when I had paid the King's Juty, my Lord, he would send a Lighter, and fetch the Iron, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. But you said Spencer would have no more of it.</p>
               <p>Williams. O Lord! my Lord, this was before he had the 18 hundred Weight, my Lord, and so when I came to the Water-side, it was 11 a Clock, my Lord, yes, my Lord, it was 11 a Clock, and meeting with Bray, unknown, my Lord, I say, my Lord, Bray, unknown, for I did not know him, my Lord, and I wanting a Waterman to Savorie's-Dock, my Lord, he ask'd me, if I wanted a Waterman to Savorie's-Dock, my Lord, and says Bray to me, my Lord, for Bray was in a small Boat, my Lord, says Bray, Mister Williams, says he, I know you, Mister Williams, says he, and I have fetch'd old Rags for you, says he; and says she, why can't you let me carry the Iron, says he; and so says I, to Mr. Spencer, Mr. Spencer, says I, the Captain makes a sad Noise at me, for letting the Iron lie so long in the Ship, and therefore, pray Mr. Spencer, says I, why don't you take it away?</p>
               <p>Council. Was Spencer with you at the Water-side?</p>
               <p>Williams. No, my Lord, Spencer was not with me, and please my honourable Lordship. But this was after I was at the Water-side, my Lord, and I went over to Spencer, my Lord, and Bray, my Lord, was with me; yes, my Lord, this was afterwards, and Bray was with me, my Lord, and says Bray, my Lord, Pray Mister Spencer, says he, can't I carry it? says he. And says Mr Spencer, Have you got a Lighter? says he. And Bray said, Yes. And then Mr. Spencer bid him be ready by the Ship's side by two a Clock in the Afternoon, my Lord, and I went back with Bray, my Lord, to Capt. Hammond's Ship, my Lord, and Bray went with me, my Lord, and so he went to fetch his Lighter, my Lord, and I stay'd in the Ship, in Capt. Hammond's Ship, my Lord, till four a Clock, my Lord, and then Bray came with the Lighter, my Lord, and I went to Mr. Spencer between three and four a Clock.</p>
               <p>Court. You said you staid in the Ship till four?</p>
               <p>Williams. God save your Lordship, my Lord! no my honourable Lordship, it was four a Clock when I came back, my Lord, for I went to Mr. Spencer, my Lord, and told him, my Lord, that I wonder'd Bray was not come for the Iron, my Lord, and Mr. Spencer bless'd himself, my Lord, to think, my Lord, that he could not have it sent that Night, my Lord, and so he sent another Lighter man with me, my Lord, but when we came to the Ship, my Lord, there was Bray, my Lord, with his Lighter, my Lord, by the Ship's side, my Lord, and so, my Lord, the Iron was put into Bray's Lighter, and he carry'd it to Mr. Spencer, my Lord, at Savorie's-Dock, my Lord, and I went with him, my Lord, and Mr. Spencer took 18 hundred Weight, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Council. As I apprehend it, here was a Contract for the Iron, and a Delivery of it to Spencer's Man. Spencer refus'd part, and the rest that was sent back, was that which Bray went away with: Is that your meaning?</p>
               <p>Williams. No, my Lord, I beg your Lordship's Pardon, I sold but 18 hundred to Spencer; but Bray took my Iron the Day before I went to Spencer.</p>
               <p>Court. The Day before?</p>
               <p>Williams. Ess, my Lord, for I found 5 hundred Weight at Mr. Wood's, at the Faulcon; ess, my Lord, it was the 5th of September at Night, and I found several. Tubs taken from the Iron, as Bray and I came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050016"/> from Spencer's, and says I to Bray, Where's the Tubs, Mr. Bray? says I, my Lord, and Bray, my Lord, was to carry the Iron to a Gentleman in Thames-Street, and upon the 7th of September, I was to carry some to Mr. Harrison, my Lord, and Bray run away from me, my Lord, for he was gone from me, and I could not get a Constable to take him, my Lord. And as Spencer took no more than 18 hundred, upon the 6th of September, at 7 in the Morning, my Lord, by Mr. Spencer's Recommendation, he desired me to go to a Founder, one Mr. Fowler, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Let us understand you, if possible. Did you Deliver any of your own Iron to the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Williams. Ess, my Lord, ess, I deliver'd three Tons and a Quarter to Bray, to bring to Mr. Fowler, thro' Bridge, my Lord, thro' Bridge, and it was put into his Lighter, my Lord, and he said, he could never get thro ' Bridge this Tide, and I got two Men to aid him, to push him thro'; but we could not get thro' for-the Tide was so strong, that it push'd us back again, and then he made his Boat fast on the other Side of the Bridge.</p>
               <p>Court. Then he did get thro'?</p>
               <p>Williams. Ess, ess, my Lord, he got thro'; but that was at two a Clock.</p>
               <p>Council. Did not he make some Excuse, and send you away?</p>
               <p>Williams. O! yes, a great many Excuses, and a Man came to him, and he quitted the Boat, and I staid there most of the time with it when he was gone, and I told him I must go away, and I left the Boat with the Man at the White-Bear, and the Man at the Bear said, the Iron would be safe.</p>
               <p>Council. Who did you leave in Possession of the Iron?</p>
               <p>Williams. No Body, my Lord, I left no Body in Possession, my Lord, but the Man at the Bear, my Lord, said it would be as safe as so much Gold, my Lord, but Bray, my Lord, Bray, took it out of the Ship.</p>
               <p>Council. Now we have got to the Ship again. But who took it out of the Boat at the Bridge?</p>
               <p>Williams. I don't know that Bray took it out of the Boat, my Lord, but Bray took it out of the Ship, yes, it was Bray, Bray, my Lord, Bray took it out of the Ship; and I found 5 hundred and a half at Mr. Wood's, my Lord, and I gave Mr. Wood a Subpoena to be here, my Lord, but he pray'd to be excus'd, yes, my Lord, he pray'd to be excus'd. I have had a World of Wrong, of Wrong, my Lord, a World of Wrong, yes, my Lord, a World of Wrong have I had, and

And what of that? says Bray, you may keep up two or three Weeks.

She had run away from me several times, and therefore, as I was to go over the Water, I set her to work in the Kitchen, lock'd the Door, and went out. I return'd about 6 at Night, and the Prisoner was not to be found, my Drawers were broke open, and my Money and Goods gone. On the Friday following, a Neighbour met her in Cannon-Street, and brought her home to me. I ask'd her, what it was she broke open the Drawers with ? Why, what should I open them with, says she, but with a Chissel ? I ask'd her, what she had done with the Money and Goods? She own'd she had taken three Guineas; but said, she had been to the Prisoners in Newgate, and they had got them from her.</p>

            . I had been winding Silk all Day, and went down to a Chandler's Shop in Blue -coat-fields, between 10 and 11 at Night to drink; I had been there but a few Minutes before I heard a Man cry out Murder! Its a sad Thing for a Man to be robb'd in a Christian Land by his own Fellow-natives. I ran out with a Candle, and saw the Prosecutor sitting on the Stones at Brown's Door, and a Man (which I believe was the Prisoner) pulling a Handkerchief off his Neck, and then he ran away. The Prosetor's Nose was cut, and he was very bloody. He ask'd me for a little Water; I told him I'd give him a Farthing's worth of Small-beer, and so I lifted him up, but he sell down again, whether it was owing to Drink, or to the Damage he had suffer'd, I can't say; at last I got him into the Chandler's Shop, and gave him some Small-beer, and ask'd him why he did not get a Dram? He felt in his Pocket, and said he had lost 4s. but hop'd his Note was safe; but searching farther, he said that was gone too; so I left him, and went to bed. The Houses in our Neighbourhood are left out in Tenements to Lodgers; between one and two, Mr. Ovington, the Beadle, and the Watch, came and knock'd at our Street-door; my Husband went down and let 'em in; they said they came to search for some Fellows that had made a Disturbance; they went backwards, and saw the Prisoner getting over the Wall in the Yard into an Alley, and there he was taken.</p>

John, says I, you must go with me to the Watch-house. Go with you, you Black-guard Dog? says he. Do you know who you talk to? I'd have you to know, Sirrah, that I have got Money, and a 5 l. Note in my Pocket. I made no more Words, but took him away. When he was in the Watch-house he pull'd a Paper out of his Fob, and said, See here, you Rascal! you Black-guard Rogue! here's a 5 l. Note! I ask'd him to let me see it in my Hand, but he refus'd, and put it up again.</p>

In the Morning the Prosecutor came to see him in the Cage, and said directly, That's the Man! He robb'd me of 4 s. a pair of Garters, a Key, a Handkerchief, and a Note of 5 l. 9 s.</p>

The Prisoner work'd with me in my Work-shop in the Garret ; I lost Wool several times d, and knew not who to suspect; at last one of my Men told me he had found the Thief, and that it was Old Will. I lock'd the Door, and waited his coming down from the Garret; I stopp'd him, and said, Will. this Man says he saw you put Niles in your Breeches ; (for such Wool we call Niles) and putting my Hand to his Breeches, I felt something soft, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050020"/> bid him pull it out. He said he would not, for he had got nothing there; upon which I sent for the Beadle, who took down the Prisoner's Breeches, and took the Niles out. Next Morning we got a Search-warrant and went to his House; as soon as his Wife saw us, she said, I thought he was taken, because be did not come home at eight a-Clock last Night. In his Room we found about ninety Pounds of Wool, a Pot of Soap under his Bed (the Soap is a particular Sort that I use) and a Bottle of Oil, such as I likewise use in my Business.</p>

Deliver your Rings then, says he. I told him I had no Rings neither. Why then give me your Watch, says he; I toggled at that. Be quick, says he, or you are a dead Man. I gave it him; they bid me good Night, and rode off. It was so dark that I could not see their Faces so plain as to know them again, so that I cannot swear to the Prisoner. I since found my Watch (but without the Seal) at Mr. Knot's a Pawn-broker in New-street.</p>

            . I was just come out of Place, and wanting a Lodging I was recommended to Kit Henley's, at the Ship in Peter-street, in St. James's. The Prisoner and Will. Ryland us'd to lye in the Stable, and ride out between eight and nine at Night, and come in again about one in the Morning. On Thursday Morning they took the Blanket off my Bed; I got up to see what they did with it; I saw the Prisoner there with his Hat ty'd under his Chin; their Horses sweated, and Kit Henley tore the Blanket in two, and laid one Piece on each Horse. They came in to drink, and Henley told them he wanted Money to pay his Landlord; the Prisoner said he had no Money, but he had Money's worth, and gave him something, but I did not see what it was. The Landlord went out in the Morning and came in again, and brought them some Money, and they paid him 24 s. and I gave an Account of this before Justice Lambert.</p>

             ( Davis's ) Information, I went to Henley's, and seiz'd him, and Ryland, and the Prisoner, but Ryland made his Escape. I ask'd Henley where the Mare was, that was there about half an Hour ago? He said, he did not know, for a Gentleman had taken her out. Henley was sent to Bridewell, and the Prisoner to the Gatehouse. I advised the Prisoner to discover what he knew, for I told him, if he would not, Henley would. He refus'd for a pretty while, but at last confess'd he had robb'd a Gentleman on a Hackney Coach-box, going to Kensington, of a Watch, and about half a Crown in Money. I found out the Coachman, by enquiring what Coach had been robb'd, and he told me Mr. Lee was his Fare: I went to Mr. Lee, and he describ'd the Watch to me, and particularly, that in the inside Case, there was the Picture of a Friar killing a Nun.</p>

            . I am Ryland's Sister, by Marriage, and Ryland's Wife is the Prisoner's Sister. On the 22d of November, the Prisoner was ill of an Ague and Fever, at my Mother's House, which is hard by the Ship. He had it three Weeks before he came there, and lay there constantly except one Night.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know it was the 22d of November?</p>
               <p>Tomson. It was Yesterday (Thursday) was a Fortnight. I came home, and saw him a-Bed between one and two in the Afternoon, and he was violent bad indeed, and he got up between two and three, and between three and four he went out with me.</p>
               <p>Court. Tho' he was so violent bad?</p>
               <p>Tomson. Yes; we went to Apothecaries-Hall, to get a Medicine Mr. Henley had given me a Receipt of. They would not sell so small a Quantity there, but directed me to a Chimist's in the Hay-Market, and the Prisoner was so bad then, that he could not go back for he said, his Ague was very strong upon him. So we took a Boat and went to Mr. Godfrey the Chimist's, and in the Way home, we met Ryland. Ryland did not go with us then, but came some time after. The Prisoner's Wife had got some Water-gruel, and Turnips, and Sage-tea ready. Ryland Supp'd with us, and stay'd all Night, for he had had some words with his Wife, and would have kill'd her, but I got between, and parted them, and so he swore he would not go home with her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You saw me find the Watch.</p>
               <p>Tomson. Next Morning, being Friday, he lay a-Bed 'till nine a Clock, and about ten he got up, and went with me to Tottenham-Court about some Business.</p>
               <p>Court. What Business?</p>
               <p>Tomson. To take the Air.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you call that Business ?</p>
               <p>Tomson. Besides I went to see an Acquaintance.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050022"/> And going over the Field, just by the Windmill, he stoop'd, and pick'd up something.</p>
               <p>Court. And what was it?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I don't know, for I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Court. But did not he tell you?</p>
               <p>Tomson. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Nor you ask him?</p>
               <p>Tomson. No; he said nothing to me, nor I to him.</p>
               <p>Court. That was strange indeed!</p>
               <p>Tomson. But he was taken up on the Sunday following, and he told me on the Monday, that what he found in the Field, when I was with him, was the Watch that Mr. Henly was in Trouble about.</p>

            , Constable. The Prisoner's Landlord, Mr. Cotterel, at the Crown in Prince's-Street, told me, she came home drunk, and had a Gold-Watch, and a Guinea, and said she had Bank-Bills. I went, and found the Watch, and Guinea upon her. The Guinea was in a Paper, directed to a Gentlewoman in Newgate-Street. I carry'd her before a Justice. She was sent to the Round-house, and next Day I went to Goldsmith's-Hall, and found an Advertisement (on the File) with a Reward of seven Guineas, with a Direction to go to Mr. Stables, in Fountain-Court, in Cheapside. Mr. Stables told me, 'twas one Troughton, a Waterman at Chelsea, who had lost it - The Prisoner, at first, said, it was her own Watch, and given her by her Friends; but before the Justice, she said, the found it in an old Pocket, in Covent-Garden. She told me too, she had got some Bank-Bills, and wanted to go into the City to receive the Money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. We went with a View to stay all Night. He paid for one Pint, and I for another; but having no Money to pay for the third, he gave me the Watch to pledge, and I carry'd it to my Landlord, who said, I should leave it with him, but I refus'd, and so the Constable came and took it from me, but I don't know what Authority he had to rob me, for it was downright Robbery, and he ought to be indicted for it.</p>
               <p>Maccoon, again. When I went up with the last Pint, he said, she had a Shilling of him, and therefore she should pay for it, for he would not.</p>
               <p>Court. Troughton, are you sure you took the Watch or Guinea out of your ket, while you were in her Company</p>
               <p>Troughton. I did take the Watch out, and laid it on the Table, but not the Guinea for I had three other Guineas in my Pocket, and a pretty deal of Silver; so as I had no need to take out the Guinea, and indeed I don't know what occasion I had to take out the Watch.</p>

            's, Brown put back the Bolt of the outer Gate, we went to the Door, and knock'd, the Colonel himself came and open'd it, I clapp'd my Foot between the Door and the Threshold, and we all forc'd in; Brown with a Cutlace, and Whitlock with a Pistol, struck the Colonel on the Head, and knock'd him down; we took a gold Watch out of his Pocket, and a Ring from his Finger. The Maid came up from below with a Candle in her Hand, I suppose the Noise had alarm'd her; Will. Black-well went to her, and ask'd her, where the Plate and Money was? She told him, she had not liv'd there long, but believ'd they might be above. I and Whitlock, took the Colonel with us, and went up into his Room, and rifled it; we went to break a Trunk open, but he said, Don't break it, I have the Key in my Pocket. We search'd but not finding it, he felt in his Pocket himself, and gave it us; We took out twelve silver Forks, seven Knives with silver Handles, one of them was a small Knife, thirteen silver Spoons, one great silver soop Spoon, eight or nine silver Pennies, a quarter Guinea, some Necklaces, and other Things; then we tumbled the Beds upside down, a pair of Shoes with silver Buckles stood in the Window, and we took the Buckles out; we open'd the Chest of Drawers - the Drawers open'd, one to the Right-hand and the other to the Left, and took out a Parcel of Linen, and Woman's Apparel.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was /Brown ?</p>
               <p>
            Mitchell. He was sometimes above and sometimes below. He came up to see how we went on. And row and then gave the Colonel a knock and a Damn, and said, You old Rogue, where's your Money? We left the Colonel, and went into his Daughter's Room (as I suppose it was) broke open the Drawers, and took out a Parcel of Head-clothes, and two pair of Scissars, with a Silver-case. Thence we went into the Maid's Room; but finding nothing there, we went into another Bye-room, where was a Trunk and a Box; we broke them open, and took out of the Box, two Gowns and Petticoats. We thought to find some Money in the Trunk, but there was only a soul Shift and 2 or 3 Napkins, which we left there 'till we had searched the other Rooms. We went down to the Colonel, and threaten'd him hard, to make him discover where his Money was; we bound his Hands to his Backside, and going down to the Entry, at the Foot of the Stairs, I saw Blackwell buttoning up his Breeches, and the Maid lying with her Coats up. God damn you for a Rogue, says I, you ought to think of something else, at such a time as this. Brown told me, he had found nothing below but seven Tea-spoons. He hit the Colonel on the Head, and putting a Case-knife to his Throat, said, Let's kill him! I swore he should not, for it was enough to rob him, and I would never be concern'd in Murder. And the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050028"/> Maid said to him, Don't kill my Master, rather kill me. In a Back-room we found some Wine; and Brown said, there were some Ribs of Lamb below. We sat down, and eat and drank what we thought fit, and then going to get our Goods together, we happen'd to see a little Closet; says Brown, I'll be damn'd if his Money is not there. But upon search, we found only a pair of Pistols, and a Silver-hilted Sword with a Green-belt - I think it was Green; says Brown, these will be of Service to us, and so we took them. We pack'd up what we had got, in several Bundles, and went to see how the Colonel and his Maid did. By the Way we spy'd a Cupboard. with some Tea and Coffee in it. Says Brown, My Wife drinks Tea, and I'll take this for her. Then each Man taking his Bundle, I went out first, and left them to lock the Door. And Brown, when he came to me told me, that he had lock'd it, but whether he did or no, I cannot tell. We went into the Fields, and thinking it was too soon to venture into London, we sat down upon our Bundles, and staid till we thought the Watch were gone off. Then we parted, Blackwell and I went to the Water-side, and took a Boat to Pepper-Alley, and walked from thence to White's, at the Grainge, by six in the Morning. I knock'd at the Door, Brown's Wife look'd out; I told her, her Husband was coming, and while I was speaking, he and Whitlock came to the Door. White got up, and draw'd us two Pots of Beer; I shew'd him the Tea, and said, Is not this good Tea? We have had good luck to Night ; for he thought we dealt in Run Tea and Brandy. His Wife, my Wife, Brown's Wife, and we all Breakfasted together with this Tea ; they said it was very good, and they had never drank better. After Breakfast, we shar'd the Goods, Blackwell had six Shirts, and two Shirts, for his Share of the Linen, and he sold his Share of the Silks to me, and Whitlock, and Brown, for 14 s. a-piece. I and the two Prisoners left him, and went to sell the Plate to

            , at the Ship Alehouse, in the Old-baily ; Whitlock staid at the Cock, in the Old-Baily, and only I and Brown went to Bodenham's, for I knew Bodenham would be scrupulous of buying the Plate, if we all three went together; Well, says Bodenham, have you got any thing for me? Yes, says I, Here's a gold Watch. He look'd on it, 'Tis very old, and worn, says he, What's the Price? I told him sixteen Guineas. It is not worth near that Money, said he, for I must get something by it, and you know how things are as well as I. At last we agreed for eight Guineas. He ask'd us, what we had got else? Then he took us into a little Room, where he Tutors his Watches; he weigh'd it, said there was eighty Ounces, and ask'd us, what we must have? Says I, 4 s. 6 d. an Ounce, you know what you use to give.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to say so?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Because I had sold him Plate before. At last he agreed to give us 24 l. for the Watch and Plate all together, and we took it, because we knew not where else to dispose of it. He did not pay us directly, but said, we must stay an Hour; he call'd a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050029"/> Coach, took the Plate with him, and in about an Hour return'd, and paid us the Money: But, says he, I have had a hard Bargain, and when you come again, you must use me better. So to make him amends, I gave him a silver Buckle, set with Bristol Stones; we drank a 3 s. Bowl of Punch, when that was empty, we call'd upon Whitlock at the Cock, and went back together to White's, where we found Blackwell. We shar'd the Money, 6 l. a-piece, and I call'd for some Beer, Damn you, says Blackwell, let's have some Punch; White brought a 3 s. Bowl; it was then about four a Clock. When we had drank it out, Damn you, says Blackwell, I must go over the Water, but I'll come again; but we never saw him more. About two Weeks after, I and my Wife went to Bodenbam's, with this Mourning Ring; he said it was very light, and he could not afford to give us above 5 s. for it, and we took the Money.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the Pistols?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. We kept them for our own Use.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you those Pistols when you were taken?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How were you apprehended?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I and the two Prisoners took Horse at the White-Horse-Inn, in Westminster, about seven in the Morning (I forgot the Day of the Month, but it's within these three Weeks) we rode directly to Fulham, over the new Bridge to Putney, so to Kingston-Bridge, and thro' Hampton-Court, to Stains, where we din'd. There a Man, who knew Whitlock, happening to come in, Damn me, says Whitlock, we shall be blown if we stay here abouts, for this Fellow knew me when I was try'd in the Country. Upon this, we alter'd our Design, which was to rob Whitlock's Uncle. We rid to Black-River - or Black-Water, I don't know which you call it - We met a Man on Banstead-Heath, says Brown, Let's tune him. No, says I, our Horses are tir'd, and we shall lose our Night's Rest. We put in at the Swan, in a little Town, where we lay; in the Morning we went to the next Market-Town, drank there, rid thro', and return'd in the Evening to meet the Farmers as they came from Market; but we got only a pair of silver Buckles: We proceeded to Farnham, lay there, and next Day went for Guilford; we intended to take the Farmers as they return'd from thence in the Evening, but while we were in Town, Brown said, he was afraid some Body would know his Mare, and so we should be blown. So we went to Godlirnan (Godalrnin) where we baited, and coming out of our Inn in the Evening we met a Man, who ask'd us which way we were going? We said, for London, and he pass'd us. I'll be damn'd, says Brown, if this Man has not got Money ; we look'd after him, and saw him upon his Knees, we thought (as it prov'd) he was tying his Money in the Tail of his Shirt, Brown follow'd with this other Pistol, and stopp'd him, the Man, who was a stout Fellow, seiz'd the Pistol, struggled with Brown, and run off; but we came up with him again, took two Bags, in which was about 6 l. from him, and then ty'd him, and rode towards Guilford, but fearing to be pursu'd, we turn'd up a Bye-road, and passing by the Green-Man, we saw two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050030"/> Men drinking at the Door. We rode a quarter of a Mile, and waited for them; when they came up, we stopp'd them, bound their Hands behind them, took 21 Guineas from one, and 1 Guinea, a Knife, and a Tobacco-box from the other. A little farther we met a Butcher's Boy, from whom Whitlock took a few Half-pence, and a silver Buckle, which he had in a Bag, and then we rode on for London. But before we got to Kingston our Horses tir'd; mine, indeed, was in a much better Condition, for I had chang'd Horses with one of the Countrymen we had robb'd. However, before we enter'd Kingston Town, we turn'd our Horses all loose in a Turnip-field, and went to the Bell, and enquir'd for a Waterman; the People said, they believ'd we should hardly find a Waterman that would go so late; but at last a Woman brought one to us, who offer'd to go for 6 s. we agreed for 5 s. and to find him Beer and Brandy. We went into his Boat, lay upon the Straw, and cover'd ourselves with the Tilt; we soon fell asleep, and slept 'till we came to Putney, when two Boats clapp'd along-side of us, and some Men jump'd directly into our Boat, and took us napping. I ask'd for the Constable, surrender'd myself, was carry'd before my Lord Palmerston, examin'd, and made an Evidence.</p>
               <p>Col. des Romaine. On the 25th of October, about eight at Night, I heard somebody knock; my Maid, who was below, not going to the Door, I took a Candle and went myself; as soon as I had open'd it, a Man rush'd in upon me, seiz'd me by the Shoulder, and swore, if I made a Noise he'd shoot me dead; he was follow'd by three more, one of whom struck me on the Head with a Cutlace, I cry'd Murder! Help! and call'd to my Maid, Veron Curtis - Veron call my Men! bid 'em bring my Pistols, in hopes to have made the Russians believe I had Men in the House, but they did not regard it. Damn him, says one, beat his Brains out; and presently I receiv'd a Blow on my Head with the Butt-end of a Pistol; the Blood follow'd a-pace, and I fell to the Ground. They rissed me; took a gold Watch out of my Pocket; I lost a Ring from my Finger, but, being in a Surprize, I don't know how it went. I had in my left Fob fix Guineas and a half, in a Purse, which I thrust under the Matt by the Door. They brought my Breeches down to my Knees, to search me, and took away some Silver, I can't say how much, but I believe there might be 15 or 16 s. They ty'd my Hands behind me, and two of them dragg'd me up Stairs, another holding me by the Shoulder, with a Pistol in his Hand, to make me shew them where my Money was - They bid me be hush, or they'd shoot me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they all three stay in your Room above?</p>
               <p>Colonel. I think so - I think one held me, and two search'd the Room. They first open'd a Trunk with a double Cover; there was a Box in it with Plate; they took the Box out, but did not open the upper Cover, within which I had 45 Guineas and a half. I still deny'd telling them where my Money was, in hopes they would not find it; upon which they again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050031"/> struck me on the Head with a Pistol - They open'd a Press, and threw some Things out; they took two Pistols out of the Closet - these are the same - and a silver hilted Sword with a green Belt. One of them said he'd break the Hilt off, but another said, No, there was no need. They carry'd me into another Room, where they broke open another Press, but I did not see what they took out of it. Then they made me go down with them, and at the Foot of the Stairs I saw my Maid sitting on the Ground, with part of her Coats up, and a Man rising from her, and putting up his Breeches. They ty'd my Hands so hard to my Back as put me to great Pain. They plac'd me by the Maid; put a Napkin and the Maid's Petticoat over my Head, so that I was almost stifled - Some of them went into the Parlour, and up Stairs - One, coming down again, gave me several Strokes, and said, O you old Rogue, you said you had no Money! Another laid his Hand on my Head, and put something under the Petticoat, which I thought was a Hanger, but Mitchell says it was this Knife.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes, this is the Knife, and it was Whitlock that put it under the Petticoat.</p>
               <p>Colonel. I begg'd them to loosen my Wrists, and thought one of them was going to do so, but he only took the Buttons out of my Sleeves. As my Head was cover'd, I could indeed hear them walk about, and speak to the Maid, but could not distinguish what they said. I remain'd thus in the greatest Misery 'till three in the Morning, when hearing no Noise, I told the Maid I believ'd they were gone. She said, Hush! don't make a Noise! they are not gone yet. They certainly are, says I, have not you the Use of your Fingers? She said, she believ'd she had. I bid her see if she could not untie my Hands. She said, her own Hands were not quite at Liberty, but she would try what she could do; and so she did, but it was near a quarter of an Hour before she could loosen the Cord. But, Sir, says she, for God's sake don't stir yet, for I am afraid they are not gone; God has preserv'd your Life hitherto, and why will you run the Hazard of losing it at last? However, as I believ'd they were gone, I went into the Passage, and saw a Light in the Fore-Room, but nobody was there. I found the Door drawn to, but not lock'd, and the Key was left on the Rail without Side. I bolted the Door, and desir'd her to call for Help, but she said, she did not dare go yet, for fear they should kill her. I went myself to a Closet-Window, call'd to a Gardener, and told him what had happen'd; he promis'd to come, but did not, tho' I call'd him again. The Maid was fearful of being left alone, and follow'd me about the House, wherever I went.</p>
               <p>Court. Look on the Prisoners, Sir, - Do you know either of 'em?</p>
               <p>Colonel. I did not then know either of them, but, on Recollection, I believe Brown was the Man who held me - I can't say that I remember any thing of the other. I saw but four in all, and for the other three, I mostly saw their Backs - two of them went before me with a Candle.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050032"/>Brown. You say I was up Stairs - Pray ask Mitchell whether I went up or not?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. You were sometimes up, and sometimes down - Sometimes you held the Colonel by the Shoulder, and sometimes you gave him a Knock with a Pistol.</p>

            . Between eight and nine somebody knock'd, as my Master said, tho' I did not hear it, but I heard the Dog bark, and listening, heard the Door open, and presently my Master cry'd out Murder! come up, Veron, and call the Men. I went up, and found him lying in the Entry all over in a goar Blood, with four Men about him. I know Whitlock - he in the grey Waistcoat, was one of them. Another of them, who was a tall Man, stept up to me, took me by the Hand, and swore, if I spoke a Word he'd shoot me thro' the Head; Whitlock had a naked Hanger in his Hand, and he (I think it was he) ask'd me where the Plate was? I told him I was a new Servant, and knew of no more than six Spoons and Forks that were in the Kitchen. They rifled my Master, and ty'd my Hands behind me, and three of them took him up Stairs. The tall Man staid below, and ask'd me where the Candles were? I told him, in the Kitchen; and if he would let me have my Hands loose, I would fetch some. No, he would not do that, but carry'd me down, and made me shew him where they were. He took some, and lighted one at the Fire, and taking me up again, carry'd me into the Parlour, where he set me in a Chair, with my Hands ty'd behind me, and abus'd me in a gross Manner. Whitlock afterwards came down, and us'd me as ill as the other had done - I saw but four Men in all.</p>
               <p>- Court. What do you know of their Eating and drinking?</p>
               <p>Curtis. I had dress'd a Neck of Mutton, part of it was left. There were three Bricks in the House, and a Pound of Butter; they eat the Mutton, and best part of the Butter, and two Quartern-Bricks; and one of them said, he'd go and carry a Bottle to the Man that held their Horses.</p>
               <p>Whitlock. Did I go up?</p>
               <p>Curtis. I think they all went up, but the tall Man, who took hold of me first; and when Whitlock came down, he and the tall Man kept me Prisoner in the Room by Turns.</p>
               <p>Whitlock. You said I seiz'd you first.</p>
               <p>Curtis. No; the tall Man seiz'd me, and Whitlock came up with a naked Hanger, and swore if I would not discover where the Plate was, I should be shot. A quilted Petticoat that I had been working, was put-over my Master's Head, and I had a white Handkerchief round my Head. Whitlock said, the best Way would be to kill the Master, and gag the Maid, and he took a Knife to cut my Master's Throat. For God's sake, says I, don't kill my Master, but rather kill me; and the others preventing him, Why then, God damn them, says he, gag them both down close.</p>
               <p>Brown. Did not you deny me when I was brought to Newgate?</p>
               <p>Curtis. It was duskish then, and I could not see very well, but as soon as I had a Candle, I said to the best of my Knowledge you was one of the Men I saw in the Entry when I first came up.</p>

Brown ask'd me to go out with them, and said, we should never want Money afterwards. I told him, No; for tho' I had seen a great deal of the World, I was now got into another Way.

               <p>Court. Do you remember you drank Tea at any time when the Prisoners, and Mitchell, and another were in Company with you at your House?</p>

               <p>Brown's Defence.</p>
               <p>Brown. While I liv'd at Paddington, Mitchell came to me, and said, he was in an Information, and begg'd me to let him stay with me, and he staid three or four Days; but there was a good 'Squire that liv'd next Door, and his Servants seeing Mitchell, they told me, the 'Squire was angry that I let such a loose Fellow lodge with me; I acquainted Mitchell with it, and he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050034"/> if I'd lend him a Great coat, he'd go off, and so he did. In two or three Weeks after, I went and lodged at White's, and Mitchell lodg'd there at the same time; He was in a great deal of Trouble, and said, he wished I would go to such and such Places. I told him, I had stain'd my Character already, and did not care to bring my self into a Scrape again. He told me, he had been in a great many Concerns himself, and if he was taken, he was sure to be a dead Man, and therefore he would swear any Man's Life away to save his own, for he did not care who he was an Evidence against.</p>

            . On Thursday Night the 25th of October, Will. Brown, Jo. Whitlock, Will. Blackwell, and I broke Colonel Romaine's House at Paddington, and stole a gold Watch, a large Parcel of Plate, and other Things, of which Brown and Whitlock were convicted here last Wednesday. On Friday October 26 (the Day after the Fact)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050036"/> Brown and Whitlock, and I went from Mr. White's in Grainge-road, near Newington-butts, with the gold Watch and the Plate, to the Cock in the Old-Baily, where we left Whitlock, and then Brown and I went with the Goods to the Prisoner's House, the ship in the Old-Baily. We left Whitlock, because I knew the Prisoner would be scrupulous of dealing with so many at a time.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you were acquainted with the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes, I had dealt with him several times before, and especially in Watches that I had stole out of Ships in the River; and he used to say, those were the safest Goods to deal in, because the Owners were going to Sea, and could seldom stay long enough to prosecute; so that he was in no Danger on that Account; and he always desir'd me to be true to him, and not bring him into any Trouble - And so, as I was saying, Brown and I went to his House at the Ship, and turn'd into a little Box on the left Hand, where he presently came to us, and ask'd if we had got any Thing for him? Yes, says I, We have a gold Watch - shew it him, Brown. So the Watch was produc'd, and I told him the Price was 16 Guineas. 16 Guineas? says he, I can't afford near that Money; 'tis very old; the Gold is but thin, and the Watch is worth but little more than the Gold weights. We agreed to take eight Guineas. He ask'd me what else we had got? I told him some Plate; we shew'd it him; he took us into a little private Room, where he Doctors his Watches, and weigh'd it - There was 3 silver Salts - We stole 4, but we sold but 3 to him - 12 silver Forks, 6 Knives with silver Handles, and 1 little Knife with a silver Handle, 13 silver Spoons, 1 large silver soop Spoon, and a silver Hilt of a Sword. These are all I remember we carry'd at that Time; and as for the tea Spoons, the Women shar'd them among themselves. He weigh'd the Plate, and said there was 80 Ounces. We trusted to him for that, for we did not understand the Weights.</p>
               <p>Then the Clerk of the Arraigns read the Record of the Conviction of Brown and Whitlock, by which it appear'd that all these Goods (among others) were stolen by them out of Colonel des Romaine's House.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. The Prisoner was a little suspicious of Brown, because he was a new Face. I know, says he to me, I can trust you well enough, but I don't know whether I can trust that other Man. O ! says I, Brown is a very honest Fellow - he has been transported. Has he, Faith? says the Prisoner, nay then there's no Danger - we are all right! - well, what must I give you for this Plate? You know the Price, says I, what you always give - 4 s. 6 d. and Ounce. Then, says he, the Plate and the Watch together comes to just 24 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you cast it up?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No, we trusted to his Reckoning, as well as to his Weights. He bid us go in and take a 3 s. Bowl of Punch, and he'd bring us the Money before it was out. He call'd a Coach, and took the Plate with him, and in about an Hour came back, drank Punch with us, and paid us 24 l. Now, says he, I hope you'll be true, and bring me into no Trouble - I have had a Bargain of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050037"/> this! - I question whether I shall make my Money on't again - You must use me better next time. He complain'd so much of hard Dealing, that I took out of my Pocket a silver Buckle set with Bristol Stones, and made him a Present of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Look on that Buckle.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Aye, this is the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you get it?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. We took it among the other Things we found in Col. Romaine's House - The Prisoner having paid us the Money, we call'd upon Whitlock at the Cock, and all three went back to Whtie's, where we shar'd the Money with Long Will. who was concern'd with us in the Fact. About a Fortnight after this, I and my Wife went to the Prisoner's, and sold him a gold Mourning-ring, it had the Name of Ann des Romaine engrav'd on the Out-side of it, he gave us a Crown for it; and this too we took from Colonel Romaine's - The Prisoner told me he had been try'd (or taken up) once or twice, but he knew how to get such things off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were all the Knives sold to me, on the Friday, with the rest of the Plate?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were the Knives out of the Handles ?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I go into the little Place with you,</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was 24 l. all the Money that was given?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes - I sold it for 4 s. 6 d. an Ounce, and you said it weigh'd 80 Ounces.</p>
               <p>Court. Eighty Ounces at 4s. 6 d. and 8 l. for the Watch, comes to more than 24l.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I don't know as to that, but I am sure we had not a Farthing more of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not you at my House, from the time you sold the Plate, to the time you brought the Mourning-ring?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes, I was with Whitlock when he came to you to get his Watch mended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. But did not you come on the Saturday (the very Day after you sold me the Plate) and receive 3 l. more?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No, I receiv'd but 24 l. on Friday, and not a Farthing afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Plate I bought on Friday, weigh'd but 75 Ounces, for the Knife-handles were not weigh'd then, because I had no Fire, and could not take the Knives out. The Watch was worth no more than the Gold weigh'd, and I allow'd but 7 l. for it, and so the Watch and Plate came to 24 l. 12 s. but they insisted upon 25 l. because it was even Money, and 25 l. I paid them that Day, and 3 l. the next Day for the Handles.</p>
               <p>Court. But 24 l. 12 s. was more than the Watch and 75 Ounces of Plate, came to, at your Price.</p>

            . On the 21st of November, by my Lord Mayor's Order, I went with Justice Deveil, and Col. des Romaine, to search the Prisoner's House. The Justice read a Paper to the Prisoner, in which all the Goods the Colonel had lost, were distinctly mentioned, and the Prisoner positively deny'd that he had had any such Goods in his House -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050038"/> I found this Buckle in a Drawer, and took it out, and laid it upon a Table. Going back to my Lord Mayor's, I ask'd Mitchell, if he knew any thing of such a Buckle? he said, Yes. I return'd to the Prisoner's House, to fetch it, but it was remov'd, I ask'd his Wife where it was, she said, she believ'd we had taken it with us; but I pretending if she would help me to it, I could procure her Husband to be admitted to Bail, she took it out of a Drawer, and gave it me.</p>

            . I went with my Husband, when he sold this Mourning-ring to the Prisoner, I ask'd the Prisoner if he could help me to a Ring for my own wearing, he said he could have done it, if I had come but an Hoursooner, for he had just parted with a little Diamond-ring, that would have come cheap, and he would have sold it me for 3 or 4 Shillings profit, because he got by my Husband. I told him I did not care to wear that Mourning Ring, because I knew how it was come by.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that in his hearing?</p>
               <p>Phillis. Yes, and my Husband told him, it was got with the rest of the Things at Paddington; we drank 18 Penny worth of Punch, and had some roast Veal from the Cook's for dinner.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I might say so to the Prisoner, but I can't remember positively whether I did or no - I know they were talking about the Ring when I went to fetch the 6 Pennyworth of roast Veal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I ask if the Ring was stole?</p>
               <p>Phillis. I don't remember such a Question.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray, my Lord, let her be examin'd a-part. [Then Ralph Mitchell withdrew.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where was the Ring weigh'd?</p>
               <p>Phillis. It was not weigh'd at all that I saw; you gave 5 s. for it, and I gave you 2 Guineas worth of Silver for 2 Guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray ask her how long she has been marry'd?</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot ask her that. [Then her Husband was call'd in again.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did your Wife see the Ring weigh'd?</p>
               <p>R. Mitchell. I don't know that it was weigh'd at all.</p>
               <p>Court. He agrees with his Wife.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to Mitchell. Did not Brown sell me some Buttons and a Watch that Day you were marry'd, which was 3 Days before you were taken?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I don't know; I was gone for the Veal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I ask'd if the Watch was honestly come by, and if no House was broke open? for otherwise I would not buy it for the World; and you said that Brown brought the Watch from Dover.</p>
               <p>Mitchell, I said the Watch came off the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050039"/> Water; and you said you was not afraid to buy such Watches, because there was seldom any Prosecutions on those Accounts - You and I have often had Dealings together.</p>

               <p>Court. Any Buckles?</p>
               <p>Colonel. A silver Buckle set with Bristol Stones.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose Property was that?</p>
               <p>Colonel. This Lady (Lucy Montreasure's) I bought it for her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no private Room. The Place I carry'd them into was the Shop where I keep my Watches.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. But there were Curtains to the Window, and he said, Draw the Curtains and then nobody can see us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I weigh'd the Gold of the Watch, and told them it weigh'd but 7l. 10s. as for the Inside (as it was a large old Watch) it was not worth above 15 or 16 s. When they shew'd me the Box of Plate, I said, I hoped no House had been broke open, and if there had, I would not meddle with it for the World, for I had often been in Trouble. There was no Arms nor Cypher on the Plate. There was not above 1 third of it Sterling. It weigh'd 75 Ounces, and, with the Watch, came to 24 l. 12 s. They insisted on 25 l. which I paid them. When Mitchell went out, Brown told me he brought it from Dover, to sell for a Person there.

               <p>Court. And could not you read the Name on the Ring?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Its possible I might read Ann des Romaine upon it, and yet might think nothing of the Robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. But was not the Story of Col. Romaine's Loss very strong then?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, it was so; and I had heard much Talk about it, but really I did not think of it when I bought the Goods.</p>
               <p>Juryman. Had not you one of the Warnings that were given out on this Occasion? - for its common to send<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050040"/> them to Watchmakers, as well as to Goldsmiths.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can't tell but I might have had seen an Advertisement in the House, but I can't remember that I had seen it, or if I had seen it I had forgot the Particulars - O here is my Girl! she has brought the Book I sent for - This is the Book where I set down what I buy -</p>
               <p>Court. This Book is no Evidence, but you may refresh your Memory with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is - 'Oct. 26. Bought 75 ' Ounces of old Silver, and an old gold ' Watch, large Size; the Watch for 7l. ' and the Silver for 18l. 12s.'</p>

            . I fell into the Prisoner's Company the first Day that I went into the Country - It was at the Two Brewers at Winchmore-hill, where I call'd for half a Pint of Two-penny, and having drank it, was going away, when the Prisoner and one Hill came to the Door with a Brace of Greyhounds, and a Bob-tail Dog. Says I, These Dogs look as if they would run well; and upon saying so, the Prisoner drank to me - We had 3 Pots together, they paid for 2, and I for 1. Then the Prisoner, who had 3 Horse in the Yard, mounted, and rid off; and Hill told me, if I had a Mind to see the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050041"/> Dogs run, I might, in a little Time, and not far off. I said, if I could see it in half an Hour, I should be very willing; I went with him; we came up with the Prisoner, and passing by an Alehouse, says I, Let's have a Pot here. No, says the Prisoner, that's a House the Keepers use. This gave me the first Suspicion of their being upon an ill Design. We pass'd a great white Gate that look'd like a Coach-way, and 10 or 12 Yards beyond, I saw the Park-pales. I hope, says I, you are not going in here, for I never was in any such Affair in my Life, and would not be concern'd for 100l. But I could not tell what to do, for it was dark, and I was a Stranger, and did not know my Way back. The Prisoner took 2 Slips [made 2 Nooses] to fasten the 2 Greyhounds, and bidding me hold 'em, he jump'd over the Pales, and he within and Hill without, broke 2 of 'em down, and they both went into the Park, and the Dogs run after, for I was not able to hold 'em. They came back in 2 Hours, and brought out 2 Deer; I was a white fallow Deer, and the other a red. Hill went in again, and the Prisoner desir'd me to help load 'em; he cut their Heads off, and we put the Bodies into Sacks, and so ty'd them upon the Horse; but my Heart ached all the while. I thought they were very tedious about every thing they did, and wonder'd they made no more haste - The Prisoner said, he knew by the Bite which Dog it was that kill'd the Deer - At last Hill came out again with a live Pawn in his Arms, and we went away together - I ask'd them the Way to Edmonton; they directed me, and so we parted, and I never got the Value of a Farthing from them. I went to Work next Day at Winchmore-hill, but I was so uneasy, that I could hardly eat or drink, or sleep for a Fortnight afterward - I have been threaten'd to be shot if I appear'd as an Evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were the Dogs mine?</p>
               <p>Burgess. I thought so - you call'd them by their Names; and on the 6th of Feb. the Friday before I was taken, I saw you with the same Dogs, and 2 Deer before you, going to London.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Colour were the Dogs?</p>
               <p>Burgess. Liver-colour and White, and the Bob-tail Dog was red.</p>

            . Coming from beyond Temple-Bar, at Night, I enquir'd my Way to White-Friars-Stairs, a Man who had two Women with him, told me, I was past the Stairs, and must turn down such an Alley. I went as he directed, and he and the Women follow'd, and ask'd me to drink a Dram. I told them, I had no dram Money. He said I was welcome whether I had or no, for it should cost me nothing. He went into a House, he call'd for two Quaterns, paid a Shilling, and left us. The Prisoner then came up to me, and said, What do you call for? I told her I had no Money to spend. Sure, says she, you won't trouble the House for nothing? With much Importunity I gave her 6 d. she laid her Hand on my Thigh, and pull'd my Watch out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you charge the other Woman for this?</p>
               <p>Gallimore. The other Woman held me while the Prisoner got off, and therefore I charged the other Woman. I was beat and abus'd there, 'till my Face run down with Blood, and at the same time I lost my other Goods, which were in a Bundle. The Constable came, and I and the other Woman (Ann Castle) were sent to Woodstreet-Compter. The Prisoner came to me there in another Dress, and desir'd me to be easy ; I told her, perhaps I might, if I had my Goods again ; and in a little time they were all sent to me.</p>

And who must pay me? says I. Why, says he, the Gentleman will. I found Mr. Gallimore and the Constable there, and the Constable said, I'll be hang'd if here are not the Things; they open'd the Bundle, and there was a Watch and some Linen in it. I went from thence and saw the Man who sent me, going into the Compter - It seems, he's one of the Runners there - I ask'd him for my Money, but he deny'd that he sent me, and he is run away since.</p>

             (Mary Wright's Son) but could not be positive that he was concern'd with them, and that as soon as she could find out their Lodgings, she would give me Notice. Accordingly last Tuesday, by her Directions, I took Mr. Burly and Mr. Froud with me, and went to an Alehouse in Little St. Martin's-Street, by Leicester-Fields; we sent the Girl at the Alehouse to the Prisoner's Lodgings, under pretence of enquiring for a Pot, to see if they were at home. The Girl brought us Word they were. I sent Burly and Froud up Stairs, placed another to watch at the Door, and went my self into the Yard, to see if any Moulds should be thrown out at Window. But believing they were taken by the Noise I heard above, I ran up. We ty'd them, and then begun to search; the first thing I took Notice of, was a bad Six-pence, some Chalk, and Brush lying in the Window, for we found no bad Money upon their Persons; Looking towards the Fire-side, I saw a little Trunk. I ask'd the Prisoner, Knight, What was in it? He said, he could not tell. I drew the Nails and open'd it, and found these pair of Chalk-Molds, which have the Impression of a Six-pence, the Head on one side, and the Reverse on the other: This Paper, in which were these Six-pences nfinish'd, not so much as the Tops being cut off : This little Box with these 18 bad Shilings in: it This Bag, with about 40 bad Shillings, and Six-pences, 3 bad half Crowns, and some Pieces of Metal; all these, and this Crucible, which is to melt Metal in, were found in this Trunk - Upon searching Knight farther, there was found in his Pocket this Key, which upon Trial open'd this Trunk.</p>
               <p>Knight. That is the Key of the Trunk where my Linen is.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoners eight Years, but never was concern'd with them till July last was 12 Month, when one Sunday, Elizabeth came to my Lodging, and ask'd me to go out with her next Day, but said nothing upon what Account. I agreed, she came on Monday, between 2 and 3 in the Afternoon. We went out together. Crossing Lincoln's- inn -fields, she gave me 6 d. (I thought it was a good one) to buy some Gingerbread; the Man said it was not. I told her of it; she curs'd me for a Fool ; gave me another to fetch a Pennyworth of Silk; I pass'd it, and brought her the Change. You Fool you, says she, you may do this as well as my Daughter Molly, if you'll give your Mind to it, and you shall have half what you get. After this I put off several in the same Manner, and we always shar'd whatever Goods I bought, and the Change out of the bad Money. They then lodg'd at Mrs. Mason's, a Chandler, against the Chequer Alehouse in <placeName id="t17331205-65-crimeloc292">King's-street</placeName>

Her Daughter, Mary, at the same Time cut off the Tails with a Pair of Scissars, scrap'd the Edges round with a Knife, and then fil'd them.

I said to my self, If ever I find 'em in the Kingdom, I'll give the King an Account; and 3 or 4 Months ago I was inform'd they were come to London. The Mother sent for me, in the Name of a Gentleman, to come to Mr. Garvey's, at the Bull-head in Prince's-street; when I came to her, she said she was sorry to hear of my Trouble. About 5 Weeks ago I inform'd Mr. Ashton of this, and about a Month ago I told Mr. North, and Mr. North assur'd me there was no Reward to be given in such Cases. I made it my Business to enquire out their Lodging, and having found it, I sent Word to Mr. North last Tuesday, and he came and took them.</p>
