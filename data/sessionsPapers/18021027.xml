I asked her what was her business, she told me she came from Mrs. Peppercorn, in Newgate-market, who wished to know what I had a quarter with a little girl; I said, if she would give me her mistress's address I would wait of her; she said I had better do so; she said her mistress did not live in the market, but in lodgings, which she described very particularly, as also the situation of the shop; she then bid me good morning; she had at that time a bundle in her apron; she had neither bonnet nor cloak on; I then went to Mrs. Peppercorn, but she knew nothing of it; I afterwards went to the prisoner's apartment, and saw her there; there was a gown and an apron found, which I shall know when they are produced; the constable has them.(William Shepherd, a constable, produced the property that he had found in the prisoner's apartment.)(Mary Britchard, the wife of the prosecutor, identified the gown and the apron.)</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that gown and apron? A. I suppose the gown about 4s. and the apron 3d.</p>

               <p>Q. With his hat on? - A. Yes; I said, pardon me, sir, what have you there; he said, it is only the string of my hat; whether in my hurry I knocked his hat off, or whether it came off by touching the band, I cannot say, but the hat fell, and I think the prisoner caught it, for it did not fall to the ground; I then saw a gown in the crown of his hat; I said, that is my gown; he then threw it on the bed in the other room; the door which goes out of one into the other was open: he said, I am a man of honour, and a gentleman, you cannot suppose a person of my appearance would be guilty of taking a gown, I merely did it out of a hit of fun; I then laid hold of him, and brought him down stairs, and when he was on the first floor landing, he called out, Jack, Jack; the street door was open when he came down; I still had hold of him, and called, stop him, stop him; a little girl who was in the house hearing me scream, came up from the kitchen; she screamed, and at that time the prisoner broke from me, and went out; a young man, of the name of Joseph Simpson, was standing at the door; I said, stop him, stop him, he has stole my gown; he then went after him; the prisoner was brought back by Simpson in about five minutes, and then he was taken to Marlborough-street; I am sure the prisoner is the same man; I saw nothing more of the elderly man.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the room was your gown lying? - A. In a drawer belonging to the wardrobe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270012"/>in the back room of the second floor, I had seen it there on the Sunday morning, this was on the Monday; it is a Japan Muslin gown.

             sworn. - I am a bricklayer, I was employed at Mr. Renaud's; I was standing at the door, and saw an elderly man ran out of the house; about two minutes after the prisoner came to the door, and the lady said, stop him; I was going to stop him, and he went back to the lady, and the lady directly laid hold of him; the elderly man was then outside the door; the prisoner said, Jack, Jack; the man said, d - n you, and immediately ran away; the prisoner then got away from the lady; he got a few yards off, between a run and a walk; the lady desired me to run after him, for he had stole her gown; I immediately ran after him, I ran into Bond-street, and there I saw a mob before Mr. Dalby's, a silversmith; directly that I went up to the door, the prisoner came out, clapped me on the back, and said, I will go back with you to the lady myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him? - A. No; I immediately laid of him, and when he got into Brook-street, he said, I will go and fetch the other man, he has got the gown; I said, never mind, I will take you first, and fetch the other man afterwards; I took him to the lady's house, and from there we took him to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I came down stairs with the gown in my hand, it was lying on the bed; the lady said, I was going to stealher gown; she seemed very timid and frightened; I told her she need be under no apprehension of my taking it, it was not my intention; I then threw it on the bed in the first floor, and told her not to be a alarmed; I desired her to sit down, and be perfectly reconciled; I went down stairs, supposing she was perfectly reconciled, having her gown left there; when I got near the door, the brick layer's boy was standing at the door; the lady immediately followed, and took hold of me by the arm; I stopped a considerable time, and then she called, stop him; she let go my arm, and I was walking on; I went as far as Mr. Dalby's shop; when I went in, Mr. Dalby was very much surprised at seeing such a mob round the door; seeing the bricklayer's boy standing at the door, I came to the door, and told him I should return back with him to the lady very quietly, and I returned back to the lady's house; some people came into the parlour where I was, and they sent for a constable; not finding a constable, they proposed going to a Magistrate, and I was taken to Marlborough-street. <rs id="t18021027-25-verdict137" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You had never seen the person of the man before he ran from you? - A. No; I had not seen him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not lose sight of him turning the corners? - A. I was within fifteen or twenty yards from him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The person Mr. Tilden pursued was stopped? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prisoner you cannot swear? - A. No. (The book produced and identified).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been to Newgate-market, and just by King-street there was a cry of stop thief; I dropped my piece of meat, which I had in my hand, by the pushing of the people, and away I run as fast as any of them; upon which they took me, and said I was the thief.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who first gave him a good character; but upon the cross-examination of Mr. Gurney, three acknowledged he had been transported. <rs id="t18021027-43-verdict241" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - I know Mr. Mansell, a cheesemonger, in Charles-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270023"/>street, Westminster: In September last, I was in his shop, and saw several books on the counter, amongst them a Bible; I examined it, and found a very curious edition, not according to the one we use in the church; it was printed according to Mr. Reeves's from of the Bible; I did not look much at it, as I had not time to examine it; I saw also, Apion, a Greek book, the covers were all off; it was perfect, and a very good edition; there was a plate also, but rather damaged; Testaments in various languages, one in the Malay language, with a Dutch preface, which, not understanding the language I rejected, there was a Thucidides, in fragments, there were seven altogether, and the Malay Testament, which had Dr. Busby's name in it; Mr. Mansell gave them to me, but a suspicion arose in my mind, and I sent them to Mr. Ginger's to be bound, he serves Westminster school, Welch was his servant, and was sometimes employed by the master of the school to put the library to rights; Dr. Vincent was then master, but is now dean; the books were then in his possession, as master; after the books were sent to be bound, on Saturday, we went again to Masell's, and found another book, Gage's Survey of the West-Indies, which had marks on it, that Welch immediately swore to.</p>

Mr. Ward, to be rebound; I took particular notice of the Plato, but did not look further into the books till Saturday morning, when I took up the Testament, and seeing it was the gift of Dr. Busby, I recollected it belonged to the library when I took the catalogue; I examined the others, and found they all belonged to the library, upon which I went to the Rev. Mr. Ward, and acquainted him with my suspicions; we went to Mr. Mansell's, and saw a book with a private mark, which was Gale's Survey of the West Indies, and several fragments of Greek, Latin, Arabic, and other valuable books; the books are here, (the books produced and identified); I know the prisoner, his wife cleans the school out, and he assists at times, by which means he had access to this room.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you live as servant with the prisoner in June last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. State what you know of this transaction? - A. I saw him take Mr. Pedder's gun about five weeks a before I left his house, on the 28th of June; it was about seven or eight in the morning, when I was washing my pots, and putting them up to dry; I saw him take the gun through a hole in the tiling of Mr. Pedder's kitchen; he carried it under his coat, and I said, ah, master, what are you there? he said, hold your tongue, in a very crabbed way, to me; he carried the gun into the room called the double-bedded room, and I saw it and had it several times in my hand; there was an iron plate put on one side where it was split a little, and there was a waxed string round the flint, and some silver very near the flint; I had it in my hand when I was cleaning the room, and I saw it clearly when my master took it, and observed those marks on it then when he was concealing it under his coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When did you first mention the circumstance? - A. I was coming by Mr. Pedder's, and heard him say he had lost his gun; then I said I knew about it; he and his wife were the first I mentioned it to, as they stood at their own door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Were you and Mr. Pedder acquainted much? - A. No; I have been there on errands for my master about three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live at the time you told him? - A. I lodged down the town, and was going up the town on an errand for myself, and crossed over the way, because it was the cleanest walking.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in August? - A. Yes, it was very wet.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say it was very wet on the 25th of August? - A. Yes, it was quite wet.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with Mr. Pedder? - A. His wife, and one of the horse-keepers.</p>
               <p>Q. That was John West? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Lander? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in company with Mr. Pedder? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never did? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in the prisoner's service? - A. Nineteen weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. The stealing of the gun was a very dishonest thing, you knew? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go and tell the baker of it? - A. No; I thought he had given him leave to take it, because he was often with Mr. Pedder, and I believe he asked him to lend it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said he took off two or three tiles, for the purpose of taking the gun out? - A. No; I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Evans? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you never said your master took some tiles off, for the purpose of taking the gun? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you dismissed from the prisoner's service for? - A. For his ill behaviour to me.</p>
               <p>Q. He charged you with stealing something, I believe? - A. He charged me with stealing a bonnet; my mistress said, the cover of a muslin bonnet was her's, though it was given to me by a girl he cohabited with in the house; I was not turned away, but would not stay; there was not a word mentioned about the bonnet till I came down stairs and received my wages.</p>
               <p>Q. You were never charged with stealing any thing else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any soldiers billetted on your master? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not accuse you of stealing the liquor, to regale the soldiers? - A. No; I never wronged him of half a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you seen the prisoner between that time and this? - A. Two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at Brentford before the Justice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to Dr. Glasse, that it was between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, and not six or seven, that he stole the gun? - A. No, I said between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You said you thought Pedder had given him leave to take it? - A. I thought so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270025"/>Q. Were you not surprised when he told you to hold your tongue? - A. It did not strike me at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not surprise you that he put it under his coat for concealment, if he had liberty to take it; did it not strike you as very odd? - A. Yes, to be sure it did; I thought he had stole it then.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Police Office, Queen's-square; On the 8th of October I met the prisoner in Darkhouse-street, Westminster, between nine and ten at night, with a bag on his back; my brother officers stopped him; I laid hold of the bag, and said, what have you got here? he seemed very frightened, and said"nothing;" I said you have soap here, and asked him where he was going with it, and whether he did not live in York-street; he said he did; I thought I knew him, but did not; I asked him how he came by the soap; he was very unwilling to tell; upon which I said he must go to the watchhouse to account for it; going along I asked him where he worked; he said in the City; I said you have robbed your master of this; at first he said no, he had not; he said afterwards he had taken it a bit at a time as he was carrying it to the customers, and begged hard not to be taken to the watch-house, for he had a wife and family; he said he lived in the gallery over St. James's Market; in the morning he was taken to the Magistrate, and I was sent to search his room, and bring down his wife; I searched his room, but found nothing of the fort.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you promise that it would be better for him, or threaten him? - A. No; I neither did so, or heard my brother officers do so.</p>

             sworn. - On the 18th of September the prisoner was brought to the watch-house on suspicion of stealing the tea-spoons; she was detained till Monday, and taken before the Magistrate, where she confessed she had pledged the spoons; the Magistrate gave a summons to Mr. Morritt, where she said she had pawned them; I went to the pawnbroker's with a duplicate for a tea-spoon and a shift, and found the tea-spoon; next morning the prisoner gave me two spoons herself. - (Produces the duplicate and tea-spoon.)</p>
               <p>- MORRITT sworn. - I am a pawnbroker; this is my duplicate; a tea-spoon was pledged with me in the name of Foulkes on the 12th of May; the young man who took it in has left me, and I cannot say who pledged it.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner, at No. 2, Webb-street, on the 18th of September, at night, upon suspicion of stealing a pair of ear-rings, and the spoons; she said, the ear-rings were given her, and as to the spoons, she knew nothing of them; I took her to the watch-house, where I left her. (The spoons were produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutrix lent me spoons at different times, and I pledged many things for her at different times, but I was not to pledge them in her name, least her husband should find it out; she used to get tipsey, and make me so, that I did not know what I did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character. <rs id="t18021027-53-verdict292" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>- TROTT sworn. - I am an officer: On the 28th of September I met the prisoner; he said he wanted to speak to me about a person who had been robbing him of fourteen or fifteen shillings; I asked him the nature of it; he said, he had got to bed to a girl the day before, who had picked his pocket, but he could not swear it; says he, that is not all, I want to have the first pull, for if I don't take her, I am afraid she will take me about halfa-guinea, she says I have robbed her of; I said it was a poor story; when I went to the office I found the prosecutrix waiting to make a complaint, which she did, and described the fathing, that it had a cross and a piece out of the edge; we went in search after him, and found him in Nightingale-lane, and took him to the office, searched him, and found three shillings and sixpence in silver, a quantity of halfpence, and four farthings; I asked the girl if she should know the farthing; she said yes. (Produces the farthing).</p>
               <p>Q. (To Gorman.) Look at that farthing? - A. I am not positive to it; I had such a one, but whether it is the same I cannot say; when I took it I said it was remarkable; I had taken it three or four days before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I got four shillings from the girl, on Monday morning to keep for her; she said, keep that for me; I went out, and on my return, laid down in my own bed; she came up intoxicated; when I awoke she was gone; I opened the door, and saw her coming into Sun-yard; she said, I hear you have lost your money Browne; if I have lost it, I said, I suspect you of it; I put my hand in my pocket, and my money was gone; she said she knew nothing of it, only she had lost half-a-guinea; then she got a warrant against me, fearing I should go first. <rs id="t18021027-59-verdict322" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Hoppe: On Thursday the 21st of October, three men came in, Welch said, he wanted a pair of shoes, I took two pair out of the press, and tried on pair on, which sitted him, but he wanted a more fashionable pair; I went to get him another pair, and Welch came after me, and pointed to a pair of shoes, saying, they would do; when I turned round, I missed the first pair, which I had left in his possession; the third man went out; I looked to see if they had the shoes, and saw them behind M'Leod's back, and saw him push them up to hinder them from falling; I asked Welch where the shoes were, which had sitted him so well, he said, he and given them to somebody, pointing to the apprentice; my master said, M'Leod had them behind his back; he denied it till they were pointed to, and then he produced them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat. Q. Welch came to buy shoes, did he not? - A. I understood so, but I suspected him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether Welch gave them to M'Leod to hold, you cannot say? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from Welch? - A. Standing still, close to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know how far the apprentice was concerned? - A. He knew nothing of it till I mentioned it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had Welch agreed to buy a pair of shoes? - A. No.(

             confirmed the two former witnesses.)(The shoes produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Welch's defence. I went along with M'Leod to buy the shoes, I sitted them on, and they were rather right; I said to M'Leod, hold them, while I sit on another pair, which he did.</p>
               <p>M'Leod's defence. I went with Welch, and the first pair was tight, as he has said, and he gave them me to hold; I was speaking to a man at the door, and kept them in my hand under my coat behind, unthinkingly, while I was talking; they asked for the pair of shoes; I said, what is the matter, and immediately gave them to the master; I have been in his Majesthy's service nine years, and would not disgrace the cloth of a soldier by stealing a pair of shoes.</p>

               <p>Q. When the prisoner received money, he put it down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many 25s. have you paid him? - A. Only once, and that was on the 2d of September, which I recollect, because I have children, and the fair was talked of.</p>

             sworn. - On the 2d of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270035"/>September, I left orders for 25s. to be paid to the baker; I mostly keep this book, (producing it;) but then I said, never mind, let the baker set it down next time; there was another time before that it was not set down; there is only two marks of his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Whose marks are those? - A. The two first are the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose are the others? - A. I put his initials, T N, to it, after he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you forged the prisoner's receipt? - A. No; I put it down to shew Mr. Hutchins, whom I paid it to, as the prisoner was gone away; I paid for the bread I received.</p>
               <p>Q. This book was kept in your hands, not in the hands of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 4th of August, you paid 1l.? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the book forth coming? - A. No; I said I told not find the book, and he should set it down another time.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you told him to put it down the next time he came? - A. No; not till the next time I paid more money.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you see him between the 4th of August and the 2d of September? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him after the 2d of September, for he left his master's service on the 11th? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you write that entry of the 4th of August? - A. Not till after the prisoner had left Mr. Hutchins, and I made them both at once.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any reason for so closely representing the prisoner's signature? - A. Not at all; I did not attempt it, I write sometimes one way, and sometimes another, and the prisoner said he could not write, and said, he would thank me to write it for him the first time, and from that time I marked T N, and know no more about it.</p>
               <p>Q. And after his having told you he could not write, yet he wrote T N twice, and you wrote as much like his as you could? - A. No; I wrote it with no other intention than to shew Mr. Hutchins who I had paid the money to, as I had paid him once a month, and I did not know it was not paid, till Mr. Hutchins sent for me.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner asked you to bring a bottle or can, and he would fill it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That not being a wrong thing you did it? - A. I thougth it was no harm his giving me the liquor; it was not in my charge; he chose to give it to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you get the can? - A. From under the stairs of the guard-house; I don't know how it came there; I saw it there.</p>

             sworn. - I am a weaver, and was passing Valentine, who lives next door but one to me, on the night of the 27th of September; he called out stop thief; I said, have you been robbed; he said, yes, but I saw no other person; he asked me to go in pursuit of the prisoner; I did, and we went to the prisoner's lodging in Webb-square, but did not find him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. The place where the prosecutor called is kept by two girls of the town; I lived there then, and he asked me to fetch the pot of beer, which I did and two others, and half a pint of gin; they then asked me to drink along with them at a gin-shop; I did so, and he was flashing his gold ring, a guinea, and a seven-shilling piece to the girls; I never saw it after; one of the girls went back, and the other went to the Golden Key with the prosecutor and me; we walked on till we came to the Green Gate, where he began to dance with a parcel of men and women who sold fish; they would not let him have any liquor there; he was so drunk, when we went out he tumbled down, and had liked to have pulled me down; when I helped him up he missed his ring, and said I must have taken it; I said if he thought I had, I would go back and look where he was dancing; I asked him to take his fish; he refused them, and I dropped them down, saying I would not carry them any farther.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. (To Valentine.) What is the name of your acquaintance? - A. Greenwood, a carver and gilder, whom I have known twenty years; I understand the woman the prisoner lived with is a girl of the town, and she was not part of the company.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there three pots of beer? - A. No, nor did I go into any gin-shop, or make any display of my money or ring, any further than it was on my finger. <rs id="t18021027-70-verdict386" type="verdictDescription">

Upon his last demand, and my refusal, Mr. Minett came in, and passed him behind, very near to his right hand; Mr. Minett could not see the pistol he had in his hand, from the position in which he stood, with his back towards the door, till after he had passed the prisoner; Mr. Minett then drew back, and the prisoner held a pistol to us both, in order to terrify us; I was going to desire Mr. Minett to seize him, but apprehending the prisoner might shoot him, I refrained; he still continued pointing the pistol at Mr. Minett, and I

               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of this man before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Considering the time that he was in the shop, and the short time that elapsed before he was taken, are you perfectly satisfied that he is the man? - A. Perfectly; my face was very much burnt for several days; the City Marthal said it was from the wadding.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether it was loaded with ball? - A. The ball was taken out of the wainscoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no hole in the pannel before? - A. There was not; it had just been painted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you yourself see the ball found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. At the time the pistol was fired, was it in a direction towards you? - A. Over my head; it was within an inch; I think it was owing to my holding my head back, that I did not receive the contents; I saw the pistol very near my head, and I threw my head back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Stephens. Q. You must have been a good deal slurried I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you master of your own observations and ideas, at the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have possessed a very unusual presence of mind; when the prisoner came into the shop first, he left the door open? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return to shut the door? - A. No, he made no return.</p>
               <p>Q. Lombard-street is a very well frequented street at that time in the evening, I should suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people passing at that time? - A. Yes, for what I know, or there might be none passing.</p>
               <p>Q. Generally the foot path is pretty well trodden? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before your friend came into the shop, the prisoner did not present the pistol at you? - A. I thought that quite enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't be pert; I shall expect you will give me your answeres with great coolness and great candor. He did not present the pistol at you till your friend came in? - A. He pointed it at my body.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not pull the trigger? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was not till there was a witness in the shop that he discharged the pistol? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Minett passed him you say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did Mr. Minett continue to him? - A. I cannot tell; I kept my eye upon the prisoner and his pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell where Mr. Minett stood? - A. Not exactly; he went on towards the end of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you told us that he more than once pointed the pistol at Mr. Minett? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you say he pointed the pistol at Mr. Minett, when you don't know where Mr. Minett stood? - A. He stooped down, and I lost fight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you tell, if you had lost fight of him, that the prisoner pointed the pistol at him? - A. He pointed his pistol at Mr. Minett; Mr. Minett drew back and stooped down; I kept my eyes upon the prisoner directly, and drew a little nearer to him, in order to lay hold of him, in case he fired at Mr. Minett.</p>
               <p>Q. Your attention was occupied at that awful moment in the safety of Mr. Minett, whom you did not see, and not upon the preservation of your own life? - A. My eye was upon the prisoner and the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you say you intersered to save Mr. Minett's life? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Mr. Minett no longer, it was your momentary apprehension that induced you to stop forward? - A. Not forward; I stepped rather aside.</p>
               <p>Q. The process of your ideas were, I will step towards him, that I may be ready to seize him after he has committed the act? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I want some exact information respecting this place; what is the size of your shop; how wide is it? - A. It may be a little wider than that table, not much.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a counter in the shop, I believe? -- A. There is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the width of that counter? - A. It is a very narrow one; it is narrower towards the door, where the prisoner and I stood, than towards any other part.</p>
               <p>Q. How wide is it at that part where the prisoner and you stood? - A. I suppose about two foot.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270039"/>Q. You were behind the counter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance is there from the counter to the wainscot? - A. It is very narrow, there is not room for two to pass.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there not a seat or a bench at that end of the counter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the size of that bench? - A. I don't know, it may be six inches wide.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sit upon it? - A. Occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. That is hardly wide enough to sit upon, I should think? - A. It is hardly wide enough, but it is made narrow, in order to have room to pass.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a bench or a stool? - A. It is a bench fixed to the wainscot.</p>
               <p>Q. That bench runs home to the window? - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sit at the time between the bench and the counter? - A. Not when the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you sitting then? - A. A little more to the left; a little more in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner first spoke to you, and asked your money, where were you? - A. In the same position, a little lower down.</p>
               <p>Q. When you advanced towards the prisoner, where were you? - A. I advanced towards the bench, between the bench and the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time then you were at the narrowest part of the counter, where it does not exceed two seet? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner was standing close to the counter? - A. No, I never said he came close to the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner stand at the time when you advanced towards him to be ready to seize him? - A. He never moved his seet, only his body.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the counter did the prisoner stand? - A. I suppose about a foot, or rather more, from the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure? - A. I am not sure; I never measured it; he stood about the middle of the door-way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner stand where he had stood from the time he entered the shop, or did he move, and where? - A. He stood in the same place; only when he fired the pistol, he turned his body towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at that time did he touch the counter or not? - A. I cannot tell how near he touched the counter; I was looking at the pistol; my eye was directed to his face and to the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, in presenting the pistol, extend his arm? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure he extended his arm? - A. I am sure he extended his arm; I saw the pistol very near my head.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the length of the pistol? - A. I cannot say the length; I saw it was an iron pistol the moments he drew it from his breast.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you had drawn towards the prisoner? - A. A little more to the right.</p>
               <p>Q. And came to this narrower part? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was that part of the wainscot which the ball penetrated from the floor? - A. I believe it is about five feet eight from the floor.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your own height? - A. Five foot five.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean with your shoes, or without? - A. I believe without.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I suppose about five foot six as you stood? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the hole was about two inches above your head? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As your eye was upon the pistol, in what manner did the prisoner present it; for instance, did he raise his hand, or did he, in holding the pistol to you, point it upwards? - A. He extended his arm, and pointed it at my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he elevate the point of the pistol? - A. It was a very quick motion; I had not much time to see; I shut my eyes, and put my head back.</p>
               <p>Q. You have already told us that the ball of this pistol passed over your head? - A. I did not see it go; it went very near my head I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. The ball struck two inches above you? - A. Some where thereabout.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was at first only one foot, or at the utmost one foot and a half, and in swinging round to present, he approached nearer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon these facts I wish you to lay your own ideas together, and tell me now, thinking of the question with that seriousness which its awful consequences require, whether you think it was possible for the prisoner to have missed your head, if he had not put his hand over your head when he fired? - A. I believe it was only prevented by my putting my head back, and I apprehend it was only the hand of Providence that directed my head back at that moment; if I had not been very collected, I should not have followed the prisoner instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated that the prisoner extended his arm; that the counter was only two foot, and as the prisoner approached the counter, having extended his arm with the lenght of the pistol in his hand, I ask you what distance could the muzzle of that pistol be from your head, if he pointed it at you? - A. I should suppose about a foot.</p>
               <p>Q. Why then the prisoner's arm could not reach a foot? - A. I cannot tell to an inch.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't speak then from the idea you had at the time so much, as from the effect of the pistol scorching your face; now I ask you whether that might not have happened if the prisoner had purposely put the muzzle of the pistol over your head<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270040"/>in the action of swinging round? - A. No, I really don't believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your hair singed? - A. No; there were several spots upon my nose, and upon my eye-lids.</p>

               <p>Q. A merchant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so kind as tell us the whole that you know of this? - A. On Saturday, the 16th of October, about half past five o'clock, I went into Mr. Marryan's shop for a tooth-pick-case, and saw a man standing at the counter, rather obliquely, the door was neither open nor shut, and I heard him say the word money, only money, to which I heard Mr. Marryan answer, that he had none; I suspected there was something wrong, upon which I rushed into the shop, and in so doing, I pushed his right elbow; I then observed that he had a pistol, upon which he put his pistol close to me; I drew myself back, and stooped down, facing the counter; he then took the pistol from me, and pointed it towards Mr. Marryan; the pistol was immediately fired, and the man ran out; Mr. Marryan put his hand to his forehead, crying, oh God! which made me think he was wounded in the head; he took his hand away, and then I saw he was not wounded; he ran out of the shop, before me, but very little; I followed, calling out, stop thief, but I did not see him apprehended, on account of the crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the pistol afterwards found upon him? - A. No; I saw one in captain Stewart's hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The pistol went off almost at the same time that you were stooping down? - A. No; it went off after I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Just in the act of rising? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Endeavouring to secure him? - A. No, I had endeavoured to secure him before.</p>
               <p>Q. In the act of rising, had you endeavoured to lay hold of the prisoner? - A. Not in the act of rising, I did not at that moment.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the height of the counter? - A. Probably about that height. (Describing it to be about three feet.)</p>
               <p>Q. At the very moment you were rising, you found the pistol go off? - A. I heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. How it went off, and under what circumstances, it is impossible for you to say? - A. It was pointed towards Mr. Marryan at the time it went off.</p>
               <p>Q. You were rising from the stooping situation in which you were; how then is it possible for you to say, it was pointed towards Mr. Marryan; did you not mean that it was pointed across the counter? - A. Yes, I had my eyes fixed upon the prisoner, because I expected him to shoot me.</p>

             sworn. - On the 16th of October, I had passed Mr. Marryan's house, about a hundred yards; I heard a pistol go off about a minute after; I saw the prisoner following me; I turned round, and seized him by the right-hand, he had a pair of pistols, one in each hand; I took a loaded pistol out of his right-hand; I assisted in securing him, and he was taken to the Compter.</p>

               <p>Q. How was the other pistol? - A. That had been fired.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You are one of the City-marshals? - A. I am.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know of this? - A. I don't know any thing more, than that after the examination, I thought it necessary to take down the pannel, through which the shot had passed; I went to Mr. Marryan's, and had the pannel taken out; I found the ball, which I have in my pocket, it had gone into the joint of the brick-work, about half an inch, the pannel is here. (Produces the pannel and the ball.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You went for the purpose of observing where this ball had entered the pannel? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your observations, when you went there, was your attention called to see what was the distance with respect to heighth, be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270041"/>tween where the ball entered, and the counter? - A. I did; I requested Mr. Marryan, as he was standing behind the counter, to go back; I asked him for a rule, and I think it was just about three inches and a half above his heighth.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the counter, from his description, must have been close to where he stood? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The ball, however, was about three inches and a half above his heighth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Did I stand accused of having presented a pistol with a view of extorting money, painful to me as the acknowledgment must be, I certainly could not but plead guilty to the charge: it was a rash and criminal action, (for it is not my intention to attempt in any manner to extenuate its guilt): it was an action which I cannot reflect upon but with the utmost astonishment, which I know not how to account for, which I most sincerely condemn, and the very idea of which overwhelms me with inexpressible contrition and shame, that I even proceeded so far as to fire the pistol, (though I shudder at the thought, yet consistently with truth), I cannot deny but that I fired it at the prosecutor, but not with any intention of killing or injuring him, that is a charge which my conscience will not suffer me to admit. The fact is, that without the smallest premeditation or reflection on my part, but from I know not what kind of sudden and momentary impulse, occasioned by extreme distress, I entered the house in which this melancholy event took place, and shewed the pistol, thought certainly without any intention of firing. - In the already extremely agitated and disordered state of my mind, I was, in all probability, as far as I can judge of my own sensations at that moment, so affected by the entrance of a person who came in after me, that I involuntarily pulled the trigger, but without pointing the pistol at the prosecutor, or any other person. This, to my conception, is the only possible way of explaining so very extraordinary and unpremeditated an act. Of the extreme agitation and disorder of my mind, some idea may be formed, when I declare, that almost perishing with hunger, (for I had taken no nourishment whatever during two days), a friend less wanderer by day, obliged at night to seek repose within the dismal walls of unfinished houses, unacquainted with a single individual to whom I could make application for relies, ashamed to beg, and destitute of every other resource, I was absolutely driven to such a pitch of desperation, that I had positively determined, about two hours before, in the Park, to put an end to my miserable existence, had loaded my pistols for that purpose, and should actually have perpetrated the horried deed, had I not been prevented by the presence of a lady and her two servants, who were at that time walking in the Park. In short, I am fully convinced, however unable to prove it, that I laboured under a kind of mental derangement at the time: that such was the idea of the keeper of the Poultry Computer, when I was taken into custody, is evident both from his own declaration, and his ordering a strait waistcoat to be put upon me; at all events, the firing of the pistol certainly was an act in which my will had not for a moment the smallest concern; for I do most solemnly declare, in the face of this awful tribunal, before which I am now arraigned, and in the presence of that omniscient Judge before whose still more awful bar I am shortly, perhaps, to appear, that it never was my intention to fire. What object, in fact, particularly at so early an hour, and in so public a street, could I expect to attain? what advantage could I hope to derive from it? I could not but foresee that the report of the pistol must necessarily alarm the neighbourhood, and cause my person, in all probability, to be seized: the act itself proves, that there could be no rational intention; and I solemnly aver, that there was no intention at all of pulling the trigger, much less to fire at the prosecutor. I am informed, and it has but this morning reached my ears, through the charity of a gentleman, who, from compassion, interested himself in my unfortunate case, that I stand accused before the public of actual robberies committed in shops and private dwellings, under circumstances similar to those of the charge I have now to answer to: this, I am told, has been asserted in the public newspapers; and yet from my ignorance of the language of this country, and my close imprisonment together, I have been so far from being able to answer the groundless and cruel report, that I was utterly ignorant of its existence. I throw myself upon the candour and humanity of the Court for protection from this source of prejudice: I am sure the justice and liberality of the English nation will hold it enough for a poor foreigner to answer to charges legally brought against him in a strange land, without being prejudged by the effect of calumnies which he has no means of disproving. For the charge upon which my life is now in your hands, my rash and criminal conduct had given but too much colour, though I certainly did not fire at the prosecutor, or meant for a moment to hurt him; but that I ever, in any other instance, offended against the laws of this country, in any degree, I most solemnly deny; and if any man can alledge the country against me, I desire him to stand forward, and am ready to meet death if it be found, that except in this instance, I ever attempted to invade the property of another, or gave a moment's alarm to any man for his personal safety. Whatever character may belong to the act now in question, it was my first and only action which can be taxed with criminality in the eye of the law of this or any other country; I had suffered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270042"/>enough before, but had not before attempted to relieve my sufferings at the expence of any moral obligation.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I have nothing more to add in my defence; I rely on your equity and your charitable construction of my conduct; my life is in your hands; and whatever your decision may be, to that I shall bow in either case with respect, with resignation if it bid me die, and with gratitude if it save my life from a premature and dishonourable end.</p>

               <p>Mr. Marryan. My Lord, I beg leave to observe, this gentleman has been twice with me, and had conversations with me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stephens. We are not going into the subject of those conversations - you appear to feel too much in this cause.</p>
               <p>Mr. DUGGIN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Stephens. Q. Are you of any prosession? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. With what motive did you go to Mr. Mar. ryan? - A. From motives of humanity.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain your object? -</p>
               <p>Court. We really cannot enquire into this gentleman's motives.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stephens. Q. When you were in the shop of Mr. Marryan, did you take notice of the size of the counter, and of the heighth of the shot in the pannel? - A. Yes. I did; but I have taken more particular notice since, that, this day.</p>
               <p>Q. State it as accurately as you can? - A. As Mr. Marryan has described it as near as can be, about twenty-one inches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you measure it? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you measure the height of the shot? - A. Yes; my own heighth is about five feet nine inches, and it is about five inches above my heighth, I mean the aperture in the brick wall; I marked it upon a stick which is in Court, so that it appeared to me to be six feet two inches from the floor to the aperture in the wall where the ball entered.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you think it necessary to put a strait waistcoat upon him? - A. A strait waistcoat was put upon him when he first came into the prison; I was not present, but I saw him after wards with a strait waistcoat upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find his mind in a state which made it necessary? - A. It was done from the fear of his making away with himself, on account of the agitation of mind he was in.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Shoemakers have two or three different forts of knives? - A.

               <p>Q. You say there is aqua-fortis, have you ever smelt oil of vitriol? - A. I have, but saw no oil of vitriol; I am sure it is aqua-fortis.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was there the appearance of shoe-making carrying on? - A. There were things sufficient, but I am convinced it was used merely as a clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not twenty or thirty lasts in the room? - A. There were a good many.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not begin to kick and knock all the things about? - A. No; I took hold of the knife.</p>

               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. It is, with the deepest sense of shame and concern, that I find myself under the necessity of answering a charge I never expected to be brought against me; I looked upon the articles to be a free gift from the prosecutrix, who consented I should have them for her sake; the morning I left her, I asked them of her, and she consented to my request; when I left her lodgings, I desired her servant to follow me home, and I would send her mistress something for having staid with her all night; I was surprised she did not follow me, but intended to return again, and went home without an idea of what would be the consequence; being but a short time in London, and unacquainted with the town, I could not find out her lodgings, which I wished to do; when I met her afterwards, my satisfaction was much damped, by the charge of having robbed her; I might easily have avoided her, but I offered to go home with her, and might have quitted her in our walk to Half-moon-street, where she said she lived, if I had been so inclined; it happened that I had been disappointed of some money from my friend,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270046"/>which subjected me to the inconvenience of pledging my apparel, and inadvertently those ear-rings; having been a short time in London, and my friends and relations being abroad, I have no friends here to speak for me; I hope, if my single asseveration can be taken, it will be believed, I had no intention to rob her, and that my conduct will be looked upon more as levity than an intention to injure; I humbly beg leave to say, that as this is the first time, so it shall be the last of my appearing at the bar of this or any other tribunal.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not go out when he did? - A. He got into a little bit of a yard, and the people would not let me follow him.</p>

               <p>Simon Fuller's defence. I had been at work all that day at the water-side, and when I went home, I found the door open, and the light out; I got a candle, and looked round the room, thinking my wife was in bed; I saw a strange man asleep on the bed; I shook him, but could not move him; he appeared to be very much in liquor; immediately I sell into such consusion, that I packed up every thing belonging to my wife and myself that I could see on the table; those things were laying on the table, and I picked them up, being mixed with my own things, saying I would not live any longer with my wife, if that was the way she followed; I went away, looking for work, to Maidstone; next day I got lodgings there, and examined the things; when I found what I had got, I was rather afraid of coming back, but did intend to return them, and met with that man who apprehended me. That is all I have to say. My wife had no hand in it; I did not see here for three or four days, till I wrote to her. I have been nineteen years in the service, and was wounded in Egypt, on the landing the troops, and in the East Indies; being so long abroad, I have no witnesses, for my regiment and officers are now at Gibraltar.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Gibbs.) How long have these people lived with you? - A. Three months.</p>

               <p>Q. What time on the Monday? - A. About four o'clock; the next morning the shepherd informed me they were gone; the shepherd is here; I went in pursuit of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go yourself to the field? - A. Yes; the lock was broke open, and the stake pulled up, and thrown on one side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself afterwards see any of those sheep again? - A. Not till the men were detected with them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the sheep again? - A. Last Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure they are my Lord's sheep? - A. Yes; they had the same marks as they had when I bought them; I bought the twenty-six South Downs at Croydon fair, about three weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had the others? - A. Last May.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any fresh marks been put upon them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the South Downs marked? - A. There was the letter S inclosed within a circle.</p>
               <p>Q. What marks had the Wiltshire sheep? - A. None, but I could distinguish them very well.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it that you saw these sheep? - A. On Tuesday, the 19th of October, at the top of St. James's-market, what we call the country market, a few minutes before five in the morning; the man was standing at the paved stones, that we call the Terrace, with the sheep, that was not the prisoner; it was quite dark at that time; I went up to the man, and asked him who they belonged to; he said, they belonged to one O'Connor; I said, what is he going to do with them?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any thing of the prisoner? - A. Yes; I went and called a gentleman, who is here, of the name of Higgs, and he came to me; I communicated to him a suspicion of these sheep being stolen; when I came back, I saw the same man that I had seen before, and asked him where O'Connor was; he said, he is gone down to Mr. Welch's, to sleep for a couple of hours, and while I was talking to him, the prisoner came up; I asked him whose sheep they were; he said, they are mine; says I, what are you going to do with them; he said, he had brought them there to be slaughtered; I asked him who was going to slaughter them for him; he said, a couple of young men, who lodged at a public-house hard by; I asked him who the young men were, and he could not tell me their names; I asked him the sign of the public-house they lodged at; he said he did not know the sign, but pointed to the door; he knocked at the door, and called several christian names, as Tom, Dick, William, and several other names; then he turned back again, and I said, it is not worth while to let the sheep abide here, you may as well drive them into the market; says he, I don't care, with all my heart, they will be safer in the market than they will be in the street; I asked him where he got the sheep; he said he bought them about seven miles on the other side of Bagshot; I asked him who he bought them of; he said, of one Mr. M'Andrews; he said, there should be forty of them, but he thought he had lost two in coming along, he was not sure; I then gave our watchman charge of them in the street, and then I gave charge of the prisoner to another watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the sheep afterwards? - A. I sent them in the afternoon to St. John

               <p>THOMAS HIGGS sworn. - Q. When was it you first knew any thing of this matter? - A. On Tuesday morning, about five o'clock, Mr. Spragg called me up; I went to him in the country market, and found him talking with the prisoner; he said the sheep were his own; I asked him how he came by them; he said, he bought them; I asked him if he gave 60l. for them; he said, no, not quite so much; I asked him how far he had brought them that night; he said he had brought them from seven miles below Bagshot; I asked him if he was not afraid of losing any of them, driving them in the night; and he said, one walked before, and the other behind them, but he believed he had lost two; we then got them into the market, and there I asked him how much he gave a-piece for them, and he said, he bought them in four lots, one of the lots he gave 32s. a-piece, and another lots, 28s. another lot, 17s. 6d. a-piece, and another lot, 16s. and he said they should not be long before they had their jackets off; then I consulted with Mr. Spragg what was to be done, and we thought it was no use to detain the sheep without<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270056"/>detaining the man; we then gave charge of the sheep into the hands of the watchman belonging to the market, and then we went into the country market again, and gave charge of the prisoner; he told us likewise that he had eleven pigs in his possession, and the lads that he had engaged to kill the sheep, were to kill the pigs at 2s. 6d. a-piece, and seven sucking pigs at 6d. a-piece; he said he dealt largely in poultry likewise, and then we took him to the watch-house, and the sheep were sent away to the Farm; the sheep were very much out of condition, and not fit for slaughtering; we asked him how he could think of killing them, for he could not make any thing of them to sell again, but he said that was the best way to make the most of them; he said he would make us pay for any that were lost; the wethers were in a good deal better condition than the ewes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOWARD sworn. - Q. Did Mr. Spragg give you any sheep to drive any where? - A. Yes; thirty-seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take them to? - A. To St. John Wood Farm.</p>
               <p>Q. That was on the Tuesday? - A. Yes; and the next day I went again with the steward and the shepherd, and saw the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the same that you had delivered the day before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there when they were taken away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the shepherd afterwards? - A. No; the steward and the shepherd saw them at the Farm on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Walker.) You see that young man, the last witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the sheep at this Farm? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear they were all Lord Besborough's sheep? - A. They were all my Lord's, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that they were the sheep you had the care of? - A. Yes, I am sure they are the same.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Wilson.) Were you at St. John Wood Farm at the same time with the shepherd and Howard? - A. I was.</p>

               <p>Q. You have no doubt these were the same sheep? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. The ewes were not fat, were they? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the wethers fat? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not fit for killing? - A. No; there might be two or three pretty fair sheep.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was hired to drive the sheep by the person that Mr. Spragg saw first with the sheep: I met him on the other side of Kingston; he had thirteen pigs with him; he called to me, shipmate, where are you going; I told him I was going out into the country, to look for work; says he, come along with me, and I will give you 5s. to assist me to drive some cattle that I have got along with these pigs: there was a public-house just by, and I went in with him and had some ale; he said there were two more men in the town of Kingston that were to be along with us, upon which he went to the house where these two men were, and we sat there drinking till I suppose about ten o'clock at night; he then told me we had to go down to a turnpike very near, where he had the rest of the cattle, he did not tell me what cattle they were; he called for half a pint of gin, and told me he would go and have the cattle out; and as soon as he had got the sheep out, he came to the turnpike again, and I overtook the sheep with the other two men, they were about four miles a-head of us; we drove the pigs, and the other two men drove the sheep, till we got to Charing-cross, and then he desired me to drive the sheep to St. James'smarket, and if any body asked me whose they were, he desired me to tell them they belonged to myself, and that I bought them seven miles beyond Bagshot, upon which we drove them to St. James'smarket; I went into a house to lie down, and left another man watching them; a man came to me, and said, one of the butchers had looked at the sheep, and said, he thought they were stolen; I said I did not believe so, for what profit, says I, would it be to him to pay me to drive these sheep here, if they were stolen: so with that I met this man, and, as he tells you, he talked with me about the sheep; the other man ran away, and I was taken up; I have but just come over from the East Indies. <rs id="t18021027-90-verdict500" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>- LOCKIE sworn. - I am a surveyor; I live in Dean-street, Soho: On the 20th of October I was at Mr. Hale's, a grocer, in Cockspur-street; Mr. Hale, in Mr. Watts's presence, gave me two shillings and half-a-crown marked, and a copy of the marks made upon paper; I went to Mr. Watts's that evening, and purchased a box of Dr. Jebb's pills, and a bottle of hartshorn; I paid the same marked money to the prisoner at the bar; I went back, delivered the articles to Mr. Watts, and Mr. Watts soon after left me.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WATTS sworn. - I am a chemist and druggist, in the <placeName id="t18021027-92-crimeloc512">Strand</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was there any increase in the silver? - A. I believe there was one shilling increase, but I am consident no more: it was the indispensible duty of the prisoner to have entered these articles in the retail book; the book is here, but they are not entered; I called in Mr. Green and Mr. Christain, two neighbours; I then called the prisoner into the accompting-house, and told him I was sorry to accuse him of being a thief, I had long suspected him, but now I have good proof of it; I told him I had a constable at hand, and requested him to take out of his pocket what money he had; he pulled out four half-guineas, one shilling and sixpence, and half-a-crown, that was the marked halfcrown I had given to Mr. Lockie, I am sure it is the same, here is the paper upon which I copied the mark. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The mark was not put upon this half-crown by yourself? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. The mark is a letter, is it not? - A. It is an I and a semicircle.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner lived with you thirteen months? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stop at Mr. Hale's, after the money was given to Mr. Lockie? - A. Not five minutes; it was the indispensible duty of the prisoner to enter those articles in the retail book.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not sometimes the case, that articles are omitted to be entered? - A. Yes; and then there has been a surplus.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said there might be an increase of a shilling in the till in the silver? - A. There might.</p>
               <p>Q. If a customer wanted change, would not the person serving resort to the till for that purpose? - A. Assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a half-crown was wanted, and there was no half-crown in the till, might he not give the change out of his own pocket? - A. He had a particular order from me never to give change out of his pocket, but to send the servant out for change.</p>
               <p>Q. But he was alone at this time, and it was night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From the hurry in which this business was transacted, which you say was not five minutes, do you, in your conscience, believe he had had time enough to have put it into the till? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Mr. Lockie had had time to come from your house to Cockspur-street, and you to return again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lockie. This is the same half-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Watts.) How often do you settle your book? - A. Every night in general, and if I am not in the way, there is an entry made of the produce in the till.</p>
               <p>- CHRISTIAN sworn. - I am a linen-draper, in the Strand; Mr. Watts called me in, and I saw the prisoner produce the half-crown.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what part of Nottingham he resided in? - A. No particular place I believe; when I found him, I told him he was a prisoner; that I had directions to take him up for robbing his master; he said he had robbed his master, and he was very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Had you made him any promise? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was that the immediate answer? - A. Nearly to; I asked him the amount, and he said between 60 and 70l. I took him into custody, and at the desire of the Magistrate, I brought him up to London.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find upon him? - A. A watch, two or three little trinkets, and a canvas bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the canvas bag here? - A. Yes -(produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him any question respecting the watch and trinkets? - A. Yes; I asked him where he bought the watch; he said he bought it of a person of the name of Hall, at Nottingham; I asked him how he paid for it, and he said by a 20l. Bank-bill; I asked him what time it was that he went away, and he said between three and four in the morning; that he walked on, and the Briton coach overtook him, and brought him to Nottingham.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This young boy was perfectly contrite, and ready to tell you every thing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he cried? - A. Yes, he did, and said, he was very sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. (To Wood.) Is that such a bag as your money was contained in? - A. Yes, it is such a one.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sober at that time? - A. I was as sober as a Judge.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been drinking at the winevaults? - A. We only drank a glass a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Dyot-street, what happened to you? - A. We called for a pot of ale.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you and Hawkins to treat? - A. I paid for every thing they had the whole day; I said, who is to pay for that; Hawkins said, you pay for it, and I will pay you another time; after I had paid for it, Hawkins took his handkerchief off his neck, and gave it to me; he wanted me to take it till he had money to pay me; I gave him his handkerchief back, and told him I did not want his handkerchief, he might make it up to me another time; when the ale was almost out, I went out to see a bit of a row in the street; I saw a young fellow, whom I treated with a glass of peppermint; in this house I changed half-a-crown to pay for it, and put the change in my jacket pocket; as I was standing at the corner, Hawkins put his hand in my pocket, took out the change, and handed it over to the other parties.</p>
               <p>Q. Hawkins and you were alone then? - A. No, all these jockies were out; I said, I think it is time to be off; upon that Hawkins and the rest of them laid hold of me, and dragged me into the house; then Hawkins said to the other, stand by; Thompson, Mackenzie, and the others said, "all ready, hurroo, hurroo, draw him, tingle, tingle;" Charles Hawkins was knocking me about at the time Thompson and Mackenzie were robbing me; they got me down, and ill-used me, and knocked me about.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they rob you? - A. They broke the chain of the watch; the chain was drawn through my button-hole; they broke the chain in three pieces; I had these trowsers on at the time (producing them), and they tore the pocket right out as you see it, and in the same pocket where the watch was there was a 5l. Bank-note, which they took; there were two half guineas, and nineteen shillings in silver in my waistcoat pocket, which they tore out likewise; I got hold of Thompson's hand, and said, I don't care, I will lose my life before I let you go, and I kept hold of his hand while the others were knocking me about; I cried out murder almost all the time from the first beginning of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come to your assistance? - A. Yes, a soldier came in, and then they all bolted out; I held fast hold of Thompson, the man that took the watch out of my pocket and the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Thompson taken upon the spot? - A. Yes, he was taken directly; Mackenzie then came up directly, and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after the soldier came in? - A. Yes; Mackenzie knocked me down while the soldier was after Thompson; Mackenzie said to Thompson, "you b - r, don't go up that street; if you do, you will be caught."</p>
               <p>Q. What street was that? - A. I don't know the name of the street; I never was in the place before in all my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mackenzie caught? - A. He was caught about an our afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Thompson was taken immediately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mackenzie make his escape? - A. While we were taking Thompson to the watch-house, I had hold of one side of him, and the officer on the other; Hawkins came up to me again, and knocked me down; I had hold of one side of him; I got up and caught hold of him directly, and gave him in charge to the officer; Mackenzie made off with the property; he took it out of Thompson's hands.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him take the property from Thompson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat. Q. You joined Hawkins at the public-house? - A. Yes, and he said he would take a walk with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking a good deal? - A. No I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking at the wine-vaults? - A. No, I did not; I only treated them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many public-houses were you at in St. Giles's? - A. Only the Turk's head.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself; were not you among some women at another house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You paid, I believe, for Hawkins the whole of the day? - A. I paid for every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. And you offered to lend Hawkins money several times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did you offer? - A. When I caught his hand in my pocket, I said, Charles, you don't behave like a shipmate, and he immediately handed the money away to some of the rest of them; and I said, if you had not done that, I would have lent you half a guinea, or a guinea, if you wanted it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have disagreed with him so much; you had some kind of quarrel with him, and struck him, I believe? - A. No, I did not quarrel with him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. After drinking all this while, you take upon you to say you were quite sober? - A. I was as sober as any person could be.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you think you had drank in the course of the whole day? - A. I had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270063"/>drank more than six glasses, and twice that would not make me drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mackenzie take any thing from your person? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to say Mackenzie struck you? - A. He knocked me down in the street several times, not in the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thompson. Q. I wish to ask him if I was out of his sight from the time he says he was robbed till I went to the watch-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not stand by at the watch-house, and see me searched? - A. I don't know whether you were searched there; if you were, it were more than I know.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you recollect there is a reward; have you ever been told there is a reward? - A. No, I have not; I never was before a Justice in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not the officers given you money since you have been here, and tampered with you, and even given you victuals and drink? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not received any emolument, nor have been told there is a reward? - A. No; they have not told me of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Q. Did you from any person hear that you were to have a reward if any of these persons are convicted? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you imagine or conceive in any way that you are to be benesited if these persons are convicted? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Attkins appear to you to be drunk or sober? - A. He was no more in liquor than I am now; then I saw Mackenzie come out after him; Thompson ran round the corner of Church-lane, and Attkins ran after him; then Mackenzie came close after him, and just as Attkins got to the corner, Mackenzie knocked him down; Mackenzie cried out to Thompson, that if he ran that way he would be caught.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What do you know of this matter? - A. On the 1st of October, between five and six o'clock, I was standing where I lodge, No. 27, Dyot-street, St. Giles's; I heard a cry of, stop thief, over and over; upon hearing the alarm, I proceeded to the spot, and saw the prisoner Thompson rush out of the door at the Turk's Head public-house, and the young man Attkins pursuing him; Attkins was bleeding very much at the mouth or nose, I could not say which; I immediately collared Thompson, when the prisoner Mackenzie rushed out immediately after the prosecutor, and made a bolt right against my arm, and rescued Thompson; immediately after he was rescued, Thompson returned into the house again, Mackenzie following him; I pursued him, and in the tap-room there is a door that leads back towards the vault in the yard, and Thompson attempted to bolt through towards the yard; there I saw Thompson give Mackenzie something that appeared to be a small thing, imitating a purse, or something of that description; he twisted the mouth of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270064"/>it round, and put it into the fore part of his breeches; then Thompson bolted out again at the bar-door throught the house; I pursued him and collared him again a second time; Mackenzie said,"bolt, you b - r, bolt," and up with his first, compelling Thompson to run, as if he was going to strike him; Thompson ran up the street, and I followed him; he was soon taken by the assistance of me and the mob which was collected.</p>

               <p>Hawkins's defence. This sailor asked me to go with him and take a walk, between one and two o'clock; I told him I had no money; he said he would treat me, as I was a shipmate; we went to Drury-lane, to the wine-vaults, and had a glass of gin a-piece; then we went to a private house with some lewd women; he was up there some time; I staid below; then we went down into the street, and had some ale; then we went home, and he said, "come with me, and I will shew you a shipmate of ours;" he took me to Dyot-street, where we had some ale; he asked me to pay for it; I told him I had no money; he made a grumbling, and I offered him my handkerchief, and then there was a piece of work among them, and I went away. This is all I now about it.</p>
               <p>Thompson's defence. As for insinuating, as the prosecutor does, that I was in the company of the others, it is not true; I did not associate with them; there was a very great alarm in the house; the house was full of people; I was very much alarmed, and left the house.</p>
               <p>Mackenzie's defence. I have nothing to say.</p>

               <p>Kitchener's defence. I am entirely innocent of the charge; I never saw any watch at all.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Attkins.) Q. Were you in any private house? - A. Not with any of them, but Charles Hawkins.</p>
               <p>Q. He says you were at a house with some loose women? - A. I changed a 7s. piece in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Ann Morris.) What is the name of the man who keeps the house? - A. I cannot say; he was a Frenchman.</p>

               <p>Q. On what day were you robbed? - A. On Monday the 4th of October, I set out from Cheshunt.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going? - A. To Tooting, in Surrey, on business; I came from Cheshunt about half past three in the afternoon, to Waltham-Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the road is it? - A. Yes; I applied to the Peterborough stage-coachman for a place, but he said he was loaded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go by it or not? - A. No; I walked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270065"/>on, and overtook another person, and he and I walked on together; I meant to go to London by the Tottenham coach, but it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that other person? - A. No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you walk together? - A. We walked together till we came to Tottenham, and when we came to Tottenham, we overtook the prisoners at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. On the road? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all three in company together? - A. They were; the young man who was with me spoke to them at a little distance from the White Hart public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem to be acquainted with them? - A. I cannot say; he seemed to hold some conversation with them; I said I wanted to make haste to town; he directly said, we will go into this public house; I said I was dry, and the young man and I went in together.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoners? - A. They came in afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come in together? - A. They did; they were all in the place together.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when you were at the public house? - A. I called for a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of day was it when you got into the White Hart? - A. I should suppose it might be about half past six in the evening: I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did the prisoners come in? - A. They were in as soon almost as the beer was drawn; I think they were in before; they were at the heels of us as it were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they join company with you? - A. The young man and I drank our beer; I said I had got a bit of cold leg of pork, and asked the landlord for a bid of bread, but he did not sell it, and I went out and purchased a two-penny loaf; when I came back the young man was in company with the prisoners at the bar; they were in conversation together, and had a pot of beer; they asked me to drink; I said, no, I would keep my own company.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you mean by keeping your own company? Did you mean the young man that accompanied you? - A. Yes; the young man handed round part of the meat and bread to the prisoners at the bar, in the room; I got up and said, I must go.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you sat there? - A. Very likely it might be three quarters of an hour, or less.</p>
               <p>Q. On your saying you would go, what then? - A. I paid a pint of porter towards the reckoning; the young man and I had two pants.</p>
               <p>Q. That was all the liquor you had some? - A. No; the prisoners called for some go, I believe, I cannot exactly say; they handed it round among themselves, the young man, and me; they drank, and paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much spirits were there? - A. I think there was half a pint.</p>
               <p>Q. How many glasses did you drink of it? - A. About half a glass.</p>
               <p>Q. You had nothing sufficient to intoxicate you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were quite sober when you went into the house, were you? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not drank before you went in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, during the time you were there, sufficient opportunities of noticing the prisoners? A. I had remarkably so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the young man go along with you, or did you go alone? - A. The prisoners wanted more liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were to have had more, I suppose? - A. I suppose so; the landlord would not let them have any more; here is a person who was in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go away alone, or in company? - A. I walked out first, the young man, I believe, was the next that came out, and then the prisoners; which came first I cannot ascertain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you part with the young man any where? - A. No, not then; we walked on together as it were.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the young man, the prisoners, and you? - A. No, the prisoners were all rather before me.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you came out first? - A. Yes, but they passed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you and the young man walking together when the prisoners passed you? - A. I was outside, first.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the young man came out next? - A. Yes; he asked the prisoners how far they were going; they said they were going to London.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose some one said so? - A. One and all together; when we had walked on the road about twenty yards from the Bull inn, at <placeName id="t18021027-101-crimeloc559">Tottenham</placeName>

               <p>Q. How far is the Bull from the White Hart? - A. I cannot ascertain; I think it is about a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. When you walked there, was the young man and you together, or you by yourself? - A. The young man and all the prisoners were before me.</p>
               <p>Q. They walked a little before you all the way? - A. Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were they a-head? - A. They might be about the value of two yards.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the story you have always told before the Justice? - A. Yes, I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all in a line together, or near together? - A. James Brown was rather at a distance from them; how far I cannot say, but nearly together.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you had the pocketbook out in the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose? - A. The woman wanted to carry my money; she said she would take care of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she know you had it? - A. Because I pulled it out in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pull it out for? - A. I meant to get change for a 5l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken any note out of the book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You pulled out a 5l. note? - A. Yes; I had three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer it to any body to change? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you wanted to get change? - A. Yes, I said I should like to get change, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the presence of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put it into your pocket-book again? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the woman say? - A. She said she would take care of it for me; I told her I could take care of it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not pulled it out before? - A. Not that I recollect; I wanted to get change, thinking if I got a stage, I had not money enough to pay it, only having a shilling and four pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us the contents of your pocket-book? - A. There were three 5l. notes, some letters, and bills of parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. You state that Haley and the woman came about you? - A. Yes, and Brown run away with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they all run away together at the same time? - A. I did not see Brown there at the moment when I got up, but I saw him going away when I recovered myself; I saw him some little distance further than where the other prisoners were.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you guess how many yards he might be from them when Haley knocked you down? - A. I don't think he was two yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Further before them? - A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any thing of Brown again; just at the time you were knocked down, you say you saw him; did he then go from you, or did you see him afterwards? - A. I saw him when I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after they took the pocket-book? - A. It was after.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he then? - A. I think within about two yards, or more, I cannot exactly say.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say whether he went away before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270067"/>them, or whether they all went together? - A. Before them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - A. He was away from me first; the other two were behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go till after you were robbed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing still when he was about this distance of two yards? - A. When I got up he was walking on, on the right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the others, immediately after you got up, leave you? - A. Yes, they run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether Brown run before them? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did they run? - A. Towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you then do? - A. I cried out I had been robbed, and called to the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was dark at this time? - A. It was moonshine.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it? - A. It might be eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a clear night? - A. Yes, it was light, so that I could see, and could distinguish the prisoners perfectly well; I never lost fight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Not of any of them? - A. Excepting Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the watch join you? - A. No, not at that moment.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost sight of Brown, but not of the other prisoners? - A. No, I did not; a young man hearing the cry of, stop thief, run out.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name? - A. Robert Mews; he brought Morris Haley up first.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there to take care of him? - A. A gentleman, who is here, named Saunders; then Mews brought the woman up.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see any thing of the woman? - A. Almost directly.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was he? - A. He was some little distance behind, coming from the Magistrate's with the other prisoners; he run, and called to Brown as he was getting over a stile.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him getting over the stile? - A. Yes, I did; he was running away; Brown stopped as he was getting over the stile, and Mews said he must go with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Who laid hold of him? - A. Mews.</p>
               <p>Q. He stopped at the stile, did he? - A. Yes; we told him we wanted him, and I took him into the public-house again, charged the constable with him, handcuffed him, and took him to the Magistrate's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever afterwards see your pocketbook? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When? - A. The next morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he deliver it to you? - A. No; I saw him pick it up about fifty yards from where the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the road, or where? - A. By the side of the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was by accident he found it? - A. It was early in the morning; I got up with a friend to look for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. About six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this man join you? - A. I was on the road, and he was on the foot-path; I saw him pick something up, and when I came up to him, he had picked up the pocket-book, which I believed to be mine; I told him there was a name in the inside; he opened it before he gave it me, and then he delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. I hardly suppose there were any notes in it? - A. There was nothing in it but a pair of brass compasses, a pencil, and two cards.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned your having some little bills; did you ever afterwards see any thing of them? - A. I saw two produced by the gentleman who picked them up, Mr. Saunders.</p>
               <p>Q. The same morning you found the book, somebody produced the bills of parcels? - A. Yes; they were produced that night before the Magistrate; I saw them the same night that I was robbed.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he not in a second public-house after he met with me at Edmonton? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What house was that? - A. I think it was the Red Lion.</p>

               <p>Q. You are sure you had no more than part of a glass of peppermint? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were quite sober? - A. Yes; I had nothing to drink but part of two pints of potter, part of a glass of gin, and part of a glass of peppermint.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about Brown? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether you told any thing to the persons about you of these being the persons that robbed you, and that the prisoners were in company with you before? - A. Yes.</p>

            , Esq. at the Seven Sisters, Tottenham High Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say? - A. I did not see the robbery done, but I heard an outcry or stop thief, about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do? - A. I run out of the gates, and saw a gentleman on horseback first.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that? - A. Mr. Biggs; upon that I stopped his horse, and having so done, I begged his pardon for it, as I knew him; he said it was not a horseman, but footpads who had committed the robbery, and he believed he had over-rode them, or rode by them; I then went in pursuit of them, and run up the side of the turnpike-road a good distance, but never saw any thing of them; as I was standing still, I heard a person come running very hard towards me; when I first saw the man, he crossed over to the other side of the road when he saw me; I crossed over to him, caught hold of him, and asked him where he was going to; he said he was going after his partner; I told him to stop, and asked him what made him in such a hurry; in the mean time Mr. Biggs came up, and said, that is one of the men I saw in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270070"/>scrummage, don't let him go, young man, and we detained him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is that man? - A. Morris Haley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of any other man? - A. When Mr. Biggs came up on horseback, the man that was knocked down came up.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the prosecutor; you did not see it done? - A. No, but I saw his head all over dirt; when he came up, he said, that man knocked me down three times; after that, I said, take care of him, and I will go and see after the others.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know there were others? - A. The gentleman told me to take care of myself, for there were three or four others, and they were Irishmen, and a woman among them; I went into the grove, where there is a cluster of trees, a ditch parts it from the road, and there I saw that woman and Brown running down the grove together; I caught hold of the woman's shoulders, and made a catch at the man, but he sprang away from me, the woman stopped directly, and I saw no more of the man then, but I took him again the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he run that night? - A. He ran towards town then.</p>
               <p>Q. What time next morning did you see him? - A. About seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you then? - A. At my master's gate, and from thence I walked towards him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he then? - A. About one hundred yards from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him to be the person? - A. Yes, I had seen him by the lamps, and the lamp-lighter's torch.</p>
               <p>Q. The lamps did not light much into the grove? - A. It was rather moonlight.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon seeing him? - A. When I saw him in the morning, he was going towards Essex.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you made no attempt to stop him? - A. No, because he was so far off.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know him; will you undertake to say it was the same man you saw at night? - A. Yes, I was close to him at night, I saw his face, for he turned round and looked at me, and according to the dress he had on the over night, and by the description I had of him, and what I saw of him the night before, I am sure it is the same, I will swear to his face.</p>
               <p>Q. What, at the distance of one hundred yards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He passed by you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you pursue him then? - A. Because I wanted to go down to the Justice, and as he did not seem to wish to leave the place; as I was going to the Justice afterwards, a woman called to me, and asked me if I should know the man again, if I saw him, that got away the over-night; I said I should, and she gave me some information: I then went on to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go after him? - A. Not then; when we came back from the Justice we agreed to go into the Ship to have some refreshment; Bangs went in before me, and Brown was in there along with another Irishman; he ran out as soon as Bangs went in, and Bangs said there he goes; I ran after him over the brick-fields, and he had just got to the stile as I got up to him; I detained him and asked him where he was going to.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an opportunity of having a close view of him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be positive he was the person you saw with the woman in the Grove? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing was said to him, but he ran out directly? - A. Not that I heard; I was going towards the house, and was within about twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Bangs go in? - A. Yes, and immediately the prisoner Brown ran out.</p>

               <p>Q. When were you applied to on this business? - A. On the 4th of October; I saw the three prisoners, another man, and the prosecutor together, at the White Hart, at Tottenham; I asked Mr. Cantrill if he knew what company he had in the taproom, he said, no; I told him, I thought they were smashers, and to be careful what money he took.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them go out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the same room with them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you see them? - A. I had been at dinner there, and came into the tap-room up to the bar, I saw them as I crossed the tap-room up to the bar, and went back again into the room where I left my company; I saw no more of them till I was sent for to take them into custody and to take them before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the three prisoners are the persons who were in company with the prosecutor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any one of them before? - A. Yes, Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sent for at night or in the morning? - A. At night, when there were only two taken, Haley and the woman, and in the morning I was sent for to take Brown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. Q. Where did you see me before? - A. At Mr. Nixon's, the Roebuck.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see the transaction yourself? - A. I saw three or four persons running away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prosecutor before? - A. No,</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any woman among them? - A. I cannot say, there was not light enough to distinguish.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did they run? - A. They ran different ways; the prosecutor cried out, watch; at first I thought it was a squabble, and could hardly think it was a robbery; when it was cried out a second time I went up to him, he was on the footpath, and he told me he had been knocked down and robbed by two men and a woman, who had ran away; I desired him to see where the watchmen were, upon which he called as hard as he could; I said I would go forward and take care they should not get towards London; being on horseback I got on rather fast; I met Mews, the coachman, and told him the circumstances; as I returned back towards the spot where the robbery was committed, on the dark side of the road, there was Haley under the trees, and he crossed over towards the side on which the coachman was; I asked him where his companions were; he said he did not know; his giving me that answer, gave me suspicion he had been in company before with them; the coachman took hold of him, and said, he must be one; we were going to take him to the prosecutor, who, at that instant, came up, and said, that was the man who had knocked him down, and that he would swear to him: I think the prisoner said, he had never seen him before; I desired them to see where the others were, and I would go on; I went on, and overtook another man, whom I supposed was the other; he was very near a watch-box, and I said, do you know any thing of the robbery at Tottenham?</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Brown? - A. It was not Brown, but another man; I desired him to come back, he said he had been knocked down himself; I then took him and gave him in charge to the watchman, who let him go as soon as I left him, which I think it is very fit the trustees should know of; I then went back, and found they had got the woman; the prosecutor certainly was in liquor, and must have lost fight of them before they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you think so? - A. Because, between the time he was robbed, and when they were taken, must take two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not yourself see the robbery? - A. There was a general run when I came up; my coming up, I suppose, was the cause of their running; I lost sight of them, and so must he; though it was moon light, it was a very dark moon-light.</p>
               <p>Court. I did not understand him to have said they were not out of his fight till they were taken, but from the time they left the public-house, till the robbery was committed.</p>

               <p>Quinland's defence. All I have to say is, that I am a poor lone girl, and have no one to take my part; being quite a stranger in London, as I have worked chiefly in Essex, I was told to go to Fdmonton, where I should find some work; I went, and met with these two men, standing at a publichouse door, and the prosecutor and his partner; the prosecutor was the first who asked me where I was going, I said, I should go no farther, if I could get lodgings there; he said, he would stop with me; I told him, I would not wish to trust myself with strange people I did not know; we went into a public-house to refresh ourselves, and the prosecutor went in with us, and told us, if we were bound for London, he would go along with us; he called for a pint of beer, and went out for some victuals, we called for a pot, and said, we would not be under a compliment to him while we could pay for a pint; we came out of that house and went into another, but I don't know which it is; we had some beer there, and four half pints of peppermint; the prosecutor began to offer me every thing he had got, his pocket-book, notes and all, if I would go with him; he told me he was a single man, and if I would go home with him, he would settle so much a year on me; I said, I did not want any such thing, that I was not of that cast, for that I always worked hard for my bread; he came out into the road, and laid hold of my hand, I pulled it away, and he said I would rather go with some other fellow than himself; then he stripped off his coat and hat, and said, he would fight the best man in the street; one of the men took him up, and struck him three times with a stick; we got him away from them, and got him to go along with us; we had walked but a few yards, when he got hold of me, and said, I should not go any farther; my fellow prisoners said, they might get into a bobble if they stopped any longer with us, for we were all drunk; I began to scream, and he let me loose, when he found that people came up; I was making towards this man to save me, and to take me to London, upon which he called out watch, and took up this man directly; I staid where I was, being so much amazed, that I did not know which way to go, and I stopped behind; I was then going to look for

               <p>Prisoner Brown's defence. (Read.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I humbly crave the indulgence of this Honourable Court to hear this paper read; for being unused to appear in this situation, I am not able to speak with that accuracy necessary to make my innocence appear, which I trust it will. I am a labourer, and went to get a job at Edmonton, and had engaged to work there the next day; going back to London, I met my fellow prisoners refreshing themselves; on their saying they were going to London, we agreed to walk together. Soon after we were overtaken by the prosecutor and another man; they asked us to to drink; we consented, and went into the Red Lion; the prosecutor called for liquor, and insisted on treating us; we would not consent to it, but would each pay a share of the reckoning. After this we went to another house, where we had more liquor, and the prosecutor pressed very much to pay; he seemed to be intoxicated, and to make very free with Quinland, which she refused to let him do, and seemed much terrified. We then went out of the house, and a scuffle ensued between Haley and the prosecutor; a number of people collected round, and the prosecutor began to strip. Being alarmed at my situation, and the company I was in, I thought it best to leave them, for I had no knowledge of my fellow-prisoners. I heard the screams of a woman, and somebody running towards me, which was Quinland; she appeared to be frightened, and crying; she said the prosecutor had used her ill, and wanted to force her against her will; I saw the others coming up, and not liking their company, I went way; next day I was going to my work, and went into the house to have a pint of beer with the prosecutor, who asked me if I was in his company last night, and I said, yes, and he had me taken into custody. My Lord, I have here related a plain and simple tale of facts, and humbly trust my case to your decision, fully confident a poor and friendless man will find that commiseration his innocence and unhappy condition requires.</p>

Last Friday week I was at work in the London Road, at Mr. Barber's, stick-manufactory, when my brother came to me, and asked me if I was busy; I said not particularly, for it was the first day I had been at work there; he asked me if I could step along with him, and he would satisfy me for my trouble; I asked leave of my master to go, and went with him home to Westminster; he asked me if I knew of any person where I could leave a bundle for him; I told him I had nobody to leave it with as I knew of, but I would go to Mr. Ellswood's wife, and ask her if she would let me leave it there; I went, accompanied by my brother, and left it there, saying, I would call for it in the morning; as such I did not call till the Monday following, and we were both taken into custody; I know nothing more of the property.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you? - A. A servant to Mr. Page, in St. John-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with Pamphlin, the deceased? - A. Yes, about six months before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you meet with him on Monday the 4th of October? - A. About 20 minutes before nine o'clock at night; he came to the Bell public-house, Clerkenwell-green, where I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink any thing there? - A. Yes, we had some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree to go away together? - A. No, Pamphlin went first about three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in liquor? - A. He was not quite drunk: he was the worse for liquor, but was able to walk and talk.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of beer had you? - A. There<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270077"/>were seven or eight in company, and I suppose we had a pot of beer a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see Pamphlin again? - A. At the steps going into the Sessions-house, Hicks's-hall, by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up to him, was it proposed and agreed to that you should go home together to Goswell-street? - A. Yes; I live in Old-street, Pamphlin lived in Pear-tree-street; we proceeded as far as Aylesbury-street from the steps at Hicks'shall, when I told him my nearest way was to turn down St. John's-street, and go down Sutton-street, towards Old-street; he said it was no great round for me to go along Compton-street; upon which I agreed to go that way.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get to Compton-street? - A. About half past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you got in Compton-street before any thing happened to you? - A. Close to the <placeName id="t18021027-103-crimeloc574">Harrow public-house, in Compton-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Were you then walking a-breast or not? - A. I was before Pamphlin about two or three yards, as near as I can say, walking one after the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you come to the public-house, is there a fruit-shop? - A. Yes, a green-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You being before Pamphlin, what occurred there? - A. I passed two young women.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they? - A. At the green-shop, one was half and half in the door-way, and the other standing on the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Pamphlin seem as if he was speaking to them? - A. Not at first; I cannot say whether he missed his step, and caught hold of the young woman to save himself, or whether he caught hold of her wilfully, I cannot say, for I kept walking on, and might be six or eight yards before him when I missed him.</p>


               <p>Q. Whether from his missing his step or not, did you hear the women say any thing? - A. I heard one of the women say, "I am not one of that sort;" says Pamphlin,</p>
               <p>"I like you the better for that;" then I heard the name of Jem called out, but I cannot say by whom; I returned back to Pamphlin, and asked him to come along home; as soon as I spoke, three men came round him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they come from? - A. From the Harrow, as near as I can say; they did not come further than from the public-house door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any person of their description in the street before that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the three persons that you suppose came out of the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Briscoe was the first, and another, of the name of Smith, was close to him, and Denham.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say that Smith, was the first who made any attempt? - A. No, Briscoe; I saw him make two attempts at Pamphlin, first with his fists; and observed that three or four more came round me, so that I was separated from Pamphlin.</p>
               <p>Q. Who surrounded you? - A. I know none but Denham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other attempt made by any body on Pamphlin, except what you have stated? - A. No, because I was separated from him, and drawn to the other side of the street, where I tried to make my escape, which I did at last.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you made your escape, did you receive any injury? - A. I did not know of any, except one blow in the face, which I had a black eye through; that was all I knew of till I got home to my lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see Pamphlin? - A. He overtook me before I got to the top of Compton-street, into Goswell-street, and asked me how I came off; I said I had a blow in the face, and was afraid I should have a black eye.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any complaint? - A. He complained of his sides being very sore, and did not know what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you part? - A. Just at Mr. Gordon's, in Goswell-street; he went up Peartree-street, and I went home, to No. 3, Dolphin-court, Old-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley, Counsel for Briscot and Denham. Q. Your back was towards Pamphlin when this affray took place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These young women had been buying fruit, or something? - A. I cannot say; I passed them.</p>
               <p>Q. The first thing you heard was one of them say, we are not of your sort? - A. Those were the first words.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say you turned round, and saw Pamphlin strike against one of them? - A. It was before she made use of those words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see whether it was between her thighs, or upon her thighs, that he happened to strike? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You don't know whether it was about the thighs that he happened awkwardly to take her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That woman he struck turned out to be the wife of Briscoe? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not one of the women run to the publichouse before any of the men came out, and make an alarm? - A. I don't know; I heard the name of</p>
               <p>"Jem</p>
               <p>"called out.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know whether it was by accident or design he fell against the woman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you account for her saying, I am not one of your sort, unless he put his hand upon her by design? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any of the polite language he made use of? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any observation made by him? - A. I heard Pamphlin say, he liked her the better for that.</p>
               <p>Q. When the men came out, Briscoe squared at him with his fists? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270078"/>Q. Pamphlin was a strong sturdy fellow, was not he? - A. He was a strong young man.</p>
               <p>Q. As big again as Briscoe, was not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After Briscoe squared at him, did you not see him knock Briscoe down? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Briscoe on the ground at all, as if he had been knocked down? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Smith was the second person who came up? - A. Smith was close to Briscoe.</p>
               <p>Q. Denham was third man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you were separated from Pamphlin by the other people that came round you, Smith remained with the deceased; he did not attack you? - A. I cannot say whether he did or not; I partly judge he was one of the party, but cannot say positively only to Denham.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Smith one of the persons that remained with the deceased? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you say whether he was one who attacked you? - A. I partly think he was one by his size and description.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you say whether Smith remained with the deceased, or came up to you? - A. I cannot tell where Smith was after I was separated from the deceased; he was first with Briscoe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Have you never said that Smith was the person who used the knife, and cut you? - A. No, I saw no knives.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see a knife in the hands of Briscoe or Denham? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you say what time it took up? - A. It might be about five minutes from the first commencement till Pamphlin overtook me; it did not last longer than three or four minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Therefore, if any conversation passed between the women and the other persons, you not being out of the house, did not hear it? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Since you have known of the 50 guineas reward, have not the officers and witnesses been talking of it? - A. I have heard it talked of in company.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him accidentally on the 6th of October? - A. Yes, about six o'clock, at the corner of Cradle-court, St. John's-street, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. I passed him; but he said, "Jem, how are you?" I said, "how do you do;" as we walked up St. John's-street, he said, "did you bear of the row?" I said, "no further than seeing the papers;" he said, "he, his wife, her filler, and Denham, were together at the Harrow, with some more, on Monday evening; that about half past nine his wife and sister went to buy some fruit, and met two men; that one of them said to Mrs. Briscoe, come here, and I'll turn up the lap of your liver, and to the other he said, go home, Ma'am, or I'll kick your a -; that then Briscoe went up to him, and asked him what he wanted; that the man said, to wring his nose, and Briscoe said, he stabbed him in the side with a knife."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he got the knife from? - A. No, he did not; he said, that the man said oh! that he followed him, and gave it him again, meaning that he stabbed him again; that Denham came out and said to Briscoe, "Jem, shut your knife, and come away;" and that then they went again into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what became of the man? - A. No, but he told me that the man said he should know the knife by its having a long buck's-born handle.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the man that was stabbed? - A. Yes, and he told me, that in the morning when he awoke he looked at the knife, and found it all blood in the socket, which was caked like bullock's liver, and that he threw it down the necessary; he said he thought the man would know him by the white buttons on his coat; that he would get his white buttons cut off, and have others put on; that a few days before he had sharpened the knife, and tempered it so, that it would not turn against any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What way of life are you in? - A. A farrier.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always got you livelihood by being a farrier? - A. No, but I have lately; I have been at work near six months.</p>

I was sitting in the chandler's-shop where we lodged, he went to bed and I followed him; he appeared as if he was rather in liquor, and he laid himself down on the bed; I told him to get into bed, but he did not; I then got into bed, and he lay as he was, till the candle went out, which might be about an hour; I called to him to get into bed, for he would get cold; he said, he could not, and asked me to help him; I went down stairs for a candle, and when I came up again, I told him to strip, he said, he could not; I pulled off his cloaths, and got him to bed, but I found a great quantity of blood, when I pulled his cloaths off, on his left-side, rather behind, under his arm; I fetched a surgeon, who dressed his wounds; one was under the blade-bone, and the other at the bottom of the belly; these two were found out that night, next morning, another was found on the other side his belly, just answering the other; he was then taken to the hospital.</p>

I have no doubt it was; I have every reason to suppose it, though I cannot positively say, perhaps neglect might be partly the cause, though I don't think it was curable; the other wound was not sufficient to kill him, but that was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the deceased? - A. I asked him if he had had any quarrel? - A. He said, no, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to believe he was conscious that death awaited him? - A. I don't think he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You are of opinion that his wounds being neglected might occasion his death? - A. We look upon all wounds in the intestines, as mortal, but notwithstanding that, there have been some cases where such wounds have been cured.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no doubt also, that a wound may be inflamed, and that inflammation may be promoted by a variety of means? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not intoxication have that effect? - A. Yes, certainly, but he had lost a considerable quantity of blood, which would counteract that.</p>
               <p>Q. All you mean to say, is, that you believe it was the cause of his death? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was there any thing to justify your opinion, that neglect had taken place? - A. I don't think in any great degree, because inflammation don't come on so very quick, and we had him within twelve hours after the wound.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. A constable, and produce a jacket belonging to the deceased, and a knife which was taken from Baker; as I stood by his side in the office, he offered it to somebody to give it to his father, and heard him say, "give this to my father."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. That is not a buck-horn handle knife? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Briscoe's defence. I have only to say, that I went to the assistance of my wife, but had no weapon of any kind whatever; I am thoroughly innocent of the charge made against me, and firmly believe the witness, Smith, to be the person who did it.</p>
               <p>Denham's defence. My Lord, I am innocent, but I really believe Smith to be the man who did the mischief.(Baker was not put upon his defence.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley here submitted to the Court, that Mrs. Briscoe was a competent witness in behalf of Denham, although she could not be so for her husband, but inasmuch as her husband and Denham were both trying upon one indictment, Denham was intitled to the advantage of the evidence.</p>
               <p>The Court were of opinion, that she could not be admitted an evidence for Denham, without being an evidence for her husband, which, according to the cases determined, could not be admitted, and therefore rejected her testimony.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. A coal-heaver, and live in St. John's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Smith, the witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the Thursday after this unfortunate affair, seeing him? - A. Yes; at his father's garden, No. 8, Sleigh's-alley, St. John's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about himself? - A. Yes; he said he came out of the Harrow on the Monday night, when the name of Jem was called, that he was the first that came out and stabbed the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. How came you to be at the garden? - A. He sent his sister for me, and she said her brother wanted to speak to me.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the Thursday - did you see any bills up about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what had happened? - A. No, not till he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you, when his sister found you? - A. At my father's, No. 13.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he introduce the conversation? - A. When I went in to him, I asked him how it was, and what he wanted me for.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by how it was? - A. I wanted to know what he wanted with me; it was rather a mistake in speaking the word; then he told me the affair that happened on Monday night, and said, Briscoe and Denham were of the party; he said, that the two girls went out, and were insulted by two brewer's servants, and that being used so very ill, Briscoe's wife called out Jem.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you who came out of the house? - A. He said, he was the first, and that Briscoe followed, and Denham followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Only those three? - A. Only those three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you whether he stabbed more than one? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you whether he stabbed him once, twice, or ten times? - A. No, he told me he stabbed him, and that satisfied me, and I asked no further, but went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Briscoe? - A. Yes, about five or six years; I knew Denham only a short time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know they were, either of them in custody at that time? - A. I heard Briscoe was taken up on Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not some suspicion it was for what he, Smith, had done? - A. No, he did not tell me any thing about his being confined.</p>
               <p>Q. Finding Briscoe was taken up, and Smith telling you he was in his company, did it not come into your mind he was taken up for the same thing? - A. It did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand Briscoe lives in the same alley with you? - A. He had for a short time.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not call upon his friends and tell them this? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The bills were posted up on the Wednesday? - A. I did not see or hear of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you know there was suspicion against Briscoe? - A. When Smith told me on the Thursday, that they were taken on the Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. They lived in the same alley with you - Briscoe's wife and sister were taken up, were they not? - A. Yes, on Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you first? - A. Royston.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that? - A. Smith used to be called so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you Briscoe was taken? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he sent to you to tell you he was the man that had done it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you went before a Justice and told all this? - A. No, I did not; I did not relate it to any body, till the prisoners were sent to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Those men, being your friends, did you not know they were examined five times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go any one of the times? - A. Yes, the officers came and fetched me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell what you have told now? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Smith and Briscoe there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Denham? - A. No, not till the last day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing of Smith accusing them? - A. No; I did not know that he had turned any way against them; I understood they were all to be tried for the murder in Compton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not tell the officers you knew nothing about it? - A. I did, and I knew nothing about it; they asked me if I was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened you to mention it now? - A. Because I thought it very wrong for any person to be accused wrongfully, and when I knew he went to speak against the others, I mentioned it, or I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been at work since Tuesday? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at work on Thursday, when Smith sent for you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never mentioned this, till the prisoners were in Newgate? - A. No, because I did not know Smith had turned against them, which I first heard at the Hat and Tun public-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. So long as Smith did not accuse any body else, you did not accuse him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you found he did, you told his secret? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does you employment lead you to? - A. To Mr. Eddington's, at Blackstiars.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you return at night? - A. About dark, and go about five in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270084"/>Q. On the Wednesday, had you any opportunity of knowing, at Blackstiars, what was passing at home? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Those bills were posted on the Wednesday, and you did not see them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>HENRY CROSSWELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are turnkey at the New-Compter? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the prisoner, Denham? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come to the prison? - A. Last Monday, he came to me, and told me, he came to surrender himself, concerning a bill that was stuck up in Compton-street, about a murder; I refused at first to receive him, but he insisted upon stopping.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you refuse to receive him? - A. I told him I did not know any thing of him, neither had I seen any of the bills.</p>
               <p>Q. He importuned you, however, till you did receive him? - A. He did.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had the misfortune to be confined in the New-Compter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For some crime or other? - A. Yes; upon suspicion of felony.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been tried, or discharged? - A. I was discharged at Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you confined there? - A. In a cell; I was let out morning and night.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were there, did you happen to meet with Smith, who has been a witness here? - A. Yes, he answered to the name of Royston</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the man, (pointing to Smith?) - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he? - A. Close to the place where I got the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it happen, that while you were in prison, you talked with each other, about what you were confined for? - A. Yes; I spoke to him two or three times, by the name of Royston; I was getting a pot of water, and I heard him at his cell door; I went up to his cell.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there an opening near where you get the water? - A. There are some bars where I could just see the head of the man, and his handkerchief; he had a red silk handkerchief on; he got up upon the lock of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When a man gets up upon the lock, can he be seen on the outside of the cell? - A. Yes, he can; I said to him, young man, what are you confined for? he made answer, and said, it is all right with me; I made answer again, and said, how do you make that out, (this was in the evening) and he said he had been called down in the morning, and said, he should be anevidence; that he stuck the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. That is all you have got to say, is it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you the satisfaction of being in the New-Prison? - A. I went in on the Saturday evening, and staid till yesterday was a week.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you had never been in that prison before? - A. Yes, I had, the more is my misfortune.</p>
               <p>Q. More than once? - A. No, not more than once; I was put in because I would not pay a fine; I was put in fourteen days.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not see into the cell, without getting upon the lock? - A. Smith got on the lock.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say you could only see his head and his handkerchief? - A. I could only see that.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that? - A. Yes, I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see any other part of him at all? - A. No farther than seeing him go down the stairs once.</p>
               <p>Q. But at the time you are speaking of, you only saw his head and his handkerchief? - A. That is all.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it? - A. On Thursday, about the day before I came out; it was the very day before I came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, perhaps, you are not in the secret that he was admitted an evidence only last Tuesday? - A. I don't know, only that some gentlemen had been with him, and he said, it was all right with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure what he said, was the day before you came out, the day before Friday week? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that he was the man that had stuck the man? - A. Yes; he said he had stuck the man in the side.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never heard when he was admitted as an evidence? - A. Not till he told me the gentlemen said he should be admitted as an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you desired to come here? - A. On the Thursday evening last; they told me I was subpoened here.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you so? - A. The father belonging to one of the prisoners told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in that strong place since the prisoner has been committed? - A. I have been once; I went there this morning, and took their breakfasts.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a little conversation on the business, I suppose? - A. All the three prisoners said, I must come here and speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You told them what you could say? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath you never told them? - A. No, upon my oath, I never told them what I should say here.</p>
               <p>Q. Smith, you say, told you a week ago, he should be admitted an evidence - how soon did you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270085"/>tell that to any body? - A. On the Friday that I came out of prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that you told of it? - A. Mr. Burt.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is he? - A. I believe he is one of the constables.</p>
               <p>Q. Belonging to where? - A. I cannot tell, whether he belongs to Hatton-Garden, or whether he belongs to the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him of it on the Friday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not tell the prisoner of it, or any solicitor of theirs? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you swear you were subpoened? - A. On Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean in the prison? - A. No, Thursday last, the night before last.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you subpoenaed? - A. The father of Briscoe told me I was subpoenaed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then had you any subpoena served upon you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the New Prison the only prison that you know? - A. Yes, the only prison I was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Except Newgate, you know? - A. Not for any misdemeanor.</p>

               <p>ATKIN PHILLIPS sworn. - I keep the Magpie and Horseshoe in Burleigh-street; the prosecutor and prisoner lodged with me, the prisoner for about six months, he is a porter: on the night of the 26th of October they were drinking together in the taproom about three hours, several others were with them in the course of the time; I wanted the prosecutor to go to bed about twelve o'clock, but he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270086"/>would not, as he was in liquor; the prisoner was more sober than him; as I had got every body else to bed, I gave the prisoner a bit of candle and told him to help the prosecutor; I went to bed and left them alone; between two and three o'clock I heard a noise, and the prosecutor said he had been robbed; I know nobody was there but the prosecutor and him, and thought it was the effect of liquor, therefore I would not get up; between eight and nine in the morning the prosecutor said he was robbed, upon which I went up to the prisoner in his own room in bed, and asked him if he knew any thing of the man's money; he said he did not; I said I must be under the necessity of sending for a constable to search him; he said I might if I pleased; I fetched a constable, and his room was searched, but nothing found there; he was taken to Bow-street; he did not seem to wish to get away, but sat himself down very quiet till the office came.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prosecutor changing a note? - A. Yes, in the early part of the evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was drinking with the prosecutor and two soldiers till about half past two, and Mr. Phillips desired I would see the prosecutor to bed; before we two left the tap-room he was very much agitated, and fancied he saw his mother stand before him, and attempted to shake hands with her, but when he had lost her he went into a sort of hysterical sit for about a minute or so, and his eyes run over with water; I got him as far as the stairs and he was taken in the same manner, exclaiming, "Oh, my mother!" he said, that although he knew she was dead, he had been four hours on his knees in hopes he might see her again; then he began to pray to himself, and I begged him to go to bed, saying I would say prayers for him; I got him to bed and fetched my prayer-book, and read two or three evening prayers to him; I was going for a candle and he begged me not to leave him; I went for the candle and returned again instantly, but before I entered the door he called to me "where is my small cloaths;" I entered the room and pointed my finger to the floor, saying, there they lay; he said, give them to me; I did so; he pulled out his notes and counted them over and his cash, he then said he had been robbed of two or three guineas and two or three notes; I said I knew nothing of it; he said I must, for nobody else had been there; I wished him to search me, but he would not, only said he would take me to Bow-street next morning; he went to Phillips but he would not get up, as he did not believe him; in the morning they sent for an officer; I never attempted to get out of the house, which I might have done had I been guilty. <rs id="t18021027-104-verdict583" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Did any women come in? - A.

               <p>Q. Will you tell me who the lady was at whose house you slept the night before, and who you slept with? - A. I slept with no woman, I had the bed to myself; I was going round the corner of a street the night before and met two girls, whom I asked where I could get lodging; they took me to a house where I slept, but they did not sleep there; I paid sixpence for my bed, it was the day I came from the country.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The prisoner staid in his lodgings till he was taken up? - A. Yes, he was taken in bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you both occupy the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And both live in it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other partner? - A. No; I sleep in the one-pair of stairs: On the 10th of October, about one in the morning, my wife waked me, saying, there was a noise up stairs; I jumped up in the bed, and listened, I heard some person walking without shoes over my heard; I heard a watchman's rattle spring in the street at the same time; I immediately jumped out of bed, and went to the window of the front room; I then opened the window, looked out, and asked what was the matter; the watchman said, there is a ladder; I looked down, and saw a ladder like a lamplighter's ladder, upon the leads of the shop window; the ladder reached to the two-pair of stairs window; my wife said, they were making their escape backwards; I learned that somebody had jumped out of the two-pair of stairs window backwards; I then took down one of the pistols from the mantle piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loaded? - A. Yes; I lifted up the fash of my bed-room window, which he had passed by; I put out a pistol with intent to fire, but did not see any body, the pistol missed fire; I then shut down the window again, and took down the other pistol; I then went to the window of the front room, got out upon the leads, and took down the ladder; I put it down to the watchmen, and desired some of them to come up that ladder; two came up into the front dining-room on the same floor that I sleep on; I told them to follow me up stairs; they followed me up into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room where you heard somebody walking, the warehouse? - A. Yes, both back and front; we then went up into the garnet, but we could not find any body; we then went down stairs, and I let in another watchman, and opened the yard door, and told them I was sure we should find one there; I then saw the prisoner at the bar lying on the ground; I presented a pistol at him, and told him, if he did not tell me where the rest were, I would blow his brans out; the pistol being full cocked, went off by accident.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mean to shoot him, when you had him in your power? - A. No; it was quite by accident; the flags entered the wall, about three inches above his head; the powder searched hisforehead a little, and he put his hand to his face, he cried out, O Lord, O'Lord; I was afraid I had shot him, but when the smoke went on one side, I saw I had not; he desired the watchman to take him to the watch-house; he complained that his arm was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. That appeared to be so, did it? - A. No, his shoulder was wrenched; he had jumped from the two-pair of stairs window, which is between 20 and 30 feet from the ground, and he had fell upon the gutter at my bed-room window, and forced the holdfast out; his arm was not broke, but he was very much hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ladder long enough to get upon the leads? - A. Yes; and then from the position of the ladder, he must have assisted himself by the ball irons; the prisoner told me he had brought the ladder from Lord John Cavendish's, near Vigo-lane; there were two ladders locked together, and he had picked the lock, and brought it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that your front two-pair of stairs window was shut down? - A. It was shut down within six or eight inches; it is left open, because the moth is apt to breed quick; but if there is air, they don't breed so quick.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen it? - A. I was in the warehouse sending some goods down the well after eleven o'clock that night.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are positive that at that time it was down within six or eight inches? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any property? - A. I found eleven gowns removed from the rack in the twopair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these gowns had been upon the rack the night before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they lying? - A. There was one gown open on the floor, and the other ten were upon it, ready to tie up.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from where you had left them? - A. About a yard and a half; they were the bottom her in the rack, it was quite full, and they were all pulled out.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not have pulled out that parcel yourself the night before, without having known it? - A. No; one of the gowns was opened, the ticket taken off, and the other ten laid upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of those things? - A. The officer has got them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't with to give the Court any further trouble, I am guilty of the fact.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it? - A. About nine o'clock in the afternoon of Monday the 11th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body attack you? - A. Yes, a single person; I was in the act of getting under a stile; I heard a voice say stop, stop; I went on, I turned round, and saw him run; I did not at the first moment observe he had a pistol holding out towards me; knowing it was a gentleman I had before seen in the fields I did not think his intentions were to rob me, I turned about and went on a little bit; the man said, stop, d-n you stop, or I will blow your brains out; I said, what do you want with me; he said, all that you have got about you, d-n you stop and give it me or I will blow your brains out, or something to that effect; he came up to the stile with the pistol in his hand; I then stopped and gave him what I had, a metal watch, with a black shagreen case, two shillings, and two sixpences; he said, d-n you don't look at me, I am not to be looked at.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a good deal alarmed? - A. I was a great deal alarmed; he said, don't look which way I go; he went away and I went to my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to your wife? - A. He asked her for what she had got about her; what she said I don't know, but I afterwards heard him say I won't take that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, upon the whole, was he with you? - A. Not above two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take particular notice of him? - A. Not at that time; I had seen the man that robbed me twice before in the fields within the hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had an opportunity of seeing him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you see him at the Justice's? - A. I saw him on the Friday following at Knightsbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you positive of his person before the Justice? - A. I believed he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you positive at that time? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it now makes you less positive? - A. I cannot justly say; I have some doubts as to the identify of the person.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very positive at that time, how came these doubts to arise in your mind? - A. It is a very serious thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care what you swear; do you or not, upon consideration, believe that is the man, for if you screen him from justice you are guilty of perjury? - A. I have my doubts.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence do your doubts arise, what makes you doubt now when you were so certain before the Justice, is there any thing you did not observe at that time in his person? (Hesitates.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him, is there any thing about his person that you, did not see at that time and that you do see now? - A. I have my doubts.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270093"/>Q. But from whence does that doubt arise; because unless you tell us from whence it arises, it creates a suspicion in one's mind? - A. I have my doubts.</p>

               <p>Q. You were not at all alarmed? - A. I was a little alarmed, but I was sure I should know the man again, having seen and twice before.</p>

               <p>Q. At his lodgings? - A. No, in the public road: On Monday, the 18th of October, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; I took him to the Marquis of Granby, and searched him; I found nothing upon him but two shillings and a few halfpence in his pocket; no duplicates of any kind whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask him his place of abode, and did he not tell you? - A. No, he refused to tell me; he said he lived in the neighbourhood of Brompton, but he would not tell me where he lived, though I asked him several times; he told me if I would treat him like a gentleman, he would go quietly with me to Bow-street; I took him there, and the prosecutors both seemed to be very positive to his person.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there a gate through which persons come into the yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a private watchman in the yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A person of the name of Holliday, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you go to bed that night? - A. At ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the house fast when you went to bed? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the private watchman on duty in the yard at that time? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time, in the course of the night, were you awaked? - A. A little before two o'clock; on Wednesday morning, the 6th of October, I was awaked by a singular noise, as if it proceeded from the yard; I listened, but did not hear a repetition of the noise, and therefore concluded it might be an engine, or some workmen that might be at work in the yard, not knowing, at that time the hour in the morning; I laid down to sleep, and was again alarmed by a crash, as if it was in the dwellinghouse; I got up, and went softly down stairs, listening as I went, to ascertain if my doubts were just; when I got a little below the first landing-place, on the stairs, I saw a glimmering light in the parlour, and could hear people talk, and could plainly see that the house-door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the door was not open when you went to bed? - A. Yes, I fastened it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock it? - A. No, I left it on the spring-lock; I went out at the door so opened, and proceeded up the yard to the accompting-house, where I found the private watchman of the yard; I informed him there were thieves in the house, and desired that he would arm himself, and come with me, and assist in taking them; I proceeded again to the accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he arm himself to accompany you? - A. He did not, though I desired him several times; I went into the accompting-house, seized the firepoker, and desired him to come along with me, which he did; we proceeded across the hall together, towards the parlour door, two of the men immediately came out of the parlour into the hall; I struck at them with the poker; a scuffle ensued, and the watchman's light was immediately put out; I instantly went outside of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to have any thing about them? - A. When I struck with the poker, some of the plate sell down from them; two of the men rushed out at the street-door; I called out, stop thieves, one man sprang over the rails, and ran towards the gates; I made a blow at the prisoner, Johnson.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say, the prisoner, Johnson, had you light enough to see his person? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that you have since learned is Johnson? - A. I know him by never having lost fight of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It was not Johnson that sprang over? - A. No, another man sprang over the rails; I knock him down, and struck him again as he was rising, his hat came off. I knocked him down twice; he then proceeded towards the yard gate, I pursuing him, and striking him as he ran.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get over the rails? - A. Those rails go from the outside of the steps, leading to the dwelling-house; there are about five steps from the yard to the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get over the rails? - A. No, I threw him head long down the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. What gates do you mean? - A. The yard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270095"/>gates; the rails were only on each side of the steps, there are no rails at the bottom; I then pursued him, striking him as he ran.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did your watchman attempt to give you any assistance? - A. I never once saw him after I had desired him to arm himself; the first man had got through the wicket, while I was engaged with Johnson; Johnson was going through the wicket, and I struck him several blows as he was getting through; he then proceeded through the wicket, along Little Pulteney-street; I followed close to him, through Crown-court, until he came to Little Pulteney-street again, where he was met by the watchman, O'Donnel, and secured; I followed him close all the way, striking him several blows as he ran.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him before he was stopped by O'Donnell? - A. Never once; he was without his hat all the way he ran.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said, he lost his hat in the scuffle in the yard? - A. Yes, his hat was left in the yard, where I first knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then return to the house? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough to enable you to see the features of the other man? - A. No, there was not, it was quite dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon returning to the yard, did you find the hat belonging to Johnson? - A. It was picked up by the watchman, O'Donnell picked up one hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Were both hats dropped in the yard? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When you returned, did you see that which had fallen from the persons, when you attacked them? - A. I did, on my return to the house; I went into the parlour, and found an iron crow lying close to a cupboard that had been broke open, and in the hall, and across the yard, I found several articles of plate, which had been taken therefrom.</p>
               <p>Q. What articles? - A. Three silver bottlestands, several silver labels, a silver wine-strainer, and a silver waiter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find all the silver labels that had been taken away in the yard? - A. Some were found in the yard, and I believe the street watchman picked up one.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find the whole that were lost, in the yard, and in the house? - A. No; on examination, I found one silver bottle-stand missing, which has not since been found.</p>
               <p>Q. How had they got in? - A. By breaking the street door.</p>

               <p>Q. How were you able to ascertain that? - A. There were impressions of the crow upon the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. It appeared forced? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the lock of the street door? - A. The fastenings inside appeared to be very much strained; they were torn open, the screws were in a great measure drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. In such a way as a crow would have occasioned? - A. Yes; the door-posts were very much torn.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did the plate belong that was found? - A. The private property of Mr.

I apprehended the prisoner Johnson; I was on my beat a few minutes after two o'clock, I heard a cry of stop thief, upon which I pursued towards it; passing the top of Crown-court I saw the prisoner Johnson come running without his hat, I laid hold of him, we scuffled some time, and Mr. Jennings came up, having a weapon in his hand, which I believe was a poker, and desired me to hold him fast; I asked Mr. Jennings if that was the thief, he said it is if he has a cut in his head, so I turned him about to the lamp and accordingly he had, upon that I conducted him to Mr. Jennings's house, where we found a number of things lying.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a watchman, in Hopkins-street; a little after two o'clock in the morning, I heard the rattle spring; I ran from Husband-street into Hopkins-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with any body before you came to Green's-court? - A. When I came to the gateway, at the end of Green's court, I saw Remington, I then looked and saw a pair of white stockings standing up against a door which I found to be a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did that turn out to be? - A. That is the man (pointing to Shires); I took him to Mr. Jennings's, and from there to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. When you first heard the rattle you were in Husband-street? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Then if any person had gone through the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270097"/>gateway before you came up, that person must have gone a different way from that which you came? - A. I suppose so.</p>
