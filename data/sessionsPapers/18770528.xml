On May 8th I received informa<lb/>tion of a robbery at Mrs. Ward's—I examined the premises and afterwards went to Uxbridge Common with constable Moore where I apprehended the two Bradles—I told them the charge of breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Mrs. Ward, of Chapel Street, Uxbridge—before that I charged them with stealing a counterpane, table cloth, and other articles—they said "We did not break into the house, you want that girl with the bundle"—I said "There is a third party in it, where is she?"—they said "In a field by the railway bridge, near the militia barracks, with the bundle, waiting for us to return; we did have some of the gin that was taken"—I took them to the station and apprehended Brench on Uxbridge Moor, near the Pipemakers' Arms beer-house—I afterwards went to a green lane near the railway bridge and found a bundle tied in this tablecloth which contained a counterpane and a petticoat—they were buried in a lump of earth about a mile from the prosecutrix's house.</p>
               <p>John Bower (<hi rend="italic">Policeman X</hi> 220). I was with the last witness; his account is correct—I also found a bundle which contained this old dress and this dress (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mrs. Ward afterwards identified them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller, of 160, Kingsbridge Road, Milwall—on 14th May, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the night,. I was on Blackfriars Bridge, and sat down on one of the <hi rend="italic">resters</hi>, as I felt a bit drowsy—the prisoner came up with his friend and said "Look sharp you b—, or else you will lose your chance," and he drew my watch from my pocket, but I caught it and put it back and shouted "Police"—he and iris friend were kicking up a bother and running to and fro on the bridge as if they had not seen me—a policeman came up and I gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

On the morning of 14th May, about 12.15, I was on Blackfriars Bridge, heard a cry of "Police" I and saw the prosecutor and prisoner and another man chasing one another, and Dawkins said, pointing to the prisoner, that he had tried to take his watch—the prisoner said "Oh, no, it is your own mistake"—I took the prisoner to the station; he gave a wrong address.</p>

I was crossing Blackfriars Bridge with a friend, and a man who was coming the other way shoved me against this man on the seat—he said "You b—, you want my watch"—I went a few yards after the man to ask why he shoved up against me, and the prosecutor gave me in charge—I never touched his watch, but I was shoved against him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, New North Street, Theobald's Road—on 10th May, after 12.30, I was in New North Street with my wife, going home—we passed four young men standing under a lamp post—the prisoners are two of them—I have not the slightest doubt of that—as we passed, one of them pushed Patten right into my wife's face and the brim of his hat cut her across the nose—I turned to protect her and was struck by Uwins and knocked down by a blow between the eyes—the whole four then fell on me—I was beaten about the body, and two sovereigns were taken out of my waistcoat pocket, and 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. either fell or were taken from my trowsers pocket—I felt a hand in my pocket and am sure the two sovereigns were there—I cannot say whether they put their hands in my trowsers pocket—I saw the two prisoners there the whole of the time until I got up, and my wife and Mrs. Richards chased them, and I saw a man stop them 300 or 400 yards off—I followed as quickly as possible, and said to Uwins "I will make sure of you if I make sure of nobody else"—he had my hat on and I took it off him and placed it on my head—I saw Patten there too—a policeman came up and they were taken to the station and I charged them with assault and robbery—I was sober.</p>

I went to Camden Town about 6 o'clock and got the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there—we had one pot of malt liquor with my brother and then went home and had some supper and came out with my brother-in-law to post a letter and get a stamp—there was no row—I did not make a rush at Uwins—I felt a hand distinctly in my waistcoat pocket while Uwins and the others were on top of me—I said before the Magistrate that my money did not fall out of my waistcoat pocket, but it might possibly have fallen out of my trowsers pocket—Uwins was stopped by a man named Arnold, and I told Arnold I had been knocked down and robbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I am not related to Mrs. Richards she said that one of her teeth was knocked out—I did not know that she appeared at Clerkenwell and attributed that to a man she was living with—she said that she got her black eye from the man she was living with—it had been rather an exciting day for her, but not for me—I did not know that her name was Joyce—I know that her husband's name is Middleditch—it did not strike me as strange that she should be Mrs. Middleditch that day and Mrs. Richards at the police-court the following day, because her husband's name is Richard Middleditch, and she took the name of Richards not wishing to go in her marriage name—Joyce has lived with her in our house about four months—she had been with us and had a share of a pot of malt liquor between four of us—she did not strike any of the young men—she was not the least excited—she was not with my wife the whole evening—my wife was with me—my brother-in-law spoke more clearly to the men than my wife—I heard witnesses to character for Patten called before the Magistrate, and he was admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. When I charged Uwins I said that I had been knocked down coming out of Mr. Tucker's house—he said "What!

He was running when I stopped him, he was pursued—a woman was following him calling out "Stop him!"—that was the reason that I stopped him and Page came up and charged him with abusing him first, and then I let go of him, and Page said "He has robbed me of nearly 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I held him so long as he was charged with abusing him, but when he was charged with highway robbery I let him go—I heard that the assault was outside a particular public-house—I did not say "If I had known that I never would have stopped him," and then let him go—I knew where it happened because I heard a row in the Arthur Arms and came out—I was in that very public-house—I did not see either of the prisoners in that public-house that night—I did not come out and see the thing going on—I came out of the Arthur Arms, Mr. Tucker's—I heard the two women scream<lb/>ing and ran after the man and stopped him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in the Royal Navy and live at Walton House, West Cowes, Isle of Wight—I was introduced to the prisoner three or four years ago, as a stockbroker, by my brother, not personally, but he mentioned his name—prior to February this year I had various transactions with him in stock securities, and during the whole of that time I treated with him as a member of the Stock Exchange—I believe that he was a sworn broker—I had 364 shares in the Richmond Mining Company in the hands of Messrs. Robarts, and in February this year I wrote to the prisoner about selling them—this is the letter I wrote, and I received his reply on 13th February—I also received these other letters. (<hi rend="italic">These letters referred to a law suit in America against the Mining Company, and the possibility of bribery and corruption being practised on the Jury, and advised the prosecutor to sell his shares</hi>.) I afterwards received a telegram from the prisoner which I have destroyed, but the effect of it was that he strongly advised me to sell, and that he was quite sure his advice was sound—on 2nd March I telegraphed to the prisoner "Sell and pay into Robarts'; I will write to them"—on the same day I wrote this letter to Robarts "Cowes, March 2nd, 1871. Dear Sirs,—Will you give the certificate of my Richmond Consolidated Mining Company's Stock to Mr. A. H. Westaway for sale. Yours truly, A. W. Gillett."(<hi rend="italic">On this letter was written</hi> "Received 364 shares".) <hi rend="italic">On the same day I wrote this letter was written</hi> "Received 364 shares".) On the same day I wrote this letter to the prisoner confirming my telegram—on 3rd March I received from the defendant this sale note "Sold by order of Captain A. W. Gillett, R.N., 114 Richmond Consolidated Mining Shares,. 684<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; brokerage, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.: 678<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for 14th March"—that is signed by the prisoner, I know his writing—on 3rd or 4th March I received this further sold note "March 3rd, 1871. Sold by order of Captain A. W. Gillett, R.N., 250 Richmond Mining Shares, 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; brokerage, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.: 1,487<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—those were both for 14th March—on the 12th prior to the settlement I wrote this letter "Cowes, March 12th, 1877. Dear Sir,—When you receive the money for the Richmonds pay it into my account at Robarts'. Your advice in my affairs has been so uniformly disastrous that I am afraid to take it again; you have nearly ruined me as it is. It was a very bad day for me that I ever consulted you about a revision of my securities, but it has taught me a very bitter lesson. Yours, very truly, A. W. Gillett"—I afterwards received this letter from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This stated:</hi> Egyptain Stock is very strong. I only advise it in consequence of the loss: you have made in Richmonds, &amp;c. Richmonds are weak.") In answer to that I wrote this letter, enclosing the transfer of 87 shares—I then received a further letter from the prisoner advising the buying of Egyptian's—up to "this time I had received no advice from my bankers as to the payment of the money to them—on 23rd March I wrote "Yours to hand. If the Tasmanian Line is likely to advance in price I had better not sell just yet. I am desperately afraid of speculation, I have suffered so much and my means are so limited, but 1 think I will venture 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Unified and 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the 5 per Cent.

               <p>—on April 5th I wrote this letter to the prisoner "Dear Sir,—When you have got them, place the Egyptian certificates in Robarts' hands, also the balance of the money," &amp;c.; and on the 6th I received this letter from the prisoner "Dear Sir,—The slight delay in the delivery of the New Egyptian Securities is owing to the conversion still going on, but the 10th instant is the last day for doing this, when the conversion will be closed, I will then deposit the bonds and balance with Messrs. Robarts"—I wrote to him again about 24th April, about the Egyptian Bonds and received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 26th April</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner, requesting Mr. Gillett to run up to town to see him about the Egyptian clock, and to send a telegram stating at what time he would be there</hi>.) On 27th April I telegraphed to him that I would be there between 3 and 4 o'clock, and I went up to town and saw him—he said, "I am sorry I cannot deliver the Egyptian Stock or the money"—I said "Why not?"—he said that the war and various things prevented him—I said "What has the war got to do with my money! the money was given you for a specific object, buying Egyptian Stock;" and I asked him if he had got the money for the Richmond Shares, he said "Yes, if you will give me three or six months time I will repay it"—I said that I could make no arrangement without taking advice—he said "If anything transpires about it I shall not be able to get back on the Stock Exchange"—I said "Are you not on the Stock Exchange?"—he said "No, I have failed"—I said what business had you to be dealing with me if you are not on the Stock Exchange 1 had I known that you had failed I should not have employed you"—I then left, and on 3rd May I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Bead:</hi> "2nd May, 1877. Dear Sir,—Not having heard from you any further in reference to my debt to you of 2,184<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I write this to propose that I should give you my promissory note for this amount at six months' date, which would leave me time to turn round in, and send in my application for re-admission to the Stock Exchange; my other creditors have accepted a similar arrangement, as ray only wish is to pay you all in full, and I will do so if given time, but should the slightest rumour of these outside liabilities of mine get known to anyone not directly interested in the matter, the rumour is certain to get to the Stock Exchange, and then my getting re-admitted would be hindered completely," &amp;c.) I did not reply to that but came up to London and obtained a warrant.</p>

Cappers' contract for the purchase of them—I never heard Mr. Capper's name from him, I swear that—I had no advices from Messrs. Robarts, on 2nd March, when I sent the telegram and letter, and until 5th April, the same condition of things existed, and I wrote and told him to pay in the balance which was in his hands—I did not on</p>

I am one of the firm of Capper and Co., stock and share brokers, of Adams Court, Old Broad Street—I have known the prisoner some time—I remember his failure at the beginning of 1875—subsequently to that we received the permission of the committee to deal with him owing to a rule which debarred us from dealing with him without that permission—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is kept by a clerk and made up from the contract notes—I do not check it with the original—I did business with the prisoner myself personally, and under his instructions I sold for him on 2nd March, 114, and also seventy Richmond shares for the settle<lb/>ment of 14th March, and on 3rd March, 100 Richmond shares for the settle<lb/>ment of 28th March, and seventy others at another price, and on the 17th two quantities of twelve and ten for the settlement of 28th March—on 16th March, we received a letter from the prisoner saying "Please let me have cheque for 2,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," which I sent payable to his order—that was on the current account—there were other accounts between us besides these Richmonds—that cheque was in respect of stock and shares delivered, including the Richmonds—on 19th March, we received another letter from him containing a request for a cheque for 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which we sent him, and on 21st March, he bought Egyptians through us: 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I reside at Atherleigh House, Lansdown Road, Twickenham—on 19th August I answered an advertisement in a newspaper,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187705280022"/>
               <p>and on 22nd August received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Auction and Estate Agency Offices, 488, New Oxford Street, London, August. 21st, 1876. E. T. Edgington &amp; Co. Established 1860. Dear Sir,—If you will call upon me at your convenience I will give you particulars of the partnership adver<lb/>tisement, if not settled, but I cannot go into details without a personal in<lb/>terview Yours truly, Edward F. Edgington.") On 28th August, in consequence of this letter, I went to 488, Oxford Street, and saw Edgington—he said the party he advertised for, a Mr. Barker, of 22, Bloomsbury Square, had found a partner, but he knew of another gentleman who required a partner in the same business at 13a, Red Lion Square, who was a first-class man of business, and that if we could come to terms I should be perfectly satisfied, and that he would recommend the business as a first-class one—no terms were mentioned then, but an appointment was made for the next day to meet Atkinson—I went the next day and was introduced to Atkinson as the party who had written to Edgington about the partnership, and Edging<lb/>ton asked what he wanted—Atkinson said 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a half share of the business, the profits of which were from 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and even might come to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum for each partner; and that the profits had been equal to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for each—Edgington then said that Atkinson had always done some agency business for him which amounted to about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, and that he would still continue to give him that portion of his business, so that I might look for a participation in that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum from Edgington's busi<lb/>ness—those sums represented the profits of the business, so Edgington said, and Atkinson acquiesced in the statement—Atkinson said the best time for business was in the months of September, October, and November, and that it was desirable to come to a conclusion at once, or we might lose some valu<lb/>able opportunities—it was arranged that I was to pay 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash and give an I O U for the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance which was to be paid by quarterly instalments of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the profits of the business, which I was told I should have no difficulty in doing out of my share of the profits—a deposit was required of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave Edgington 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I had not 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me, and I gave an I O U for the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance—an arrangement was made to complete on the 31st—I went on that day to 488, Oxford Street—both prisoners were present—I handed over to Edgington some Bank of England notes which I received from the London and Westminster Bank, Lothbury, in exchange for a cheque from Severs &amp; Thomas—I then signed the agreement of partnership—I parted with my money in consequence of the representations that were made to me by the prisoners of the business they had done, were doing, and likely to do—on the 29th I had asked Atkinson to let me see the books—he said that he had been out so much and for want of office assistance ho had been unable to keep up the books, and that they would not show the business done—I afterwards called at 13a, Red Lion Square, and Atkinson showed me a book called "Public Houses;" that is the only book I saw—I entered on my duties as partner on the 1st September, 1876, and continued in daily attendance up to November 16th, when there was a writ of ejectment, and Atkinson removed the few articles of furniture there were, and on arriving there in the morn<lb/>ing I found a man in possession—the furniture consisted of a few chairs and a long stuffed seat—some days afterwards I saw Atkinson at Edgington's office apparently transacting Edgington's business—I did not introduce a Mr. Henderson—Atkinson came to the business place three, four, or five times a week; he only stayed a short time, perhaps half an hour—the only business I knew of was a house apparently sold, the White Horse, Holland</p>

               <p>Street, Blackfriars, by a Mr. Brown, who was put into a beer-house in White<lb/>chapel—I did not see any money paid by Brown—I received from Atkinson 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—the fourteen documents produced were delivered by post or by hand, they were found on the premises. (<hi rend="italic">These were claims for rates and summonses, and papers relating to legal proceedings</hi>.) I then consulted a solicitor and went to Bow Street and got a warrant—Atkinson was brought up on the 7th and Edgington on 28th April—I have not since entertained any proposal to compromise the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not say this morning I received 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said I received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. up to the 16th November, because I was asked up to that date; I have given the whole amount—many entries in the order-book to view are in my handwriting, as many as five in one day, and seven in another—I quite understood I was only to be paid upon sales effected—I went with Atkinson, to the Ship, the Sun, and the Old Fountain Tavern, about the sale of those houses—he had received instructions previously—I cannot tell you what was said—I went to other houses which I cannot name now—the order-book may contain 250 orders—they are not numbered—Atkinson having received my money was to pay office expenses—he paid 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the expenses were to be apportioned between us; I do not know that the advertisements are not genuine—Atkinson did not tell me I was unfitted for the work—I remember seeing requests to sell come by post—I did not go to see about the houses—I cannot give the average of people who called on business—some called to complain that the house they went to view was not for sale—one case was as to the White Horse, North Street, Fitzroy Square—complaints were mode that the houses had been sold to other parties and they had had their journey for nothing—a man might employ two brokers to sell his house, and one might not be aware of the sale by the other, but I do not know it as a fact—I could not surmise what my commission might have been—I did hot know Atkinson had gone to Edgington's office till I found him there; I urged him continually to carry out his engagement with me—I wrote Atkinson this letter: "On Friday last, when I saw you you said you should procure a partner for the purpose of paying me out, and that you would at once let me know what progress you had made, but I have never heard a word from you"—Atkinson complained of the badness of trade, but I replied that other people were doing business—there are about a dozen entries in the "Register of Public Houses" for sale, while I was there; there are no dates—the prices are marked—they were not sold—I do not think Atkinson tried to get business; I did—he paid for the advertisements with my money, and what he called looking after the business ended with his coming home intoxicated—I issued the orders to view the Red Lion, Shoe Lane, the Ship, Gray's Inn, and the Devonshire Arms—I have seen a Mr. Pinner, and a Mr. Josephs-Atkinson told me the firm was instructed to find a partner for one of those men—Josephs never denied it, Atkinson never told me that he made no profit unless he found a purchaser—I did not go to Duncan Terrace, and tell Mrs. Atkinson,. she had better remove the furniture—Atkinson said he was not liable for the rent when I spoke to him about a distraint coming in a few days after I was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. There were no sales except that of Mr. Brown's house—the orders to view were given to anyone who applied in answer to the advertisements—beyond Atkinson's statements and the case of Brown, I do not know of any actual business done from September to November—</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 28, Millman Street, Guildford Street December I saw an advertisement in the "Daily Telegraph" in reference to a partnership, in consequence of which I went to 488, New Oxford street—I there saw Atkinson and then Edgington, who drew up a memo<lb/>randum and submitted it to me I afterwards received this letter of 21st December, 1876, signed by Edgington: "If you are prepared to carry out the proposed arrangement, please call on Mr. Edgington between 3 and 4 or 7 and 10 to-morrow, Friday. Yours truly, Edgington &amp; Co."(Thomas Galpin. This letter is in Atkinson's writing.) On the 8th December I received from Edgington this letter: "Please give me another call at your earliest convenience. I will keep any written appointment not before 5 p.m.—I afterwards called; Atkinson's name was not mentioned, but I saw Atkinson at his own house after I received this letter from him of January 23rd, 1877, from 9, Duncan Terrace, Islington: "I am informed by Mr. Edgington of 488, Oxford Street, that you are desirous of investing money in a partnership. I shall be pleased to see you if you will make an appointment"—a proposal was then made to me by Atkinson of a partner<lb/>ship in a public-house business for which I was to pay 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; no place was mentioned, but I was to have an equal share—I was to pay 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down at once for the purpose of relieving him of his present partner, who, he said, was too old a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> and quite useless in the business—he said the profits were very fair, but no sum was mentioned—on the 6th February I received this letter from Atkinson: "Dear Sir,—I shall be pleased to know your decision as regards the proposed partnership, as I am desirous of at once settling my arrangements"—I did not see him after that letter—he had told me the best time for business was February and March, on account of gentlemen's servants coming to town who had received money in the holidays in the country and wished to invest it in public houses—I did not part with any money—Atkinson is the same person I saw at Duncan Terrace and at 488, Oxford Street—he explained that he was a confidential clerk who had a knowledge of the value of the public houses.</p>

I am a Great Western van boy, and live at 7, Craven Place, Kensal, New Town—the prisoner and his wife lived at No. I—on Saturday afternoon, 14th April, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I was at home, in consequence of hearing a noise I went out and saw Mr. and Mrs. Wicks <hi rend="italic">running;</hi> Mr. Wicks ran indoors and fetched out a spoon and struck Mr. Wicks on the head with the bowl part, she had the handle in her hand—the prisoner went to return the blow, and instead of that he stabbed her in the neck; I thought he struck her to defend himself—I saw the knife in his hand after it was done—she fell against the fence, and her sister got hold of her, and took her to the doctor's—I saw blood come from the wound directly the blow was given.</p>

I live at 10, Landseer Terrace, immediately opposite the prisoner's—I was standing at my door on the afternoon of 14th April, between 4 and 5 o'clock my attention was called by the prisoner and his wife quarrelling, which was very frequent—I could hear them using very violent language towards each other, more especially on her part—I saw her driving him out saying "Stab me you b——if you are a man, stab me, stab me"—she kept on saying it three times, and she struck at his head three or four times with a spoon—there is a little narrow garden in front of their house, about 2 yards wide, and the prisoner backed out into the path and then into the middle of the road, she striking at him all the time; I never saw him raise a hand to her till this happened, and then he held up his hands to ward her blows off to all appearance and gave her a push—he pushed her with one hand, but he had both hands up, she was striking at him furiously on the forehead, and I believe it did cut him—she even struck at him after she had received the stab—I did not see any knife until the policeman told me that he had a knife—I did not see any blood, I saw the sister get a cloth and put on her neck and take her off to the doctor.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "On Saturday, my husband was at home sitting by the fire, he had been drinking, I went in and said to him "You might have done your work," and I asked why he would not let my son do the work as he would not do it himself. He called me very bad names, and I ran upstairs and got a little iron fender and threw it down at him, but it did not hit him, he got up, and went into the garden and sharpened a knife; I took a spoon out of the drawer and went to him, but I did not hit him; he was stooping sharpening his knife; he got up turned round and stabbed me in the neck; I don't remember any more. I had a share of two or three pints of beer. My husband had been drinking for six or seven weeks; he was the worse for drink at the time, when he is sober there is not a kinder man or a better husband.</p>

                  </hi>. On 11th April, I was house-surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital, I received the deceased there and examined her—she had a wound in the upper part of the neck, on her left side, about an inch long; I did not probe it, because fluid and blood came out of it—it went into the back of the larynx and food came out of it, I should say the depth was about 2 inches, it pierced the larynx right against the spinal column; the wound had been closed by two small superficial stitches by an assistant of the gentleman to whom she had been previously taken; I had to take those out before I could form an opinion as to the wound—there was not much blood, she could not swallow, or speak, except in a whisper, inflammation of the lungs immediately set in about ten days after, and she died on 9th May, from exhaustion and inflammation of the lungs, the result of the wound; she was of rather a bad habit of body, and apparently had not led a very regular life, but these wounds are almost always fatal even in the strongest habit of body—in my judgment unless she had received this wound she would not have died—a knife of this sort would cause such a wound.</p>

The wound was quite horizontal with the body, it went in at right angles, not downwards; if the man held the knife stiffly in his hand, the woman falling against it might be sufficient to produce the wound, it was a penetrating wound; if she had fallen forward it ought to have been not only penetrating but longitudinal—it might probably be caused by the woman coming against it, it is unusual to get such a wound in that way, but it might be.</p>

I said that if the business was a satisfactory one I would communicate with Mr. Lane—he said "These are the offices"—I asked how long the business had been established there—he said "About four years"—I asked what income was derived from the business—he said "About 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the twelve-months, "but it was capable of extension, as it was an increasing business—on 17th February I called again with Mr. Lane, who asked, in my presence, where the offices were—he said "Here," and as to the length of time the business had been established the prisoner gave the same replies as he did to me—Mr. Lane also looked through the ledger and put questions which I did not pay attention to—I asked how the offices were let—the prisoner said by a three years' agreement, and that as he had the letting of the greater part of the offices in the neighbourhood the tenancy could be renewed on the same easy terms, but if let to any one else they would be worth more money—he also said to Mr. Lane, in my presence, "Within the last few days an estate near Epsom, worth 22,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., has been put in my hands, which had formerly been placed with Messrs. Farebrother, but they did not push the thing as I shall," and that the profits of that should be thrown in—he showed us a printed bill, on which I saw the name Farebrother, but did not read it—Lane asked whether there would be time to run to Chippenham to see his father to ascertain how soon he might be released from the bank, as they could claim his services for three months—Raven said the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. must be then paid or the thing would fall through, as others were after it—references were exchanged—the money was then paid on the understanding that it should be returned—I wrote a cheque and gave it to the prisoner—the agreement was then signed, Raven's name being first—this is Raven's endorsement on the cheque. (<hi rend="italic">This was on the Bournemouth branch of the Bank of England; the references were F. B. Cameron, Esq.</hi>, 78, <hi rend="italic">Queen Vic<lb/>toria Street, and Frank Keen, Esq., Hillsborough Villa, Talfourd Road, Peekham</hi>.)

Tatham &amp; Mackreth, solicitors, and previous to 3rd March I went to Bow Street and swore an information—I have since been several times to Parliament Street, but found the offices locked, they appeared to be empty—I could not find the prisoner.</p>

I am a cashier in the Wilts and Dorset Bank, Bourne-mouth—Mr. Briant called my attention to this advertisement, and on 17th February I went with him to Parliament Street—I saw Raven and Mr. Wright, and two clerks in the outer office—Mr. Briant introduced me as the intended partner—I asked the prisoner how long he had been there he said "I have been four years as an auctioneer and estate agent, here"—I asked about the profits of the business—he said they were 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or "800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, but if he took a partner the profits were capable of extension—that the profits consisted of commissions on sales and lettings and the letting of apartments at the Lord Mayor's Show and other occasions—he said that the commissions went a great way towards the establishment; that he had just had an estate at Epsom of 22,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. value put into his hands which had been taken out of Messrs. Farebrother's hands, and that the profits of that estate, which would be considerable, should go into the partnership—I was to have a half share—I gave three references and he gave me two—Raven said that a deposit must be paid or the partnership must fall through as he had several other offers, and, in fact, had received 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that morning as deposit—I thought his statement satisfactory, and paid the cheque produced on the understanding that if his references were not satisfactory the deposit would be returned—this letter was written in my presence.

On 21st May, about 1.25, I was on duty in the Old Kent Road, there was a drunken woman lying on the footway, a crowd of about a dozen persons round her—some one cried out, and I looked across the roadway and saw the two off wheels of a furniture van go over the head of the deceased child—the prisoner was driving the van—I was standing about 4 yards from the van—it was going about 4 miles an hour, the minimum space, the horses were trotting, I followed the van and called out to the man to stop, he pulled up in about 50 yards, I came up on the near side and said "Pull up, you have killed a boy"—he said nothing, he dismounted and I handed him over to Hampshire—Mr. Haynes, a doctor, was coming along and I call his attention to the body—some of the people cried out that the prisoner was drunk, and I called the doctor's attention to him, the prisoner said nothing—there was another man on the box with him, I don't know what became of him, he was not at the police-court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was too much engaged in attending to the child to notice the prisoner's state, he was haggard looking and very dull and heavy, but I had not sufficient time to pass an opinion whether he was sober or drunk—I told the Magistrate so—I did not see the child before it was under the wheels of the van—there were two horses and a leader in front—</p>

               <p>the driver was on a high seat, there was room for two on it—I could not say whether the van was loaded or not, it was one of those pantechnicon covered vans—where the accident occurred was at the foot of a rise to go over the canal bridge, the road previously was level, the van was just going to ascend the rise.</p>

I live at 535, Old Kent Road, and am in<lb/>dependent—I was at my window watching the crowd—I saw the child run from the crowd and when he got to the tramway he stumbled and fell in the middle of the tramway and a van drawn by three horses came up and passed over the child—the wheels of the van must have been on the tram<lb/>way—the child's head was cut off on one of the tram rails—the child was some 10 or 12 feet from the foremost horse where it fell—I thought the van could have been pulled up very easily before the wheels reached the child—no attempt was made to pull it up; it went on some little distance before it was stopped—my window is opposite to where the accident occurred—I saw the prisoner when he came down from the box, he looked stupid.</p>
