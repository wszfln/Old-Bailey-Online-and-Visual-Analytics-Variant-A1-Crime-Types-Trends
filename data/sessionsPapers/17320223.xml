But pray look, says she, and so I did; but I could not find one single brass Farthing, for my Money was all gone. Well, says she, come along with me, and I'll shew the Woman that took it; and so she brought me to the Prisoner, and laid hold on her. The Prisoner had got the Money in her Hand, and went to put it into my Pocket again; but Holms would not let her, though I would fain have had my Money again.</p>

               <p>Peterson. It was Money that I had borrow'd to go to Market with, there were 4 half Crowns, and the rest in Shillings and Six-pences; and so Mrs. Holms brought her before Mr. Basset the Constable, and put the Money into his Hands, and then we went before Sir

But I Bitch'd up the Prisoner again pretty handsomely, and brought her to the Constable; I had watch'd her several Days, because I thought she was a Pick pocket; and, I said, that the first time I catch'd her, I would have her prosecuted, or else I would prosecute them that made it up. A couple of Men came to me to Day, and they said they came from the Prisoner, and they offer'd me ten Guineas not to appear against her.</p>

            , Watchman. Between 4 and 5 in the Morning, the Prisoner went by me over Fleet-bridge, with some Pewter-pots, and other Things; I follow'd him, but he went too fast for me. After 5, I went to the Night-house in George-Alley, by the Ditch-side, and found him there with the Goods. Pray, young Man, says I, where did you get these Things? I had them, says he, from Mr. Winniat's in Fleet-lane, and am going to carry them to his Brother in Red-Lyon-Street. I look'd on the Gallon-Pot, and found writ round it, John Smith at the Boar's-Head in Barbican. And upon this I secur'd him, and sent Word to the Prosecutor.</p>

            , again The Cow that got from the Boy came Home again The Day before I lost these Cows. I had 2 Horses taken away in the same Manner, and conveyed to the Green-yard, where they made me pay 6 s. 8 d. for one Night, before they would let me have them again. When the Boy was taken, I desir'd the Woman of the Green-yar to go with me, to see if he was the same Boy that brought my Horses to her, but she would not go, tho' I offer'd her a Coach. Not only I, but all my Neighbours round me have had their Cows or Horses carried to the Green-yard in this manner, which has been a great Charge to us; for we are forced to pay extravagantly to get them out again. The Owner of the Green-yard gives a Shilling a-piece to any Body that brings Beasts thither, which is a great Encouragement for these Vagabonds to take them out of our Fields, or off the Common.

Smith came in, and passed by the Prisoners without taking any Notice of them, and ask'd for some Scotch-Cloth to line the Body of a Gown for her Mistress: She went to the farther End of the Shop, and said she was in great haste, and then Carrol was in haste too: He endeavour'd to please them both, but they both were very difficult. While he was engaged with them, a Neighbour's Son came in to change a Guinea; he went in for Silver, and as he came out again, he saw Foy was bustling about the Counter, but did not then suspect any thing. Carrol bought half a Yard of Irish-Linen, for which she paid 19 d 1/2, but she borrow'd the Money of Foy ; and while Foy put her Hand in her Pocket for the Money, he observed that she had 2 large Linen Bags, or Pockets, within side her Riding-hood. Then Smith would have some of the same Linen as Carrol had, for which she paid 21 l. The Prisoners went first, and Smith follow'd. Soon after they were gone he missed the Stockings, and went to enquire after his Customers ; for he had seen them before, and heard they lived in the Neighbourhood. He was told that Smith was a Servant to a Gentlewoman that lodged at the Green Canister in Princes-street. He went thither, but could not meet with her; but there he got Intelligence that Carrol was a Servant to Mrs. Mason, at Mr. Hosse's, a Barber, in Russel-street. By good Luck he found them all three standing at Mr. Hesse's Door. Pray, Mistress, says he to Foy, was not you at my Shop just now? I, at your Shop. Fellow, says she, what do you mean? I never was at your Shop in my Life, nor don't know where it stands. However, he secured them, and brought Foy back to his Shop in order to search her.</p>
               <p>In pulling off her Ridinghood, two odd Stockings were some how thrown behind the Counter. Smith pretended that she did not know Foy; but Foy and Carrol were drinking hot Pots together that Afternoon, Up-stairs, at the Golden-Lyon in Russel-street, and ordered themselves to be denied to every Body but Smith, who came in a little time, and was sent up to them. Smith left them a little while, and went to - Bowen, a Pawnbroker's, and pawn'd for Half-a-Crown the two Pieces of Cloth they had bought of the Prosecutor just before. Mr. Hosse (to whose Lodger Carrol was a Servant) going Up-stairs, found 2 odd Stockings hung between the Banisters, which proved to be the fellows to the 2 that were found behind the Prosecutor's Counter when Foy was searched. In the Cellar Mr. Hosse found a Handkerchief under the Water-Tub, with several Pair of Stockings in it, which were part of those the Prosecutor lost. Smith was made an Evidence [out did not appear against the Prisoners on their Trail] Foy broke out of the Round house, but Mr. White, the Constable, met her afterwards in Leadenhall-street, and secured her. She offer'd him 5 or 10<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173202230006"/> Guineas to let her go, and would have given as much to have made it up with the Prosecutor; but after she was sent to Newgate, she said, if they had taken the Money, she would have prosecuted them for compounding a Felony. At Mr. White's House (the King's-Arms Tavern in Russel-Street) Carrol fell on her Knees to the Prosecutor, and said, that her Life was in his Hand, that his Goods had been lost, and she would make him Satisfaction. And when she was in the Coach with Mr. White, who had her in Charge, she said to him, dear Honey White, my Life is in your Power, you may hang me, or save me.</p>

               <p>Foy said, That she spoke to Smith, when Smith came by her in the Prosecutor's Shop, and that after she heard Smith had sworn against her, she was coming to surrender herself, in order to take her Tryal, when Mr. White seiz'd her in Leadenhall-Street.</p>
               <p>Carrol said, That the Prosecutor knew her before, she having been at his Shop to buy facing and robing for a Gown, and that she told him where she liv'd in the Neighbourhood, and that therefore it was very unlikely she should go to his Shop with a Design to steal.</p>

               <p>Council. What Company did you see there?</p>
               <p>Rohan. There was Cannon and his Wife, and her Mother; and Tapper and my Wife Jonny ; and - let me see - Smith and Cotterl, and Wilcox. Now Wilcox and the Deceas'd were playing at Cards together, and Wilcox won all his Money. Then the Deceas'd pull'd off his Waistcoat to send it to pawn for 2 s. but his Wife said to him, You had better buy me a Smock to my Back; at which he fell into a Passion, and got up to beat her. She ran out, and he after her, but she got into some Neighbour's House, and so he came back again. By and by some-body came in, and told him, his Wife was miscarried; What, says the Prisoner to the Deceas'd, was your Wife with Child? Yes, says the Deceas'd, and that's more than yours will ever be. How do ye know that? says the Prisoner. Because, Mr. Tapper, says the Deceas'd, I have tapp'd her many a time. Have ye so? says Tapper, Why then, G - d d - n ye, I'll tap you. My Back was towards them when I heard this Discourse, but as soon as I turned about the Deceased opened his Waistcoat, and shew'd me a Wound under his right Breast; and he said to the Prisoner, Lo you think you shan't pay for this?</p>
               <p>Council. You had all been drinking, had ye not? Rohan. Yes. Coun. And were you not all got Drunk? Rohan. No. Coun. Was not you Drunk? Rohan. No, I tell ye; why, sure I am not to be persuaded that I was Drunk. Coun. Have you ever seen the Prisoner and the Deceased a drinking together before this Accident? Rohan. Yes; but they were always a quarrelling. Coun. How far was you off when the Deceas'd receiv'd the Wound? Rohan. About three Yards; but I did not see it given. Coun. Was not the Deceas'd a paring his Nails just before this happen'd? Rohan. I don't know. Coun. Did you hear no mention of a Whetstone? Rohan. Not as I remember. Coun. How long did the Deceas'd live after the Accident? Rohan. Eleven Days, from the 11th of last Month to the 22d, and the Coroner sat on him on the 25th of the same. The Deceas'd told me (when he was under the Surgeon's Care) that if the Prisoner would be so good as to pay the Surgeon, he'd forgive him. I afterwards met the Prisoner accidentally in Bishopsgate-street, and asked him, how he could be so barbarous as to stab the Deceas'd? and he answer'd, I am only sorry that I did not give him a prick on the other side.</p>

Next Day he seem'd tolerably easy, as if the Wound had been in a muscular Part of the Body. The third Day the Wound look'd well, but the next Morning he was out of Order. I would have blooded him, but he refus'd. I told him then I would do no more, and advis'd him to send for an Apothecary; he was very aint, but the Wound all along digested well openly. He died on the 22d, and on the 24th, I (with another Surgeon ) opened his right Side, and 2 or 3 Quarts of Blood and Matter was taken out of the Thorax. He had spit no Blood, and I found the Lungs no way touched, but they could not possibly perform their Office with such a Quantity of Blood in the Thorax which was penetrated, tho' we could not perceive it before the Body was open'd. He had a Fever, and the Blood lying on the Maphragma, might cause his Urine to be something bloody. He was suddled when he came to me first.</p>

The Deceas'd play'd with Wilcox, and lost all his Money; then he fetch'd down a Looking-Glass, and made Money of it, and lost that too; then he would have pawn'd his Waistcoat, but his Wife would not let him. He got up in a Passion, she ran away, and he after her; but she got shelter in a Neighbour's House, and so he came in again. News was brought that she had miscarry'd; but afterwards we heard that it was not so bad with her.</p>
               <p>Coun. Did you hear any Joaks pass about Tapping the Prisoner's Wife?</p>
               <p>Cotterell. No; the Prisoner was standing at the Table cutting his Nails with a Pen-knife, and he ask'd the Deceas'd (who stood with his Back to the Fire) if he had never a Whetstone? No, says he, but there's a Trowel lies in the Window, whet your Knife on that. The Prisoner took the Trowel, and whetted his Knife for some time; Uamn the Monkey, says the Deceas'd, what a Noise he makes with whetting his Knife, there's no bearing what any Body say. And with that he gave the Prisoner a Push, and turn'd him round, so that the Prisoner fell with his Back against the Table, and he fell over the Prisoner. The Deceas'd got up again, and said, he had prick'd himself, and says the Prisoner, I am sorry for it, but it was your own fault, why did you push me when I had a Knife in my Hand. They were both drunk. About 3 or 4 Days after this, I was talking with the Deceas'd, about this Accident, and he said, It was all owing to his Wife, and the old Bitch her Mother.</p>

            . Cotterell and I call'd upon the Deceas'd, he was just come down Stairs, we were not for staying, but he would run up and call the Prisoner. We drank together, and then went to Cards. The Deceas'd won the Prisoner's last Half-penny, and then play'd with Wilcox. They play'd for a Farthing a Game, till the Deceas'd had lost all his Money. Then he fetch'd down a Looking-Glass, and sold it for 15 d. and lost all that Money too. And when that was gone, he stripp'd off his Dimitty-Waistcoat, and bid his Wife go and pawn it for 2 s. You Rogue, says she, you had more need fetch my Smock out of pawn. And you Bitch, says he, I'll beat your Brains out. She ran into the Lane and made an Out-cry, and he follow'd her, but she got into a House, and he came back again. The Prisoner went to the Table to pare his Nails, and ask'd for a Whetstone. The Deceas'd told him there was a Trowel in the Window, and he might whet his Knife upon that, which the Prisoner did, but while he was whetting, the Deceas'd said, Damn the Fellow, what a Noise he makes with his Knife; and then gave him a shove by the Shoulder that turn'd him round, so as he fell backwards against the Table, and had been quite all along on the Ground if the Table had not been in the way, and then the Deceas'd fell over him, for they were both fuddled and stagger'd. When the Deceas'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173202230009"/> got up, he shew'd me the Wound; Bless me, says I, how came that? I don't know, says he, but it's all along of that Bastard Tapper's Nonsense.</p>
               <p>Coun. Did you hear the Deceas'd say any Thing about Tapping, Mr. Tapper's Wife.</p>

            . The Deceas'd won the Prisoner's Money, I won it again from the Deceas'd, who then bid his Wife pawn his Waistcoat. She said he should not play there to pawn his Cloaths, and so she snatch'd up the Cards and ran out, he follow'd her, but came back again, and said, she was got in a Neighbour's House. Word was brought that she was in a Fit, and that a Midwife was sent for. Her Mother went to her, and in a little time return'd and said, Thank God she's recover'd, for a Surgeon has been there and blooded her. The Prisoner was standing and paring his Nails at a Table by the Window, and ask'd for a Whetstone. The Deceas'd who stood with his Back to the Fire, and not far from him, bid him take the Trowel that lay in the Window by him, he took it, and whetted his Knife. The Deceas'd did not like the Noise, and so push'd him down, and fell over him; but there was then no quarrel between them. The Deceas'd got up, and said, Jack, you have hurt me, do you think you shall not pay for this? And then he went out, and said, he would get a Warrant. I went to see him afterwards, and ask'd, how he did? He said the Wound was pretty well; but he had got out in a thin Coat without a Wastcoat, and had got Cold. A little before his Death, he blam'd his Wife for putting him in a Passion, and said he never intended to take the Prisoner up. When the Surgeon first prob'd him, he said it was but a frivolous Wound.</p>

            . I saw the Deceas'd in the Little-Old-Bailey, on the first Day of last Sessions [January 14.] and ask'd him about the Accident. He told me, if it had not been for the Bitch his Wife, it had never happen'd, for he had never minded the Prisoner whetting his Knife, if she had not put him in a Passion, and that thereupon he push'd the Prisoner against the Table. Afterwards I saw him and the Prisoner drinking together very friendly, and he being poor, desir'd the Prisoner to give him half a Guinea to pay the Surgeon.</p>

            . I ask'd the Deceas'd how the Wound happen'd, and says he, I don't know very well; I got it when I push'd him against the Table; but Damn it, I don't mind it, I'll drink it off. When he spoke this the Prisoner was with him, and they shook Hands, and seem'd very good Friends. I have been acquainted with the Prisoner 7 Years, he was always a quiet Man, and not given to quarrel.</p>
               <p>Several others appear'd to the Prisoner's Character, and swore that they had known him many Years, that they had been drinking in his Company many hundred Times; that he had often taken even blows patiently, without returning the ill Usage.

And why did not you stop her? Powell. I did not think she would have carry'd them away, because she was acquainted in the House. Coun. How acquainted? Was she a Servant? Powell. She was rather a Mistress; she kept Company with my Master Bass. Coun. Did you inform Mr. Bass of this? Powell. No; he was gone aside, the Landlord had distrain'd his Goods. Coun. Did you acquaint any Body with it? Powell. Yes, I told our Chamberlain, William Street, but he is not in Court; I desired him to enquire after her, and send her back, for she was gone into the Country ; but in about two Weeks I heard she was Dead, and Mr. Rider took me up. Coun. Did not Bass and his People carry off what Goods they could? Powell. They carried some away the Sunday before; the Prisoner took these on the 19th of February was a 12 Month, between 10 and 11 in the Morning, she carry'd them out of the Pantry into the Kitchen, and then I went into the Cellar, and when I came up again she was gone, and the Goods too. Coun. What Goods were they? Powell. There was 9 Pieces of Camblet, and 9 Ells of Tabby, some Black, and some White; they were all put up in Papers, with Directions. Coun. Did you see the Papers open'd. Powell. No. Coun. How then can you take upon you to swear to the Colour and Quantity? Powell. I knew what was in the Papers by Mr. Rider's Bill of Parcels. Coun. Did Mr. Rider find the Bill against the Prisoner, or has he been at any Charge in this Prosecution? Powell. No; he had no Hand in it.</p>

               <p>William Davis. On the 30th of January, between 9 and 10 at Night, as I was going <placeName id="t17320223-31-crimeloc162">from Hackney towards London</placeName>

Half-penny, and then he took my Hat, and gave me another that was not worth 2d. and bid me go on, and told me, if I spoke a Word, I was a dead Man. Going along I met Wingfield (who is a Servant at the King's Head) and Mr. Oram [Oswald] with 2 great Dogs. I told them what had happen'd, Wingfield and I and one Dog went after them to London-Field, but not finding them, we came back to Mr. [Oswald] Oram. We saw a Man at the Salmon and Ball Door, and he told us 2 such Men as I had described were just gone from thence. Faxton, the tall Man, was in a Pea Jacket, and Smith, the short Man, in a brown Coat; we pursu'd them again to London-Field, but could not find them, and so Wingfield went home. But the Prisoners were taken the same Night by Wingfield, and Mr. Oram. When they were carried before Justice Norris, Faxton fell on his Knees, and own'd that the Hat was mine, and that he and Smith had robb'd me of a Groat. As they were going to Newgate, Smith said to Faxton, Ye whiddling Dog, now you have hang'd your self, and me too, but if I had a Knife, I'd cut your Throat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Oram. Between 10 and 11 at Night, I call'd at the King's-Head, in hopes of finding Company to go over the Fields with. Wingfield told me, that a Man had been robb'd that Night, by two Foot-Pads, and offer'd his Service to go with me. We took a Dog with us, and went towards the place where the Robbery was committed. We saw 2 Men before us, one a tall Man in a Pea Jacket, and the other a short Man in a brown Coat. Says Wingfield, I believe, those are the Rogues, for they answer the Description. We stepp'd up to them, I took Faxton by the Collar, he trembled very much, and Wingfield seiz'd Smith. We charg'd them with the Robbery. Damn ye, says Faxton, do you think if we were Guilty, we would let you take us? No, says Smith, we'll fight the 2 brightest Men in Hackney. We carry'd them to the Shoulder of Mutton, but the People of the House were gone to Bed, and so we took them to the Buffaloe's-Head, in Hackney. Next Morning we had them before the Justice, and sent for the Prosecutor. The Room was full of People, but as soon as he came in, he fixt his Eye upon Smith, and said, That is one of them. Says some Body, who is the other? He look'd about, and presently pointing to Faxton, said, That's he, I'll swear. While the Mittimus was making, some Body advised Faxton to confess, and be an Evidence, upon which he came forward, and told the Justice, that he and Smith committed the Fact, and desired to be made an Evidence. With that, says Smith, I know I shall be hang'd, but he shall be hang'd too.</p>
               <p>Wingfield. Mr. Oram and I took the Prisoners, as he has related. When they were before the Justice, Faxton fell on his Knees, and confess'd that he and Smith committed the Robbery, and that the Hat Smith then had on, was the same as they took from the Prosecutor; then Smith said, G - d d - n my Eyes, now we are both hang'd, but I shall have one to hang with me. As we were going away, Smith said to me, If you'll go to Oswald's Window-shutters, you'll find the Silver Groat that I thrust in there last Night. When I came thither, the Window-shutters were open'd, and it was fallen down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dennis. When Faxton was before the Justice, he was advised to confess in order to be made an Evidence. Upon which he fell on his Knees, and confess'd the Fact, and that the Hat Smith had on was the same they took from the Prosecutor, only the Loop was cut off, and another put on. He had scarce spoke when Smith doubling his Hands together, said, G - d d - n my precious Eyes and Limbs ! that Word has

            , the Prosecutor's Father. As we were coming from the Justice, Smith said to me, Old Man! I am a dead Man, give me four penny-worth of Half-pence, and I'll tell you where the Silver Groat is. So when we came to Mr. Oswald's, at the Shoulder of Mutton, I changed a Shilling and gave him a Groat, and the Silver Groat was found according to his Directions. This is the same, 'tis a bended King William's Groat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Smith. The Prosecutor could not swear to the Hat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Norris. Fallum confess'd the Fact before me, and as far as I know, it was voluntary. Smith was in a great Rage and Fury about it, and said he knew he should die, but the other should die with him. I desir'd him to let the Prosecutor look on the Hat to see if it was his, but he refus'd, upon which I order'd it to be taken from him. The Prosecutor looked on it, and said, I believe it is mine, but the Loop is taken off.</p>

At the Month's End I let her have 20 s. and then I got her out of my House, and glad I was to pass with her so. The same Day a former Servant of mine came to see me, and I being without a Maid, desired her to stay with me a Day or two. I gave her my Keys, and when she open'd my Drawers, she told me every thing was out of Order; and what's become of your Gold Rings, says she, and the Money that you used to keep here? Became of 'em? says I, why there should be 2 Gold Rings, and 15 Pounds. Well, says she, here's neither Rings nor Money. I found what she said was true; I got a Warrant ; the Prisoner was apprehended, and committed the Poultry-Compter. I and Mr. Bennet went to a Tavern near the Compter-Gate, and sent for her, and an Officer brought her to us. She told me she had not got my Money, but that it was in such a Place in my House. I was called out of the Room, and at my return I saw my 2 Gold Rings, 7 Moidores, 2 Broad Pieces, and 2 Guineas lying on the Table. This was all the that I had lost, except 1 Broad Piece.

             came last, and demanded my Watch, and my Money, I gave them 4 s. and some Half-pence, which was all the Money I had about me; but as for the Watch, I told them I had got none, tho' at the same time I had it in my Hand; for when I heard them coming after me, I slipt it out of my Pocket. Then one of them snatch'd off my Hat, and another took away my Scarf: They swore at me, and made me run down an Alley, and then they went off.</p>
               <p>On the Sunday following, some Persons came from Rag-Fair to visit a Man in Swan-Alley, near my Brother (Mr. Prior)'s Brewhouse; and they sent for a Pot of Beer, and so they fell into Discourse. And how goes Trade your Way? says one. Why, truly, but so so, says another; but Robbing goes forward however. Robbing? says a third. Ay, says the second, see what a pass the World is come to! we had a Clergyman robb'd here last Wednesday Night between 12 and 1. A Clergyman? says the fourth to the first, Why did not we see some Fellows in Rag-Fair with a Parson's Hat? And so we did, now I think of it, says his Neighbour. The Alehouse-Man who was one of the Company, acquainted my Brother with what had pass'd, and the Prisoners were afterwards taken in Rag-Fair.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you was robb'd about Midnight, was it dark? Prior. It was Moon-light; but the Moon was a little clouded. Court. How long did the Persons that robb'd you stay with you? Prior. About 5 or 6 Minutes. Court. Did you ever see any of them before? Prior. No; not to my Knowledge. Court. You say you was under such Confussion that you took a clasp Knife to be a Pistol; how then can you recollect to perfectly that these are the very Men who robb'd you? Prior. I should not have been so positive, if my Opinion had not been supported by

            , one of those concerned in the Fact. Court. Was you positive to the Prisoners when before the Justice? Prior. I was more positive to some than to others I fix'd upon Past and Edwards for two of them. Court. Could you be positive to Tripland without the help of Beck's Evidence? Prior. I should be very cautious of being positive as to him: He was a dirty, thick-set short Fellow; but there may be many such about Town.</p>
               <p>Past. Did not you say before the Justice, that you was positive to none but Edwards?</p>
               <p>Prior. I said indeed, that Edwards's Countenance struck me most; but at the same time I said I believ'd the others were the Men. And as to Edward's, there is one thing, in which I cannot but observe the Hand of Providence. When he was taken up, and was about to be carried before the Justice, he chang'd his Coat, in order, as I suppose, to disguise himself, but the Coat that he then put on, was the very Coat that he wore when he robb'd me; or one that was pretty much like it.</p>

            . About 11 o'Clock, I and Edwards, and Tripland met with Past in Bishopsgate-street. My Lads, says he, what Lay do you go upon. They told me they could find no better Business than stealing Lead. That's but a foolish way of living; you had much better stop a Coach. I proposed to go into Widegate-Alley to break open a House, but at last we agreed upon Street-Robbery. We went to Shoreditch, and attempted to stop a Coach, but the Coachman whipped his Horses, and drove into Hoxton-square. Going a little farther, Past cry'd out, Boys, here's a Cock!</p>
               <p>Court. What did he mean by a Cock?</p>
               <p>Beck. A Man. We came up to this Man, but he cry'd out Fire! Fire! and so we let him pass, for fear he should alarm all the Neighbourhood. We went along Old-street, and so to St. John's-street, without doing any Business: But in St. John's-street, Paste called out again, Boys, says he, Here's a Smallcoal-man; let us stop him, for they wear the best of Hats.</p>
               <p>Court. A Smallcoal-man, what did he mean by that?</p>
               <p>Beck. A Parson: We always call a Parson a Smallcoal-man, because their Dresses are pretty much alike. So we look'd in the Parson's Face, and let him go on, but we follow'd at a little Distance. He turned down Swan-Alley, when Edwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173202230015"/> stept forward with a Knife in his Hand, and stopt him. Whereof another Man was coming by at the same Time, and Past said, Boys! bid him stand, which we did. I sell a swearing at the Parson for his Watch, but he said he had none. Then I swore and cursed bloodily for his Money, and he gave me four Shillings, and 3 Half pence. Then Past took the Parson's Hat, and Tripland his Scarf; and so we left the poor Parson, and went into Catherine-wheel Alley and stole a Hundred Weight of Lead off of one of the new Houses that are unfinish'd. We were afterwards all taken, and I gave Information against my Companions. I have known Tripland and Past but a little while; but I have been acquainted with Edwards many Years. He and I have stole 30 Hundred Weight of Lead together.</p>

I did not like their Looks and so I took notice of 'em. Beck had got on a great flopping Hat, without Loops. Says I to my Journeyman, does that great Hat look as if it belong'd to that Fellow?

            , Headborough. On Jan. 30 I went to see a Man that was sick and lame in Swan-Alley. We sent for a Pot of Beer to his Room. The Alehouse-man who brought it, talk'd about Trade, and said there was nothing but Robbing there-a-way, for some Rogues had robb'd a Parson. What, says I, do they rob the Cloth? And says Mr. Wood (who was with us) I saw 4 Men that had got a Parson's Hat among 'em in Rag-Fair. The Alehouse-man told this to Mr. Prior the Brewer, who sent for us, and we told him what we knew. Next Day Mr. Wood sent me Word that the 4 Men were gone into the Yorkshire Grey Alehouse. We went in and seized Past and Tripland, for Edwards and Beck were gone out before we came. But Mr. Archer and a Watchman went out and took 'em both; they were all carried to the Watch-house, and then we sent Word of what we had done to Mr. Prior. When they were carried before Justice Haydon, the Parson swore downright to Edwards, and one of 'em said, Do you know me ? and another, Do ye know me? And he answer'd, Yes, I have some Knowledge of you now, but I shall know you better when I have observed you a little. The Parson brought me a Warrant to search for his Hat, and by Beck's Information, we went to

I was taken ill, and so I deliver'd the Hat to Past to pawn, and went Home to take a Sweat. Past did not come home till next Morning, and then I asked him what he had done with the Hat?

            , Waterman. I was about 6 or 7 Yards from the Prisoner when the Sash was broke, I saw him smash the window with his hand thus - and snatch out the Handkerchief; he ran away towards Tower-hill, I pursued him, he dropt the Handkerchief in the Mud, and presently after fell down himself, and so I took him. There was another Fellow with him when he broke the window, but he got off. A little Boy took up the Handkerchief and gave it me, and I gave it to Mr. Lambard. This is the Handkerchief, you may see where 'tis cut with pulling through the Glass.</p>

I saw the Glimmering of a Light, but being between sleeping and waking, I thought it might come from my Neighbour the Currier, and that his stirring might disturb the Bitch, and so I went to Bed again. But when I came down Stairs, about 7 in the Morning, I found my House was broke open, and several Goods gone. Some Tiles were taken off the Wash-house, and so the Door was unbarr'd and open'd. Then a Hole was cut thro' the Kitchen-door, and that was open'd too. When the Prisoner was my Journey-man he 'bizzled my Goods, and lived but a loose Life; so that I presently inspected him to be the Man; and so I had him taken up the same Day, and he confess'd that he brought 3 Men with him, and they broke my House open, and he confessed where he had pawned my Goods, and I found 'em accordingly.</p>

            , the Prisoner's Maid. Last Tuesday was Seven-night, between 12 and 1, my Mistress (the Prisoner's Mother) told me I might go to Bed (for I was not very well) and she would sit upto let my Master in; and so I did. My Bed is below in the Kitchin, and my Mistress lies with me. I fell asleep, and was waked with a Noise above Stairs about One or Two o'Clock. The Prisoner was knocking violently against the Inside of the Door of the Room where he lay, the Room is even with the Shop; and I heard him call out, Damn ye, ye old Bitch, do ye think I'll be lock'd up in my own House ? My Mistress told him she would not open his Door, till she had open'd the Street Door first: I heard her open the Street Door, and go out, and shut it after her. As soon as she was gone, my Master came down into the Kitchin, and call'd to me; Mary, says he, where are ye? Here, Sir, says I; What in Bed? says he; Yes, Sir, says I; What do ye want? I am come to bid you good Night, says he, give me a Buss. I was very much frighted, for he was stark naked without his Shirt. Sir, says I, you had much better go to Bed: No, says he, I will have a Buss first. He came to my Bed-side, and as he did not offer any Rudeness, I suffer'd him to kiss me once or twice, in hopes that he would then go away. But instead of that, he got upon the Bed ( out side the Bed-Clothes) and lay upon me ry hard, and endeavour'd to pu his Hand into the Bed, but with much difficulty I kept them out ; I begg'd him to leave me, and look after my Mistress, who was gone into the Street, and might come to some hurt a that time of Night. I had hardly spoke, when my Mistress appear'd by my Bed-side (for she had the Key of the Street-Door in or Pocket when she was dead.) You Dog, said she, what business have you upon the Maid's Bed ? With that he got up and said, Damn ye, you old Bitch, I don't know what Business you have in my House. She ran into the Coal-Vault to hide herself, and in running, her Candle went out. He ran to the Fire, and lighted a Match, and went to look for her; but she got by him and ran up Stairs, and he after her. I heard a great Scuffle, and a Struggling in the Passage at the Stairs Head as if he was running after her, and she was endeavouring to get away from him; I heard no Blows indeed, but presently she fell down with such Violence, as if Part of the House had fall'n with her: She neither spoke, nor so much as groan'd. He ran down immediately after her, and cry'd out, Damn the old Bitch, I have murder'd her, and I shall be hang'd for her. Mary! bring me a Candle. I am coming Sir, says I, but being in a Fright, I ran up Stairs in my Shift to Mr. Gold's Chamber, and begg'd that I might stay there a little, (Mr. Gold and his Brother lie together.) Aye, pray do, said they, and bolt the Door, for in his Passion he may murder us too. The Prisoner continued calling out, Mary! bring a Light! I have murder'd my dear Mother, and I shall be hang'd; after some time the Gentlemen bid me call the Watch, and then I ventur'd down again. The Street Door was open, and a Washerwoman came in with a Candle and Lanthern; but I was in such a Fright, that I don't remember whether it was I or any Body else that open'd the Door. Then the Prisoner call'd for a Knife, or a Fork to bleed his Mother; I brought him a Fork, he prick'd her Arm, it bled a little, and he said, He would give a 1000 l. to save her Life. She had a Napkin on her Head, and it was bloody. The Prisoner sent for a Surgeon, and Mr. Martin came and said, he believ'd she was dead.</p>

               <p>Court. How did he behave himself to his Mother in that time? Did you ever observe that he treated her with ill Usage?</p>
               <p>Parrot. He would sometimes scold at her as I thought, but I don't know what he said, because he us'd to speak in French; but at such times I have seen him pull her by the Nose, and push his Hand in her Face, thus -</p>
               <p>Court. In Anger? Parrot. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say you would hang me if you could, and that you would hang me rather than be hang'd your self?</p>
               <p>Parrot. No, some People that were strangers to me were saying, that if they had been as me, they would have let my Master have lain with them to have saved his Life. And I answer'd, that I would see half the World hang'd before he should lye with me, or Words to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How much Liquor did you fetch your Mistress that Night?</p>
               <p>Parrot. About 2 o'Clock I fetch'd her half a Pint of Gin and Bitter (I think they call it) and she gave me a Glass to carry to the Watch and to another Woman. I never saw her fuddled in my Life, and yet I know she would drink a great deal; but she was so much used to it, that it would hardly disorder her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Parrot. I cannot say you was drunk, I have seen you much worse, I believe you had been drinking, but you seem'd to be sensible, only you was in a great Passion.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How did I behave my self after you came down?</p>
               <p>Parrot. I was so frighted that I could not take particular Notice; but I remember you trembled and said, You would give a thousand Pounds to save her Life.</p>

            . I lodg'd up one Pair of Stairs at the Prisoner's House, about 2 in the Morning I heard a violent Out-cry of Murder. I waked my younger Brother who lay with me, and the Noise continuing I went down and found the Prisone (in his Shirt and Breeches, without his Wag) opening the Street Door, his Mother had a Candle in her Hand, and Mrs. Bormen stood crying with her Hair loose about her Ears, and the Prisoner gave her several Blows, and call'd the Watch, and bid them carry her Home, or to the Roundhouse. I asked him if he was not asham'd of himself, he said, She was an but his Mother said, was and Woman, and had brought him had lost his Watch and his M. When Mrs. Brown was gone, I was going upto bed again; but the Deceas'd pull'd me by the Sleeve, and pointed to his Door that I should get him to Bed. I persuaded him into his Room, and he sat down on the Bed side. As he was undressing himself, he told his Mother, that she was a wicked, drunken Monster, and a base Woman; that she had been the Ruin of him; that all his Misfortunes were owing to her, and that he had paid 15 or 16 l. for her but a few Days before. His Mother said, if it was so, it did not become him to tell her of it in that manner. He was in a great Passion, but at last I got him to Bed, and we went out; I shut his Door, and his Mother shut the Door of the Shop that goes into the Passage. I advised her to go to Bed, she thank'd me, and went down, and I went up.</p>
               <p>Court. Was either of them drunk?</p>
               <p>Gold. I believe they had both been drinking, but they both spoke perfectly well, and appear'd to be well in their Senses; I had not been a-Bed three Minutes when I heard a violent Noise at his Door. He swore he would not be lock'd in, but would break open the Door. I thought then he was coming to have a farther Dispute with his Mother, for I did not think the Maid was in the House because I had not seen her when he quarrell'd with Mrs. Bowman. While he was knocking at his own Door. I heard his Mother say. If I must open this Door, I'll have it. When his Door was open'd, I heard the Street Door shut, and then I was pretty easy. But soon after I heard a running and a scuffling Noise, as if two were struggling, and something fell down with a violent Force. After which I heard somebody come up to my Door barefoot, I at first thought it was the Prisoner, but opening the Door I found it was the Maid. Lord, Sir, says she, my Master has murder'd my Mistress, and I am afraid murder me too; and so I let he in. We all went down in a little time, and I believe my Brother<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173202230020"/> open'd the Street Door and call'd the Watch.

            , Watchman. As I was crying the hour of the Night, I came to the Prisoner's Door, and found a strange Watchman. What do you do here Friend, says I, Why, says he, I have lit a Man and a Woman hither. I heard a sort of a Dispute with a Woman within doors, and by and by the Deceas'd came out and asked who I was? and I told her, I was her Watchman, so she bid me fetch a Pint of Beer to make my Brother Watchman drink, which I did; and when I was come back with the Beer, I heard words encrease betwixt the Prisoner and the Woman, and at last I heard Blows, and the Woman cry'd Murder 3 times; with that I knock'd at the Door heartily, and the Prisoner open'd it. Who are you? says he, I am your Watchman, Sir, says I; then light this Woman safe home, says he, and I'll give you Six-pence; but when he felt in his Pocket he had no Money, and so he asked his Mother for some, she said she had neither Copper nor Silver. Why then, damn it, (says he, in a Passion) give me some Gold! The Woman had no Head-clothes on when she came out of his House, but she had 'em in her hand, and put 'em on at the Door, and so we lighted her home, and she gave us a Shilling. I came again to the beginning of my Beat, and then I went to the Prisoner's door, and found a Washer-woman there, and she said she believed there was Murder done; so I went in (for the Door was open) and down Stairs, and there I saw the Prisoner sitting as naked as ever he was born, with his Mother's Head betwixt his Legs; I went and called the Constable, and other Watch, and the Prisoner said, he had murdered his dear Mother, the best Friend he had in the World, and called for a Penknife, or a Rezor, to let her blood.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure he said murder'd ?</p>
               <p>Miller. Yes. And Mr. Cockerel, the Constable, was there at the same time.</p>

            , the Prisoner's Apprentice. I was waked about 2 in the Morning, by a Noise which was made in the Quarrel with Mrs. Bowman, who is our Embroideress. I heard her Shriek, and cry Murder. The Prisoner bid the Watch take her away, and she said, Ay, for God's Sake do, get me out of this House. After she was gone, I heard my Master knock at his Room-Door, and say, That be would not be lock'd up in his own House. And his Mother said, What a-devil ails the Man? I won't open it; or if I do, I'll go into the Street. Then I heard both the Doors open, and the Street-Door shut to again; and in a little time I heard her open the Street-Door with the Key, and come in.</p>

            ! what have I done? What have I done? Mary! Mary! bring a Light! Capt. Dunbar, who lodges in our 2 pair of Stairs Room, called out to me, For God's Sake, Jack, get up, he'll murder the poor old Woman! So I went down, and he was making his Complaint, and said, O my poor dear Mother; she is dead. Why won't you speak to me? he bid me fetch a Surgeon. I went up and saw several Watchmen, and I sent one of them for Mr. Martin, and went myself for Mr. Weems.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever observe that he treated her in an undutiful Manner? Barber. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Martin, Surgeon. I was called up about 3 to come to the Deceas'd; I found her lying along on her Back: Says I, She's dead, you have no need of me. The Prisoner was standing sideways, and desired me to bleed her; I prick'd her Arm, but she bled but about a Spoonful, for there was no Circulation of the Blood. I observed a Wound on the back-part of the Head, about an Inch long. Next Day the Coroner sent for me, and (Mr. Weems being with me) I opened the Skull,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173202230021"/> and found it crack'd in two Places from Ear to Ear, and a Piece of the Skull separated; so that it was impossible she should ever speak after the Blow. There was much extravasted Blood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Weems, Surgeon. Between 3 and 4 in the Morning, I found the Deceas'd dead; I felt of the Wound, but found no Fracture at that Time; I did not see the Prisoner, he being then in the next Room. I came again the next Day, and found the Skull crack'd 4 or 5 Inches, and a vast deal of extravasated Blood contained in the Ventricles of the Brain.</p>
               <p>[The Prisoner's Defence.]</p>
               <p>All that know me inwardly, know that I lov'd my Mother above all Things; that I lov'd her as dearly as any thing upon Earth; and I believe she has said the same to all the World. I went out in the Morning to speak with Capt. Randal, and from him I went to Mr. Hasleton, the Riding-Master's, and so to several others, drinking with one and with another. I was at the Tavern all the Afternoon, and went to the Ale-house at Night: From thence I went to Mrs. Bowman's; she ask'd me for my Watch, and a few Shillings that I had, that she might take care of them, and so she came home with me. My Mother ask'd her to stay and lie with her, and so did I too, but she would not consent, and that put me in a Passion, and so I beat her, and called the Watch to take her away. When she was gone, Mr. Gold put me to bed, but I did not like to be lock'd in, and so I got out and went down to the Maid without my shirt, and laid myself upon the Bed; and then my poor Mother came down, and ask'd me what Business I had with the Maid? and so I got up, and - and - my Mother run into the Coal-Vault, and I lighted a Match to look for her, but then she run Up-stairs, and I followed her; and some how or another, as she was endeavouring to get by me in the Dark, I suppose her Foot slipp'd, and she fell down. And this is the Truth, as I hope to see the Face of Almighty God.</p>

Sometime in September last, I had heard some spightful People say, that he had used her ill, and with unbecoming Language when he was in Drink. I ask'd my Mother about it, and she said, O Lord, Billy, it's quite otherwise, he has always treated me in the most tender endearing manner that ever Son did. Ah, Billy, I wish you was but half so good! She had enough to maintain her and therefore had no need to live with him if he had used her ill: But for 4 or 5 Years past she has been very much given to intoxicate herself with Drink.</p>

But she always said he was the most endearing Child in the World, and the most dutiful Child that ever Woman bore. About a Year and a half ago, there was some falling out betwixt me and her, and thereupon I said I would never go into her House again; but however, she came to see me, and always said what a good Son she had.

The Door that leads down the Stairs is in the Corner; and the Door into the Shop is almost close to it, not a Foot asunder; so that any Scuffle there might easily be the Occasion of a Fall; and if her Foot slipt at the Top, the Stairs are so steep, she must certainly fall to the Bottom.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner these thirty Years. He was all Obedience and Duty! A tender affectionate Son at all Times! The Delight of his Father's Heart. His Mother was continually praising him. She was always commending him for his Industry, and said, that he left every thing in her Hands. I sat up with her four Nights in a Week when she was sick, and he was always expressing a great Concern for her.</p>

She has been at my House when she could hardly stand, so that I once affronted her by speaking to her about it; for, in short, I was afraid, that in time, by their Intimacy, my Wife might follow her Example.

               <p>Hen. Gobin. I live behind the Prisoner's House. Between 2 and 3 in the Morning I heard a Noise, a Cry of Murder, and high Words, and then all was Calm again. And by and by I heard the Prisoner bemoan himself in a very piercing Way; and then he call'd out, Mary! bring me a Fork or a Penknife! Mary! Mary! for Jesus Sake, Mary! What, will no Body come a near me? O my God! She's dead! She's dead! My poor dear Mother's dead! but I did not hear a Word of saying, I have murder'd my Mother.</p>

               <p>Gobin. Yes, every Word.</p>
