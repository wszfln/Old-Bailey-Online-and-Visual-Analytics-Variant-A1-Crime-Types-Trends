I have attended Mrs. Hopkins several times and have examined her leg—I was not on duty when she was first admitted; there was a fracture of both the bones of her leg above the ancle—there was a bruise, but the skin was not broken; there were not any defined marks of violence.</p>

On Tuesday night last, I was outside Mr. Skinner's door and saw the prisoner take a coat which was outside, and run up the buildings where my mother lives—I told the shopman who was standing outside, he waited till the prisoner came down the court, took hold of him, and brought him into the shop wearing the coat which he had stolen.</p>

I had a letter from the governor of Newgate, requesting me to come here—I was sent for to the police-office—I was not at home, and my assistant dressed the prisoner's wound—she came to me next morning, and the wound was undressed on purpose for me to see it, and I gave my opinion, after carefully looking at it, that it was done with some sharp instrument; but it is very difficult to distinguish between a wound done with a knife and one done with this box of the door, which I have only just seen; it would depend on the way it is cut; it is a semicircular wound going right round the ball of the thumb; it is ragged at one end but clean at the other; now a wound might be done with a knife and yet be ragged at one end, the first part of it would be jagged even if done with a razor; to my mind it seems a very difficult thing to make a semicircular wound such as this from striking an object. I think it began at the back (<hi rend="italic">Examining the scar</hi>), but you can judge of it better, or as well as I can. The thick part of the wound is at the back, which would be the jagged part as I describe; that was evidently the last part that healed, as the scar is thicker there. This lock is so very sharp that I do not see how anyone can distinguish between a wound done by that and a wound done by a knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly Inspector of police of the G division—I was employed last month to watch a house in Graham-buildings, Twister's-alley—On 21st December, I went to that house with Inspector Briant, Serjeant Brannan, and Elliott, about half-past 6 o'clock—I had watched the house all the week previously—I saw a youth named Upton go into the house—I followed him in soon afterwards—I went into a room on the left hand on the ground floor—the street door was ajar, and the door of the room also, but instead of the door opening into the room as I expected, I pulled it, and shut myself in the passage till I broke out—after opening the door, I went into the room with the three constables—I saw the three prisoners there with the youth already alluded to—William Elliott was standing with his back to a bed and his face towards me, and he put his left hand out as if throwing something, and I heard something knock against a basket which stood inside the door—at that time Briant seized him, a struggle ensued, and I saw a white lump drop from between them on the floor, and William Elliott used every effort to stamp on it, which he did before Mr. Briant could remove it—Briant pulled him away, and pushed him into another part of the room, and put him in custody of Serjeant Brannan and Elliott—Briant said "He has broken it"—and I saw Briant pick up the fragments of a plaster of Paris mould—I looked in the basket, and found this rag containing six counterfeit shillings, wrapped up separately, and folded this way—three of them are of the date of 1853, two of 1842, and one of 1820—when we went into the room, the two women were standing close to the fire, which was a very large one—the place was excessively hot—I went to the cupboard, and found two files with white metal in their teeth—a paper containing plaster of Paris in powder, some pieces of tin, a small portion of plaster on them, and in a tub which stood inside the door, I found this basin containing plaster of Paris, and three or four lumps of soft plaster—it had been recently mixed with water—it will be soft till dried with great heat—I said to William Elliott, "Well Mr. Elliott, I received instructions from the Mint to look after you—I believe you are dealing in counterfeit coin"—Margaret Elliott then said to him, "I told you the other night when you was doing this, that there would be a b—y buss some day"—and William Elliott said, "Mr. George Carroll is at the bottom of this—I have not been long at it—I can't be much worse off than I am"—we took the three prisoners away in custody, and took possession of the things that were there, and produce them to-day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of the last witness. On 20th November, the prisoner was in our house with a young lad, whom I had not seen before—they called for half-a-quartern of gin—the prisoner paid me a shilling—I put it in my teeth, and found it was bad—I returned it to him, and the other gave me a good shilling. On 11th December, the prisoner came with a short young man—the prisoner called for half-a-quartern of gin—he gave me in payment a shilling—I noticed that it was bad, and told him so—I gave it to my sister—the prisoner offered me another shilling, which was good.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live in Bear-court, Blackfriars-road. On 14th December I was coming down Fleet-street about 9 o'clock in the evening—the prisoner came alongside of me and told me a long story, that she had come from Lincolnshire, and she had no money, and she would be very thankful if I would give her a few halfpence to get her a lodging—I went into a public-house in White Friar-street on the right hand side—I had a pint of beer—the prisoner stood between me and the door—I drank, and then handed the pint to her, and said, "Drink that," and I went to pass her—she said, "I can't drink it all, you drink the remain<lb/>der"—when I paid for the beer I took the money out of my right hand pocket—at that time my watch was safe certainly, it was fastened to the button hole or over the button with the key across—it was in my left hand waistcoat pocket—as soon as I got out of the house I went on my way home, towards Blackfriars-road—the prisoner walked outside of me in the street—she was after some money, and finding I denied her, she made a snatch at my watch—I made a grasp at her directly, and I received a blow at the back of my head, and down we both came together—I fell upon her; she was under me—it was a man that struck me, but I don't know who—when the prisoner made a snatch at my watch, she got it away, and the guard was hanging down, the ring breaking—the guard was left in my possession—when I was knocked down I had hold of her—with the blow my hat fell off—I kept my hand on her—she got her hand in my pocket—I noticed there was some<lb/>thing in her hand, which was my purse with 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—I saw her pass her hand to the man, and the man ran away when he heard some persons coming towards me—I took my purse out of her hand; she made a snatch at my chain—I held her till the policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Thurloe-place, Lower Norwood, and am the owner in conjunction with my son of 5, Farringdon-street, in the parish of St. Sepulchre—this is the lease (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 28<hi rend="italic">th February,</hi> 1813, <hi rend="italic">from James sivewrite, for twenty-one years</hi>)—it being empty in November, I engaged Mr. Martin to let it, and in consequence of what he told me, I met Perry at his office on 23d November—Perry proposed to take the house for the remainder of my lease, about fifteen years, paying 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. premium—I bargained for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he said that he was a printer in a large way of business, at 12, Milbank-street, Westminster, and that he wanted the house for a printing establishment, to put in expensive machinery to a large amount, and that he should want several hundreds to get it ready—he said that he was going to commence almost immediately—I ultimately agreed to take 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by three bills, and he signed this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in which he describes himself as a stationer of 12 Milbank-street, Westminster—Henry Baker was keeping the house for me at the time—I gave Perry possession on 25th November—it was not in a very good state as to the leads, but all the other part was in good repair—there was lead on the roof, and piping in the drain-pipes and water closets—there was also a large iron safe fixed, belonging to the owner of the house, which was worth not less than 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; also some mahogany swing doors with plate glass, which cost not less than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the fittings on them—I told Perry that the iron safe did not belong to me, but to the owner; I did not tell him the owner's name—in consequence of information I went there six or eight days afterwards, and the lead was every bit gone, the water closet pipes pulled down from the second floor to the bottom, and every thing was taken away—the lead across the roof from the back to the front, what is called the flushing, was gone, and also a considerable quantity of the lead on the roof, and the rest of it was turned up ready to move away—I also missed the copper from the kitchen, and the range, the tank, and the lead pipes connecting it—a lock was taken off, and I believe the doors would have gone in a day or two—the damage done was not less than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they tore the place to pieces.</p>

Q.</hi> Did not I say that the kitchen was as dark as a grave, and was of no use, and request it to be cleared? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You said that you wanted to put your machinery there; I said that the back part had been excavated—if it was necessary to take anything away to make any alterations for your business, that is one thing, but you were not to steal anything—neither of these three bills (<hi rend="italic">produced by Perry</hi>) is due; the first is not due till 28th January—I had borrowed 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the lease formerly—I did not tell you that I had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. borrowed on the house then, but 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing—when I went to the premises on the 7th or 8th, I saw some carpenters boarding up the place where the iron safe had been taken from the wall—the only fixtures put up were two desks put there as a blind—there was something of a counter brought in in the morning, and taken out before the evening—I saw the painters doing something to the front, but it was all deception—I ordered them to leave off work—I did not authorize the prisoner to do so, that I might get the key.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 49, Skinner-street, Snow-hill, and am an auctioneer—No. 5, Farringdon-street was put into my hands in August, and remained so till 20th November, when Browning called on me and said that he had been sent by a gentleman sitting in his chaise, to make enquiries about the terms of the house—I asked who the gentleman was—he said Mr. Perry of 12, Milbank-street, Westminster, a wholesale stationer and printer—I gave him the terms and he went away—he returned on the same day, and told me that Mr. Perry had looked the house over, and he would call on Monday to make me an offer—Browning called on the Monday, and made me an offer on behalf of Perry, in consequence of which I communi<lb/>cated with Mr. Robinson, who met Perry at my place on the following day, the 23d—Browning came again in the morning—he wanted to have an answer because they were about other premises, and I promised him an answer about the middle of the day—I wrote to Mr. Robinson—he came on the Tuesday morning to see if I had got an answer from the landlord—Mr. Robinson had not then arrived—he called again a second time, and Mr. Robinson was there—he then went away and sent Perry—I was present when the agreement was drawn up—I had occasion to go into the other office, and Mr. Robinson told me there was no occasion to go about the reference, he was quite satisfied with Perry—I drew up a temporary agree<lb/>ment by Mr. Robinson's request, so that they might be bound to the</p>

               <p>bargain by Thursday, as Mr. Robinson did not wish the matter to stand open till Thursday without a written agreement—that memorandum is here—in Mr. Robinson's presence the agreement was concluded—I saw the state of the premises before they were let in—I did not go outside the top of the house, but the inside was correct—I saw the safe and the mahogany doors—I went some time afterwards, and found that they had all been removed—the lead at the top of the house had been loosened—some was taken away and the rest left ready to be taken—the flushings were gone, and the water-closet pipes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Perry. Q.</hi> Was it a week before I took possession that you went over the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was within a few days—there was a kitchen range—I cannot say that I noticed a copper, but I believe there was one—I did not see that any lead was gone, because I only stood on top of the ladder and looked out; but I saw that it was cut, and saw that the flushing had been removed—water had come through a good space in the ceiling, which was very wet—I will not swear that the lead flat was touched—I heard most all of the conversation between you and Mr. Robinson—I know that a conversation took place relative to your making alterations; I do not recollect the exact words—there was some conversation about the front being cut into by the late tenant, and you asked what had become of the plate glass which had been removed to make way for the door—a perfect door was put in the middle, and the glass was taken away—I saw Browning after I had been over the premises with Mr. Robinson—he came to see if I had any message for you some days after possession had been given—that was the day that Browning was given into custody in the afternoon, as I understand—I had some conversation with Browning respecting the alterations and repairs—the shop ceiling was, certainly, in tenantable repair when you took possession—the water had been through a portion of one side, but the ceiling was not almost coming down.</p>

I live at 11, Back-lane, Smithfield—I am a carman out of employment—On 7th December, about half-past 6, I saw a truck standing at the door of 5, Farringdon-street—I saw Browning and two boys putting a sack into it, which appeared to contain something heavy—finding that they had difficulty, I helped them, and then followed the truck to Mr. Farmiloe's, 118, St. John-street—the two boys brought the truck back empty, the sack having been taken inside—a day or two after-wards, I saw what appeared to be a piece of lead, brought out and put into the truck—as I saw something suspicious in it, I followed the truck to the same place.</p>

I know the prisoners by sight—On 7th December, I was on duty in Farringdon-street, inside the house 5, about half-past 5 o'clock; I saw the prisoners with a sack on the floor, which appeared very heavy, about 1 cwt.—I watched them, and saw two boys come with a truck—Perry came to the door and opened it, and Browning dragged it out on to the pavement—a man in a white jacket assisted them—It appeared to contain lead from the weight and sound—the boys took it away in the truck, and the prisoners went back again—Perry only came to the door.</p>

I am a lead and glass merchant of 118, St. John-street—I know the prisoners—I can speak confidently to Browning, and I believe I have seen Perry twice or three times—I first saw Perry about December 1st.—I cannot say what he brought on that occasion, but he brought me old lead on several occasions, ordinary old gutters—he may have brought me some pipe, but I do not remember it—he brought me thin sheet lead as if it had been used for roofing and flushing—he gave the name of Reeve, Endell-street—on Wednesday 8th December, Browning brought two gutters weighing 1 cwt.—I weighed it, sent into the counting-house, and I believe he took the money for it—I am the son of the head of the firm.</p>

               <p>but we do not take the name of the person bringing the lead, only of the person to whom it is said to belong—Perry had stated that the lead he sold, came from Green of Endell-street, and Browning the same—I believe the lead has been flushings, pipes, and sheet lead; but I have not been in the habit of seeing it myself—I saw it on 8th December, but not till after the person had left—I do not understand much about lead—I did not notice whether it had been recently cut.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Canonbury-place, Islington. On Wednesday, 22d December, about half-past 3 o'clock, I was coming out of the London and Westminster bank; when I bad got as far as the corner of Bartholomew-lane, Mr. Higginson accosted me—I did not then know him—he asked me if I was Mr. Salomons, I told him "No"—I presumed he meant the Al<lb/>derman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030034"/>
               <p>and I told him the Alderman was then in the London and West-minster bank, as I had just previously ascertained—I returned to the bank about half an-hour afterwards, and met Alderman Salomons coming out of the bank; I joined him, and we proceeded up Bartholomew-lane, towards the South Eastern Rail way, intending to go to the station—Mr. Higginson then accosted the Alderman, I should say within ten yards of the place where I had previously seen him—he spoke to the Alderman in a somewhat excited tone, with a gradually raised tone—thinking he might have business with the Alderman, I advanced a few paces, to leave them to transact their business—I did not hear what his first words were, but I soon heard what he was saying—I did not hear the first words that passed between them on either side—the first words I overheard Mr. Higginson say, in a somewhat raised tone, which was the cause of my overhearing them, were "What do you mean by delusions?"—I did not hear the answer clearly, as the Alderman spoke lower I presume—I naturally turned round, and saw Mr. Higginson in the act of striking the Alderman with a stick over the shoulder—it was an or<lb/>dinary walking stick; he was very near the Alderman, and he struck in this manner (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>); if I recollect right, he struck with both hands, but I am not certain; I then seized Mr. Higginson round the waist—a crowd presently collected—he did not say a word after I seized him, until we got to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you brother-in-law to Mr. Salomons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am—when you first spoke to me on that afternoon, you spoke courteously and calmly—when I afterwards returned to the London and Westminster bank, I did not inform the Alderman that anyone had inquired for him; it made no impression on me—I did not know who it was that had spoken to me—I had no conversation whatever with the Alderman on the subject—it had not been arranged that I should go with the Alderman to the railway—I was frequently in the habit of going with him—I did not go with him in consequence of having seen you—I was not in the habit of going with him every day; it might be twice a-week—I could not have informed the Alderman who you were, for I did not know; I had scareely heard of you, more than what I had seen in the papers—we did not arrange any plan what to do if you spoke to me; on my oath no such arrangement was made; we did not arrange not to speak, or not to listen if we were spoken to; there was no arrangement whatever—I did not see the Alderman push you aside, or hear him say that it was untrue that he had said you were mad, and he was in a hurry to get to the railway—I heard no more than I have already stated—the Alderman and I left the bank together—I don't think we were arm-in-arm, I would not undertake to swear it, but I believe not—I should say I was not more than four or five yards from the Alderman when you accosted him—I think it is quite possible for the Alderman to have pushed you aside, and have said that, it was untrue that he had said you were mad, without my hearing it; I am not so quick of hearing, perhaps, as some per-sons, and I was not listening to your conversation—I was a little in advance; I don't know on which side the Alderman I might have been, I think it was a little to the left—I cannot say what he did with his right hand, as my back was towards him—I did not see the Alderman knock your hat off—I did not see your hat off, I did not notice it—I will not swear it was not off—the Alderman did not drop his railway wrapper that I am aware of—I will not swear he did not—I seized you round the waist, and I believe I held you pretty tight—I believe I seized you by the arms—I should say I did not put both hands to your throat and squeeze you against the wall; I think not—to the best of my impression I did not seize you by the throat, but I think I should have been perfectly justified if I had; I will not swear</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030035"/>
               <p>I did not—I assailed you very strenuously, that was after you had struck the Alderman with the stick—I saw no more than the blow which you made at him with the stick—my impression now is, since you have spoken of it, that your hat was off at the time you struck the blow, but I will not undertake to swear one way or the other—I heard the Alderman state at Guildhall that I pinioned you against the wall—whether in holding your body I leant against the wall or not I cannot exactly state, I might natu<lb/>rally avail myself of the wall—I cannot undertake to swear that you said you did not wish to hurt the Alderman—I will not swear you did not say those words, I don't recollect hearing them—I released my hold of you because the Alderman was separated from you—I was not afraid of you personally—I did not hear you say that the Alderman might have been content to swindle the Atlantic Telegraph Company without imputing mad<lb/>ness to you—I will not swear those words were not spoken—I don't think they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did I not say that the telegraph cable had been broken from the first, according to their own reports, and, therefore, no message could ever have been passed through it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear one word about the telegraph—I did not hear it mentioned, I swear that—after the assault a crowd collected—if such words were said loudly, I should say it would be impossible but that they could have been overheard by some one—I could not swear they were not said—I have had no conversation with any one as to what I should say here, I swear that—I should say I have not had one word with the Alderman about it—to the best of my knowledge your name has hardly been mentioned between us; on my oath, this inquiry has been very casually alluded to, nothing more than as to the sanity or wisdom of the aggressor—there was no agreement between us to impute insanity to you, nor any discussion as to the propriety of doing so—I do not believe you violently insane—I have not been examined by the attorney conducting this case, as to the nature of my evidence; on the day after your examination, the solicitor took a note of the evidence that I had to give—I have had no conversation with any one respecting the evidence I had to give—I had not said one word to the Alderman respecting my evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you had any conversation with any member of the Atlantic Telegraph Company on the subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know any of the members of the Atlantic Telegraph Company, nor any of the shareholders, as share-holders—of course I know the Alderman, I don't know him in his capacity of a shareholder—I have not had any communication or conversation with any shareholder in the Bank of England on this subject, I swear that—the Alderman did not say after the policeman arrived, that he had a great mind not to give you into custody—it was not at my request that he gave you in charge, I believe it was his own act—some few minutes elapsed before the policeman came—I am almost certain that no such occurrence took place—I swear to the best of my belief that it did not—I accompanied you to the police-station in Bow-church-lane—I heard the Alderman state the charge—I will not swear whether I did or did not hear you say that he was not telling the truth, I do not recollect it—I did not hear him reply that he was not then on his oath—I should think he could not have said so without my hearing him, but I did not pay particular attention to the words—I will not swear he did not say so—I don't remember hearing you request him to remember that he was "on the gentleman"—I do not recollect any such expression, and I think I should have recollected if you had said it—I heard the Alderman state that he did not wish you to be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030036"/>
               <p>detained—I did not hear him order the inspector to take your recognizance of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and discharge you if you gave your address—I was not out of the police-station from the period that I went in, until I departed with the Alderman, I might have been at the door, I believe I was at the door, to request a policeman to get a cab—I heard the Alderman tell the inspector that he did not wish you to be detained, that he should be satisfied with your address and an undertaking to appear—I do not recollect any sum being named—there was a man in uniform, I presume he was the inspector—the Alderman requested him to be as expeditious as possible in the business; he was in a great hurry in order not to miss his train.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could any other person than a magistrate in the execution of his office have given such an order? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The officers would naturally have some deference toward those immediately above them, and would perhaps give them a little more facility than to others—I cannot say whether that might be so or not—as to whether a common accuser could have given any such order, I know no more than any other individual, I know nothing at all on the subject—it did not strike me as monstrous or singular, that any roan should act as accuser and judge at the same time; I did not perceive that there was any judgment in the question, nothing of the kind; I was not dazzled with the magnificence of nay relative's position—I saw no gross violation of justice in the matter—I made no statement at the station—I don't think the Alderman discharged you on your recognizance, my impression is, that he did not act as a magistrate at all in the matter, but merely as any individual giving you in charge might do—I think anyone else but a magistrate might have acted in the same manner—I never witnessed such an occurrence before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you heard a magistrate or cadi so conducting himself in Russia, France, or Constantinople; would you not have known it to be a gross oppression, and glory in your privilege as an Englishman, to be exempt from it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really cannot answer that question—I have never discussed the result of this case with any person whatever—I swear that—I did not consider as to whether the Alderman was over-matched by you, when I seized you—I considered his position was not consistent with a street row, or scuffle—I think I was perfectly authorized under the circumstances, in seizing you—the Alderman was entirely passive as far as I saw—you did not struggle with me, you were remarkably quiet—I did not assail you until I saw you in the act of striking the Alderman—It appeared to me to be a violent and ruffianly assault—the Alderman was not hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was it that he was not hurt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appeared to me that Mr. Higginson was too close to him, and that only that part of the stick nearest the handle must have descended on the shoulder.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Upton, near Stratford—I was in Bartholomew-lane, on 22d December—I observed two gentlemen approaching me—I did not know either of them at that time, but they proved to be Alderman Salomons, and Lieutenant Higginson—I did not hear anything said by either of them—I was about three or four yards from them—I noticed Lieutenant Higginson make a kind of snatch with his open hand, at the face of Alderman Salomons—The Alderman threw his head back, and then the defendant raised a stick which he bad in his hand—I think it was in his left hand—It appeared to be an ordinary walking stick—he brought it down as it appeared to me, on the Alderman's shoulder—I then noticed Mr. Cohen; he rushed forward, seized the lieutenant by the two shoulders, and pinioned him against the wall, and at that moment his hat fell off—I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030037"/>
               <p>not noticed the Alderman give any provocation—I then advanced, but did not touch him myself—I heard him say that he was Lieutenant Higginson, and that his object was to bring his case before the public; that he intentionally assaulted the Alderman and pulled his nose—he then said to the Alderman "You have treated me very ill, you know you have—I have assaulted you purposely—I wish to be taken into custody"—some few minutes after, a policeman came up and he was given into custody—I went to the station, and I heard him make a similar statement there; that he had intentionally assaulted the Alderman—the Alderman expressed him-self extremely desirous of getting home; he had, as he said, a dinner party, and his words were, "I do not wish the defendant to be inconvenienced and therefore I hope" or "wish he may be discharged on his own recognisance"—I don't recollect the defendant making any observation to that—I have no doubt that he was discharged on his own recognisance, bat I left before the form was completed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Where did you first see the Alderman and I on the day in question? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very nearly opposite the Auction mart—I was coming from the Exchange towards the London and Westminster bank, and I saw the Alderman and you approaching me—I did not witness your first meeting—my impression was, that you made the snatch at his face with your right band, but I should not like to say positively—I was in front of you on the pavement, three or four yards off—your hand was open decidedly—I then saw you raise the stick—your hat was on at that time—I am quite sure of that—I did not see the Alderman push you before that, nor do I believe he did—I think I should have seen if he had done so—I cannot say whether he had done so before I saw him—I saw no one but you and the Alderman when I first observed you—I did not see Mr. Cohen at the moment—if he had been alongside of you I must have seen him—I did not see him—I volunteered my evidence to the Alderman—I said that I had witnessed the assault—you did not see me walk down from the bank and join the crowd afterwards—there was no assemblage at the moment I saw you commit the assault, but immediately afterwards, when Mr. Cohen laid hold of you and pinioned you against the wall, then a crowd collected—I can't tell where Mr. Cohen came from—the first time I saw him was when he seized you by the shoulders—I think he held you by both your shoulders—I don't think he held you round the waist—your hat came off from Mr. Cohen's laying hold of you, that is my impression—he pressed you suddenly, I may say violently, against the wall of the Bank of England, and the jerk knocked your hat off—Mr. Cohen's hands were not on both sides of your neck, not that I saw—I should say that your stock was not torn—I did not observe it—I will not swear it was not—your dress was not at ail disarranged—I will not swear it was not, but I did not see that it was—I did not know Alderman Salomons when I met him—I called him Alderman Salomons after I heard who he was—I knew who he was when I tendered my evidence—I did not consider this a good opportunity of making his acquaintance—I swear that—will you allow me to explain the reason I volunteered my evidence; I happened to know Mr. Roy, the Alderman's solicitor, extremely well, and I was on my way there at the time I saw this assault, and as I saw Mr. Roy afterwards I told him what I had seen—I have had conversation since as to what took place on this occasion—I will tell you the nature of it if you think proper, but it will not be very complimentary to you—I expressed an opinion without a doubt that you were under delusions, and I am sorry to say I think so now—I have said that I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030038"/>
               <p>believed you were suffering under some delusion or other, and I was sorry to see so gentlemanlike a man as you labouring under delusion—I have never seen you before—I have read the accounts in the papers of your appearance before the Alderman—I cannot believe that a gentleman holding such a position as you do, would be guilty of such an assault on an unoffend<lb/>ing gentleman, unless you were partially insane—your conduct at the Guildhall was very eccentric, and different from other persons—I think my grounds of belief quite sufficient, that you are labouring under a delusion; you are labouring under an imaginary grievance, therefore I think you are not sane—I have no other grounds for saying so than what I saw in the papers, and what took place on this occasion; but I think they are sufficient—I am a literary man, and connected with the press—I am connected with the <hi rend="italic">Field Newspaper</hi>—I am not in any position in which the Alderman could be of the slightest benefit to me—I heard you say that you wished your case, as connected with the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Telegraph Cable,</hi> to be brought again before the public—you said that Alderman Salomons had treated you very ill—I understood you to mean in connexion with the Atlantic telegraph.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I make use of these words, on your oath, that the Alderman might have been content to swindle the Atlantic Telegraph Company, without imputing to me madness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You never uttered any such words in my hearing—I did not hear you say that the Alderman ought to be ashamed of himself, or words to that effect—I heard you say to Mr. Cohen that you had no wish to hurt the Alderman—I accompanied you to the police-station—the Alderman said he did not wish to detain you; that he was in a hurry to get home; that it was not his wish to inconvenience you, he hoped that you would be discharged on your own recognisance—no sum was mentioned in my hearing—I swear that he did not, in my hearing, tell the inspector to take your recognisance in 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think if he had said so I must have heard it—I was not out of the office—I cannot swear he did not say it—I did not hear the Alderman say to Mr. Cohen that he had a great mind not to give you into custody—I never saw anybody act with greater forbearance in my life, than the Alderman did towards you—I did not see him acting at all as a judge—he directed the inspector to take the charge as soon as he could—he then said he did not wish to detain you; that he wished your recognisance to be taken, and that you should be discharged upon that being taken—I left before the form was completed, and don't know what the sum mentioned was—the inspector was not in the office when we first went in; he was sent for—I remember Mr. Cohen going out for a cab—I should not consider it a grievous oppression if I had been so treated—I should think it extremely kind to be discharged on my own recognisance—according to my impression the Alderman was not acting as a magistrate at all—if instead of ordering you to be discharged, he had ordered you into a cell, that would not have been so kind—I think if I had been the accuser instead of the Alderman, the inspector would have listened to the same suggestion from me—I attended at the Mansion-house next day—I sat on the bench beside Alderman Salomons—the Alderman sat on the bench beside Sir Robert Carden—the Alderman was sworn according to the Jewish form, he gave his evidence from the bench—I don't think he spoke several times confidentially to Sir Robert Carden during the examination—I say decidedly not, because I heard everything that he said—he said he placed himself in the hands of Sir Robert Carden for the case to be dealt with in the ordinary way—he did speak to Sir Robert Carden, but not con<lb/>fidentially</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030039"/>
               <p>—I swear that—he did not say anything to him that I did not bear—I was too close not to hear everything that was said—I really don't know whether it is customary to have an accuser and a witness sitting on the bench with the judge; I have seldom attended a court—I think it is decent—if my lords had the witnesses for the prosecution sitting beside them I don't think it would be a gross violation of public decency, if they wished them to be there—you asked to be allowed to cross-examine the alderman—Sir Robert Carden said that as you wished the case to be sent to the Sessions he would not permit any cross-examination—you were not allowed to cross-examine, because you were out of order—Sir Robert Carden said that as you did not wish him to adjudicate upon the ease he should send it to the Sessions in accordance with your wish—there appeared no reason to me why you did not wish Sir Robert Carden to adjudicate; it was certainly not because he would not allow you to cross-examine the alderman; I should say that was not your objection—you did not express the objection on that ground openly before the whole court—you did not say that as you were not allowed to cross-examine the alderman you objected to the jurisdiction of the court—I swear that—you said you did not think you should have justice done you in that court; you gave no reason why—you did not state that it was because you were not allowed to cross-examine the alderman, because you would have been allowed to cross-examine had you allowed Sir Robert Carden to go into the case—you asked Sir Robert Carden if he was a shareholder in the Atlantic Telegraph Company, and he said he was not, and never should be, and never had been—he did not at first order you to enter into your own recognizance in 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to appear and take your trial—I swear that—he ordered you to enter into your own recog<lb/>nizance in 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to find a surety for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Alderman Salomons did not interfere and propose that you should find the additional bondsman in 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear that—I do not think anything was said about your keeping the peace; I will not swear it—I did not hear Alderman Salomons object to the case being sent to the Sessions as too trivial a case, and one that ought to be decided by the magistrate there—he did not say so openly in court; I swear that—I did not hear him say so, and I do not believe he did; he might have said it without my hearing it, I do not think he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you ever heard of magistrates thus acting as accuser, advocate, and judge in their own case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not perceive that they acted in any such form; they did nothing of the sort that I witnessed—if a stipendiary magistrate had acted in the same way I think he would have acted very properly; I think a stipendiary magistrate would have done the same—I do not think there was any oppression in the case whatever.</p>

Higginson," or "You are Lieut. Hig<lb/>ginson?" interrogatively—he said, "Don't you know me?" I then said, "Indeed, I hardly recollected you," or some words to that effect—he then said, "You have said, "or" You say that I am a madman;" to which I answered, "No, I don't think I have; but I have said you are under delusions"—he then quickly said, "What do you mean by 'under delusions'"—to which I replied, "You must put your own construction upon it, "or some words to that effect—the words were hardly out of my mouth, when he rushed from</p>

               <p>my side, and got in front of me, and I felt his hand in my face, just touching my nose—I convulsively raised my arm to ward off the attack, when he stepped back, and raised a stick violently, which just came on my shoulder, because, in the meantime, my brother-in-law who was close to me, rushed upon him and pinioned him—to the best of my recollection, I never did anything in the way of resenting a blow, or uttered a single word to him, except order an officer to be sent for—a crowd collected, and a gentle<lb/>man named Milk, who I did not then know, came up to me, and told me who he was, and said he had witnessed the assault—after an interval of a minute or two, to allow an officer to come up, I gave the individual in charge, followed with the officer to the police-station, and gave Lieut. Hig<lb/>ginson in charge, precisely in the same way as any other individual may have done—I think it right to state that my wife was expecting me home by the express train, and it was a most painful thing to me, fearing she might be alarmed if I was detained; my brother-in-law went to get a cab, and luckily, I did save the train.</p>

Hig<lb/>ginson?" or "You are Lieut. Higginson"—you said, "Don't you know me?" or "Sure you know me"—I said, "No, I do not recollect you"—you then asked me whether I had said you were a madman, or were mad; to which, of course, I said, in the most polite language I could, "No, I have not; but I have said you are under delusions"—you then asked me what I meant by "delusions," to which I said, "You must put your own interpretation upon it"—that was what took place; then you assaulted me—when you accosted me, I did not tell you that I was in a hurry, and could not stop—I never said one word of the kind—you joined me by the corner of the Bank of England, to the best of my recollection, and before we had got to the Bank-gate, which is not twenty yards, you assaulted me—there was not much time for conversation—we walked just as would allow the conversation which I now state, to occur—I do not think I said, when you first met me, that I could not stop, for I was in a hurry to get home to Mrs. Salomons; I may have said so, but if I am bound to swear, I say I did not—I will swear I did not say so—I have not said that you made use of any violent expression—remember one thing, that I am not only on my oath as a man, but as a Magistrate—I know what is due from a Magistrate, and I am very scrupulous what I swear to—you did not make use of any violent expression—I was on the side nearest the Bank of England, the right-hand side—Mr. Cohen was on the outside—I should say I was in the middle, between you, when you joined me, you were inside—I am pretty sure that was so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I ask you, why, being an admitted shareholder in the Atlantic Telegraph Company, you had adjudicated in your own case at Guildhall; and, on the following day, had selected Alderman Rose to sit with you, he likewise being a shareholder in the company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think, after a crowd collected, you did say something about the Atlantic Telegraph Company, but what it was I cannot recollect; my mind was too much occupied at that time—it</p>

               <p>was addressed to the crowd—I cannot say what it was—I don't think you said that my dishonestly selecting Alderman Rose to sit with me was a disgrace to the judicial integrity of the City Magistracy; but you may have said so, for I really took no notice—you may or may not have said so; but, if you did, it was not true.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I ask you to stop and answer me, stepping before you, and did you push me aside saying you were in a hurry to get to the train? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never touched you to my knowledge, most distinctly, on my oath; I say most distinctly and decidedly, no—you did not ask me to stop—I thought until to-day that Mr. Cohen was by my side at the time, but it appears from what he has said, that thinking we had some private business, he went a little aside—we came out of the bank together, not arm in arm, he was close to my side—I was in a very great hurry to get to the rail, that there is no doubt about—I have not had any conversation with Mr. Cohen, or any other witness respecting this matter—I saw Mr. Cohen last night at his father's, and I never mentioned your name to him—I met him at 10 o'clock this morning at the Old Bailey, but I never mentioned your name to him—on my oath I have never discussed this matter with Mr. Cohen, nor in my family; I never even told my wife until I gave her the newspaper—I never dis<lb/>cussed this matter with Mr. Cohen; we never discuss matters that are to be gone into in a court of justice—you don't suppose I <hi rend="italic">crammed</hi> him—I have had no communication on the subject with the Atlantic Telegraph Company or any of its officers, except speaking to Mr. Freshfield's partner, Mr. Newman, on the day when he was a witness; I said that you had got some very strange de<lb/>lusions on the subject, or something of that sort—I have not sworn that you at<lb/>tempted to pull my nose—I said that I felt your hand just touching my nose, and I convulsively threw my arm up to defend it; you know best what you attempted—I will take back the word "convulsively," if you like—I threw up my left arm suddenly, or violently—it did not touch you, only your arm—I dare say my arm came in contact with yours, and threw it up—it did not knock your hat off—I was not in a striking attitude—I was astonished at the attack, and as any other man would, taken suddenly, I threw up my arm, seeing your arm coming across—I do not know whether I touched your arm or not, for you went back so quickly with the stick—on my oath I had not touched you at all before that, as we walked together—I am quite clear as to that—I did not let my railway wrapper fall to my know<lb/>ledge; if you say it was on the ground, I will admit that it was, but to my knowledge it was not, I think I kept it on my arm all the time; I should say it did not fall, because if it had fallen it would have been dirty—if I am bound to swear, I will swear it did not fall—</p>

               <p>I think it was on my left arm—to the best of my knowledge Mr. Cohen pinioned you—I saw him assault you—I believe he threw himself round you so as to pinion you entirely, and hold you against the bank—I consider he did me a great service, for he saved a scuffle, which I should have lamented exceedingly—I think he threw himself round you, so as to pinion your arms—his object no doubt, was to prevent your using your arms—I think he put his arms round your body and your arms, grasping you within his arms—he had not hold of you by the throat, most distinctly not—I did not see your hat off, but it may have been—I really cannot say—I was close to you, as close as I am to the gentleman in the jury-box—if I am bound to swear, I should say your hat was on; but I have heard a gentleman say it was off—to the best of my knowledge it was not off at all—I swear that that is my impression—I think some words passed between you and Mr. Cohen when he seized you, but I do not remember what they were—I heard you complain of his holding you—you said he had no business to do so; that he was not a constable, or something to that effect—you did not say he was choking you—I think you said that no constable could take you, because he had not seen the assault—you also addressed the crowd, something about the telegraph, which I do not remember—I do not recollect your saying anything about not wishing to hurt me—I will not swear you did not my so—I doubt whether it could be ten or sixteen yards from where you first met me, to where the scramble took place—to the best of my recollection you joined me at the corner of Bartholomew-lane, and the scuffle took place long before we got to the Bank-gate—it could not be more than ten or fifteen yards—I cannot speak within five yards—Mr. Mills came up when the crowd collected; he was one of the crowd—we had not got to the gate of the Rotunda before he came up; it was very near it, some few yards from it—he addressed me after the scuffle as one who had seen the assault—I did not see anybody present when the scuffle commenced, but Mr. Cohen, you, and myself; but I was engaged talking to you—I thought Mr. Cohen was by my side, but it appears he was not—you have heard what he has stated, his evidence is better than mine; he can speak about his own acts, which I cannot do—I did not hear you throughout make use of any violent language, and nothing took place as to words, except what I have sworn—you were eool at first; when you spoke to me, you were a little more warm, but nothing to warn me of any attack—I did not see you assault Mr. Cohen in any way; if you had done so, I could not have helped seeing it, at least I think so—I was not at any time so far off, as not to see and hear what was doing—I have heard Mr. Cohen examined to-day—he is one of the most truthful men in the king<lb/>dom; I am quite sure that whatever he says is true, therefore if he differs from me, you have the advantage of it—I did not hear you ask Mr. Cohen to take his hand off your throat, and say you could not breathe; he is too much of a man to do anything of the sort—if you had said so, I certainly should have heard it, nor should I have allowed him to assault you in any way—I did not know Mr. Mills—he addressed me as a stranger—I have not since had any conversation with him as to what he was to say here; not upon any occasion or in any place—the attorney for the prosecution has not examined me as to what I was going to say to-day—I do not think that I desired a working man in plain clothes to take you into custody, prior to the constable coming up; I may have done so; I should say not—I ordered a constable to be sent for—the man did not reply that it served me right, and he would not do it—when the policeman arrived, I gave you</p>

               <p>into his charge—I never said that I had a great mind not to give you into custody, I should say decidedly not, but my anxiety was so great to avoid alarm, and to get down to the country, that I will not swear such a thing may not have been said, in case a policeman could not be found; but I don't think it did take place—I say distinctly and decidedly that I did not say so after the constable arrived—I wished to avoid, if I could, going down to the police-station to make the charge, on account of my anxiety to save the train, but the policeman said it was necessary, and therefore at the hazard of losing my train I went to make the charge at the station—I have received three letters from you, to which I sent three answers—I have your last letter, I cannot find the other two (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner handed in copies of the letters</hi>)—this is the third letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I received two previously—(<hi rend="italic">at the prisoner's request the letter was read dated</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th November</hi> 1858)—I sent an answer to that letter, of which this is a copy—(<hi rend="italic">this was read, and also one from the prisoner, dated Portsmouth, 19th October, 1858, and Mr. Alderman Salomons' reply, dated October</hi> 23,)—I also sent an answer through Mr. Gardiner my secretary to the other letter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ALDERMAN SALOMONS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Recurring to our happy meeting, did I inquire why you had denied to the Greenwich electors that you had apologized for your misconduct as a Magistrate in open court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not quite see what answer I can give to that—I had never seen you from the day you were in my court until the day you assaulted me—I never did apologize to you in open court at any time—I swear that—I know perfectly well what you allude to—what I did was this: from your violence I was obliged out of respect to my court to order you out, and when you came next day I expressed the natural regret that any gentleman or any Magistrate would feel at being obliged to do so to a person of your rank—I thought that was due to myself, and that it might soothe your mind also—I did not apologize to you in open court for my conduct to you on the preceding day, but I expressed in the most courteous language I could, the regret that I felt—and which I feel now at being here to-day, very strongly indeed, for I am very sorry to be here—not as an apology but with a view to soothe your mind, as well as to express what I felt at being obliged to adopt the unusual practice of ordering an applicant to be led out of court—(<hi rend="italic">the prisoner here read an extract from a newspaper, of an obser<lb/>vation addressed by the Alderman to the defendant at the police-court, containing the words,</hi> "If I was not quite so forbearing to you yesterday as I might have been, I regret it,")—I have no doubt whatever that that is a true report—that is not an apology—seeing you to be a lieutenant in the Navy, and not being aware of the peculiarities which you exhibited afterwards, I wished as far as possible to treat you just as ray equal, and I used the strongest language I could to express the extreme pain and regret I felt at being obliged by your own conduct to order you out of the court—I thought it would be an amiable thing on my part, both to relieve myself and to make you as comfortable as I could—(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner again read the extract</hi>)—I did regret it—I regret it even now—there is nothing in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030046"/>
               <p>your letters manifesting any hostile spirit on your part—I think the letters are courteous, and I think you are always courteous when you are not contradicted—I have never made use of any language towards you that could be construed as offensive—I may have been asked about your notions of the cable, and I may have said off-hand "He is a madman"—I did not mean to say you were a madman—I have not promulgated that you were—I may have casually said with regard to your opinions, or fancier, or views of the Atlantic Telegraph Company, "Well, he is mad," or, "He is mad upon it," or, "He is a madman," in that way, but not with a view to stigmatize you—I did not mean to say that you were a madman <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>—it was not solely in compliance with Mr. Cohen's request that I gave you in charge to the police constable—the constable could not have heard me say so—I followed you to the police-station—I was very impatient that they should take the charge quickly, as I was most painfully anxious to get away by the 4.30 train, which was the only train I could get home by—I did net hear you say that you were anxious to get home—I do not know that the Bank of England has refused to pay you 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for work and labour done for them in an invention supplied, on account of your hostility to the Atlantic Telegraph Company—I never heard of it till now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that the Atlantic Telegraph Company suppressed my work "The Ocean, its depths, and phenomena" because it revealed the impossibility and the fraud of the undertaking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not—I could not make out what grievance you had with the Telegraph Company, except what I heard incidentally that it was something about some work which you say they suppressed—I think I heard that from Mr. Freshfield's partner, Mr. Newman—I say as I have said before, that I have not had any communication with the Bank of England or the Atlantic Telegraph Company upon this subject, except incidentally some conversation with Mr. Newman on the day of this assault—I know nothing about whether your pamphlet was suppressed by the company, or whether they deprived you of the results of your literary labours as well as deprived you of your invention without compensation—the only thing by which I knew of your having anything to do with the Atlantic Telegraph Company was from a pamphlet which you sent me and which I read, containing letters to them—I know nothing about any work being suppressed—I do not know that they adopted your invention of laying it down without paying for it—I should doubt it very much—I do not know that in 1851 you registered the machinery, with the exception of the pulleys, which was used on board the Agamemnon, except from your letters in the pamphlet which I read—I was not an active member of the company; I am a passive one—I have only sunk my money, and I am very glad to have taken part in that invention—I have no knowledge that your invention was used with<lb/>out compensation—I have not the smallest knowledge on the subject, of any kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In fact, has not the whole power of the Atlantic Telegraph Company been used through you, as a magistrate, upon several occasions, to crush me and my plans? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> So far from it, I beg to say, that in this instance, although summonses are always heard in private, this being a summons against a public company, we took it out of the usual course; for I thought you had some wrong that might be remedied—Mr. Martin, the clerk of the court apprised mo before I came in, of the nature of your application, so far as this; that it was an application to which the Atlantic Telegraph Company was a party, and I then told him as I told you, that I could</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030047"/>
               <p>not bear the case—Alderman Rose came in on the following day as a spectator, and sat next to me—he did not say that I was to be sup<lb/>ported; I swear that—I believe Alderman Rose is a shareholder in the Atlantic Telegraph Company—I did not know it then—I know it now, for he was at the company the other day as a shareholder, and he has told me he was a shareholder—the newspapers say that he moved a resolution the other day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then both you and he, being shareholders in the Atlantic Telegraph Company, sat at Guildhall to adjudicate on your own case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; that is not so at all; do not couple Alderman Rose with me—he came in as a spectator, and sat upon the bench, as he might sit upon the bench now as a commissioner of this court; that is all—when you were very violent Alderman Rose did interfere, but I put him down, I am very jealous of my brother Magistrates interfering when I am sitting—I don't want their assistance—I did not at the Bow-lane station, exercising my jurisdiction as a magistrate, order the inspector to take your own recognisance of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and discharge you on giving your address—I did what any prosecutor would do, either suggested that he should take bail, or not, believing your word could be taken, to appear—I was most anxious to get away, and suggested that you should be let out on your own recognisance, and I think that was a kindness for which you ought to thank me, and not find fault with—without that interference, if I had been a common accuser, they would not have let you go without your finding bail—the moment I had made the charge I left—I don't know what was done between you and the inspector; I was too happy to get into a Hansom cab and gallop off to save my train—I did not order the inspector to take your recognisance in 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I swear that—I suggested that he might let you go on your own recognisance to appear next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was I prevented by Sir Robert Carden from cross-examining you at the Mansion-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think Sir Robert Carden suggested, when he had heard my statement, that as the case must go elsewhere, and he had heard sufficient to enable it to be sent there, he must stop further cross-examination—he is responsible for his own acts—I have nothing whatever to do with it; I was there like any other complainant—I should say the police-inspector would have released you upon a similar order from any private individual—the police are quite independent of the magistracy, and are regulated by their own rules—I presume he acted upon his own impulse, and not from any order of mine, to the best of my knowledge—I did not ask you, when you said you had been assaulted, why you did not give Mr. Cohen into cus<lb/>tody; I never heard such words used—I cannot say whether you said that the whole affair was far too trivial and contemptible to be made the subject of a charge on either side; you may have said it; I do not know whether you did or not—I was at the Mansion-house next day—I knew you had been discharged on your own recognisance—I inquired; I cannot recollect of whom I did so; it was some of the Mansion-house people—I should say I did not know before that—I wished to do, and I believe I only did do, what any person would have done in the matter—I did not act as a magistrate; I gave the inspector no order—when at the Mansion-house next day I sat on the bench, not by Sir Robert Carden's side—perhaps we were as close together as my lords are now—when I gave my evidence I was not close to him; I was on the dais.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was I prevented from cross-examining you upon your depositions in chief, because you were a magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You did not cross-examine me;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030048"/>
               <p>but as to anything else, the magistrate before whom you were examined can answer the questions, not I—that was not the reason stated; the stated reason was this, that enough had been stated by me to enable you to go to the Sessions as you wished, and therefore no cross-examination was entered into—that was Sir Robert Carden's decision and statement—I think you requested that the case should be sent to the Sessions; I don't think it was on that account—I think it was in consequence of your wishing it sent to the Sessions that you did not cross-examine—you know best what your reason was for wishing it sent to the Sessions—I do not remember what you said—Sir Robert Garden then ordered you to enter into your own recognizance in 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to appear—I did not say anything upon that—upon my oath I did not propose that an additional bondsman of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be found; I am in<lb/>capable of doing such a thing—with the exception of my testimony not one word passed between me and Sir Robert Carden, either at that time or since—I did not state to my attorney, he being on the other side of Sir Robert Carden, that an additional bondsman should be found; I swear that—I cannot tell you how the additional bondsman affair came forward—I pre<lb/>sume Sir Robert Carden did not think of letting you go without taking some security for good behaviour—nothing was said by me about a bondsman in 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to keep the peace; I heard Sir Robert Carden say 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one surety of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I thought very low—I do not know that it was to keep the peace; I daresay it was; I did not observe—I swear that the additional 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not at my suggestion—it is usual to desire a man to enter into recognisance to keep the peace and then send him to be tried, or else it would not have been done—I never opened my lips to Sir Robert Carden on the subject either before, at the time, or since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was I at that time actively opposing your return for Greenwich, by giving lectures upon the laying down of the Atlantic Telegraph cable, and your conduct to me at Guildhall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You were making yourself excessively ridiculous; you had a meeting there, and they all thought you mad—you tried three meetings afterwards, and nobody came to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did not you or your partisans send three wagon-loads of people from Deptford for the purpose of opposing my lectures? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Upon my oath, to my knowledge, nothing of the kind was done; the universal opinion at Greenwich after two lectures was that you were a madman—I saw the lectures advertised, and felt quite sure that you would fail—I know the prison regulations for the treatment of prisoners in Newgate—I never Bent you to prison; I prevented your going there, or being locked up at all—if you went to prison, of course you were subject to prison regulations—I have not been to Woolwich since this assault; I have been unwell, and confined to my house for some little time—I know nothing about your son being refused admission to you in prison; I never heard of it till now—I heard you say you would not find bail, and you were consequently shut up, but I had nothing to do with that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath have you not been advised and instigated to push this matter to the utmost, with a view of getting a verdict and judgment that should shut me up, and prevent my appearing for a time in the Atlantic Telegraph Company, and in your electioneering proceedings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As God is my witness I did as little as I possibly could for my own protection, and for the purpose of doing my duty, for the gross outrage committed upon me—my answer to your question is, I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in any way afraid of me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not show much fear when you accosted me—I should be sorry to acknowledge myself afraid of you or</p>

               <p>any other man, I have done you no wrong—I never saw or heard of you until you came into my court—I do not know that you have received two medals from the Humane Society for saving lives at the expense of your own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you been cheated out of your invention, had your literary work been suppressed without compensation, had you been ordered to be assaulted in open court, refused all explanation, and your prospects ruined by a false imputation of madness; in short, had you been oppressed as you know me to have been oppressed, I ask you, on your oath as an honest man, could you have borne it so patiently as I have done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you apply that to me, I have done nothing of the kind—I have no doubt if I had suffered all you say I should have felt very irritated—I had not, previous to meeting you on the day in question, been told by Mr. Cohen that a gentleman wished to speak to me—I have, learnt since that you had asked one or two of my brother directors whether they were me—Mr. Cohen came back to the bank for me—he is a very late man, he does not come into the city till 4 o'clock—he very frequently goes with me to the rail—he had left the London and Westminster Bank—I am sure I cannot tell you what he came back for—he met me somewhere inside the Bank, I think in the passage—he did not say a word to me about you—I was in a great hurry, it had struck 4—he did not say that any person had spoken to him—he afterwards accompanied me to the police station, and he got a cab for me there—I think he volun<lb/>teered to do so—I was not influenced by any advice of Mr. Cohen's to give you in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner in his defence read a very long statement, in which he entered into a recital of his services in the navy, and the nature of several inventions he had perfected, as well as the alleged use of those inventions by the Atlantic Telegraph Company, from whom he asserted he had received great injustice; he then entered at great length into the circumstances contained in his cross-examination of the witnesses, commenting upon various portions, and contended that the first assault was committed by the Alderman, who pushed him when he accosted him.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a stonemason, and live in John-street, Mile-end-road On Tuesday evening, 21st December, I was in Mile-end-road, about 12 o'clock, and saw the prisoner and another person—they were in<lb/>toxicated—the prisoner's friend was very much intoxicated—when I came up first, he was standing, leaning against the fence—he had been on the ground—the prisoner asked me if I would assist him with his friend—I said "No," but I did do so—I walked on, holding the prisoners friend by the arm—the prisoner then, accused me of picking his friend's pocket, and made a blow at me—I jumped into the road to avoid it; the prisoner ran a little way after me, but turned back to his friend, who was lying on the ground—I followed him, and when I came back, I saw the deceased, Mr. Williams, standing near the prisoner's friend—the prisoner then asked Mr. Williams to assist him with his friend, and Mr. Williams would not—I don't know what he said—I believe there were two or three words passed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030050"/>
               <p>between them—when Mr. Williams refused to assist the prisoner with his friend, the prisoner challenged Mr. Williams to go out in the road and fight—I can't say exactly what he said, but he asked him if he would fight, and the prisoner went out in the road—the prisoner came back, finding Mr. Williams would not follow him—Mr. Williams said he had better sense than to fight—that was the time the first scuffle took place—the prisoner struck Mr. Williams with his fist—he struck him three or four times about the head and shoulders, and they fell down together—Mr. Williams was the undermost—the prisoner then got up, and Mr. Williams did the same, and walked towards the road—the prisoner then pulled off two coats, and struck Mr. Williams again, and they fell down from the kerb into the road—the prisoner then struck Mr. Williams three or four times about the head and shoulders, and they fell down—I believe they did not close, but Mr. Wil<lb/>liams fell on the stones, and the prisoner fell by the side of him—Mr. Williams did not get up—he was lifted up, and the men who lifted him up took him on the other side of the road—the prisoner pursued him, and was in the act of striking him again—Mr. Harris struck him with some stones in the road—the prisoner put his hands to the back of his head, and returned to his friend, who was drunk—assistance was procured; he was taken and set on the step of a door—from my observation of the deceased, he was perfectly sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Mr. Harris walking with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was the first who was asked to assist the prisoner's friend—there was not a crowd looking on at the time I came up—there was no one—they were not noticing that there was a drunken man falling on the ground—there was nobody there when I went up but me and Harris—I did endea<lb/>vour to assist the friend—I went about ten yards, more or less, before I was accused of attempting to pick his pocket—on the prisoner charging me with that, and making a blow at me, I ran into the road—I ran about twenty yards, or it might have been a little more, when I turned round, and saw that the prisoner had got back to his friend, and Harris was still standing by the friend—when I got close to them, I found several persons had then collected round them, and, amongst others, Mr. Williams—Harris stood nearer to them than I did, and he could see all that occurred—I did not hear the first words that occurred between Mr. Williams and the prisoner—the first words I heard were, the prisoner said, "Will you help me to take my friend"—Mr. Williams said he would not—it was after that that some words passed between them, which I did not hear—I am not aware that they were spoken in an angry tone—I cannot say that I heard Mr. Williams raising his voice, as if speaking angrily—after hearing a word or two, the next thing was a challenge from the prisoner to fight Mr. Williams—at that time Mr. Williams was on the pavement—the prisoner challenged Mr. Williams, and then he walked out in the road—before the challenge they were both on the pavement, and the friend was lying between the pavement and the chapel—I should say the friend was three or four feet from the prisoner when I heard those words pass—at that time there might have been as many as twenty people present—I cannot say that I heard the people who were there laughing and crying out—there were some laughing and some crying—they were not chaffing the drunken men—there was not so much of that as there might have been—some of them were chaffing and some hooting the prisoner—there were some persons sneering—there were some talking—some persons talk louder than others—when I heard the challenge to fight, the prisoner and Mr. Williams were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030051"/>
               <p>not far off from one another—the prisoner was on the pavement when he struck the first blow—I did not notice whether Mr. Williams had an umbrella with him—I did not notice whether Mr. Williams was upwards of six feet high—he was a powerful-built man—I do not know how high he was; he was a big man, that is all I know—when Mr. Williams was struck once, twice, or thrice, he did nothing to protect himself—if he had an umbrella, I did not see it—the prisoner struck him three or four blows, and then there was a fell—there was a scuffle immediately, and both fell on the pavement—I mean to say there was more than one fall—the leg was not broken by the fall on the pavement—I should think if the leg were broken by the fall on the pavement, Mr. Williams could not have got up and walked into the road—I did not know his leg was broken till he was over on the other side of the road, and I saw the blood—they fell once, and the prisoner proceeded to take off his coats, and struck again—he took off two coats after there had been one fall—the second striking was when they were between the pavement and the road—Harris was nearer than I was, and there were several persons between us, but I could see whether a man was on the ground or on the pavement—after the first fell Mr. Williams got up and was walking towards the kerb—he had not got off the kerb, and the prisoner struck him again—it was when Mr. Williams was being taken across the road that Harris took up stones and struck the prisoner at the back of the head—at that time Mr. Williams was not lying down; he was being taken across the road—he was not actually lying down—that I am certain of—I don't know whether Harris striking the prisoner with stones appeared to hurt him—he put both his hands to the back of his head and came back—they were not large stones, not granite: they were gravel—the prisoner, in consequence of that, returned to his friend.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Regent-street, Mile-end—I was on that night with my friend Mr. Carter, going along the Mile-end-road—I observed the prisoner and some person with him—the prisoner was slightly intoxicated, and the other person very much so, and lying on the ground—the prisoner requested Mr. Carter to assist him with his friend a little way down the Mile-end-road, and Mr. Carter did so; and while he did so the prisoner accused Mr. Carter of picking his friend's pocket—with that Mr. Carter refused to have anything more to do with him—just about that time I saw Mr. Williams, the deceased; he was on the pavement, and when he came up close to them, the prisoner asked Mr. Williams if ho would assist him—Mr. Williams refused to do so, and they had a few words together which I can't recollect—I have been trying to recollect them since the last examination, but I cannot—the prisoner spoke and Mr. Williams—finding that Mr. Williams would not assist him with his friend, the prisoner challenged Mr. Williams to fight—he refused, and told him he had got too much good sense to fight—on that they had a few words, which I can't recollect, and the prisoner struck Mr. Williams with his clenched fist about the head and body—they had a scuffle together, and both fell—I did not see Mr. Williams strike, or attempt to strike any blow at the prisoner—he did not make use of any offensive language</p>

               <p>or behave in any offensive way towards the prisoner: quite the reverse—when they fell, Mr. Williams was undermost—they fell down off the kerb to the road—I believe Mr. Williams was assisted across the road—I cannot call it two scuffles—the policeman was called, and the prisoner was given into custody—after the time when Mr. Williams and the prisoner fell together, the prisoner went back a yard or two, and while the prisoner was going to make another attack, I took up a few stones and struck him on the back of the head, which I believe prevented his doing so—assistance was procured, and Mr. Williams was conveyed across.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. My father carries on the business of an engraver at 17, Sun-street, Bishopsgate, and I assist him. On 19th October, between 5 and 6 in the evening, one of my men fetched me to see some one, and I found Goldwater in the shop—I had never seen him before—he said that he had got a gold plate which he wanted engraved with the Russian eagle and the Russian capitals, and wanted to know what I would do it for—I had some conversation with him, and he promised to call again—he called the next day, and asked for me—I was behind the shop, and did not see him come in—when I saw him, he said he called about the matter on which he called last night, and had brought the gentleman with him, who was outside—on that he left the shop, and brought in Kochanowsky, the person who was called the Baron—Goldwater said that they had come about the things about which he came last night, and Kochanowsky asked if we could show him some very small letters in type—I showed him some, but they did not suit him; they were not small enough—I was about twenty minutes showing him specimens, and a few speci<lb/>mens of plates and dies were shown to him, but nothing was settled—the same evening, between 8 and 9 o'clock, Goldwater called again with Goldberg, who he introduced as a Prussian—Goldberg asked me if I could keep a secret—I said, "Yes"—he said that he thought it was some bank-notes, but he did not know—after some little conversation, he said he would call next day, between 1 and 2, or when I was alone; when all the men had gone to dinner, and I could be seen by myself, and bring some person else with him, a Baron—the next morning, before they came, my lather and I made a communication to Superintendent Hamilton, and between 1 and 2 o'clock, when I was alone in the shop, Goldwater came—it was on 21st (<hi rend="italic">Looking at a memorandum</hi>)—he asked me if I was alone—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030055"/>
               <p>said "Yes," and he went out, and brought in the Baron and Goldberg—the Baron asked me, in the hearing of the other two, if I could keep a secret—he then took a pocket-book out of his pocket, and handed me this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said that he wanted two steel plates, one for the back, and the other for the front—they were to be done like the note—I told him I could do them—(I acted under the directions of the officer during the whole of the matter)—the Baron said that he did not mind how much money he paid, if it was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he offered to make me a present of a hand-some gold watch, which he took out of his pocket—I told him that I must have a deposit, but he said that the note would do, and left it with me—nothing further of any importance passed—the same evening, between 8 and 9 o'clock, Gold water and the Baron came—the Baron wanted to know if I could get paper like the five-rouble note—they were both together, but the Baron was the spokesman—he said that about five or six hundred would be required to be printed off—after we gave information, the workmen under mine and my father's superintendence, acted according to the direc<lb/>tions we received from the prisoners, and the work of engraving the plates was progressing from that time to 20th November—on 26th October, about 9 o'clock in the evening, the three prisoners came and wanted to see the plates; I showed them one of these plates, No. 2, which was partially engraved at the time, and No. 1 was in course of workmanship—they examined the plate, and the Baron said he was very glad to see that it was going on, and that he wanted another plate for the water-mark, producing another Russian note to show me—they said that they wanted to see the plates finished on let November; Gold water said that he hoped, next time they came, that I should have all the gas out, except a little jet at the back—on 1st Novem<lb/>ber, at 2 o'clock, Goldwater came to say that they were coming in the evening, about 9 o'clock—they all came together at 9 o'clock, and I showed them the same plates—they examined them, but they were not quite finished—the Baron inquired when they would be finished, and I told him on Monday week, 15th November—next day, November 2d, the Baron came between 1 and 2 o'clock, and before he left Goldberg came, and there was some more conversation about the plates—that same evening, Gold-water came and asked me for some money—on 5th November, about a quarter to 9 in the evening, Goldwater came and told me that the others were outside—I went out with him, and found the others outside—they took me to the King's Head public-house in the neighbourhood, and Goldberg asked me, going along, if I had decided about the money, the commission—when we got to the King's Head, I asked the Baron for another note, as the first one was rubbed out—he said that he had not got one then, but he would send me one, and that he wanted to see a specimen of the paper—somewhere about that time, the Baron showed me some other notes of different denominations; one for fifty roubles, and one for twenty-five roubles—on 6th November, Goldwater came to the shop, and gave me this, other five-rouble note (marked H)—on 10th November, I met Goldwater in Bishopsgate-street, and he asked me how the plates were getting on—on the 12th Goldwater came to my shop, and inquired how the plates and proofs were getting on—I had been asking them for some more money, and Goldwater said that, if I took an impression of the two plates, as the Baron could not read them, the Baron would give me some more money—on 15th November Goldwater came with Goldberg, but I did not see them—on Thursday, the 18th, Goldwater came to the shop, and asked me to go outside with him—I found the Baron outside, and there was a conversation between him and Goldwater and me in reference to the proof—I showed</p>

               <p>them a plate, and they examined it—on the next day, Friday, I saw all three of them in my father's shop, and showed them the three plates, and a proof of them—the prisoners examined the plates, the proof, and the paper—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the proof; it was done from my plates—the prisoners spoke together in their own language, and having made an appointment to meet me next day, with the plates to be delivered, they left me—on the following morning, according to the appointment, I went to the King's Head, Threadneedle-street, taking with me the plates and proofs, which the prisoners had been, from time to time, examining—I went into a room at the King's Head, and the three prisoners being there, I took the plates out of my pocket, wrapped in paper, and placed them on the table—the prisoners examined them, and I left them with them, making some excuse, and left the room, and communicated with the officers, who were outside.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not I refuse to take the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you offered me, and say that I should have nothing to do with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You said that you would have nothing more to do with it, and would take it out of my hands and give it to another engraver in Shoreditch—I do not recollect saying, "Let it stand over till Friday, and I will settle with you, I must consider about it"—I said that I would give you no more than 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as commission—after you said "I will come no more to your place, "I did not say," Come on Friday evening," I swear that—I believe there is a Saviour—I made the appoint<lb/>ment with you all, to meet at the King's Head, on November 20th—I never heard the Flower Pot public-house named that I know of—I opened the parcel containing the plates and notes—you did not tell me that you wanted any notes or plates of me that I know of—you did not say that you were a party to the order which was given me, but you came always with them, and I thought you were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Goldwater, (Through the Interpreter). Q.</hi> Did not you leave the plates behind in the public-house without paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left them all open on the table, and if you did not see them, you were in the room—it was a moderate sized back room, and the three of you were in the room when I laid the plates on the table—I spoke to you all and told you that I had come about the plates before opening the plates, and about what you spoke of last night—I went to the public-house by myself—I was there first—I came up at five minutes to 10, saw the Baron go in, and went in directly afterwards, and there was only the Baron in the room—the other two came twenty minutes or half an hour afterwards—I had not opened the plates before they came in, but directly they came into the room the Baron said, "Now to business,"—I then took the notes out of my pocket and opened them—they were all there, the notes and all.</p>

               <p>as soon as I came in in the course of five minutes, ran to the back part of the house, fetched an officer, pulled me down the stairs and gave me in charge. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I was with the three prisoners half an hour or nearly three-quarters—they were up there talking, and there was bread and cheese and brandy and water, and that took more than five minutes—Goldwater did not leave the gold plate-with me to engrave—I never saw it—he said that he had got a gold plate and wanted it engraved with a Russian Eagle or Russian capitals—Goldwater did not say anything about bank-notes, it was Goldberg—my father said that if they paid-the price he would make one—it is within our line of business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Goldwater.</hi> I never saw the plates on the evening I was taken till they were shown me at the station-house: as I am unable to read or write, how is it likely I could inspect the plates to know whether they were correct or not. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You looked at the plate, but did not say whether it was right or wrong, it was the Baron said that; he was the spokesman after the first mention of the bank-notes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Goldberg. Q.</hi> Did the Baron offer to break the plates in pieces, saying that he would not make use of them, and offer you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for your trouble? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not heard of it before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Consul-general for the Russian Govern<lb/>ment in Great Britain—during the autumn I believe two of the prisoners came to me, but I only saw them once or twice—I could not speak to their faces, but I know Goldberg the best—I have no belief as to Goldwater—he may have been to me—it is very probable he did—I can recognise Gold<lb/>berg's face—it was he who spoke most—I cannot exactly tell you the date—I did not take a note of it, because I had been a few weeks before deceived by a man who came to denounce pretended forgeries—I should be sorry to say the date to a month, and make a mistake—the two men said that they had found out that there was an intention on the part of some person who was expected to arrive, or who had arrived, to cause Russian paper-money to be circulated—that the person expected was a rich man, with a great deal of money at his command—that he was expected, or had arrived in London, to cause these Russian bank-notes to be forged—that he belonged to a good family, and there is some recollection in my mind, that he made use of the word Baron—I told them, as I always do to these people, that they must address themselves to the police and the Consul-general—I do not know whether I gave them the address of Mr. Mackenzie or Mr. Durham; but I said that at my private lodgings I would take no representation of that sort, and that no denunciation could be expected, unless they could give some sort of proof—I do not know that they did not say that they wanted a little money; but if I did give them any, it was but eight or nine shillings—certainly not ten shillings altogether, and from that time, I have heard nothing of them—I am told that they have called at the office, but I have not been them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Goldwater.</hi> We called on the Consul to inform him that such a thing was going to be done, expecting of course that we should be rewarded for our trouble; but the Consul would not believe me, though he said that if we brought proofs he would speak afterwards with us, and I was trying to get proof of the forgery that was to be carried on. I have not been able to pro<lb/>duce any proof to the Consul, because while I was trying to do so I was taken into custody; he sent me to bring the proofs, and said that I should be rewarded for it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I refused to have anything to do with them, and gave them the address of the police and of my solicitors, and said that they must go to them—I always do so—I certainly did not do anything which he might construe into an authority to co-operate with the guilty party in having the plate engraved—I sent them to the police, in order that the police or my solicitors might judge whether there was any case or not, and left them to say whether the information was sufficient to act upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Goldberg's Defence.</hi> The engraver's evidence does not show that I had the notes or gave the order. The only reason that I went there the first time was because this man said, "Here is a Russian gentlemen who wants a gold plate engraved, and he has already communicated with the engraver, but he wants to know if he can keep a secret; he did not know much En<lb/>glish, and asked me in German the translation of "secret." He asked me if he wanted to have a plate for bank-notes—I said, in the presence of all his people, "No, I do not think that," because you cannot go and give an order for bank-notes without 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., deposit at least. I went to the engraver</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030060"/>
               <p>and said, "The gentleman who was here wants to know if you can keep a secret;" he said, "Yes." I said, "I do not think it will be a gold plate; I think it must be plate to get gold." I could not understand him exactly; he said before that the Russian gentleman was only a fortnight or three weeks in England, and I said to the engraver, "If you cannot understand this man I am at your service, but you must pay me a commission." I tried to see the gentleman, but did not know where he lived, so I went and met him there, and we all went to the engraver. I can understand German, but they spoke Russian together; afterwards he told me that he wanted some money. I said, "If you pay me, I will ask him for it." I told him, and he asked 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the first time; the gentleman prepared himself with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he then only asked for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he gave him: next time he asked 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and agreed to take 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I asked for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he offered me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I said, "No, I will not have anything at all; I am going, and will have nothing to do with the business" He said, "Well, alter your mind, come on Friday evening." I was going by myself, and he asked me if the others were coming. I said, "If they have got an appointment with you, they will come." I never examined the things. I do not understand Russian, and could not make any use of Russian bank-notes. I am not going to take an interpreter to Russia, and get them changed there; if I wanted such notes I had no occasion to put myself in a dangerous position, because my brother-in-law could have done it for me; I could have recommended them to him, and they would have been quite safe in his hands. I said the evening before, "This is a very dangerous business, tell your governor he had better drop the matter;" he said, "Mr. Roll, I cannot make use of the notes; I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for your trouble, and I shall then have a few pounds left to go home to my country." I hope you will not come to the conclusion that I was in possession of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Goldwaters Defence (through the interpreter</hi>). Gentlemen of the Jury, I have not gained anything by this; I have had no profit by it, and I do not see how I can be guilty. I am a poor man, and have a wife and family at home. I, knowing of this business going to be done, gave the necessary in<lb/>formation to the Consul, that I might get a little reward for my information. I therefore went very often to the man who was manufacturing it to see when it would be ready, in order to get the proofs, and take them to the Consul as he described. I am not guilty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—we have been married three years and a half—on 13th September, I was living at 4, Oak-place, Stepney, not with my husband, but he came there, and stayed a night and a day—we had parted on 12th September, the day after he came—he found me out at 4, Oak-place, I do not know how, and came there drank with his shirt all bloody, and said that he had been fighting in Baker-street—nearly a month afterwards, in case he should come again to me, I removed to Wellington-street, Stepney, and occupied a room on the ground-floor—I have one child by the prisoner, a little boy, who was living with me—on the morning of 14th December, I was in bed with my little boy, when the prisoner came into my room—I said "Well, Fred, what do you want here "—he said "I have come to see you, but I shall not stay long"—he came to my bedside, and I said "Move away, I want to get up and get some tea"—this was about 10 o'clock in the morning—he said "You lie there, there is plenty of time for that, and forced me down on the bed with his left arm—I said, "Come, none of your nonsense, or I shall call murder"—he said "Where is the baby?"—I said "Here he is" and pulled the bedclothes down to show him—he went to lock the door, and then went towards the window, and I got out of bed—he was pulling something out of his left hand pocket, and I said "What a fine cigar-case you have got"—he said "Yes it is"—he replaced the case in his pocket, but what he bad in his hands I could not tell—there was nothing more till I felt a razor across my throat, as I was putting on some of my clothes, and he was standing by the wall at the back of me—it is a small room—I felt myself down on the floor, with my head on the fender, fighting to get possession of the razor—he kept trying to cut my throat while I was on the floor, and cut it in three places—he had his left hand on my chest, and one knee on me, and with his other hand he was wounding me—I laid hold of the razor, and my hands were cut in eight places—I caught hold of it two or three times, but could not succeed in getting it from his hands till the last, and then I did; and in the struggle, it broke, and I had possession of the blade in three wounds in my hand—the handle came off, and I kept the blade—I kept crying "Murder," and begging him to desist, but he never answered—when I got the blade from him, he screamed out "Oh!" and went to reach a white-handled dinner knife off the table, but he overbalanced himself and fell, and that is how I got up, I unlocked the door, and found myself in the other room on the same floor—I took the razor from the wounds and flung it away in the fender, as I could not remove from where I stood—I had the presence of mind to think that if he followed me, he would get possession of it—a surgeon was sent for—I was afterwards taken to the hospital—there was no razor in the room when ray husband came in the morning—I saw a razor-case produced at the police-court—that is what I took to be a cigar-case.</p>

I live at 9, Wellington-street, and let rooms—Mrs. Goodey came to live with me about two months prior to 14th December—on that morning about 10 o'clock there was a knock at the front door—I opened it, and the prisoner came up and asked me for a name which I did not know—he then said, 'Goodey,"—I said, "Yes,"—and he walked in and opened her room door, I did not show him her room—he went in, and not more than five minutes afterwards, I heard Mrs. Goodey say, "If you do I will shout murder"—the door was shut and lacked, and my daughter knocked at the door—I heard a confusion, and my daughter ran to the police-station—I heard a very great scuffle, and she screamed "Murder" over and over again—I tried to force the door open, but could not; I begged of her to unlock the door, and called out loudly to her—some one unlocked the door, and Mrs. Goodey came out, and into my back-room,</p>

               <p>covered with blood—she had a petticoat on over her night gown, and that was all—the prisoner came out to me—I was very much frightened, he lifted up his arm to me, and said that he was mad—I said, "For God's sake have mercy on a poor old widow, do if you please go into that room and sit down"—that was the prosecutrix's room—he went in, and I took the key from the inside of the door, and locked him in, and while I was in the back room he got out at the window into the street—the police came and took Mrs. Goodey to the hospital in a cab.</p>

I found, marks of blood in the front room—on my way to the house I saw the prisoner about a quarter of a mile from it—he was drunk, and I did not speak to him—he was confined at the station, and about four o'clock in the afternoon he was sober—I read the charge over to him, and cautioned him that he was going to be taken before a Magistrate, and whatever he said to me it would be my duty to relate to the Magistrate in court—he said "I know nothing of it, I have no recollec<lb/>tion of it."</p>

About 2 o'clock on the morning of 14th December he was very drunk, and asked me to take him home as he was incapable of taking himself home—he was in a state of great excitement, throwing himself about in the way he generally acts when he is drunk.</p>

The prisoner lodged in the house where I was acting as nurse, prior to 14th December—on that morning he was brought home intoxicated at 2 o'clock and was in a state of great excitement—about half-past 8 o'clock I made him a cup of tea—he was then in a state of great excitement and still apparently drunk—he had taken his clothes off excepting his trousers—excepting when he got in that state he was a quiet inoffensive man—I have seen him drunk three times during the time I have known him, and on those three occasions he was always in that violent excited way; but he was a quiet, harmless, inoffensive man—he appeared like a man with something on his mind when drunk, but when sober he acted like a gentleman—I did not know his wife.</p>

I went on to Whitechapel, and saw Mr. Marks—I said I thought I had something that would suit him in the shape of a bell—I asked it he would look at it—he said "Yes," and I drove it to his place—Mr. Marks said, "This is a foreigner"—I said to Tuttlebee, "You know the person you got this bell from"—he said "Yes, it is all right"—it could not be weighed whole; it was to be broken up, but we found it could not be broken—I went out and came back about 4 o'clock—I saw the bell sold to Mr. West in the evening for 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I sold it to him—it was appointed for Mr. West to go to Mr. Marks at 9 o'clock the next morning to get the bell away—my van went with two ropes to get it away.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He told you, did he not, that his stock varied very much? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot call to mind any particular conversation upon that point—I cannot say he did not say so—it was a special risk, that means more; on account of the nature of the stock and the premises—it is my business, as agent for the Company, to go over the premises and look at the nature of the risk—I passed through the shop with Mr. Roper to look at the back premises—it is my duty, as far as possible, to protect the interests of the parties to whom I act as agent—as part of that duty I ought to look at the premises before I recommend an insurance—I did so—the premises consisted of a cellar (the basement), the shop, then the bedroom, and then the attic over—as far as my recollec<lb/>tion serves me, there was a gas-light at the end of the counter—I do not recollect whether there was a gas-light suspended from the ceiling of the shop—my attention was not called to that at the time—I was there to look, but my attention was not directed—I did not notice what the material of the ceiling of the shop was—I could not have told if I had looked—to my recollec<lb/>tion no intimation was given that a surveyor might examine the premises—I made a memorandum—the result of such a memorandum sometimes is that the Company sends a surveyor, if their attention is particularly called to it—I cannot say whether the prisoner knew that I had made a special memoran<lb/>dum of that kind—this is the memorandum that I made, "The stock of Richard Roper, corn dealer, of Royal-hill, Greenwich, consists of flour, seeds, &amp;c., the stock of hay, straw, and clover is kept in a timber-built shed in rear, but almost adjoining the back premises. "That was with a view to inform the Company that there was something more than usually dangerous—when a representation of that kind is made to a Company they do not generally send their own surveyor to go over the premises, unless they are specialty requested to do so—I cannot say whether or not I said anything to the prisoner about a surveyor.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Wheeler, and live in Addy-street, Deptford—I am a distant relation of the prisoner's wife—I went to the prisoner's house in September to nurse Mrs. Roper during her confinement, which was on Thursday the 9th September—she occupied a bed-room on the first floor—I remember the fire taking place on Sunday, 12th September, about 4 o'clock—on the Saturday night before retiring to bed, I had been down stairs into the kitchen—that was about half-past 11—I went down to make some gruel—I then went up stairs, and I did not leave the room any more that night—the gas-lights were burning when I left to go up stairs—there is a gas-light in the shop, and in the back parlour, which leads out of the shop—the gas had not been turned off at all then—Mr. Roper had not come up stairs to bed himself—I left Mr. Roper and the girl down stairs—I think the gas was full on at the burners—during Mrs. Roper's con<lb/>finement the gas had been led on, in case she wanted anything during the night—when I went up stairs at half-past 11, I left Mr. Roper and the servant down stairs—the servant's name is Waterfall—Mr. Roper came up stairs about a quarter of an hour after—he came into the bedroom and said "good night" to me and his wife, and then went to his room—since Mrs. Roper's confinement he has slept in a front room on the same floor, and the servant and the children slept in the attic—the steps of the staircase leading to the attic are just outside the bed-room door—I can't say how many stairs there are—there are two flights of stairs; I can't say how many there are in each flight—after the prisoner had said good night, I went to bed and went to sleep—after I had been asleep I was disturbed by Mrs. Roper speaking to me—she said there was a nasty smell in the room—I did not smell anything—I can't say what time it was that she spoke; it was some time in the night—I did not leave the room; I went to sleep again—Mrs. Roper awoke me to attend to her; I attended to her and then got into bed and went to sleep again—I was disturbed again by Mrs. Roper saying she smelt fire; I did not smell the fire—Mrs. Roper told me to call Mr. Roper; but before I could do so, he burst the room door open and rushed into the room—he was in his drawers and night-shirt—he said, "There is fire, for God's sake open the window, and get out as fast as you can!"—Mrs. Roper's bed was near the window; close to the window—the window on that model (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) represents the window of the bed-room from which we got on to the roof of the adjoining house—when Mr. Roper rushed into the room, the flames followed him—he assisted Mrs. Roper out of the window, on to the out-building; he then assisted me out, and gave me the baby—he left us there, and jumped off the wash-house place and went to make an alarm—before he burst the door open he knocked at the door, and called up stairs to the girl, "Lizzy, Lizzy!"—after he had got us out, he got us out himself—at that time the curtains of the bed were on fire—when he assisted us on to the out-building, we stayed there till he came back; he was away about twenty minutes—when he returned he got us off the out-building into a person's house—the position of the bed had not been moved since Mrs. Roper's confinement—it was moved about a month before, from behind the door—I mentioned about the bed being removed myself for convenience.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> To get more room for you when your mistress was confined, I suppose. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had attended her in two former confine<lb/>ments, and have known her all her life—I had an opportunity of seeing the prisoner on the former occasions, as well as at the time of the last confine<lb/>ment—he was very affectionate to his wife, and very fond of his children; as far as I saw he was a good husband and father. The first time Mrs. Roper said she smelt something she was not out of bed—she was not in a fit state to get out of bed—I attended to her, and then she laid back again and went to sleep; when she said she smelt fire on the second occasion, I did not notice it—I was very sleepy—when Mr. Roper came into the room, I was undressed, in bed—he was in his night-shirt and drawers; nothing else. The eldest of the little girls who was burnt was about five and a half years old, I think, and the other a year and seven months—it was not my wish that the gas should be left burning in the shop; Mr. Roper did it for my convenience, in case I might want a light in the night—the lamp was suspended from the ceiling with a globe over it—I cannot say whether the globe or bell was broken; I never noticed it—I was not in the shop very often—the room in which Mrs. Roper was confined was furnished—as far as I know, there was no alteration in the furniture from what there had been a month before; I did not see any—the remainder of the house was very decency furnished—there was a double chest of mahogany drawers in the room, with mahogany knobs—I have not seen the cellar where it is sug<lb/>gested the fire began—Mrs. Roper was confined about the time I expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember Mr. Roper's saying anything about its being unlucky that she should have been confined at that moment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said it was rather unfortunate, that he had let his shop—he asked me how soon she would be able to be removed—I told him I could not tell exactly, it was according how she was in her health; I said I thought in about ten or fourteen days—she certainly could not have been moved before without very imminent peril—she was helped out of the window—there is a cistern over the water-closet—I asked her to step on that, thinking it was wood—I was not aware there was water there—she put her foot on it and it gave way—she did not go into the cistern, only a little way; I pulled her back from it when I found what it was—she had spoken to me on the subject of leaving the shop—I had pinned the window-curtains together to keep the draught out—when the prisoner came to wish her good night they were pinned in that way—he took leave of her very affectionately, the same as usual, with affection, but nothing more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and valuer, residing in Lewis<lb/>ham-road, Greenwich—I knew the prisoner before this fire took place—I heard of the fire on the Sunday morning, and on that day I offered my services to him—I have had experience in making valuations—I saw Mr. Roper on the Monday morning between 10 and 11 o'clock, at Mr. Cowell's, his father-in-law's, in Church-street, Deptford—after some conversation relative to the loss of his children, which he was deploring in a very dread<lb/>ful way, I said that he had better try and not think anything more about that at present, but give me some account of his loss—he said he did not want to claim anything, although he should be a great loser; nothing could compensate him for the loss of his poor children—he appeared very much distressed indeed in his mind, and it was with that intention almost, that I thought it would be doing the man a charity to call his mind away from it. He asked me what was requisite to be done—I said I should require an inventory of the whole of his goods—he said that he had prepared an inventory when he sent for the agent to insure, and he asked me whether it was not usual for an insurance office to send a surveyor to see whether or not the proposed insurer had got value to the amount which he proposed to insure for—I said it was not usual, for they generally trusted to the agents to fulfil that part of the duty; but I said, as he had so recently made an inventory of his goods, it would serve to refresh his mind—he did not produce the inventory—he has not done so at any time. I asked him how he was insured, whether he was insured properly—he said he could not tell—I then asked him if he could tell the amount of premium he had paid—he said he could not recollect exactly, but he gave me an amount something near it, and I knew, from that he was insured properly—it was doubly hazardous, because it is a very hazardous business, three risks—the premium was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that would be three risks—I was satisfied from that that he was insured properly—he told me he was insured for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, as he had so recently made out an inventory, it would serve to refresh his memory; and if he would proceed at once to give me the items, I would go on with it—he did so, or rather, I may say, I did it—a claim was afterwards sent in to the insurance office—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not the paper upon which I took down the items from him—I took it down in my book—this is it (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>). It was done in this way—of course, being a valuer, and being used to houses of almost every description, I have a pretty good knowledge of what furniture there may be in any house; and as such, I dictated to him, and said, "Was there so and so?—"Did you have so and so?"—and that was the way in which we got at the items—for instance, I said, "We will begin at the top of the house—to take the first thing, there is a bedstead: what sort of bedstead was it?"—he said, "An Arabian bedstead"—what I took down from him in my memorandum was, "An Arabian bedstead, with white dimity furniture"—then I went on again, "What mattress was there to it?"—just in that way—and he said, "There were two mattresses, and a palliasse;" I have got that—I said, "Was there a mattress?"—"Yes"—"Was there a feather-bed?"—he said, "Two beds; one was a cotton-bed, and one was a feather-bed"—he told me of the palliasse—he also told me there were two pairs of sheets, four blankets, and two counterpanes. I sent this claim in to the insurance company, with this letter annexed—there is also attached to it an acceptance of the company's offer by Mr. Roper—it was written by me, and signed by him—he told me there were six cane-seated chairs, mahogany-tray, dressing-glass, and deal dressing-table.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask him whether there was this, or did he tell you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked him—he scarcely told me anything himself, but I knew—there is "a fender and set of fire-irons"—I have not counted the number of items altogether—I dare say there are 209 items altogether, in the different rooms of the house—this is an exact copy of my book—there is a japanned wash-stand and fittings, and Brussels carpet to cover floor, formerly laid down in a much larger room—he told me that—I asked him what carpet it was, and he said a Brussels carpet; and it excited my surprise, a Brussels carpet being in an attic; and I received that explanation, that it was down in a much larger room in a better house; and when he came there he had no other place for it, and put it in the attic—the floor-cloth he also said was in the other house—there are prices put to all these articles; I put them—not all of them without assistance; but the majority of them I did; for instance I did not know the size of the Brussels carpet until I asked him about the probable size of the room; and as he gave me that, I put down the price—I valued the yards, so many yards at so much a yard—he did not tell me the number of yards; he told me the size of the room, as far as he could recollect, which the carpet came from—I said to him, "Was the parlour the carpet came from as large as the room we are in now?" and he said, "Yes, rather larger;" and I then knew it would take more than twenty yards, perhaps twenty-five. I took him through all the rooms in the house—I was with him about two hours and a half—altogether I was with him four hours; but I was about two hours and a half or three hours making this out—this was on the Monday—I was with him from 10 in the morning until he went over to the inquest at 3 in the afternoon—the questions were asked by me, and answers were given by him to all my questions relating to the furniture, as described here—I remember a set of <hi rend="italic">papier mache</hi> tea-trays in the parlour, the front room first floor—I asked him about them—I said, "Were there any tea-trays?"—he said, "Yes;" they are charged at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there is au item, "A large bouquet of wax flowers, under a glass shade, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I asked if he had got any ornaments of any description, and that was given me under that head—there is also an item, "Books, various, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I asked him about books, and I put the value to them—I said, "Were they worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?" and he said, "Yes"—there is "a long dinner service complete, of 150 pieces, cost 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I did not put that down—I must give a little explanation with reference to that dinner service, if you will allow me; when he spoke about the dinner service, I asked what sort of dinner service it was; whether it was a long dinner service—he said, yes, he thought it was—I said, "How many pieces were there?"—he said he could not tell; he said there was a quantity of other things which he bought at the same time; and subsequently he said, "Altogether I dare say 150 pieces:" and, consequently, I entered it in my book as "A dinner service complete, etc. etc., 150 pieces"—and he said, "I should think it amounted to from 8 to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said altogether the 150 pieces cost him from 8 to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I put down 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—here is my book with the item entered; "Dinner service complete, etc. etc., 150 pieces"—there are two etceteras—there is a statement in my book of the cost; it is in private marks—they are all private marks—the word "cost" is not there—I have no recollection of how I came to insert the word "cost" in the claim—I had no further conversation with the prisoner about it; I never saw him afterwards—I do not recollect particularly how I came to insert "cost" here—the item, "China tea and coffee service, 7 guineas, bought at Masters's, Deptford-broadway," I inserted from him—I heard from him where it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030075"/>
               <p>bought—I asked him about the items following: the cut-glass celery-stand, water-ewer, two goblets, twelve cut champagne-glasses, twelve wine-glasses, twelve liqueur-glasses, twenty-four tumblers, four cut decanters, and dessert service, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him about all those in the same way, and he told me of them—I recollect the "Two glass candlesticks, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" also the "Suit of fine black, with embroidered trousers and waistcoat, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" "An Alma coat, lined with silk, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" "Dress coat, lined with satin and quilted, and silk sleeves, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" "One velvet waistcoat, and one silk ditto"—I took that down from him—the "Coburg black dress, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." is a woman's dress—I had none of the female's dress from Mr. Roper—they were supplied by his wife's sister—most of his own clothes were stated by himself, of course I could not tell what clothes he had—he gave me those I have described—the stock I took from him—he said he thought there might be near upon four<lb/>teen sacks of flour—in the exercise of my duty, I of course endeavour to ascertain the exact amount, so as to be fair between both parties—I made out this inventory on the Monday night—this is an exact copy of my book, as near as possible—all the items he gave me are contained here—he had nothing to do with the letter I sent in; he never saw it—when. I had finished the inventory, I went over to the inquest with him; and the last I saw of him was after the inquest was over; he went into Mr. Waldy's on Royal-hill, where his wife was.</p>

I said, "Turn over, and you will find it on the last page, or the last but one," and as he turned it over in his hand his eye caught a double chest of drawers, and he said, "You have only put down 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that, it cost me more"—I said, "Never mind, here is more claimed, for than you insured for; it is not worth while putting down more money"—the claim is 290<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is what I call the full claim—I did not claim for the shed—the shed was insured separately I found, and I did not claim for that—this is the letter in which I made the original claim—I was then acting as the agent for Roper in making the claim.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>different things there that I had not got any account of whatever—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the dinner-service included other items; he mentioned sets of jugs—they are not down in my inventory in any other form—I have no account of any sort of dinner-service except that, nor any other glass of any description, nor is there any cutlery in the inventory—I have never counted the number of items; I daresay there are 209 entries—I can tell you out of those how many I found traces of—out of 11 in the attic I found traces of 9; in the bedroom out of 26 I found 21; in the front parlour, which was of course destroyed, where the seat of the fire watt, I could trace 11 different things—I have not got the number of things that were there—the attic had fallen through and showed itself on the top; the middle floor was entirely burnt; but the heavy goods, the expanding dining table, the loo table, and those sort of things had been left at the top, and I could see them—on the ground floor I found everything as specified—I did not know anything of the prisoner's character or reputation at Greenwich before this, not personally—I have only been to his shop, and had conversation with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and appraiser.

               <p>burn, you may read the title—I saw traces of about half a sack of flour,—if there had been fourteen sacks of flour on the premises when the fire took place, I think I must have found traces of pretty well all—the action of the water and the fire will calcine the floor so that you cannot destroy the whole of it—I found traces of a very small portion of the wearing apparel at my first view—I found a small portion of it in the wardrobe—I should have expected to find traces of the greater portion, especially of the man's wearing apparel; the waistbands of the trousers, and the backs and collars of the coats; it is a very hard matter to burn such things as those—there was no fire-place in the attic—I think the model will show that.</p>

I remember the fire—some short time before that, the girl Waterfall had been in the habit of bringing things to our house—the day Mr. Roper let his shop, in the evening she brought about a dozen plates in the perambulator—that was the first time she brought anything—it was on the Tuesday evening, she came with the perambulator and the two children—the next day, Wednesday, she came four times—she brought things each time—she brought a dinner service, she brought part of it each time—I do not know whether she brought the large dishes that day—between that time and the fire, she brought it all as far as I recollect—I took some of them in myself—I put them in the back parlour on the sofa as she brought them in, until I had convenient time, and then I placed them in a box in the back parlour—I did not receive the dessert service; I know it was there, I saw it, and a case of wax flowers was there—I saw one sack containing books, two parlour lamps, and three paper tea-trays—there were some earthenware jugs, they were not real china, only mock, three were brought to my house—I saw a scent bottle, and a tea pot—I know that all those things belonged to my son-in-law—they were all afterwards given up to the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long has Mr. Roper been married to your daughter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say correctly, I think about seven years—he has been a kind and affectionate husband to her, and an excellent father to his children—he has always been a respectable man, I believe, and highly esteemed by everybody until this affair happened—I learnt from Mr. Roper him self the reason why the things were sent to my premises—that was before they were removed; he gave me this reason, he came to my house</p>

               <p>and said, "Mother, I have let the shop"—I said, "You have? I am glad of that; what have you let it for?"—he said, "130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and take the stock—my wife wished me to ask you if you would take in the crockery, because we had so many things broken coming from Plaistow here, and she wishes to pack them herself, because she <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> every hour, and she wants to pack them to send them away"—I never saw my daughter but once while the things were being sent to my premises; she knew of their coming—it was her wish for her husband to ask me to take them in, to take charge of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness, and live with her at 7, James-place, Deptford—I remember, on the Wednesday or Thursday before the fire took place, Mr. Roper's boy bringing two boxes on a truck—I asked him to bring them into the house—I believe they contained china, as I heard them rattle in bringing them in—I also saw some wax flowers in our house, and one sack of books—on the Saturday before the fire, the servant Waterfall came—I met her in the passage—she had her master's writing-desk—she told me so—I think it was between 6 and 7 in the evening—it was not quite dark—the desk was left there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are the sister of Mrs. Roper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I learnt from Mr. Roper why these things were sent to our house; he told us that he had let his business—he did not say that in the presence of his wife—he came to our house, and my mother and myself were at home—my sister was expecting to be confined every day—I used to go and visit her once or twice a week—my father is a tailor, and my brother also—they made things for Mr. Roper—they always have made things for him—he had a great many things—Mrs. Roper had been a dressmaker—she had a good stock of things—I have assisted her in making them—I am a dress-maker and milliner—I know that my sister had a good stock of wearing apparel—I am quite certain of it—they lived in better premises and in better style at Plaistow—I have seen much of them together—he is indeed a good father and a good husband—we took charge of the little boy the same day upon which my sister was confined—he was too unwell to go back, or he would have been returned on the Saturday—I heard an offer made by Miss Morton to take one of the other children during my sister's confine<lb/>ment, and Mr. Roper declined, and Mrs. Roper likewise.</p>

I am the prisoner's father-in-law—I removed a glass shade and wax flowers from the prisoner's house, on the Thursday before the fire, I think—I did not myself remove anything else before the fire—at the latter end of August, I pledged some articles for Mrs. Roper; silver sugar-tongs and forks, twelve or fourteen plated spoons, a bread knife, a decanter and stand, one or two gowns, to the best of my knowledge; and a small frock, wrapped up in a drab curtain, I think—I also pledged a coat and two waistcoats, belonging to the prisoner, at a pawnbrokers, named Barr—I pledged them in the names of Brown and Bircham—I handed the money to Mrs. Roper—I cannot exactly say how much I got altogether—I think it was just upon 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the articles have since been produced, and I have seen them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Eustace-place, Woolwich—I am married to the prisoner's sister. On the Friday week before the fire, Mrs. Roper gave me a carpet-bag to take charge of; that wag at the prisoner's house—I took it to my house—I afterwards unpacked it—it contained glass—there were four decanters, a celery glass, a water ewer, two goblets, three dozen wine glasses, and some champagne glasses—I afterwards pledged them for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the request of Mrs. Roper, and gave her the money—I pledged them at Mr. Burt's, Powis-street, Woolwich.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Mr. Roper was not present at the time, was he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I never had any communication with him on the subject—this was on the Friday week previous to the fire—I am now working as a labourer in the Woolwich Arsenal—I never was a bricklayer; I was a glazier—I had something to do with repairing these premises of Mr. Roper's, at the time he took them—I assisted in the shop—the ceiling immediately over the shop was canvas papered and then painted—the canvas was nailed to the rafters of the shop—it was from that ceiling that the lamp was sus<lb/>pended—on the wall on the right-hand side upon entering the door there was also canvas, but the left-hand I think not—I think at the side it was lath and plaster under the canvas—there was no lath and plaster to the ceiling—the prisoner paid me no direct wages for what I did, being his relative, and not being in employment at the time—I was there to assist him, as a friend or relative, without any direct regard to wages—I was paid some trifle—there was money expended on the house by Mr. Roper—there was a front put to the shop, at considerable expense, and the inside was thoroughly fitted by him; everything new and appropriate to the business upon which he was about to enter—it was originally a hairdresser's, and had to be turned into a corn-chandler's—the fittings alone, I should say, must have cost from 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a rough guess; the alterations altogether, window and all, I should say, cost not less than 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I was in the prisoner's service close upon two years—I was in his service at the time of the fire—shortly before the fire I received several things from the prisoner's house to take to Mr. Cowell's house at Deptford—I began to take them on the Monday night—I think I first took a dozen plates on the Monday night—I went several times from that time to the time of the fire—I took a few articles at a time; it was in the evening part, at dusk—the prisoner told me to take them to Mr. Cowell's, but I was not to tell any one—I remember the large dishes being moved—Mr. Roper moved them himself—I remember the stand of wax flowers, they used to stand on the table in the front parlour up stairs—they were removed on the Wednesday night by Mr. Cowell—I remember a quan<lb/>tity of glass that used to be on the sideboard in the front parlour—I missed the glass on the Friday before the fire—I did not miss the decanters—on the Friday week before the fire I saw a bundle tied up, it was a largish bundle; it looked like clothes wrapped up—it was bound up in some white dimity—Mr. Cowell came there that evening—I remember that same day dusting Mrs. Roper's bedroom—I dusted the wardrobe—in doing that I opened the drawers where she used to keep her dresses, in order to dust the ledges, and I saw that the dresses were gone; they were silk dresses—I also saw a pawn-ticket—some books were removed before the fire—I remember holding the sacks for some books to be put in—there were two sacks—I am quite sure there were two sacks of books—Mr. Roper put them in—I remember a writing-desk being removed, that was on the Saturday night about eight o'clock, the night of the fire—I did that by Mr. Roper's direc<lb/>tion—he told me to take the writing-desk to Mrs. Cowell's; it was rather heavy—it was wrapped in a little bundle handkerchief—I removed two globes on the Friday—the boy removed the lamps in the basket, on the Saturday night of the fire—I remember the prisoner giving me some direc<lb/>tions about getting some turps—it was about eleven o'clock at night that I got it; but he had told me about it in the evening part—he told me to get some turps, and see how they sold it, and I got half a pint—I asked him how much I was to get, and he said, "You will see how they sell it"—nothing was said about how much I was to get—he gave me sixpence and a bottle; it was a large white glass bottle—I have got turps for him before—there was a bottle in which I used to get it, but this was a bottle I had never had before—it was larger—I went and fetched some turps—I got half a pint, at Mrs. Harding's, in London-street, Greenwich, that is an oil shop—a young woman served me—I have been to the shop since—Maria Harding was the person who served me—when I had got the turps I brought it back, and gave it to the prisoner—I don't know what he did with it—I gave it to him, and he said, "Have you brought so much as that?"—I told him how much there was—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bottle I used to fetch the turps in—in two or three pennyworths—the bottle I got the sixpennyworth in was larger than this, and it was a flat bottle, something similar to this (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I had never got as much as half a pint of turps before—Mr. Roper said he wanted it to clean the bookcase with—I had never seen him cleaning the furniture himself—I went up stairs that night about twelve</p>

               <p>o'clock—I stayed in Mrs. Roper's room about ten minutes, and then I went up to bed—the prisoner went up at the same time; we both went up together—before he went up, I observed that he turned the gas three parts off—I had not been down in the cellar that day, nor the day before—I had not been down there for three or four days—there was no gas in the cellar—when I went up stairs to bed, as far as I can judge, everything was safe—I was awoke by the prisoner after having gone to bed—he called "Lizzy" twice—I said, "Yes, sir," and got out of bed, and went to the door, and opened it—I had not smelt any smell of fire before that—when I opened the door I saw the flames at the bottom of the stairs—the heat was so great I ran to the window—I climbed out of the window, and was ultimately saved by the fire-escape from the roof—I have seen all the things that have been produced here to day—I know the desk, it is the desk I have been speaking of—this is my master's dinner-service, and the glass, and the wax-flowers—I have since seen the things which were pawned—all the things I have seen were my master's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say you generally fetched only one or two pennyworth of turps? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, two pennyworth would about three-parts fill this bottle, I should think—I was not accustomed to fill even, this bottle—the six pennyworth did not fill the other one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to buy half a pint? who told you to do it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Roper told me to get some turps—I did not get the usual quantity, as I thought the bookcase would take a good drop, that was the reason I bought five pennyworth—it was fivepence the half pint—I had a sixpenny piece—I had not known in the morning that the furniture was going to be cleaned—I did not mention on the Sunday morning that I had to clean the furniture the next day—I swear that—I remembered this turps after I had been examined half a dozen times—I did not think of it at first—I did not say on the Sunday that I was going to clean the furniture the next day—Mr. Roper said on the Saturday night "I want you to get some turps, and we will clean the book-case"—I generally cleaned the furniture—I believe the boy Morris took away the two sacks of books—directly there was the alarm of lire I got out of the window as quickly as I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman in the service of the parish of Green<lb/>wich—I have been a fireman for twenty years—on 21st September I was placed in charge of the ruins at the prisoner's house—I have been in the habit of forming a judgment as to the origin of fires—I have seen premises just after they have been burnt down—on Friday, 22d October, I went down into the cellar for the first time—the cellar was accessible before that at one part, the flap at the back of the shop, but not the steps, where it was choked up with rubbish—I removed the rubbish from there—I found that the steps were nearly consumed—the bottom step was not consumed—they were wooden steps—I am speaking of the step-ladder; that went from the shop into the cellar—I produce the bottom stair of the first flight—it was a step-ladder; there was no stair there—there was no staircase from the shop to the cellar, merely a step-ladder—there was a staircase leading up stairs, just above the step-ladder, leading from the shop to the upper part of the house—this is the bottom step (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); the other part was totally consumed—when I went down, having cleared away the rubbish, I found part of some hay and straw, lying cross ways on the steps (<hi rend="italic">referring to the model</hi>)—under this part of the flooring the straw was totally con<lb/>sumed—the flooring was very much burnt at one part—it runs about two feet six from the bottom step—the flooring was charred more or less; further on here it was not charred, on account of the straw not being consumed—this piece of paper describes the position of the straw under the step, and part of a truss of straw was lying on the top of the step—I cannot say how many treads there were to the steps; they run nine inches apart—I dare say there were nine or ten—there was straw lying underneath the ladder—the wood-work of the other parts of the cellar was charred, and the roof also, more or less—I have seen this model before; it exactly repre<lb/>sents the roof of the cellar as I saw it burnt in October—I am able to say that the fire came from below, because, if it had come from the top, it would have burnt the contrary way—the hole underneath was rather larger than at the top—I saw no other straw, or truss of straw in the cellar, except what is produced here—I examined to see whether there were traces of straw in the shop, and could not find any, and I should say that they had not been removed or examined before I looked—if the fire had com<lb/>menced in the shop above, and any rafters or wood had fallen from above into the cellar, it might have set fire to the straw; but the rubbish would have fallen on it and smothered it, and so much of the straw would not have been consumed—there are five holes burnt in the floor (<hi rend="italic">pointing out, by the model, their position with regard to the staircase</hi>)—we got the fire well under by a quarter to 5; and if it began in the cellar, the heat would be very great there—if the flame had gone up from the cellar, it would, no doubt, have gone up rapidly and with intensity, and it would then have ascended the staircase of the house—supposing the fire originated there, that would be the first place it would go to—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bottom step of the first flight; the fire coming from the cellar, this part was burnt; it was situated next to the opening—if the fire came from the cellar, it would catch this opening, and not the other; it was charred underneath—I can say that the fire originated in the cellar, at the bottom of the steps.</p>

I have been a foreman in the London Fire Brigade 19 years, and have been 29 years in the service—I am in no way connected with the Kent Fire-office, nor with, Smart or Lilley—I was at the prisoner's house about 5 o'clock on the morning the fire occurred. On 24th and 25th October I went to the ruins to examine them—that was before the examination before the Magistrate—I have not the least doubt whatever of the fire having begun in the cellar under the cellar stairs—this flooring (<hi rend="italic">taking it out of the model</hi>) exactly represents the state of the flooring as I saw it—I believe the holes to have been made from underneath, from the flame coming under here—the fire appeared to have gone up the stairs, through the roof, and through the roof of the adjoining house—it was all down when I arrived at 5 o'clock—I saw the remains of four or five trusses of straw, and from that there must have been a great body of fire shot up—if turpentine was put on the straw, it would aid the rapidity and intensity very much.</p>

I am professor of chemistry at the Middlesex Hospital—supposing turpentine was mixed with straw for the purpose of being fired, no smell whatever of the turpentine would remain afterwards, if it was perfectly consumed—in order to test that, I made some experiments, and burnt some straw with turpentine, and some without—in this bottle I burnt some straw saturated with turpentine; there is no smell remaining.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>I will come to your house to-morrow morning"—I could not raise the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the following morning—he came to me the same evening, and said, "What is the reason you have not called on me"—I said that I could not raise the money—I said, "I will get it against to-morrow morning, by 11 o'clock"—I went to him on the following morning, at 11 o'clock, at his dwelling at Hoxton, and gave him the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in presence of my wife and John Wilkins—I offered it to him in the front room—he said, "Come with me into the next room"—I went in the next room, and counted him out the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—he said, "Now, come with me; you shall have the goods"—I went to his stable with him, and he put the horse in the cart, and drove me to Wandsworth, where I imagined the goods were—we went to a house in Wandsworth—I there got three small hampers and an egg-chest—the hampers were not mine—there was about 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods—they were not the goods which were in the hampers before—he said I should have the other four hampers on my way back—I did not get them on my way back—he took me back to my own residence in the Lower Marsh—I did not get my four hampers—he said it was too late to get them that night—he would get them to-morrow morning—I said I thought I should not be able to come myself; if I sent my wife, it would be just the same—he said it did not matter; whoever I sent should have them—I sent the next morning—I did not get them—the value of the four hampers was about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—the hampers I got were worth about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when they left me—they were worth about 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when they came back—I sent my wife the next morning, and she returned with five pawnbroker's duplicates—I have since seen the property represented by those duplicates—it is here—it is mine—the difference between what I have got, and what I delivered to him, I should say, is about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the pri<lb/>soner was taken, Coppin, the officer, said to him, "What have you done with the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "I have spent it"—I was present when his lodging was searched—six pairs of boots were found—they were part of my property.</p>

Hobbs,"—I told the prisoner to call again in half an hour—in the mean time I made a communication to Mr. T. Hobbs, who is the foreman at the Adelphi—the prisoner came again in about half, or three-quarters of an hour—I told him I had not change, and told him to call again in a quarter of an hour—he did so, and I then gave him into custody—I asked him whether the figures 7 1/2 meant hours, and he said, "Yes."</p>
