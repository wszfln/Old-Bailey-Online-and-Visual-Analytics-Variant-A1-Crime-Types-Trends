At 1 o'clock on the morning of 5th January I was in St. Pancras Road—in consequence of something said to me by the last witness, I noticed an old gentleman—three or four men were near or with him hustling one another and the old man about—I was. about thirty yards off when my attention was first called—they ran away immediately they saw me running towards them, behind the last witness—I overtook one of the men, Darcy; he had a wooden leg, and could not run very fast—I took him into custody—I did not see them knock the old gentleman down; all I saw was that Darcy was one of the men, and after he left him I took him into custody—I found on him at the station 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but nothing belonging to the old gentleman.</p>

                  </hi>. Previous to 6th January last I was in Mrs. Gadd's service for three weeks as general servant at 191, Hammersmith Road—it was a hairdresser's shop—I did not sleep in the house—Mrs. Gadd did and her two children, and I think the old lady, Mrs. Gadd's mother, but I am not sure—the elder child is about five years old—the assistants did not sleep on the premises—I don't know who managed the business—I was hardly ever down in the shop—I was never in the rooms on the first floor—all the rooms I have been in were my kitchen and a little room where the young men used to have their food—sometimes I have seen the old lady go into the first-floor rooms, and once I saw Mr. Haskerl go in—</p>

               <p>one day I saw the old lady unlock the bedroom next to my kitchen, the front one, not the one on the first floor—she and Haskerl were the only persons I have seen go into the rooms on the first floor—I don't know at what time the shop was usually shut of an evening—on the night of the fire, Friday, 6th January, I went out with Mrs. Gadd about 20 minutes to 9—the shop was shut up then, but we left the two assistants putting their clothes on, and the little boy; we. took the baby with us—the elder child was at Mr. Haskerl's; I know that, because we went there after the fire was out, and saw the child there; I don't know when he left the house—<hi rend="italic">missis</hi> told me about a week before the fire that he was going to some school—as we were leaving the house on the night of the fire Mrs. Gadd said "It is raining, Sarah," and she asked me if I had an umbrella—I said "No, it is upstairs," and I offered to go and get it if she would take the baby—I had it in my arms in the shop—she said "I will run up and get it," and she went up and got it—she was about two or three minutes upstairs—we were both dressed ready to go out, she dressed before me, I had to get the baby ready—she dressed in the bedroom upstairs, next to my kitchen—she said she was going to get some shopping, and I could come with her—I used to leave at all times, sometimes before 9, sometimes after 9—when we left we went out to several shops down Hammersmith; we went as far as the Windsor Castle, to a linen draper's, a good step down the town, about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour's walk from the shop—we then returned—we went into several shops as we were coming back—when we got against the Hammersmith Hospital we heard about a fire—we had then been absent about half or three-quarters of an hour—I don't know from whom we heard about the fire, it was a stranger; I saw signs of a fire, and I said "There is a fire somewhere"—<hi rend="italic">missis</hi> said "I hope to goodness it is not near us"—we went nearly against the shop, and saw that it was our shop that was on fire—we did not go in, we took a Hansom and went to Mr. Haskerl's, 35, Heathfield Street, Chiswick—I do not know why we did not go into the shop—a policeman was at the door, we did not speak to him; I don't know whether the door was open, we never went to the door; we went as far as the greengrocer's, three doors off—some young girl said to Mrs. Gadd "Your house is on fire," and she said "Oh dear, oh dear," and then she took the Hansom and drive to Haskerl's—he lived there with his wife—it was a good long way, I never walked it; it took us about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes in the cab—when we got there the old lady came and answered the door, and we saw Mr. and Mrs. Haskerl, the servant, and the little boy—Mrs. Gadd said to Haskerl "My house is on fire"—he said "What, what?"—she said "My house is on fire," and then he put on his boots and came with us—we went back in the same cab, I sat on <hi rend="italic">missis's</hi> lap—there was some conversation in the cab; they spoke in their own language, a foreign language, which I could not understand—I had seen the old lady at the house about 2 o'clock on the day of the fire, not after that—I saw Haskerl there about 2.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living in Church Lane, Hammersmith—I was assistant in the hairdressing shop, 191, Hammersmith Road—Haskerl engaged me about six months before the fire—at first I slept on the premises, on the third floor, at the top—Mrs. Gadd, her mother, the servant, and another assistant named May, also slept there; May slept in the same room with me—he left about eight weeks before the fire, and Herman came in his place, about six weeks before the fire—he did not sleep in the house—the boy Arnold came about eight weeks before the fire, he did not sleep on the premises—the old lady and the first servant slept on the third floor—Mrs. Gadd paid me my wages—she assisted in the business, in the shop—Haskerl generally came about 10, his name was on the shop, not on the private door—he did not always stay all day, he came every day to look after the business, he was manager; he used to assist us in cutting hair and shaving—I was paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week at first—about six weeks before the fire Mrs. Gadd said she was going to let the top rooms, and I slept away, and then I was paid 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—8 o'clock was my time for coming to business in the morning, and my usual time for leaving was half-past 9—that was the time the shop was usually closed—on the Friday, the day of the fire, I saw Haskerl there once in the morning and once in the night, he came about 10 and left about 12; he came again about 1. 30 and went out again; then about 7 he came into the shop and went out again, that was the last time I</p>

               <p>saw him at the house that day—before that he had been nearly every day attending to the business—I could not say exactly what part of the premises he went into on the Friday, I only saw him in the shop, I remained there attending to customers—I had my meals at the house; we had dinner at 1, and tea at 5; the assistants and the servant generally had it together, not Mrs. Gadd—I once went into the front room on the first floor; that was about five weeks before the fire, we had our dinner in there; it was only that once, there was a table and a few chairs in the room—I never went into the back room or saw into it—Haskerl had no particular hours for leaving, about 4 or 5, he did not stop after that—I saw Mrs. Gadd about 10 minutes before 9 on the Friday when she left, she was dressed up and said she was going out for shopping—that was not the usual time for closing—the shutters were up, she told Arnold to put them up before she was dressed, because she was going out for shopping—that was about a quarter to 9; she was then in the shop, behind the desk—Arnold put up the shutters—as a rule we used to shut up at half-past 9, and the shutters were not put up before—then she left the shop, went up, and came down dressed ready to go out—I could not say how long she had been away, because I was not in the front shop when she went away—it was about 10 minutes between the time of her telling the boy to put up the shutters and my seeing her dressed ready to go out—I then saw Gibbs, she had the baby—I asked Mrs. Gadd whether I should turn out the gas in the passage, she said no, because she wanted to see, when she came in—I don't know whether anything was done to the gas at the meter, I turned the gas-bracket lower, that was the first one in the passage by the side door—the gas in the shop was put out altogether—I did not see what became of Mrs. Gadd and the servant, they went away, that is all I know—we all left together, Herman, Mrs. Gadd, the servant, and the boy—Herman closed the door—we were all there together—I and Herman went home and then went down to the City, we did not go back to the house—I first heard of the fire next morning at 8, from Arnold—when I left there was nothing wrong with the ceiling of the shop, it was all perfectly right—we did not use benzoline in the business.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an assistant, in the employ of Mrs. Gadd, at 191, Hammersmith Road, between two and three months—I never slept there—as a rule Mrs. Gadd paid me my wages—I saw Mr. Haskerl at the shop on the day of the fire up to about 4—he went away with the carpenter then—there had been a carpenter at work on that day, the witness Heath—I did not see Haskerl again after four—we usually shut up at half-past 9 on a week-night and at 11 on Saturdays—I used to sweep out the shop before I shut up, I did not do so on the night of the fire, I had no reason why; but I was not told to do it—on this night I shut up at two or three minutes to 9—Mrs. Gadd told me to do so; she did not give me any reason—the keys used to hang up on a peg just inside the door, where Mrs. Gadd's counter is—she gave me the keys that night—I used to lock up all the doors on the ground floor, the street door too—they were all on one bunch—when I had locked up I put them back on the counter—we used not to lock one of the front doors; it had a latch, and I pulled it to—sometimes I used to give the keys to Mrs. Gadd at the counter—on the night of the fire Mrs. Gadd started to lock up, and when she had locked some of the doors she gave the keys to me to lock up the rest—I noticed that two keys were missing, one belonging to the front door—three keys fitted two doors—one key unlocked three of the doors; it would open the street door—I locked that door—one key fitted the door which I generally locked—that key would also fit the door leading into the gentlemen's saloon and the one leading into Mrs. Gadd's counter—I don't know what the other key unlocked—those three doors were locked that night, as far as I know, but I never locked them—I did not return the keys to Mrs. Gadd; she had them—I don't know what she did with them—after I gave her the keys I went and turned the gas down—before doing so I heard her tell the servant that it was raining, and ask her if she had an umbrella—I don't know whether it was raining—then we left—I do not know who left last.</p>

I am professor of chemistry to the Westminster Hospital—I have had a large experience in explosive substances—on 17th January Inspector Cronin brought me a box containing three bladders, two empty and one partly full, containing 8 oz. of what is known as benzoline or petroleum spirit, and about half an ounce of water—it was tied up with a piece of narrow wick—if set light to, it would not burn down to the bladder—it was only tied outside—I smelt the empty ones, but. being</p>

               <p>tied together with the full bladder, I did not attach any importance to that—they did smell of benzoline—the paper was stained; I can't say what with—benzoline is a very inflammable substance; it gives out inflammable vapour at ordinary temperature—it is more like a spirit than oil; it is thinner than oil—it is the volatile part of petroleum oil—if used intentionally to set fire to anything it would blaze, even without a light being actually applied to it; it gives out vapour which takes fire—it is a stuff the traffic of which is under special regulations-this in the bottle is the remnant, which I did not use in the examination—the bladders are about the same size.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Mountford Road, Clapton, and am town collector to the Jeyes Sanitary Company, Limited, Cannon Street—I have been about five years with them—the prisoner was their secretary—it was my duty to collect moneys owing to the Company, and to pay them over to the prisoner weekly—I entered the items collected upon a sheet of paper, and when I paid the money to the prisoner he should have initialled that sheet, but he always initialled my book—I also had a book in which the total amount was placed without the items—he used also to initial that—that is called the collector's receipt-book—for the week ending 16th July I had 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in hand collected on behalf of the Company—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the sheet for that week—I handed over the sum there represented to the prisoner and these are his initials to this sheet—this is the collector's receipt-book, these are also his initials to that—that receipt clears me—it was my duty when I handed the prisoner the money to also hand him the sheet, what he did with it afterwards I don't know—on 6th August I had in hand 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I handed over to the prisoner with this cash-sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and he initialled it as it now appears "L.

I am clerk and cashier to the prosecuting Company, and act under the directions and orders of Hakeman, the secretary—the practice of the Company was for the collectors and travellers to pay their amounts in the first instance to the prisoner—it would be no part of my duty to receive the sums mentioned on the two sheets, they would be paid to the prisoner—it was my duty at the end of the day, to pay into the bank the moneys received in the course of that day—I keep the cash-book partly, and partly the prisoner—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the Company's cash-book—the entries there under the date of 16th July are in Mr. Hakeman's writing—I know his writing—the sums on sheet "A" are all entered in here in detail; they are 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the entries in here on 6th August are in my writing, they were made from the sheet which is now before me, under Mr. Hake-man's direction—I have entered there the amounts, item for item, as</p>

               <p>Bank cheques—after July, 1887, he stopped giving me cash and I used it from one of my cash boxes, the one containing receipts—I cannot say how long I did that—I never received any money from the prisoner for petty cash for two months after July—then after September he began again to give me money for disbursements—I cannot tell how much I expended in petty cash disbursements from July to September, but it would be a little over the average—some special work was going on at the time—I should say I expended 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at least during that time, perhaps more; July and August are two of our busiest months—it was my duty to pay moneys into the bank; I did not always do it, Mr. Hakemann did, nobody else—sometimes Mr. Hakemann made out the paying slips, and sometimes I did, but the majority of them I think I did—all these amounts which he is charged with embezzling are entered in their proper places in the cash book; he made no concealment from me that he had received them—he told me to enter one amount and he entered the other—when I called his attention to the fact that the amounts had not been paid in, he said "Very well, I will pay it in," or words to that effect—whether he said "I shall have to pay it in," or "I will pay it in, "Idon't remember—he was away in January for two days; I did not know where he had gone to—I never heard until several weeks after he had left—I cannot form any idea as to the actual amount of cash that passed through mine and the defendant's hands in a year; I should not say so much as 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you can get it from the cash book—I only in one case left a blank in the draft report to be filled in afterwards, and that was goods receivable—I did not keep the bills receivable book, but that would have no effect on the report itself—I made out the report of the 21st January, 1888, but I did not copy it at all, I was too busy—the report was made out in the ordinary form, and all the amounts left blank—that was after the defendant had left, and when all the books were in confusion—I think our sales amount to more than 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, of 185, Gracechurch Street, and am managing director of Jeyes Sanitary Compound Company—the prisoner was secretary at 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—there had been an old Company, which had gone into liquidation, and this is the new Company—the prisoner had been secretary to the old Company and we took him on—until these matters were brought under my notice I had every confidence in him, and he was a trusted servant of the Company—it was his duty to receive moneys from the various collectors and hand them over to Fricker, for the purpose of paying them in to the account—I find that the two amounts spoken to by Thorley have never been paid in—in the second week in January the prisoner absented himself from the Company's place of business for two days—he had not asked permission to leave—the business is carried on in Cannon Street—it is part of my duty to be there almost every day—another managing director, Thomas Brown, of Monk, Brown, and Co., of Wood Street, attends almost every day to look after matters; be is not bound to be there—I have my own business to attend to as well—in our absence the prisoner would represent the Company—he returned after two days' absence—I was laid up at the time he was away—he had to leave in consequence of his absence without leave—at that time we believed the accounts to be perfectly in order—the people the prisoner bad engaged with, Messrs. Morris, Little, and Son, of Doncaster, manufacturers of sheep dip, applied to us for his character, and I wrote and said we had nothing whatever to say against his honesty and integrity—I cannot say if he got the situation—he was dismissed by us summarily on Thursday, the 19th, and on Saturday, the 21st, we got the first suspicion with regard to the books and the reports, and so on—on Friday, the 20th, we wrote to Messrs. Morris, Little, and Co., giving him a character for honesty and integrity—petty cash was kept by the prisoner in the office, and petty cash was kept by Fricker for minor disbursements—Fricker would get his petty cash from the prisoner, who would get that and his own petty cash from cheques drawn by the directors in favour of the Cheque Bank—those cheques would be paid into the account at the Cheque Bank, and then in all cases disbursements would be made by the prisoner by a Cheque Bank cheque, whether the amounts were large or small—the Cheque Bank account was started by us so that there need be no cash in the office except what was required for petty minor disbursements—I was not aware at the time that between July and September no Cheque Bank cheques for petty cash were ever given to Fricker by the prisoner—I believed the reports between September 3rd and the close of his career there accurately represented the financial condition of the Company—since his departure I have been through the books, and I find a deficiency of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I have not gone further than the end of last year—there is a further deficiency in the petty cash book—this is the prisoner's Cheque Bank account for petty cash—this book purports to represent the actual condition of the account of the Company with the Cheque Bank—the credit side purports to be the cheques drawn out by the secretary for business purposes, and the debit the amounts paid into the bank—these small items purport to be the exact weekly amounts of the office petty cash, supposed to be paid by the prisoner from the Cheque Bank week by week to Fricker, and those amounts correspond to the weekly</p>

               <p>office petty cash amounts in Flicker's books—those amounts appear in Flicker's books—Fricker, being without cash for office minor cash disbursements, would with the prisoner's knowledge take cash receipts which came into the office for trade accounts, and utilise those for petty cash which the prisoner at the same time would be drawing out—that is the way the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. comes about—all through July, August, September, October November, December, and January, he was drawing from me cheques to be paid into the Cheque Bank for this purpose—those cheques were signed at Board meetings—that goes on up to the time of his dismissal—the amounts in the second cash-box were cash receipts paid into the office direct for petty sales instead of to a collector—I had no suspicion of these till I went through the books and discovered it on the day after he left—we found on inquiry that the balance at the bank was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than appeared in his book—the balance in the book when he left was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was absent on the 9th and 10th January when the prisoner went to Doncaster—I was laid up in bed—I know now that he went there to get the other situation—he wrote a letter to Mr. Brown on the Saturday before he went saying he would be away—he was secretary of the Company, and in charge of the Company's business—he upset other arrangements which Mr. Brown had made; that was not why he was dismissed—Mr. Brown would not get the letter till the Monday morning, and therefore practically he gave no notice—he gave notice on the Saturday that he would be away on the Monday—we had been for some time dissatisfied with the prisoner, and had negotiations with some other person in view prior to the prisoner's going to Doncaster—I don't know that the prisoner knew it—I personally had advertised; the Company had not—I had no suspicion whatever of his honesty up to this time—I had advertised before November for another secretary—he told us afterwards he had been to see Messrs. Morris, Little, and Co., about a situation—he did not then give me three months' notice to leave—I believe he gave the Company notice; it is on the minutes, but it is the subject of dispute—on 12th January, as I am informed, he told the directors who were present that he expected to get a situation with Morris and Little's, but they did not wish him to leave under three months—he did not give notice to leave, but he entered this on the minute book: "The secretary gave three months' notice of his intention to leave the service of the Company," that minute was read over at the next meeting, and objected to as not having taken place—I don't know if the directors did not want him to leave—he said the people he was going to did not wish him to leave for three months—our directors did not understand that as a notice to leave—our point is that he did not give formal notice, although he told us he had another situation—if Fricker had to make a disbursement in the office of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he would pay it out of the cash he kept in cash—the prisoner ought to have given him a lump sum at the beginning of the week to start with, and if in the middle of the week Fricker wanted more he would give him a Cheque Bank cheque, within 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">or</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the amount of Fricker's disbursements—I never heard of Fricker 8 petty cash being exhausted, and his wanting some immediately to disburse it; it did not come under my notice—I can imagine such a thing—he would then have paid it out of his own pocket, and gone to the prisoner and got a cheque, or he could have paid it out of his cash box,</p>

               <p>a small amount—he had no right to he without cash—if Fricker made two or three disbursements out of his pocket in the petty cash book, then he ought to have gone <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the prisoner and got a Cheque Bank cheque—the amounts on the right-hand side of the Cheque Bank cash-book represent the petty cash disbursements, some made by the prisoner and some by Fricker—they are made in his book from Fricker's book, as being sums paid over to Fricker—those amounts are not put down in this book by Fricker—undoubtedly those amounts were really disbursed by Fricker—I took charge of the petty cash myself on account of the prisoner's illness about the beginning of 1886—there was a little discussion when I returned about the state of the account—the prisoner could not make it right; something like 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was wrong—it appeared by the cash-book as a sum which had been received, and he could not trace it as having been paid into the bank—I believe I said I must have given the amount to Fricker to pay in, and Fricker denied ever having had it from me—I put it right by paying it out of my own pocket—when I had suddenly, at a moment's notice, just after taking over the business, charge of the petty cash, found the prisoner had been mixing up office petty cash, petty cash, and cash receipts, all in one box—I was only in and out of the office; I had my own business to attend to—it was impossible to know how the thing was kept, and on the prisoner's return we determined to open the Cheque Bank account—9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was missed; subsequently one or two amounts signed as received by me were paid in, and when the auditor came to examine it he found it was wrong, and wrote it off as general expenses, because it was impossible to say if it had been received by me or not—after paying the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we found one or two things wrong—I was only connected with the old Company as a purchaser—I can't say if the prisoner was secretary since November, 1882, of the old Company; I know he was for some years—the Company went into liquidation in January, 1884—the prisoner was appointed manager to the trustees of the debenture holders in the old Company, and in November, 1885, he became secretary of the new Company—100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has not passed through his hands since 1882—the gross sales amount to something over 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at present, but I don't know what they did before we took possession—the Cheque Bank cheques, including the payments made out of the office for petty cash, would be 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month; that covers everything, the office petty cash and salaries—the prisoner drew his own salary himself every week—in the petty cash-book each salary is put down under the name of the individual—some of them are odd amounts, 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or something of that sort for wages—I did not know it was the frequent practice for the servants to cash their cheques at the office; they are not supposed to do so—the bank was not closed till 2 o'clock, and they were supposed to be paid long before that—there was an arrangement that if at the end of the year the directors thought the results sufficiently satisfactory the prisoner should have a commission of one per cent.—it was entirely within the directors' discretion—at the end of 1886 they considered it satisfactory enough to recommend it, and the commission was credited to him against a loan which he once, being in difficulties, asked us to make him—the commission credited was one per cent, on the divided profits—there was no dispute about it—the prisoner never mentioned to me that he should have the one per cent, on the nett profits—the ledger showing it is in the office.</p>

I am a cab-driver, and live at 6, Acton Street, Gray's Inn Road—on 6th February, at 2 p. m., I was standing by the side of my cab, which was fifth on the rank, in Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, about three yards from the level of the refuge—I noticed two omnibuses passing along Piccadilly, the leading one was a General Omnibus Company's, the one behind was a Road Car <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>, driven by the prisoner; I should say they were about two yards apart—they were going at a speed of about 10 miles per hour—I have been a cab-driver about 15 years—I think the Road Car <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> was trying to pass the other, to pick up passengers—when they came to the refuge, the London General Omnibus Company went to the near side, the Road Car <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> went to the off side; I did not see any reason for that—I saw it knock a gentleman down and go over him—I could not not say what part of the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> or horses struck him, I was too far off to say; I was from six to eight yards away; it was on the other side of the refuge, I did not see the deceased till he was on the point of being knocked down—I can't say whether the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> was still travelling at the speed of 10 miles an hour as it passed the refuge; it eased up a bit before it passed the refuge—I don't think he could have stopped his horses in time to prevent the accident, because the gentleman was beyond the refuge—I have seen three vehicles go abreast on the side of the refuge hundreds of times, I mean between the refuge and the park.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 43, Compton Street, Brunswick Square—at 2 o'clock in the afternoon of 6th February I was first cab, four-wheeler, on the rank by the side of the Green Park; my horse's head was turned westward—I was sitting on my box; I saw two <hi rend="italic">'busses</hi> coming along westward, I cannot tell what <hi rend="italic">'busses</hi> they were—I know nothing about their pace till they came to the refuge, my back was towards them; they were on the near side till they got to the rest, then the Road Car crossed the road on the other side, the wrong side—they were abreast when I first saw them; when they came to the refuge the one on the near side kept to the left—they were going about six miles an hour when they passed the rest—it is downhill as you go towards Hyde Park Corner—I saw the deceased crossing the road about 20 yards west of the refuge, towards Kensington; he came out of the Green Park—I saw the prisoner's <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> strike him, the collar of the near side horse struck him on the right shoulder, it swerved him round and he fell on his face—the prisoner tried to pull up but he could not, it was a momentary thing; he pulled up in about a couple of yards—the traffic was going down on the near side; if he had waited and took his turn he could have gone past—I have been a driver 38 years—there was room for two omnibuses abreast between the kerb and the refuge—I saw the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> pull up in the space between the refuge and the kerb, he pulled up close to the kerb; there was not room for the other <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> to pass between the off wheel and the near kerb of the refuge, because of the other traffic behind him going down at the same time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner went round the obelisk at a moderate pace, he put his break on to go round—he had only one of two things to do, either to stop his <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> or go round the refuge—the road was very</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188802270056"/>
               <p>greasy that day—I heard him shouting to the old gentleman, he was barely a yard from him at that time—the old gentleman came straight across from the Green Park by the walking traffic going west; he was looking westward, he was not looking down, more than a man of his age would be; he was looking down one side, with his head westward—the prisoner did all he could when he saw the old gentleman to stop his car, he put his break on as hard as he could and shouted—I could not see the old gentleman after he came out of the park till he got to the traffic, there was so much traffic I lost sight of him till he got to the traffic—the Road Car was making round on the near side when he got to the refuge, and as soon as the driver saw the gentleman he pulled to the off side as hard as he could, it was a momentary thing—the collar of the horse just touched him and knocked him down, and the wheel went over him; there was no traffic going west on the off side of the refuge—it was quite clear, there was nothing to lead the driver to expect any obstruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner's <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> could not have passed on the near side unless he had waited his turn to go down behind the other traffic—with the break on I think I could pull up a <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> going at six miles an hour in a few yards, two, three, or four yards—I did not notice if there were any other persons crossing at the same time, the deceased was the only man I saw crossing the road—he had got something like two or three feet beyond the centre of the road—I should think he was not above a yard or a yard and a half off when the prisoner saw him.</p>

                  </hi>. I sweep a crossing at the corner of Half-Moon Street, on the east side of the refuge, very nearly opposite it—on Saturday, 6th February, at 2 p.m., I noticed a London General omnibus and a road car come along Piccadilly, going westward—they were abreast, some 20 yards to the east of the refuge—I should think they were travelling between nine and ten miles an hour—my attention was attracted to them by the fast pace—the road car came on the wrong side of the refuge, and the omnibus to the right, and pulled in near the kerb—the omnibus stopped half-way down the refuge, but in such a part of the road as would have enabled the prisoner's car also to pass on that side—I did not notice whether the omnibus was setting down a passenger—I saw the deceased in the centre of the road, on a line with the refuge—I did not see him struck; I saw him fall—he was then about 14 yards from where I first saw him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the <hi rend="italic">'busses</hi> racing before they came to the refuge—I heard a shouting for somebody to get cut of the road—I said at the inquest that my attention was first attracted by the shouts—at the time the gentleman was knocked down the Chelsea omnibus was behind him.</p>

               <p>car, and I was conductor—from St. James's Street, going west, there is a gradient down hill—the road was very greasy that afternoon—after we had passed St. James's Street I noticed the London General omnibus in front; it was going about five miles an hour; we were going about the same pace—our car has glass panels in front, so that I could see the traffic in front—the omnibus went ahead of us from Piccadilly Circus; it was about two or throe yards in front of us all the way from St. James's Street—our break was about three parts on going down the hill—the hill begins at Bolton Street—we were going about the same pace—I did not hear the omnibus ring to stop—at the refuge we went on the off side; the omnibus was then at a standstill on the near side—there was not room for us to get through on the near side, because there was a line of traffic on the near side—after passing the refuge our break was put full on; that threw me into the car—I felt the car rise, and then I saw the old gentleman under the wheel—I heard shouting before we pulled up so sudden—it was about a second or so after the shouting that I felt the oar rise—I heard the shouting before the break was put full on, about a minute or two before I might say, the shouting first, then the break put on, and then the jerk—I assisted to pick up the deceased—the car was brought to a standstill in about a yard or two—several gentlemen gave me their names and addresses, and also to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 61, Avenue Wagram, Paris, and am acquainted with Monsieur Groult—he is 27 years of age, and is the son of a wealthy manufacturer in Paris—I came over to England with him to assist him in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188802270060"/>
               <p>raising a large sum of money—I had been in England some time staying with M. Groult at Thompson's Hotel, 31, Dover Street, when I met Weston in the Strand on 13th January—he was with a lady in a pony carriage—I said to him "How do you do? what do you make in London?"—he said "I have a little business"—I said "Can 1 help you?"—he said "Where do you live?"—I said "31, Dover Street"—he said "Oh, I live at 42, Dover Street; I will come and see you this evening," but he came not, and I called upon him a few days later at his apartments, 42, Dover Street, and told him I was here with M. Groult, who desired to raise a sum of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that the banker wanted some endorsement as a security; that M. Groult was the son of a very wealthy man in Paris, and that M. Groult himself had one portion of the fortune, which by French law could not be disinherited—he said "I will assist you; I have some one whom I will present to you"—he could not find him—that matter fell through—I saw him again on 19th January at my hotel, 31, Dover Street—he said "The first requisition cannot now be made, but I will introduce you this afternoon to a very old friend of mine, Lord Fairfax; he is very rich, and will be very happy to oblige you with an endorsement"—I saw him again next day, and he then introduced Lord Fairfax, that is Fairchild, whose whiskers and moustache were then quite black—he said he had a big estate and a very big fortune in Virginia, and that his mother had a big fortune, and 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the London and Westminster Bank and in the Bank of England—Weston was there at the time these statements were made—he said he had not many friends in England because he lived in America, but he was a member of a few clubs—he also said he was very unhappy that he had not the money to put at my disposition, and his old mother was not very <hi rend="italic">commode</hi>, but he said "I have a friend, a Canadian gentleman; you must not mind his manner; he is not a lord; his name is Vernon; he is a very rich man; he is now here without any friends; he was so kind as to oblige me with a loan of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I have given him big security. I will introduce him to you this evening; make him a nice good reception, and I will oblige him to lend you a loan of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Vernon did not come—Fairfax said he was obliged to go to Paris, but he would be back on the following Monday; this was Friday—on the Sunday evening I saw Weston, and he told me Lord Fairfax had arrived that evening—Lord Fairfax then came with Mr. Vernon—Vernon was about 5 feet 7 inches high, with brown beard, cut quite short, but pointed, short brown hair, a very ugly nose, and had an American accent—Vernon was very cold—he said "I have no reason to oblige you, but my old friend, Lord Fairfax, I like to oblige him. I have security from him for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I have lent him. I can give him 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, but unhappily I have not the ready money with me. When I obliged Lord Fairfax with the 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I obtained a loan in Liverpool, and gave securities to the value of 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—both Weston and Lord Fairfax were there at that time—I asked him the name of the banker, and he told me he was a private money lender named Robond—Lord Fairfax then said "You must have the 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; go with me to Liverpool to pay back the 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Robond, and release the bonds"—he said they were Canadian railway bonds—I said "I have not a banker who will give me 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I am not sure that they will find money on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188802270061"/>
               <p>your Bonds"—he said "Never mind, I will go and see my mother to-morrow morning, and will ask her to lend me a cheque for 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for one day, and I will then go to Liverpool and repay the 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Robond, and release the bonds and bring them to you, but you must arrange with your banker to give me the money when I come, that I may give back the amount to my mother; I give you my word of honour that the bonds will be to-morrow in London"—Weston was present—this description of the security was written on January 23rd, the same day as the conversation. (<hi rend="italic">Headed Thompson's Hotel</hi>, 31, <hi rend="italic">Dover Street, and stating that the security was</hi> 35,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">worth of Hamilton and North-Western</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st mortgage</hi> 6 <hi rend="italic">per cent, bonds, value about</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">per cent, above par, very difficult to buy in the market, and a very first-class investment, and that the coupons could be cut off and paid as part interest.</hi>) M. Groult and Mr. Weston, as well as myself, were present when Mr. Fairfax wrote that—on 25th January Weston took me to Mr. Alexander Brown, a banker, of Lombard Street—he had said nothing to me before that about taking me to him—I gave that document to Mr. Brown, and said "There is 35,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of these bonds, will you make a loan of 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them?"—he said he was ready to make the loan, but he would require some more particulars, and he must take the advice of his solicitor, Mr. Michael Abrahams, and told us to call again—we called again on the 28th—on the 25th a breakfast party was given, that was after we had seen Mr. Brown and he was willing to carry out the transaction—Mr. Weston invited me to the Alexandra Hotel, Hyde Park; I went there by myself; the breakfast was between I and 2—Lord Fairfax, Robond, Vernon, the Major, and Weston were there—Robond is Johnson—I said to Lord Fairfax "Who is this?" and he said "He is the partner of Robond," he made the advance half and half—that was the first time I had seen Robond—there were six of us altogether—I sat between Lord Fairfax and Weston, and Robond sat between Vernon and the Major—the first person I saw there was Lord Fairfax, and he said "This is Mr. Robond, I have brought him from Liverpool because I have not got the cheque of my mother; I promised to bring you the bonds, and I have brought you the man with the bonds"—after breakfast the Major produced this florid pocket book, and a few minutes later Vernon gave me a 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coupon like this one, No. 1954, and said "This is one of the coupons of the bond which is now in Robonds hands"—I desired to show this to Mr. Brown, and said to Watson "I should like to have this coupon, will you ask Vernon to let me have it? or I will pay 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it if necessary"—Vernon said "Don't offend me"—after breakfast there was a business discussion in the smoking room between Vernon and Robond and the Major, and I heard Robond say to the Major "You must not do this business"—when I heard that I said to Lord Fairfax "I believe this business will be dropped"—he said "I have engaged you my word of honour, and I will show you that I can keep it," and he said to Vernon "You know I am Lord Fairfax; will you, yes or no, lend the Bonds?"—Vernon said "Yes"—Lord Fairfax then said to him "Will you sign this paper?"—he said "I will"—that was a paper which had been prepared by Weston—Vernon then signed it, but it has been destroyed, and a fresh copy was made. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>. "Mr. J. Robond, 4, Holland Park. Sir,—Please deliver to Mr. G. Gall the 350 Bonds first mortgage Hamilton and North<lb/>Western</p>

That was all that took place at the lunch of any importance—next day I again saw Mr. Brown; M. Groult and Mr. Weston were with me—Mr. Brown then made an appointment for next day to meet him at his solicitor's, Mr. Michael Abrahams—he said the bonds were first-class security, he had not seen them then, he had only had a description of them—on the 28th I called again on Mr. Abrahams; Mr. Brown and M.

(<hi rend="italic">This was the same as the previous one, but dated</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">Holland Park Terrace.</hi>) I saw it written—he told me to go upstairs and put that document which Mr. Abrahams had drawn up into my desk, as it was a very valuable document—I did so—when I came back I saw M. Groult, Weston, Fairfax, and Vernon, looking at a document on the middle of the table; it was one of these Bonds for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the Hamilton and North Western Railway—I looked at it and asked him if he would give it me to show to the hanker, as it would make the business more simple<lb/>he said to Weston "I confide you this Bond of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till 6 o'clock to<lb/>morrow evening, you give me your word of honour that you will bring it back to the Alexandra Hotel by 6 o'clock, because it was confided to me by Robond, being an integral part of the 350 Bonds which he has"—I said to Vernon "Can you give me the numbers of the 350 Bonds, and tell me how you got them, by purchase on the Stock Exchange, or by concession?"—he said "I have a list of the numbers in the hands of Robond, I don't care about taking such trouble when I make a favour to a friend; you will take the numbers when you pay the money"—on that Lord Fairfax became very passionate, and said "Do you believe we are thieves? a banker has no right to ask such questions of a gentleman when he brings him bonds to bearer"—his anger was so great that Weston said "You had better leave the room," and he put me out—Weston, Fairfax, and Vernon then left the house, Weston taking the bond with him—he came back again that night about 12 o'clock, and showed me the bond again, and we arranged to go to Mr. Brown 's office</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">Holland Park Terrace, Holland Park, W., stating that he had received instructions from Vernon to take the securities to the London and Westminster Bank, for the payment of hit mortgage on them, namely</hi>, 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and that they would be at the witness's disposal at the Westbourne Grove branch on payment of</hi> 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">for which he would bring a receipt.

("4, <hi rend="italic">Holland Park Terrace," and signed</hi>" <hi rend="italic">G. Robond" and stating to the witness that he would not risk coming to the City with the bonds, and asking them to come to the Westbourne Grove branch of the London and Westminster Bank, as it was near his house, and that if that would not suit they could have the bonds at his house from</hi> 10 to 4 <hi rend="italic">next day.</hi>) I don't know whose writing that is, I believed at that time it was from Robond—I showed it to Mr. Brown and he wrote this letter in my presence, which I gave to Weston that he might show it to the money-lender Robond. ("<hi rend="italic">Dear Sir,—I will meet you to-morrow at the branch office at</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">o'clock, and will be prepared to take up the</hi> 350 <hi rend="italic">bonds for</hi> 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Alexander Brown."</hi>) This document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was written by Lord Fairfax when I asked Robond's address, and he said "4, Holland Park Terrace, Holland Park;" he also wrote Vernon's address, "Keeble Towers, Bournemouth, and of Montreal, Washington Hall"—that same evening, between 8 and 9, Weston and Fairfax came to see me at my hotel, Dover Street, and Weston said "I am very happy to be so agreeable to you, your business will be ready to-morrow, but I cannot remain in London, I have to go to Paris to-morrow morning; I shall be staying at the Grand Hotel, and I hope to see you there if I can be agreeable to you"—he had dined with me and M. Groult several times—on this occasion he was in evening dress—on the following day Weston came to see me about 12 o'clock, I was in my bedroom—he said he would call for me at 1 o'clock to go to the London and Westminster Bank, and asked mo to have a brougham ready for him; he also said he would bring Vernon and Robond to the bank at 2 o'clock, and that I was</p>

Groult and took a cab and went to the bank—I there saw Mr. Brown, Mr. Michael Abrahams, and Mr. Cutbell, the representative of the railway—about 2. 20 I was outside with Mr. Brown and Weston came up—I said "Where is Robond and Vernon and the bonds?"—he said "He is too old to come with the bonds, but Vernon will be here in five minutes"—I did not ask him why he had not called for me—shortly afterwards a Hansom's cab drove up with Lord Fairfax in it with this black box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) close to the door—I was going to take it out, but he said "Don't touch my property, "making an effort as if there was a good deal in the box, and went into the bank, which is divided into three parts—I was the last to go into the bank, and when I was in the second room Fairfax was in the third—he said "My name is Fairchild, I bring you the bonds"—he did not see me behind him—Mr. Abrahams then said "Open the box, and we will begin our transaction;" he opened his overcoat, put his hand in his pocket and said "Oh, I have forgotten the keys, I will go and fetch them and be back in five minutes"—I said to Mr. Abrahams "It is very strange his introducing himself as Fairchild when I know him as Fairfax"—he had still his black moustache and black hair—Mr. Abrahams said "You can leave the box here, there is no danger to the property"—he said "No, I don't want to leave the box here, it is confided property, I will take it with me"—he took the box, and with two walks he was in the second part of the bank, where Mr. Cuthell stopped him and said "What have you in this box?"—he said "That is not your business," and put it on the table and said "I defy you to open the box"—I said "Break open the box," and at that time a number of police-officers came in—I did not know they were there—Weston remained where he was—some police officers then went outside and brought in Robond, the Major, and Hill, who 1 had never seen before—when the Major came in 1 said "That is the Major who had the nice pocket-book, and that is Robond, the money-lender from Liverpool"—they were then searched—Weston told me that M. Groult said to him that morning "When the business is ready I ask permission to make a diamond present for your lady, and I am at your disposition for any amount you may ask me," and he said he would offer me 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for carrying out the matter; but M. Groult never said so to me—he also said "You tell him I ask for a loan of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for myself," and I said that I would mention it to M. Groult.</p>

               <p>here—in France you cannot borrow on a future fortune—there were no family reasons why he could not do that I know of—I had not offered it to anybody in Paris, but I had tried to borrow in two other places, and I succeeded in finding somebody to lend M. Groult 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on condition that he would give them an English guarantee that he would pay the interest every year—I had no document here, but M. Groult had—I knew Weston as moving in good society in Paris; I saw him continually between 13th January and 1st February, and dined and lunched and went to the theatre, M. Groult paid for everything—the first and only time I saw Johnson was at the breakfast, and then he did not speak to me—I was much influenced by the fact that he was spoken of as the Major, that made me more <hi rend="italic">confiant</hi>—I thought his wife or his daughter had made him the note case—I should not have parted with the Bonds upon that, but I saw he had much money there—the coupon was shown me by Vernon and Fairfax, Johnson was not a party to the conversation, he said nothing to me; M. Groult handed as security to Weston a lot of documents written by a notary, about eight million francs, being only a part of the fortune of his father and himself; they were copies of documents—I expected on February 1st that I was to nave 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had no document to part with in return for those documents—I have lost nothing in this matter except two months' time and my expenses—I have had nothing to do with this matter since, but I know that money was raised.</p>

Groult—after this business it was understood that Lord Fairfax would go with Weston to a solicitor for the security; the money was to be paid to me by Brown for M. Groult—I had no securities for that money—Fairfax was unknown to me till I came here, and Vernon too—I did not expect that 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was going to be given to me without security—Groult had the security—the clerk of the London and Westminster Bank was charged to bring the money there—I have seen the documents, they were shown to Weston at his house in Dover Street about 14th February, three days after I first met him; he had them in his possession eight days—I do not remember being asked at the police-court whether I had seen them—I have not said a word till to-day about Weston having them eight days, I was not asked—I did not say over and over again that the 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be advanced on the honour of M. Groult and myself, only of M. Groult—I don't know whether the documents are here, I have not seen them since they were at the police-court on February 14th—it is an exaggeration to say we had 40 bottles of champagne at one sitting, but it flowed freely—I never looked at the bottles—5 never drink myself—I only saw Daker once, that was on the 24th, when I saw the Major, he had no champagne, nor did he partake of any refreshment at M. Groult's expense—he had the break fast, but that was paid for by Fairfax—Weston said he would give me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "I will give you each 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if you will get me the loan, we are old friends"—no money has been raised yet, I have done nothing since this matter fell through—I stayed here for this business, and Groult went back to Paris on February 2nd, and I did not like to get the advance in his absence.</p>

               <p>that he had sufficient securities belonging to Fairfax, his old and good friend, and I, with my experience, thought that a reasonable thing; 1 have often seen it with 35,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and more—I did not tell Vernon who I was, it was not his business—M. Groult wanted 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am the son of a very rich man, I come from Poland, where M. Groult, senior, has castles and land; he makes tapioca—I did not mention that as a security to the person lending the money—M. Groult was at the police-court twice, but he was not put into the witness-box because there was no time, as I was in the witness-box two days—if I said before the Magistrate "M. Groult offered me a nice commission, I expected as much as possible, M. Groult offered me 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," that was a mistake—I am not quite current with the English language, I never learnt it—I certainly offered Weston half of my commission—as I had never talked about it with M. Groult, I did not tell Weston what I should have—Mr. Brown was to have 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Oppenheim was to advance the money—I have never seen him—Fairfax partook of all this hospitality, he was with me five or six times—his hair was always dark till he was locked up in prison—when he came to the bank his hair was as it was when I first saw him—his friends call him Lord Fairfax, I did not understand that that name was only used by his friends in joke—I looked at the Peerage, and found that Lord Fairfax was a Scotch nobleman, of about the same age, living in Virginia, and that his mother was a widow, and therefore I was sure that I had to do with Lord Fairfax—I never knew that the police had been communicated with, Mr. Abrahams did not trust me with that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. When I came to this country I had money with me, but I was desiring to win money—I am short of money now, but I am not in difficulties—I will not say what my income is—I did not ask Weston to borrow 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for M. Groult; I was asked by Weston—I said at the police-court "Idid tell Weston to ask Groult for 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Weston offered to give me half of all we should have—Weston said "If I get 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will give 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the secretary, and you are short of money and we are old friends, I will give you half of my part and you will give me the half of your commission"—Weston did not suggest to me that I should not continue to bargain with Mr. Brown because the commission Mr. Brown was asking was too large—I told him that Weston did say that to me—Weston said "He is an old friend of mine, and he is in a difficult position"—he asked me what he must do, and I said "I will ask M. Groult to give you the 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I will. swear that I had M. Groult's securities in my possession in London, I had the notarial act, that was a copy which proved that the house belonged to him—he had that with him, and I had it in my hands—the income of the estate is 160,000 or 170,000 francs a year, representing a capital of eight millions—I never tried in France to obtain a loan on it, as the law does not allow it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Lord Fairfax paid for the breakfast at the Alexandra Hotel with a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—Weston told me he wanted more money, as his wife was ill and he wanted to go to her—he said "You are not in a position to pay, you arrange for half and half; I will not ask M. Groult, but I will ask the secretary to give you the same; do you believe 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will be too much?"—I looked for something for myself, as I was acting as a business man, and I wanted to have part, and he said</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 79, Lombard Street, as a banker and bullion dealer—about 25th January Weston came with Mr. Gall and M. Groult—M. Gall showed me this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and I arranged to look into the matter, and if it was satisfactory to negotiate a loan of 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I understood that a loan of 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid off first—M. Groult's name was mentioned, and Gall said "He is a rich man"—I said "That is sufficient, I know the name; it is a transaction I can only carry out through my solicitor"—we spoke of my commission, but it was not definitely arranged—after they left I communicated with Mr. Oppen-heim—on 28th January I met M. Gall and M. Groult again at Mr. Abrahams' office, who referred to the London Directory, and drew up document "H, "which they took away with them—I saw them again on the Monday at my office, and Weston was with them—the document marked "I" was produced, a letter purporting to be from Mr. Robond—I believe that was delivered to me on the Monday—it purported to be signed by Robond, informing M. Gall that the Bonds would be at his disposal at the branch office of the London and Westminster Bank—he made an appointment to meet them next day at 2 o'clock at my office to complete the transaction, and then to meet me at the London and South Western Bank with the Bonds, so that the agent of the Company could examine them before the money passed—Weston was present when I said that—he had produced one Bond on the Monday—I looked at it, and sent it out to be examined—when Weston produced it he said. "This is one of the lot of 350 Bonds"—the report came back to me that the Bond was a genuine one, and if they were all like that it was a first<lb/>class security, and the loan would be concluded—I went to the hotel in the evening to examine the Bond again—Weston produced it, and I took the number of it, 2678—I saw Gall, Groult, Weston, and Mr. Campbell there—on Tuesday, the 31st, Gall called and said that it was impossible for Mr. Robond to come—I told him I could only do the business in the City, and he was to fetch Robond down—he said he would be there about 3 o'clock—he gave me at the hotel this letter, dated January 31st, in which Mr. Robond says that he is not going to risk going to the City with 35,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I arranged to meet him next day at the Westbourne Grove branch of the bank—I wrote this letter the same evening making the appointment to meet at the Westbourne Grove branch of the bank next day, and gave it to M. Gall, and wrote down who I desired to be present, Mr. Gall, Mr. Vernon, and Mr. Robond—that was written in Weston's presence—document "H" was attested in my office on Monday, the 30th, as it now appears—I had made arrangements for the advance of the money by Mr. Oppenheim at the London and Westminster Bank as his bankers—the advance was to be 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the whole of the Bonds—on the Wednesday I arrived at the Westbourne Grove branch at a quarter to 2 to complete the transaction, 2 o'clock being the time appointed—Mr. Abrahams went with me, and I knew that the detectives were going to be there—M. Gall was at the door when we arrived, but finding no one else had arrived I went out again and met Weston coming towards the bank—I said "You have come at last"—he said "Mr. Robond is not</p>

Gall give his evidence; his account is correct about Fairchild and the box, and daring any one to open it, when the officers broke it open and found it empty, Weston was there all the time—he was confronted with Fairchild, and said "You have got me into this mess," and <hi rend="italic">went for him</hi> with his fist—when the box was opened with the key, and nothing was inside, he amused himself with a little song, "What a surprise."</p>

I am manager of the London and Westminster Bank, Westbourne Grove branch—the staff consists of myself and two clerks—I recognise all the prisoners—I saw Weston first; he came to the bank by himself on the 1st about 25 minutes to 2—he was shown into my room—he said that M. Gall might be there two or three minutes after 2—I said "To whom have I the pleasure of speaking?"—I am not sure whether he gave his name or not, but he produced a letter written by Mr. Alexander Brown making the appointment—he said that he was a friend of M.

Gall comes?"—I looked at my watch and it was 20 minutes to 2—he said "No, I have not time; I want to get back; I want to go to the old gentleman who holds the Bonds, and bring him to the bank"—a messenger then came and told me that a gentleman in the outer office wanted to see me, and I said to Weston 'Just wait a minute; I shall not be long," and went to the outer office, leaving Weston in my room, and in a very short time he came out and took hold of the door leading out of the bank—I said "Won't you wait?"—he said "No, I must be off"—I said "Goodbye; we shall meet later on"—the <hi rend="italic">Cafe Royal</hi> is on the same side as the bank at the corner of Hereford Road going east; it can be seen from the corner—Fairchild was next shown into my room—I know him as Lord Fairfax—he had a black moustache then, very much brushed up at the corners, which gave him rather a fierce appearance—he had a black japanned tin box with him, and when he caught sight of Mr. Abrahams he started and said "My name is Fairchild; I have brought the Bonds"—Mr. Abrahams came forward and said "Produce them, and we will go on with the transaction"—he put his hand in this way and said "I have forgotten the keys; I will go back and fetch them"—I said "Won't you leave the box?"—he said "Oh, no, I won't leave the box; I shall not be more than five minutes or 10 minutes at the outside"—he left my room, and was confronted by Mr. Abrahams, who said "Well, what is the meaning of this? it is now considerably beyond the time appointed for meeting; I can't be waiting here all the afternoon; where are the Bonds? produce the Bonds, and we are ready to go on with the transaction"—he said "Who are you? you look like some bookmaker"—Mr. Cutbill, the agent, put the same question, "Where are the Bonds?" and beckoned to the detectives, who were just behind a screen—they came and made some remark to Fairchild, who said "The game is up"—I asked him to open the box—he said "That is my private property, and I defy any of you to open that box"—he was arrested, and then he produced the keys, though he had not left the premises—the box was taken up and shaken, and then opened—Fairchild was taken into my room, and one of the detectives said he wanted to have a private conversation with him, but we heard nothing except that he shouted out "Oh! what a surprise"—my room is not on the ground floor; there is a semi-basement—I saw some wrestling between one of the detectives and Fairchild, who had a stick—I saw the other prisoners brought in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 18, Belsize Crescent, Hampstead—in October I received a circular similar to this, with patterns similar to these, and with the name Hughes, Lockwood, and Co. printed on the front page—the same day that I received it the prisoner called and wanted to know if I wanted anything respecting the circular that had come by post that morning—I gave him an order for some goods, of which patterns were attached—he referred to the circular—he brought forward a parcel containing several pieces of cloth, Scotch costume tweeds, cloth that is used for ladies' dresses and jackets—he said there were 20 yards of stuff at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—these pieces of cloth were unrolled, they were double width—he said each piece was 20 yards—he said one of the chief inducements for my taking the dress was that he would send a tailor any day I liked to name, and that he would have it made up for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., including 12 dozen yards of braid, the lining and buttons—I said I thought that was exceedingly cheap; he said that it paid him to sell it by selling the quantity—he said nothing about Hughes and Lockwood—I purchased a piece of cloth and paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—my husband's sister was present, she purchased a similar piece of cloth for the same money; she was present during the whole of the conversation—she is away now in Lincolnshire—an appointment was made for a tailor to call on my sister on Saturday morning at 12 o'clock at another house where she was going to—directions for his calling were given to the prisoner—he said the goods I had ordered from the patterns would possibly be sent the following week; he would bring them himself—the tailor did not</p>

I am the wife of Dr. Thomas Walker, of 1, Park Villas, Willesden Park—on 4th January I received a circular like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) by post from Hughes, Lockwood, and Co., with patterns attached to it—the prisoner called on me on the 5th, and said he was the agent of Hughes, Lockwood, and Co., of Belfast—I had known the name—he said they were bankrupt and were selling their stock, and showed me some patterns of twill silks and pocket handkerchiefs—I then gave him an order for some of those things—he then opened a parcel, and said he had some remnants of Scotch tweed—I had noticed that the circular referred to pieces of ladies' Scotch tweed—he said there were 20 yards in the piece and it was double width—he then opened it, and I took hold of one end and he took hold of the other—my husband was present—he said he would send a tailor and have it made up if I liked, and he would bring him on the following week when he brought the other goods, and it would be made up for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I believed those statements, and asked my husband to pay him the money, and he paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the cloth—I did not see him again till he was in custody—I had no visit from the tailor, and the other things that I ordered were never sent—afterwards I measured the cloth, and found there were only 81/4 yards—I saw my husband write a letter, and saw it addressed, but I have not brought it here—I afterwards saw that same letter come through the dead letter office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have bought several dresses before this at shops—on those occasions I examined the quality of the material—I examined the quality in this case—I did not open it to see if it was doublewidth—I knew that 20 yards would make a dress, and I should think 20 yards of double width would be enough to make two dresses—I thought the quality was fairly good—I have employed tailors to make dresses several</p>

                  </hi>. I live at St. Mary's, Willesden Green, and am a widow—somewhere about 4th January I saw a printed circular like this one produced, with patterns attached to it—some person of the name of Bell had called first, and afterwards, on the 7th, I saw the prisoner—he said he was employed by an agent who lived in the London Road, who was a bankruptcy agent, and Hughes, Lockwood, and Co., being bankrupt, his employer was sending men about the country selling their bankrupt stook—he said Hughes, Lockwood, and Co. lived at Belfast, but they could not get rid of the things in Ireland—I said "Why did not the trade take them, they seem so cheap, cheaper than wholesale?"—he said "The Trades Protection Society stepped in and prevented it"—I then gave him an order for some goods, which were to be delivered on the following Saturday—just as he was going away he said that he had a few pieces of tweed for ladies' dresses, but he had not many left, they were of wonderful quality and very cheap, would I see them?—I said I did not want any dresses, but as he had the tweed there I would see them—he then went to the door and brought in some tweeds, and I unfortunately bought four pieces—I asked him how much there was in the piece, and he said 20 yards, sufficient to make a lady's dress and jacket—I asked him how much it would be a yard, and he said 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and they were worth a great deal more—I remarked that it did not strike me as very cheap, but I had confidence in what he said, that they could not be bought at the money—he said something about the Queen wearing dresses like them in the Highlands, and said they were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188802270080"/>
               <p>worth about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard, but I did not believe that, I only smiled at it—he then said that the firm had found a difficulty in getting rid of their dresses because their own dressmakers would not make them up, and to help them to get rid of this large stock they had employed a very good tailor, and for the extra sum of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. their own tailor would make up the dresses—the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was to include buttons and braid to trim, and I remarked that that was the way they got rid of their buttons and braid—he said he would bring the tailor when the goods were delivered on the following Saturday—I thoroughly believed those statements—I then proposed that the tweeds should be paid for when he came with the tailor, in fact I said "I cannot pay you now, I have not sufficient money by me"—he said "I will take your cheque"—I rather demurred taking one or two of the dresses, as one of my daughters was not in, but he said if she did not like it, or I did not want either of them, he would give me my money back next Saturday, or change it for another—I said "If that is the case, I will write you out a cheque," and he asked me to make it payable either to himself or to the firm—I then wrote out this cheque and gave it to him.

               <p>debating about buying it before I heard about the tailor, that was an extra inducement; without it I rather think I should have bought one or two pieces, but not so many; I was doubting about it before that, and should have bought a dress I think—I cannot say positively one way or the other—very likely the introduction of the tailor turned the balance and decided the purchase if you take it that way I will say yes, it does not signify—I wrote this address on the back of the receipt at his dictation—I did not ask him for a discount; he gave it; he told me he allowed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on each dress taken after one; I just did this to show I was paying the right sum—he told me with regard to my daughter if there was the least dissatisfaction about either of the dresses he would take back the dresses and pay back the money, or supply others—he gave his name as Graham, and said if I wrote there he should get the letter—I asked his address; he gave it me, and I wrote it down—I saw the cloth was double width when it was shown to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Carlton Road, Putney, and am a schoolmistress there—on 12th November I received a circular similar to this, with the name of Hughes and Lockwood printed on one side—on Tuesday, 15th November, the prisoner called, and said he was agent for Hughes and Lockwood, a bankrupt firm in Belfast, for the pupose of selling off their goods—I inspected the patterns, and gave him an order for some goods to which the patterns had reference—I asked him to give me a rough estimate of what the order I had given would come to, and he said "Between 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Shall I pay you now?" and he said "No, on delivery of the goods"—the goods were to be delivered that day week, the following Tuesday—then he produced some pieces of cloth, and asked me to allow him to show them to me—I said "No, I don't wish to see them; I never buy goods at the door"—he wished to show them—I said "You may show them, but I shall not buy them, because my dressmaker would not make it up unless I bought the stuff of her"—he said he employed a tailor to make up the dresses for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., including buttons and braid—he said he had sold 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of cloth, similar to what he was showing me, to Shoolbred's—I looked at the pieces, and bought four of them—I paid 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by cheque for the four—the tailor did not induce me to buy the dress, because I am not fond of cheap things, but he said the tailor would send home the things on the Saturday, and I wanted a dress quickly made, and that induced me to buy—he said there would be a dress and jacket out of each piece, and the tailor was to come on the Tuesday, and the dresses would be sent home on the following Saturday—the goods did not come for which I had given an order, nor did the tailor—I have not seen the defendant, except in Court, from 15th November until now—not having received the goods, I telegraphed to Hughes and Lockwood, Belfast—I did not know the address, as the prisoner took my circular away—I had a reply to that telegram—I received a receipt when I paid the money—I sent it to Scotland Yard, and afterwards destroyed it—it was signed "W. Graham," not "Hughes and Lockwoood"—I had two pieces of the cloth made up—he pressed two other pieces on me, saving perhaps a friend might like them—there</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have bought a tailor-made costume for a light summer tweed dress; I paid three guineas—it was the ordinary fashion of the day; that is the ordinary price—the quality of this stuff is pretty good, I should think: it was made up by a dressmaker, and a rather inefficient one, at the end of January—she took it home and cut it out—this silk ornamental part of the dress is not unusual—one of these dresses was for myself, and one for my sister, one which I thought would make up in the spring, and one for a present to any one—the quickness of gertin gthe dress was what induced me to buy—I have not sent the materials to a dressmaker except in this one instance—I did not feel the material or examine it; he held it out—I looked at it; I saw it was double width—I said before the Magistrate "My sister told me about Graham speaking of eight yards in each piece"—she was present—I could not recollect, but I asked her when I went home after the first examination, and she said something about eight yards.</p>

I should say that prior to my being appointed, I believe he offered his services in placing the shares of the Company; knowing a good deal about Transvaal matters, and feeling assured of our ultimate success, he felt justified in offering the investment to his clients and the public generally. The share list being closed, and no more shares to be obtained at par, I should certainly think we ought to stand it a small premium.

(<hi rend="italic">This was a prospectus of the mine, signed Burchell and Co.</hi>) I still believe that Perryman is not Burchell and Co.—I understand that Perryman had business transactions with Burchell and Co.—I never saw anybody named Burchell there—I called there once, and the office was shut.

All this I solemnly declare without any reserve whatever; and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true and by virtue of the provisions of the Statute"—that is not absolutely untrue—you are raising the question of the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was the excess value of the shares given to the vendor; in substance it is true, literally it is not true—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was put in as the assessed value of the shares, a nominal sum as consideration for the property; it was necessary according to Transvaal law—the purchase-money was all in shares, that made it necessary to insert some name—not one single penny-piece passed from me to Edgar Worthington—I knew that at the time I made this declaration—Mr. Perryman knew that I was going to make it—it was decided on at a Board meeting that I should make it—I did not put it in the book till 25th March because I did not pass the property till then—I did make that solemn declaration to defraud the Transvaal Government. (<hi rend="italic">The minute book was. here put in, which stated "A letter from Mr. C. Perryman, dated March</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, 1887, <hi rend="italic">was read and the secretary was instructed to reply that the Board are of opinion that the consideration for the purchase of the property should be stated as</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">if Mr. Worthington approves there of"</hi>) That letter is not here—I am not certain whether Mr. Perryman was present when that passed—we bought the property for 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in shares only, and until the property was worked it could not be said to be worth 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling—if we had put" shares" they would have charged duty on 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling—after making inquiries I was advised by a solicitor, Mr. Cusack Smith, to make that declaration; he is dead—I argued it with Mr. Battams and Mr. Cusack Smith—the advice I really took was that of a Transvaal gentleman—Mr. Battams is not here; his address is 71, East cheap—he is acting for me—he knew that I was going to make this declaration—there is a property in existence, but not one single stroke of work has been done on it by us or by anyone on our behalf—no one on behalf of the Company has been to the property yet—it is not true that it is impossible to find it—in the agreement, I vouch for; Mr. Suckling as being the person who is to go out—I received this letter from Mr. Suckling from Pretoria, dated June 1st, 1887, as secretary. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had been engaged upon the Company's title deeds; that none of the farms in the Waterberg district had been surveyed, or any beacons put up, consequently no one could point out any particular farm, and doubtless many farms would be found to overlap and have to be curtailed or cease to exist altogether; that the Govern<lb/>ment would shortly make a survey and map of the farms, and until this was made everything was in complete confusion and doubt; that no one would be allowed to claim his ground or commence mining operations, and, if they did, and it should turn out they were not the rightful owners of the property, they might be called upon to pay compensation; and that the correct number of the farm was</hi> 601, <hi rend="italic">and not the number appearing on the documents sent</hi>

S. Dry, Esq., mining engineer, who has examined the property—I have seen that report; it is in the possession of John Vernon and Co., our solicitors—I have not made inquiries in order to see whether such a person as C. S. Dry exists—I have read the defendant's affidavit, to which is attached a letter from Pretoria, dated August 26th, stating that no such farm as Poort was registered in the Government books, that no such farm existed, that inquiries had been made about Mr. Dry, but no such person was known, nor was Mr. H. Townsend, the gentleman who was said to have made the assay—they are all wrong about the Poort farm, because it has been found, and we have got the title deeds—Mr. Suckling is not here, it is six or seven weeks since I saw him—he has not seen the property—I do not know who Ross and Pomeroy are exactly, I think they are a connection of Mr. Perryman's—"The Mining Trust Register, Ross and Pomeroy managers, stockbrokers, Tower Chambers, Moorgate Street"; upon my oath I do not know that Perryman conducts his business there—I have been to his chambers and seen him there, but not frequently—there is business done there I believe; I have seen two men clerks writing letters—Ross and Pomeroy are not on the Stock Exchange, they are outside brokers—Burchell and Co. had nothing to do with the Company; they had something to do with its formation—Mr. Perryman acted as the vendor's agent—it is not known how mueh Edgar Worthington gave for this farm; I think the deeds will show—I do not recollect a document attached to my affidavit, because it was in Dutch—it appears that in October, 1886, Burchell <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Perryman is writing these letters; the prospectus is issued in that month; and yet it was not until May 5th, 1887, many months afterwards, that Worthington acquired any title—that agreement is not necessarily fraudulent—the agreement of December 7th stated that the farm consisted of 6,000 acres, and that the purchase-money should be 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe that to be a true agreement—you must remember that the property was a long way off—I believe the title deeds were given prior to October, 1887, and you must accept the explanation of the distance from England, I cannot help it—sometimes two ounces of gold per ton does not pay, but in many places a trifle under one ounce will pay well in working a gold mine—this says "The vendor has not sufficient capital to work it up for himself," that was in December, 1886—I was not cognisant of this circular being issued—I did not become acquainted with the Company till January last year, but after that I knew of it—we have not paid a penny piece dividend yet, the Company has not commenced working—Mr. Suckling is going out again this month—Burchell and Co. owe us l,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you say that is Perryman—they subscribed for 2,000 shares and paid 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as deposit by cheques; Mr. Perryman paid them, not in his own name—the cheques were paid to him first by the Company, and he returned them to the Company—the Company found the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Mr. Perryman, and Mr. Perryman, as Burchell and Co., handed</p>

               <p>that sum back to the Company as deposit-money on the application for 2,000 shares—beyond that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Burchell and Co. have not paid anything at present—we have attempted to get it, but unsuccessfully—I called there once for it, and I have written to them, I think I heard from them once; I do not recollect whether it was in Perryman's handwriting—when I made the declaration at the Mansion House I did not see Mr. Worthington; I have never seen him; I have seen the declaration which he made, in which he states that he sold the property on March 23rd, 1887, to Mr. Fagge; 23rd March is the day I gave up the vendor's shares to his agent, Mr. Perryman—I always looked on Perryman as the vendor's agent—I do not know that Perryman is Worthington; I should say not—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not Perryman Worthington, Seymour, Burchell, Craven, Morris Stuart, Ross, and Pomeroy?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Craven was in opposition to Mr. Perryman—I do not believe that Perryman found the money for directors to qualify for their shares—Mr. George Lewis stated that Mr. Perryman found the necessary money for each of the directors to qualify as directors; Mr. Perryman denied it—he showed himself at Bow Street—how should I know whether he shows himself to-day; I do not think there is any necessity.</p>

Vernon and Co. recovered from the defendant—it has not yet reached the coffers of the Company, nor what was paid to defend the case in the first—it put the Company to a great deal of expense in defending the action brought by the prisoner—the amount of unpaid calls is 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if it had not been for the attempt to wreck the Company we should have had some of that before this—Ross and Pomeroy are outside brokers—it does not follow because stockbrokers apply for shares that therefore they are for themselves—I am still secretary of the Company and a shareholder as well—my opinion is that the Company undoubtedly has a property, and I believe it is a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> concern; if I did not, I should have resigned months ago—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid by Burchell and Co. reached in cash the pockets of the Company—the Company owed the money to Mr. Perryman, it was part of expenses and things, and he handed it to the Company back again on account of Burchell and Co.; they have not paid the balance of their calls, partly owing to these</p>

On 17th February, about 11. 15, I was on duty with Apps in Catherine Grove, Greenwich, and saw Shorey standing with his back to a gateway leading to a garden—I said "Halloa, Harry, what are you doing here?"—he said "I have got a bad hand"—I said "You had better get away home"—he said "I want to ease myself"—I then left him and turned sharp round the corner of Devonshire Road, and walked as if I was going to Greenwich Road—I then crossed the road, went through a gate, and hid myself behind a hedge, where I could still see him—he stood there as if he was watching the house from the front—he did not do what he said—I hardly lost sight of him—I had watched him 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour when Apps touched me, and I turned my head, and saw Andrews partly concealed behind a laurel in the garden we were in—I took hold of him—he said "Don't hurt me"—Shorey could not hear that—Shine came up and took Andrews—Shorey ran down Catherine Grove; I directed Apps to follow him—I charged them at the station with loitering, and having housebreaking implements, with intent to commit a felony—Shorey said "It is a hard thing any one cannot go round there to ease themselves; I know nothing about it"—a piece of cord and a knife were found on Shorey.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the prisoner's service as nurse—I entered her service on 28th October last; I knew her by the name of Wesley—there were four children living with her; she was lodging at Mrs. Benbow's at 11, Lower Road, Richmond; she had three rooms, two on the first floor and one above—Samuel, the eldest, and Dorothy, the youngest, slept in the prisoner's bedroom on the first floor; the other two, Harold and Marie, slept upstairs in my bedroom—on Sunday evening, 4th December, the children were put to bed in the ordinary way—during that evening Mrs. Benbow had an interview with the prisoner; I was present at the time—after Mrs. Benbow left the room the prisoner had some conversation with me; she asked me what it was that had been said about her, and said if I did not tell her she would ask Mrs. Benbow; she said that she was not getting her full value for her money; she did not think of stopping there when Mrs. Benbow spoke as if she had not the means of paying her—she said she thought of leaving on Monday, but she did not say so definitely—this conversation took place in the dining-room—she said that Mrs. Benbow had spoken to her as if she had no money, and she was very much worried about it—that was in the bedroom—we went to bed about 12. 30—she said rather than leave the children to face the world, or battle with the world alone, she would put them all out of the way, and herself too, and she asked me if I thought it wrong—I said of course it was, or something similar to that—I tried to soothe her—this was between 12 and half-past—there was no further conservation just then that I remember—after that I went up to bed—while there I heard the child Marie coughing, and being sick and retching—the prisoner came up and took Marie down</p>

               <p>with her—I saw the child was sick—she continued retching—she was sick in the utensil in the prisoner's bedroom, and on a handkerchief in my bedroom—the vomit in the utensil was kept and given to the police—it was put into No. 6 room, I believe by Mr. or Mrs. Benbow—I gave it to Bush, the police-officer—i had put in the bathroom—after Marie had been sick downstairs I took her upstairs to my bedroom—again, and soon after I went to bed—after I had been in bed I heard a noise, and went downstairs and asked prisoner if she wanted me—I asked her where she was going on Monday—she said "Oh, I shall go away from here; I shall go to some friends," or "I shall find some friends"—I don't recollect the exact words—she was laughing and joking—I wanted her to get into bed, and not to worry about anything, and said I would come down and see that she was all right—she said she would lock me out—she ran up to kiss the children, and I slipped the key out and hid it, and I ran up behind her, she opened the door and stood straight up in the doorway—I asked if she wanted me—she said "No"—about 7o'clock in the morning little Harold woke me up—he was sick—I got up between 7 and 8 o'clock—I took Marie down to the prisoner, and left her there—I got some coffee, which I took to her room—that was about half-past 8 o'clock—the prisoner was then in bed, and Samuel with her; Dorothy was in her crib, standing up awake, and apparently well—Samuel was asleep—I touched him and woke him, but I could not wake the prisoner—I then went down and spoke to Mrs. Benbow; after that the doctor was send for—after the doctor had seen her I had a conversation with the prisoner, between 11 and 12 o'clock—she asked me how the children were—I said they were all very well—she said she had taken something; this was in the doctor's presence—he asked her how much she had taken—I think she said she had taken about half, she had given some to the children and taken some herself; either half the quantity or half the bottle full; 1 am not sure—I had seen the bottle previous to this—it was kept on her mantelpiece; it was a little blue bottle; a little dark bottle—I think she had had it in her possession about a month; I fancied it looked a little darker than this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I don't remember morning, somewhere in the bedroom—I think the doctor had it at the time—this was the bottle he had, as far as I recollect—I noticed a stain on Dorothy's nightdress—I saw a paper found in the prisoner's box—I pointed it out to Detective Bush—this is it; it is for writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "In the event of my death and I have to-night taken some laudanum, and given some to each of my darlings I could not leave them to face this cold world alone; they will be better off while as for me I have been driven mad by one thing and another.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was present on the Sunday when Mrs. Benbow had a conversation with the prisoner—I heard Mrs. Benbow tell her that she must go the next day—the prisoner seemed very worried that night—in the course of the morning she said her sorrows were more than she could bear—I went up with her to her bedroom about half-past 12—I think it must have been almost past half-past 12 when I actually went to bed—before I went to bed I went down to the door of her room—she was very pale; she looked very worried—I was joking with her because I thought she was looking worried—I did not notice that she tried very much to laugh and joke—I have said before "She was very pale; she was laughing and joking, and said that she would lock me out in a joke"—she was laughing and joking—she passed me in running upstairs to kiss the children, Marie and Harold—she went up twice to the children—when she took Marie down I went down with her—the words in my deposition are the exact ones, because it was fresh in my memory then—I can pledge my oath that 1 have given the words about the children and about the worry being more than she could bear—she said she had nothing but the children to live for—Marie was sick in a handkerchief as well as in the utensil; that handkerchief was not preserved—I mentioned the handkerchief before, when I was examined—I gave Marie a little sugar, about a spoonful of moist sugar—I fetched it and handed it to the prisoner, and she gave it to the child—I did not give any sugar to the other children, or see any given—the prisoner had been suffering from neuralgia—this bottle had been kept on her mantelpiece for about a month, down to the end of November—I had an impression that it was a dark blue bottle, and a little larger than this, but did not notice it very much—I could not say whether there was anything in it—Dorothy's night-dress was not handed to the police; it was one of the other children's—there was a stain on Dorothy's night<lb/>dress—that was not the dress that I saw handed to the police—Dorothy's night dress was marked in mistake with some of Mrs. Benbow's things—I believe the police had two night-shirts and a little night-dress—they had every night dress except Dorothy's; those worn by Samuel, Harold, and Marie. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw Marie being sick in a handkerchief and in the utensil upstairs—some of the vomit in the utensil was preserved, but not the handkerchief—Mrs. Randle wiped her mouth with it—the sugar was given to Marie when she was taken down into the prisoner's bedroom—this night-dress (<hi rend="italic">produced by Dr. Tidy</hi>) was worn by one of the boys, I cannot say which.</p>

I am the wife of John William Benbow, and live at 11, Lower Road, Richmond—on 8th October last the prisoner took two rooms on the first floor at a guinea and a half a week to board her and her four children—on 28th October the nurse came, and she then took another room at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—on 4th December she was indebted to me under 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the first bill delivered was for the first six months; that was for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—she had paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the second month; another 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due—on Sunday evening, 4th December, about 9 o'clock, I told the prisoner as she could not pay the account she must be prepared to leave the following morning; I could not afford to keep her longer—she replied "Then I know what to do"—I was with her about three-quarters of an hour—about 8 o'clock next morning Ethel Tritton spoke' to me—in consequence of what she said to me I immediately went up to the prisoner's bedroom—she looked strange, in a stupor—I put my hand on her shoulder and spoke to her, and tried to rouse her three times—it had no effect—Samuel was in bed with her; his eyes were open, but they were a little strange—I caused Dr. Chapman to be sent for; he came—I was in the room all the time he was there—he succeeded in arousing her—the doctor asked her what she had done, and where the bottle was—she said she had given each of the children a spoonful from the bottle, and had taken the remainder herself—she said she had placed the bottle in the washstand drawer—the doctor opened the drawer, and took it out, and placed it back again—I believe this to be the bottle.</p>
