No - the men were in bed when I went on board the vessel - I saw nobody to men<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030005"/>tion it to that night - we were walking about I believe from the time I went into the public-house till half-past ten o'clock - the prisoner asked me to go and see his girl, but I was not in company with any girl whatever - I gave no alarm - when I was knocked down I saw nobody near - I found that I had been knocked down I saw nobody near - I found that I had been robbed directly, but gave no alarm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If he was knocked down and robbed, would not he make an alarm? - it is a public road - is it feasible that he would tell nobody?</p>

On Saturday, the 21st of June, I was in the Strand - I went into the Swan public-house, in Hungerford-market, about four o'clock, or a little after - I know the prisoner - I never saw him before that time - he came in while I was there, and inquired if any gentleman had been there inquiring for any one, for he expected to meet his attorney there - that he had come out of the country on business for an uncle of his, and had a great deal of money to take, and in the course of conversation he said it was a hot afternoon, and he should take something to drink - he began to talk about the boats on the water, what wonderful things they were - then he said his uncle had given him a good bit of money, and what should he do if the attorney did not come - he said, "There is no fear of being robbed, is there?" for his lawyer had told him to keep nothing but gentlemen's company - he pulled out a green pocket-book with three or four notes, which I thought might be Bank of England notes, and he said as he was a stranger, if I would show him a little way about London he would be very much obliged to me - I said I was going towards the park - we went out together, and going towards Charing-cross by a pewterer's shop, he looked at that and asked if that was all silver, and when we got to the horse at Charing-cross he thought that a wonderful thing - we went into a public-house, and had a glass of gin, which he paid for - we walked up Bond-street and different streets - we then went to a public-house and had some gin and water - I do not know what street it was in, nor the house - it was a very large one, like an hotel - I said I wanted to make water, and asked the waiter for a convenient place - he said, "There is a water-closet up stairs" - the prisoner said he wanted to go likewise - I went up and came back - I had left the gin and water on the table - I drank it, and said, "This has a very nasty taste, I don't like it at all" - it was different before - he said, "Never mind, have some brandy and water after it" - I refused - we came out - went to the Duke of Wellington's statue in the Park, and there he tripped my heels up, and away he ran - he took my purse, which contained 3 sovereigns and a half, and the screw of a gun, and he took a 5s. piece which was loose - I gave an alarm of "Stop thief," immediately, and he was stopped by a young man named Garland - there was another man in our company at the Swan, but the prisoner came in there by himself - the other man went with us part of the way, and after having the gin and water I said, "I do not like that gentleman's company at all" - he said, "Well, he has no occasion to go any further, I will call him and pay him for his trouble" - he gave him what I supposed to be half a sovereign, and said, "Take this for your trouble between you - I don't wish people to walk about showing me things without paying them for their trouble" - the other one wanted me to give him 5s. and take the half-sovereign - I said I would have nothing to do with it - I wanted nothing for my trouble - before we got out of that street he came back with the half-sovereign to the prisoner, and said, "If this gentleman won't accept any thing for his trouble, I am sure I will not - take your money again" - he went with us all the way to <placeName id="t18340703-4-crimeloc23">Hyde-park</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did he do any thing then? A. It was done so quick, and after I had the gin and water I began to get so sleepy and so ill, I do not know whether the other touched me or not, but I do not think he did - when the prisoner tripped me up and took my money, I called, "Stop thief," and Garland took him - a gentleman rode up in his chaise and spoke to me - I got up and walked towards the prisoner as fast as I could, but I was so lame I could not walk fast, for he hurt me so in throwing me down I could not walk at all without a stick - as soon as I could walk, I went to the station-house, and gave him in charge - I had seen the policeman come up and take him from Garland, but I was not near him - Garland came back and led me to the police-station, because I could not walk - I did not go there with the prisoner - I saw nothing again except the crown-piece - the prisoner paid for the gin and water and different things which I had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did not you pay for any thing? A. No - I am a labourer - sometimes a gardener, and sometimes a bricklayer's labourer - I do what I can get to do - I had no employ that day - I had the day before - I had three sovereigns and a half in my purse, and a five-shilling-piece which was not in my purse - I left home about two o'clock - I fell in company with the prisoner about half-past four o'clock - I had been walking about from two o'clock till then after my business - I went after a young man who owed me some money - I could not find him, but I saw his brother, and he paid me- a young man went into the Swan with me, but I did not know him - I met him in the Strand - I did not know him before - he asked me to go with him, and I did - I had a pint of beer with him - I had had a pint of ale on the road in the course of the day - I had nothing before that - I drank nothing with my dinner - after the prisoner joined us, we went to look at the statue in Charing-cross - he asked my opinion, what I thought - I gave him the advice I should my own children, which was to take care of his property - I did not give him any invitation to come to see me - I do not exactly recollect every occurrence - I will swear I never asked him to visit me.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not ask him to come and dine with you the following Sunday? A. I did not - I said nothing to him about getting married, nor mention a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030006"/>daughter of mine to him - I have a daughter at Van Dieman's Land, and one in this country - she is a widow - I said nothing about her to the prisoner, to my knowledge - to the best of my knowledge, I mentioned no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You never suggested the probability of his marrying her if he produced a certain sum of money? A. I am quite certain I did not - I do not know that I mentioned my daughter to him at all - I was in Hyde-park when he tripped up my heels - I could not swear that the crown-piece which was found was mine - I had the money in my possession at Hungerford market - it was taken from me in the park - I took it out of my pocket in the public-house - I thought I was going to have something to eat, but I did not call for it, and put the purse back again - I pulled my purse out there, but not the five-shilling-piece - I would swear it was in my pocket - I pulled my purse out to see if I had 6d. in it, to pay for some bread and cheese, if I had it; and I had not one, and did not have any thing - I only took out my purse and opened it, but did not take out the three sovereigns and a half - I saw them there - it was a leather purse with two slides to it - I had saved the money out of my earnings, to pay my rent with it - I saved a little every week.</p>

            . I was in Hyde-park, coming into the park, about eight o'clock on Saturday evening, the 21st of June - I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner put his hands on the rails and jump over, near the Duke of Wellington's - he came running to the gates - I tried to stop him, and he hit me on the breast - I caught him by the collar of the coat - he said, "For God Almighty's sake, let me go; there is nothing the matter" - he said it was only a fellow wanted to give him a dusting - I told him I should not let him go; that I would help him if that was all - I looked about, and asked him what charge there was against him - he said there was no charge against him - he afterwards said a man there had got a charge against him - he pointed to a man standing against the railings of the Duke of Wellington's Achilles - I took him there to him - he said, "I have no charge against him; let him go" - I do not know who that man was - it was not Tiler - I saw Tiler coming across the green very slowly - he seemed very lame; and at that time a gentleman came up in a cabriolet, and told me to hold the prisoner till he saw a policeman - he said he had seen him rob a countryman - the prisoner heard him say that, but made no answer to it - he told me directly afterwards that he would give me a £20 note, if I would let him go - I said I should not let him go till I saw a policeman, and gave him in charge - the gentleman rode round to look for a policeman - I saw one coming, and the gentleman gave him in charge, and, as the prisoner came through the park gates, he threw down a green pocket-book, with flash notes in it- I saw that done - the policeman picked it up - the prisoner then walked very quietly down Vine-street, Piccadilly, till he came opposite the Duke of Devonshire's house - he there fell on the pavement, and threw down two £20 flash notes - the policeman picked those up - at the time he was on the pavement, he put something into his mouth - what it was I could not see - he was taken to the station-house, and searched - I went with him - I saw him searched, and a crown-piece and a shilling were found on him - Tiler was behind the prisoner, walking as near to us as he could - he was very lame - I did not go back to fetch him - he came in by himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. A little after eight - it was still light - there was not a person within the park gate but himself - not near the Duke of Wellington's house - I never saw the park so clear in my life - there were people higher up the park.</p>

            . I am a policeman. Garland gave the prisoner in charge to me - there was a gentleman in a gig who said in the prisoner's hearing, as he was close by, that that was the man who robbed the countryman - the gentleman is not here - I understood him to be Mr. Corbett, of No. 2, New Palace Yard - I called on him, but he stated that he knew no more about the case than Garland - I took him to the station-house - after walking about five yards with me he dropped this pocket-book, and a 5l. flash note - I picked them up directly - he struggled very violently - I told him it was no use, he might as well go quietly - and he did so till we came opposite the Duke of Devonshire's - he then made another attempt to get away, and tried to throw me- I seized him by the collar, and in struggling we both fell down together; he on his back and I on my side, and he dropped these two 20l. flash notes - I picked them up - I then heard somebody in the crowd call out, that he had put something in his mouth - I could not succeed in opening his mouth - I put my thumb in his mouth until it bled very much, and I thought it best then to take it out for fear of the consequences, but I could not open his mouth - I could not get it open - I took him to the station-house, searched him, and found a crown-piece, a shilling, and four duplicates - the crown-piece was loose - I saw Tiler almost as soon as I took the prisoner into custody - he distinctly said the prisoner was the man who robbed him - the prisoner must have heard him - I could not perceive whether he was intoxicated or agitated, but he seemed very ill at the time - I did not see any other person in particular near the rails of the Duke of Wellington's house - there were several people, but nobody to recognise in particular.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found no sovereign, nor half-sovereign? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is impossible that I could swallow three sovereigns and a half, a leather purse, and a gun-screw - at the station-house they found nothing on me - and before

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you able to say which wound was occasioned by the fall, or which by the staff? A. I should say the lower wound was produced by the staff, for if it was by a fall, the scalp would have been torn up - the wounds were about an inch and a half apart - it was not calculated to produce immediate danger - a fortnight may elapse before danger arises - I apprehended inflammation of the membrane of the brain - he is out of danger now, and quite well.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Which have the blood on them? A. These have blood sprinkled on them - it is six weeks ago, and does not show so fresh as it did at that time - I saw a man pick the keys up in the corner of a field - I never saw them in the prisoner's possession - I searched the field all over in the track I was informed he had gone - I did not go all over the field - the towels are marked "S.

            . I live in Stoke Newington - I am a gardener. On the 9th of May I was near Stoke Newington, going to master's business - I saw three men walking - one was an Italian boy, with a box under his arm; another young man was with him, with a basket on his shoulder; and the prisoner was walking with them - they were all three walking together, and before they got to the turnpike the Italian gave something to the one who had the basket, who put it in his pocket - and when they got to Newington-green they stopped - the prisoner walked on - I did not lose sight of him - the other two stopped and talked together - the Italian went towards Ball's-pond - when the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030008"/>soner got to the Coach and Horses lane, which is about ten yards further, the policeman went up to him, touched his coat pockets, and laid hold of his collar - they walked on a little way - he kicked the policeman three or four times - a lady called me in to Mrs. Cooper's house - I did not stop a minute with her, and when I came out the prisoner and the policeman were hustling - the policeman was on the ground, and the prisoner on the top of him - the servant called me in again, and when I came out the prisoner was gone - the prisoner ran away afterwards, and the policeman after him - I followed him - I did not see him throw any thing away while he ran along, but when we got to the corner he was heaving half bricks at the policeman - I observed him run into the field, and the policeman caught him - I caught hold of his collar - he threw a night-cap out of his pocket, which I gave to the policeman Breakwell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What kind of box had the Italian? A. A mahogany box strapped round him - I did not see what he gave to the prisoner - it was something small - nothing like these towels - I saw the first attack - the prisoner kicked the policeman - when the policeman went up to him he touched his breeches pocket, and then caught hold of his collar - he said something to him which I could not hear - then they began to hustle - the prisoner kicked the policeman three or four times - I did not see them fall, as I went inside the lady's house - I gave the policeman the night-cap in the field, directly he pulled it out of his pocket - he ran after the prisoner immediately he ran away, that instant - he threw the night-cap away after he was apprehended.</p>

            . I am servant to Major William Bellingham Swan. On the 9th of May, one James told me something, in consequence of which I looked about and missed a salt spoon, and a dozen things just come from the mangle - there were eight towels, a petticoat, a night-cap, an apron, and a calico cover - I had seen them safe - they were brought in at twelve o'clock - I saw them between that time and four - James gave me the information about half-past four - the house was entered through the kitchen window - this night-cap was taken away, and the towels - these bloody towels were taken away - they are all part of the mangling things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know the night-cap? A. In consequence of the two holes in it - there are two more of the same sort at home, and one of them is worn - I noticed these two holes when I washed them - I could have sworn to it if I had seen it in the East Indies - there is no other mark on it - I could have sworn to it as well there as here.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If your master was in the East Indies you would have sworn to it? A. Yes - I missed the night-cap at the same time as I missed the towels.</p>

            , of Newington-green. On Friday evening, the 9th of May, I was at the window of the house sitting at work, to the best of my recollection - my notice was attracted by hearing the words, "You must go with me" - the prisoner refused - I saw it was the policeman and the prisoner - the policeman collared him, and that action was almost instantly returned by a blow, and I believe in the face - the prisoner struck the blow in the policeman's face - he threw the policeman on the ground, and kicked him two or three times when rising - the policeman drew his staff, and it was almost instantly wrenched from his hand by the prisoner - he was thrown to the ground against a stone, and most brutally beaten with the staff over his head, two or three times while he was on the ground - the policeman called"Murder" twice - I was so terrified I had not power to speak or move - I did not see any blood at that time, but I saw the policeman wiping his face, as if wiping blood from it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear the whole of the conversation between the prisoner and the policeman? A. I only heard what I have said - I did not hear the policeman charge him with felony - I heard an altercation, and heard the policeman say, "You must go with me" - I saw the policeman fall - he fell in the road, which was stony - they are paving stones - the stone he fell against was a stone fixed against a wall - he fell against that - I cannot say that it was with any particular violence - it was owing to the prisoner's violence that he fell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 9th of May, I was coming from my sister's to take tea, and from there went to the New River to bathe - coming from there the policeman stopped me, and asked me what I had - I said, "Nothing"- he said he would take me to the station-house - I refused going - he drew his staff, and struck me across the eye, and then across the back of the head - we stumbled and fell down - I ran away - he called "Stop thief" - I stopped and asked where he was going to take me - he said to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, but you say two men pinned Vickers against the shutters? A. Yes; but when they saw they were watched, the money dropped on the pavement, and one ran away, saying to the other, "Do not be a b-fool" - they were both pinning the prosecutor against the shutters - the other was brought back, who I believe to be the prisoner.</p>

On the night of Sunday, the 1st of June, I was in Brick-lane, coming from the Black Swan, Brown's-lane - I had been to two public-houses, and had something to drink - I was rather drunk; but I knew what I was about - on going down Brick-lane, between twelve and one o'clock, when I got to the corner of Spicer-street, I saw a man cross over from the other side of the way - he came up to me and struck me on my two hands - that was not the prisoner; it was the man who is gone away - I know him perfectly well by sight, but I have not seen him since - I should know him, if I saw him - the same man then struck me on my cheek-bone, near my eye - he then put his two hands in my waistcoat pockets - he was alone then - I called for the police, when his hands were in my pockets - a shilling dropped from me when he left me - some persons came up during the time the shilling dropped, as he was leaving me - soon after that I saw policeman, H 53 - I told him I had been robbed; and picked up a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. You had only seen one man then? A. At the time I picked up the shilling, I saw several men running; but I saw nobody till I picked up the shilling - at the time the man put his hands in my pocket, there was only one man there - policeman H 53 conducted me back part of the way to the station-house, and the rest of the way I went by myself - I did not want assistance - he took me there as being the prosecutor - I had given him the shilling - I had 15s. in my right hand waistcoat pocket - I lost 10s. out of that sum - I had not put my hand in my pocket since I had received that money, which was a quarter past eight o'clock in the morning - I had 3s. paid me during the day, which I spent the greatest part of at a public-house, at the corner of Booth-street - that 3s. was in half-pence, and in my coat pocket - I had felt my money in my waistcoat pocket three quarters of an hour before I was robbed - I was at the bar of the Black Swan - I put my hand in my pocket, and heard the silver rattle - when I went to the station house, they asked if the prisoner was the man who robbed me - I said no - I never saw him with my eyes till I saw him at the station-house - I did not see him at all at the time I was robbed- they asked me what I had been robbed of - I told them I did not know; there was some money in my waistcoat pocket - I desired one of the officers to put his hand in my waistcoat pocket - he found 4s. and one was picked up - 4s. was all that remained in my pocket - I waited about during the night to see if I could recognise the man who had robbed me - soon afterwards I thought I saw him on the chapel steps, in Church-street - he was along with two females - I followed him down behind, at a very great distance, till I got to the station-house - he was going on towards the station-house - I went into the station-house, when he had passed to some distance, and said I thought I had seen the man; but I had not been up to him to recognise him - two officers went out after him, but, when I looked him in the face, I found he was not the man - I had not seen his face before - I should know the man well if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were against the shutter, was there more than one person with you? A. No; not at first - when I took up the shilling, persons were round me - when I got up, I saw several persons round me - no person struck or pushed me, but the man who robbed me.</p>

            . I am a policeman. Between twelve and one o'clock on Sunday morning, the 1st of June, I was on duty near Brick-lane - I came to the corner of Hanbury's new brewery - I saw the prisoner at the bar, the prosecutor and another man standing by the baker's shop opposite - I saw Vickers with his back up against the shutters, and saw the prisoner in a struggle with him - both were struggling together as if wrestling - I heard money drop on the pavement, and saw the prisoner run away - the prosecutor called out, "Stop thief, police" - I followed him - the other man disappeared before the prisoner ran away - he went away fast - I heard money drop, but did not pick it up, for I followed the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the money fell on the pavement, was there one or two persons by the prosecutor? A. I saw a man standing just by - but just at the time the money dropped the prisoner ran off - he was struggling with the prosecutor just before - I saw another man close by, and he went off first - that man had disappeared before the money fell on the pavement - I pursued the prisoner, and took him in custody running - I am quite sure the prisoner was struggling with the prosecutor - the prosecutor cried"Stop thief" two or three times - I conveyed the prisoner back to where the robbery was committed, and the prosecutor said to me, "That is the man that robbed me" - in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030010"/>way to the station-house another man came up close to the prisoner - I saw them talk together, and saw the prisoner reach his hand to the other man as if he was giving him something - I turned round and attempted to catch both the men's hands - the other man fell back, and in a moment after he came forward and gave me a violent blow in the mouth - both he and the prisoner struck me at different times - my brother officer McGovern came up, and I took the prisoner to the station-house - I searched him, and found on him 1s., a 6d., and 2d. in his waistcoat pocket - on the Sunday evening the prosecutor came to me, and told me something about the prisoner's friend - Vickers was three parts drunk - when I brought back the prisoner to where the robbery was committed, the prosecutor said he was the man - the prisoner denied it.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I did not see the beginning of this - I heard the cry of police - I had noticed nothing before I heard the cry - I heard a noise, and when I came up I saw a crowd of people, and among the rest was the prosecutor - I came up to him - he told me he was robbed - I did not see Flany then - Vickers was almost drunk, just able to walk a little - he gave me a shilling which he said he had picked up, of what he was robbed of - I asked him what became of the robber - somebody said my brother officer was in pursuit, and presently afterwards I saw him come back with the prisoner - he was shown to the prosecutor, who said "That is one of them," and asked me to protect him to the station-house, as the prisoner was going there - he took hold of my arm going along - as we went along a little distance, my brother officer was before with the prisoner - I saw a struggle - the prisoner and another man were struggling with the officer - the prisoner struck the officer - I let go of the prosecutor's arm, and ran up and laid hold of the prisoner, who was struggling to get away - I secured him, and stopped behind close to watch him - he was taken to the station-house, and there the prosecutor said he was not the man who robbed him - in the mean time, while I went up to assist my brother officer, I left the prosecutor behind, and when I came back I found a great many people talking to him; whether they persuaded him to say so, I cannot tell</p>
               <p>JURY to FLANY. Q. From the time you heard the money jingle, did you lose sight of the prisoner? A. No; I was but five or six yards from him - I did not lose sight of him till I got him in custody - I did not lose sight of him till I caught him - I could not describe the other person - the man who ran away wore a long coat, and the prisoner had a jacket.</p>

On the 26th of May, about a quarter past nine o'clock, I went on business to Lincoln's Inn - I had been up stairs about half-past eight o'clock, and saw every thing in its place - there was a sheet there, and table-cloth - I had given six weeks' washing out that morning to the laundress, and was going to put sheets on my boy's bed - the sheets were on a line - there was a table-cloth on the back of a chair - when I left the room, I locked the door and left the key in it, expecting to go up again; but I went out, and returned about ten o'clock - a number of people were about the house - some people were standing at the door - I went into the shop, and there found the key which I had left in the door, was hanging on a nail in the shop - the prisoners had been taken to the station-house - I went up stairs with the key to my bed-room, on the first floor - the door was locked - I opened it with the key which had been hanging on the nail - I found nobody in the room - the sheet was quite gone, and the other things which had been on the back of the chair were down on the seat of the chair - I saw the beds had been disturbed, and, on turning them up, I saw a parcel of eight pick-lock keys, a phosphorus box, and matches; the cover of the phosphorus box had been shown to me down stairs - they do not belong to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you occupy the whole house? A. I rent the whole house, and let the second floor; and the other floor is a warehouse - nobody lives in it - I left the key in the lock - any body going to see Mrs. Robinson, who lodged with me, might turn the key and go in - I have found the sheet since.</p>

             - I found the front door open, and the shop-door also - I went in, and saw two men in the shop, looking at a book on the counter, and stooping down very low - I looked down to see who they were, and did not like their appearance - I turned out, and went up stairs, leaving them in the shop - I saw the prosecutor's boy standing at the end of the counter - he is not here - he was looking at the men, and appeared rather frightened - Dewick came to the house door with me, and stayed there till I turned out of the shop, and then I called him to go up stairs with me; and, when about the middle of the stairs, I saw the prisoner Bond going up the second flight of stairs - I took him afterwards - I went into the first floor room - the door was open - (this was just upon ten o'clock at night) - I saw the other prisoner Chambers standing on the floor facing me, very close to a large chest of drawers - I had a lantern with me - I turned the light into the room, and saw a sheet dropping from his left hand side, rather high - it fell on the floor - when I entered the room door, he made a rush at me to come out, under my left arm, but I pushed him back - he then turned to the window in front, and tried to lift it up - I caught hold of him, and he struggled with me on the floor - I forced him on the bed; but, before that, his hat fell off on the floor - I picked it up, and in it found a handkerchief and a black bag - I put him on the bed, called Dewick, and gave him into custody - I then turned out of the room, and met Bond and a woman on the stairs - I asked how he came to go up there - he said, "I went up to see this woman, she is an acquaintance of mine" - I took hold of him, and said to the woman, in his hearing, "Do you know any thing of this young man?" - she appeared frightened, and said, three or four times, "No, policeman, I know nothing of him, he had no business there" - I then turned him into the room; and, as I was going into the room, Dewick said to me, "This young man, whom I have got here, is putting something into the bed" - I looked, and saw Chambers' right hand thrust between two beds - his left hand was also between the beds - we took both the prisoners to the station-house, with the sheet, and searched him - I found a skeleton-key on Chambers - we returned back, searched between the beds, and found a phosphorus box and matches, and forty-eight skeleton keys - when we left the room, we pulled the door after us, and told the shop-boy to fasten it- when we came back, I found McLachlan there, and he opened the room door for me - we found this table-cloth on a chair, and this hankerchef, and an old table-cloth and waistcoat along with it - I brought them away with me- the handkerchief found in his hat is not claimed by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found none of the property on Chambers? A. No; nor on Bond - I found only one key on Chambers - when I first went up stairs, Chambers was in the room, standing by a chest of drawers, about a space from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you did not meet him, and he made way for you, and go in the room? A. Certainly not- he did not move before I entered the room - the door was open, and I saw him standing there, and Bond going up the second floor stairs, where a Mrs. Robinson lodges - Bond told me that he was going to see Mrs. Robinson, who appeared very much frightened when I spoke to her.</p>
               <p>HENRY DEWICK. I accompanied McCarthy to the prosecutor's house - I saw Chambers in the bed-room, on the first floor, and Bond was proceeding up the second flight of stairs - I went with the constable, and assisted in securing Chambers, who I found in the room - I saw him drop the sheet, which fell on the ground - he attempted to get out of the room, and the policeman stopped him - he then pushed towards the window to attempt to get out - McCarthy pulled him towards the bed, and gave him into my custody, while he went and took Bond - I saw Chambers shuffling something under the bed, but I did not know what it was at the time - after he was taken to the station-house, we searched under the bed, at the part where I saw him put something, and there were about forty-eight skeleton keys - I saw a table-cloth and other things lying on the seat of a chair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw him shuffling about, were your near him? A. Close by him - I had hold of him - the policeman had left him at that time - I called out that he was secreting something under the bed - he could have secreted those keys without my hearing them jingle, because they were tied up.</p>
               <p>MR. McLACHLAN re-examined. All the things produced are mine - the sheet was on the line when I left the room - I know nothing of the skeleton keys - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030012"/>have marks on some of them - they were on the back of the chair.</p>
               <p>Chambers' Defence. This young man asked me to accompany him to No. 19, Ship-yard, to a shoemaker's who lived there - I said I would - we were going up stairs - I asked which room he lived in - he said, "Come on up stairs" - he went on up stairs - and in a few minutes afterwards this man came up, and dragged me into the room, knocking me down on the bed with his staff - the key that was found on me belongs to the room I live in - I never had the skeleton keys in my possession.</p>
               <p>Bond's Defence. I went to No. 19, Ship-yard, to see

             - I asked this man to come with me - he said he would - when I went up to Mrs. Robinson, she said how was I - I said very well - she asked what I wanted - I said "I have come to ask Mr. Robinson whether he would give me a job" - she said he was not at home, I must come again in about an hour - we were coming down stairs - I heard a noise in the court, and the policeman met Chambers turning the corner of the stairs, he up with his staff, knocked him down, and drove him into the room - I ran up stairs to Mrs. Robinson - she came down, and said she did not know any thing of me.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the 19th of June I was coming down the middle of the Portland-road - I saw a man who has escaped beckon, and Black, who was at the corner of Devonshire-street, crossed from one side to the other, and looked into a cabinet-maker's shop - I followed the other man up Carburton-street - Black turned back and went up Portland-road - I turned back and met the two prisoners - when they saw me they turned short back, round by a dead wall, out of my sight - I ran to the top, and Palmer informed me that they were gone up Osnaburgh-street - I pursued to Frederick-street, and somebody had stopped them there - I took hold of Black - he had his hat doubled up in his arm, with part of the plate in it - I took it from him, and delivered it to Dringle - when I collared Robinson I asked what was under his arm - he said,"What is that to you?" he took it from under his arm, and threw it up in the middle of the street - it was a paper parcel - it was picked up and put into the hat with the other - Dringle walked with me to the station-house, and there I searched Black - he put his hand in his pocket, pulled out some more plate, and threw it on the table with the rest - I produce it - I found a pair of scissors, a knife, and latch-key on Black, and a latch-key on Robinson.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE TODD re-examined. I have not the least doubt of these being master's property - I know them very well - they are not marked - I only know them by their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030013"/>general appearance - I have two spoons which were left in the kitchen, and they are the very same pattern and every thing - I know nothing of the scissors - here is a cheese knife, which I know by a scratch on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the policeman point out the scratch to you? A. I have washed it repeatedly and know it - I observed the scratch repeatedly before - I knew Robinson before - he used to come backwards and forwards to the house as a porter - his wife was servant there before me, I believe.</p>

               <p>Black's Defence. I have been the dupe of Robinson - he prevailed on me to join in the business, and in an unguarded moment I consented to his wishes - I was never accused of any thing in my life before - his offers to render me different services induced me to place confidence in him- I knew nothing of his intention, till two hours after he says the offence was committed - I trust the character I have always sustained will weigh in my favour - I do not deny participating in the offence, but I have been made the tool of Robinson.</p>
               <p>Robinson. Instead of my leading Black into it, he led me into it - as he speaks against me, I think it right to speak against him.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Whitechapel. On the 27th of May, I was near the west end of Lombard-street, at a quarter past nine o'clock - I saw the prisoner, as I was walking in front of the Mansion-house, with two others, all on a sudden make a start - I instantly followed them - I saw the prisoner take from the pocket of Mr. Bailey a handkerchief - I crossed over and tapped Bailey on the shoulder, and the prisoner ran away - I followed and collared him - he commenced a violent attack on me- gave me a blow in the right eye, and knocked me down - I got up, over took him, and laid hold of him - he knocked me down again - I got hold of him - he turned round and became more violent than before - I called "Murder," and brought a City officer to my assistance - I saw the handkerchief picked up, and am certain I saw the prisoner take that handkerchief from Bailey.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Have you any partner? A. I have not - I have a collecting clerk whose duty it is to receive money for me - I hired the prisoner as porter - it was in his employment to receive money where it was offered to him - he was not ordered to receive this money to my knowledge - it was his duty to pay it over to the clerk.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DUNCUM. I am clerk to Mr. Besemere. It was the prisoner's duty to pay over to me any money which he received - on the 26th of June, I asked him if Mr. or 
               <persName id="t18340703-13-person196">Mrs. Gibbon</persName>
             had paid him any money on taking a parcel to their house - he said, "No; they did not pay me, as there was some demur respecting discount" - I said, "How is it you gave a receipt and took the right discount?" - he said,"I dare say if I go up there I shall be able to make it right" - I said, "Mr. Gibbon says, as he has a receipt from you, he will not pay it again - you say it is not paid - I must mention that to Mr. Besemere, and we shall both have to go up there" - on my leaving the warehouse to tell Mr. Besemere, he called me back and acknowledged having received it, and bought some clothes with it, and he tendered me some money on account of it - I do not know how much it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot say it was not the full amount? A. I cannot - this occurred on Saturday, and my attention was drawn to it on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. On previous occasions had not as much time elapsed between his receiving and paying it? A. No - I always considered he paid it the moment he brought it back - he might have come home after eleven o'clock, after I retired to rest, and given me the money next morning - he offered to pay me the money in less than five minutes of his denying having received it - I cannot be mistaken with regard to the circumstance - he said there was some demur about discount, and on that account they did not pay him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is that the only paper relating to the transaction which you have? A. There was another bill which was added to it - an amount of goods bought on the 26th of May - I had had a transaction with him a month before, and that was not paid for - this payment is for the whole amount.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had no intention of keeping the money - he asked if I had it - I just concealed it for a moment, because there were so many people about, but as soon as I saw him alone I acknowledged it, and offered him the whole amount.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did you mark these yourself? A. I did on the 18th of June - he had been about nine months in my employ - I had no character with him - he came to me merely to make out a few straggling accounts, and to collect money for me, for which I used to give him 7s. a week, exclusive of his breakfast and dinner, and other things I made him a present of - he was to stop as long as he liked, and when he could better himself, he was to leave - I only employed him because he had nothing to do - I had a brother-in-law before he came to me, and his employment was to market for me, and he partly kept my books - he was in my employ when the prisoner came - his duty did not devolve on the prisoner when he left - occasionally it did, but I generally posted the books myself - he kept the books partly - I wrote more in them then he did - I made no additional remuneration for that, except presents I gave him - his dinner and breakfast cost something.</p>
               <p>Q. During the last few weeks, did you continue to give him the 7s. a week? A. I believe so - he was always paid the 7s. per week - I never paid him myself scarcely - he, I believe, owes me money now - I did not, myself, pay him the last four weeks - he did not make much objection to be searched - he began to shake a little - he was about nine months in my employ.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner has been in better circum<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030015"/>stances in life, has he not? A. Yes, he kept the George Inn, in Aldermanbury, when I knew him, and it was through that I took him - he bore an honest respectable character.</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE. Q. Are you quite sure he received more than 5s. for the 7s. lately? A. When he asked for money, he had it - he entered it himself; I always trusted him- he might not have had 5s. in a week; but, taking the four weeks, he had 20s.; I cannot say - whenever he wanted money, he said, "I want so and so" - I said, "Here, take it, and put it down."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you allow him to take money out of the till without asking for it? A. No; if he wanted a few shillings, I gave it him - he would put it in a little book, containing an account of his wages - I am so busy sometimes, I cannot attend to it - he did not ask me for money that day - I trust to himself to put it down.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, declaring his innocence, and stating, that he had placed 5s. in the till, and taken out two half-crowns to repay a friend, of whom he had borrowed that sum in half-crowns, and desired to return it in the same coin.

I got into an omnibus in the Strand, on the 24th of May - the prisoner Dowling got into the same omnibus, and sat next to me, on the right hand side; and in about two minutes he went to the opposite, and soon after English got in, and sat next to me on the same side, the right side - there was not sufficient room for him, but he thrust himself in - he observed that he expected a friend in, and went to the opposite side of the coach - there was plenty of room on the other side - he unnecessarily crowded me - another person came in, and he also sat by me- there was still more room on the opposite side - there were only two persons on my side, but there was not room, because we sat close together - an elderly woman was next to me at first - the third person rode about 100 yards and then wished to get out - upon that English observed that it was very warm, and he should get out - he stopped the omnibus and got on the steps, and then the conductor asked me if I had lost any thing - I said I had not at first, but I put my hand into my right hand pocket, and missed my purse - the conductor charged English with having my purse, and stopped him - he denied having it, got down and ran away - while this was going on, Dowling said he wanted to get out - I pulled him back by the advice of the conductor, and then he did not attmept to get away - my purse was safe two minutes before I got into the omnibus - there were two sovereigns, and 12s. or 14s. in silver in it - I cannot exactly tell the silver - it was a green silk purse - I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it very warm in the omnibus? A. It was a very warm day - I did not think the omnibus particularly warm - there were not more than three males, and two ladies besides myself, and a boy in it - there was my daughter on the opposite side to me, and an elderly woman and the two prisoners on the opposite side - I could have gone to the other side if I was incommoded - there was no conversation going on - it was on English's going out that the charge was made - he was the second that went out.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were in an omnibus, and a charge of robbery was made in it, should not you be very glad to get out? A. Undoubtedly I should - Dowling was searched - nothing was found on him - I saw no communication whatever between them.</p>

            . I am conductor of the Blackwall omnibus, No. 5,332. I was in the Strand - the prosecutrix and another female got in - there were two women in before this occurred - the prosecutrix got in at the Red Lion in the Strand, and English about forty yards further - he sat on the left hand side of the other lady - he did not sit near the prosecutrix - that I saw - Dowling, when he got in, sat close to the prosecutrix - he took off his hat and had his handkerchief in his hat, close to the lady - I did not observe him change sides - one gentleman got out at Shoe-lane, who had got in shortly after the prosecutrix - he was the third man that got in - I perceived something in his left hand like a purse - he put his hand in his right hand pocket to pull out a 6d. to pay me - I went on a little, and directly after English went to get out, and seeing the man with the purse in his hand excited my suspicions - and English getting out so shortly afterwards, I said to the lady, "Have you lost any thing?" she said, "No;" but on feeling, said her purse was gone - I stopped English on the steps - he gave me half-a-crown to take his fare - I had not change - he said, "I have smaller change in my pocket" - I said I must detain him for the robbery in the omnibus - he went down Shoe-lane - I called to the coachman, who got off, and went down Shoe-lane and secured him - English ran off,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030016"/>leaving the half-crown in my hand, without waiting for his change - he ran about forty yards slowly - I ran after him rather fast, and caught him - the fare was 6d. - when I said I must detain him, he said he had business to attend to - he did not wait for his change - he was given into custody of Martin - Dowling remained in the omnibus till we came down Shoe-lane, when I gave them both into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. People get out when they like, do not they? A. Yes; and sometimes if they see a companion in the street - English was not on the same side as the prosecutrix at all - I peep into the omnibus now and then, and see where the different people sit - I did not see the other man hold any communication with any body - seeing Dowling sit close to the lady, made me take notice of them, and seeing the other gentleman and the two prisoners all three getting in so close together - they all got in within forty yards of one another - I suspected something when I saw the purse - it was not in my thoughts at the moment I saw the purse in the man's hand - the omnibus went on after the gentleman got out with the purse in his hand, as far as St. Bride's church, about twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you help ladies into the omnibus when they get in? A. Yes - I did not help this lady in; I stood on my place - there was another omnibus near - I had the door in my hand - the other omnibus was only going to the bank - the prosecutrix was going to the Commercial-road - she stopped us - I was not searched - I have been conductor to the omnibus two years - if twenty or fourteen persons had been in the omnibus, I should have stopped every one of them if I had suspicion - I saw something like a purse in the man's hand - it was green - I did not say that before the magistrate - I never heard the lady say it was green, before she said it here - I was not asked the question before, and I was so flurried by the prisoner's solicitor, I hardly knew what I was about - the solicitor did not ask me the colour of the purse - I am sure I did not mention another colour there.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you happen to remark the purse in the man's hand? A. It was strange, he having a purse in his hand, should put his hand in his pocket to pull out silver - I suspected it was not right - the prisoners did not hold any communication with the man to my knowledge - I cannot tell who robbed the lady - he might have done it unknown to the prisoners - English was the man who attempted to get away, when I charged him with being concerned in the robbery.</p>
               <p>MRS. BROWN re-examined. There might have been one half-crown in my purse, but not more, I am sure.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you swear I took it from your person? A. No; I felt a push, and found it in his pocket, not half a yard from me - I was coming through a little alley - they were both pressing on me, as close as they could.</p>

About ten o'clock in the morning I was going to Hoxton to transact business for a friend, and in passing through the passage I picked up the handkerchief in question - the first impression of my mind was, that it belonged to one of two persons who had passed through the passage rapidly, into Aldersgate-street - the prosecutor asked me if I had got it - I said no, believing the owner to be one of the two who had gone on.</p>
               <p>MR. CHADWICK. When I took him, he said, so help him God, he had not got it, and resisted my taking it from him; but when I got it, he said, he did not take it from my pocket - I had felt one hand at my pocket, and another shoving me, and saw him shoving it into his pocket - if he did not take it, he must have seen it taken, he was so close to me.</p>

               <p>HYAM ANSELL. I live in Savage-gardens. On the evening of the 17th of June I was in <placeName id="t18340703-18-crimeloc106">Aldersgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by 
               <persName id="t18340703-18-person216">MR. STAMMERS</persName>
            . Q. What reason have you to suppose the party was connected with him? A. Because they came round me immediately. He hit me the blow - they came running from the opposite side - they hustled me, and I tore myself from them - I had accused the boy of theft - I believed that, because he was a very short distance from me when I looked round - when I looked round, and saw him, there might be two or three persons near him - there might be persons as near to me as he was - I saw him attempt to pick another pocket - he put his hand into the pocket of a gentleman who was looking in at a window - the gentleman moved on, and I immediately collared him, and said, "You have just now robbed me" - I think I called him a scoundrel.</p>

            . I saw Ansell lay hold of the prisoner, who struck him a tremendous blow in the eye - about six or eight came from the opposite side of the way - some pulled the gentleman, and some pulled the prisoner - I immediately called a watchman - the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner when they first came up - it was about a quarter after nine o'clock - I saw the prisoner chuck the handkerchief out of his hand - it was a red one - he threw it among the mob - I do not know what became of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The people wished to prevent them fighting, I suppose? A. I cannot say - I saw Ansell collar him - the prisoner struck before they came over - the prisoner's hat was knocked off - I think it was a red handkerchief he threw away - I was close to them - I have had no conversation with the policeman on the subject - I went into the watch-house and told the night officer I saw it all - the watchman came up - I showed him the prisoner, and he took him for striking the blow.</p>
               <p>H. ANSELL re-examined. I lost a red silk handkerchief - I gave him in charge for felony and assault.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to the watch-house with him? A. Yes - the charge was assault and robbery - both charges were given at the same time - Ansell mentioned both at the same time.</p>
               <p>H. ANSELL re-examined. Q. Were you not standing with what the Jews call a "cutter," and did you not turn round, collar the boy, and call him a thief? A. Certainly not - no handkerchief was produced to me at any place - I am confident the prisoner said nothing to me about the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>J. TOWNSEND re-examined. I saw the prisoner throw a handkerchief away out of his hand - not from his hat - I think it was a red one.</p>

               <p>Witness. I said to the best of my knowledge you were the person who came to my shop - you asked me if I would buy a clock and set of fire-irons - I said, "Where are the weights and the pendulum?" you said you were moving, and should find them presently - you asked 3s. 6d. for them - I offered you half-a-crown - you went out, came back, and said you would take it - you are the person to the best of my belief.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mrs. Elizabeth Jones - these tongs and fire-irons are hers - I had them to clean some months ago - I began to clean them - they were then put away, and the servant oiled them - I missed them about twelve o'clock on the day they were found at the broker's - I had seen them about a month before they were lost - on the Saturday before I had seen the prisoner on the leads, while I was at work in our shop - he looked into our shop, and then into Mr. Hallam's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The place he speaks of is at the back of the house I live in, at Short's Gardens - I was coming from the water-closet, and there is an old lumber room which they are making into a dwelling-room - I went on the leads, and their window comes out on the leads - I could not avoid seeing them, nor they seeing me - I was taken from my bed at nine o'clock in the evening - there were three other young men taken; one of them had vitriol all over his trowsers, and the master said the bench had been overturned, and the vitriol spilled; but that young man was discharged.</p>

            . I am an iron-dealer, and live at No. 2, Wheeler-street, Spitalfields. Delaforce was in my service - I sent him on the 24th of May, with John Todd, to No. 29, Half Moon-alley, Bishopsgate-street, at a little after four o'clock - I deal in marine stores - he has been my servant about five months - he had 5s. a week - he slept at home, I believe - he comes in the morning about half-past seven or eight o'clock, and leaves about eight in the evening - I did not know his name except William - I have heard his other name before - I do not know how long I have lived where I now do.</p>

            . I live on Clerkenwell-green. On the 20th of June, I met the prisoner in Chiswell-street, carrying these two bundles, one tied in a red, and one in a blue handkerchief - there were two men walking behind her - I followed her to Whitecross-street - I saw her give the bundles to a man who went under an archway - she went up the street, and returned in about three minutes with another female - each of the women then took a bundle from the man and went up the street, the two men walking behind them - I met a policeman, and told him - he went after them - the two men then kept back, and the policeman spoke to the prisoner and to Hubbard, the other woman - the prisoner said she was going to take them to the top of the street, but she did not know to whom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time was this? A. About twelve o'clock at noon - it was in open day - I knew the men, who went away, by sight - I believe them to be bad characters - I believe the name of one of them is James Reynolds - he had been charged at Hatton-garden - I do not know that the other had been charged with any thing, and do not know his name - I might have seen him four or five times - I had seen him once in Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell, about six weeks ago - I believe he is a reputed thief.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you heard the witness state that there were two men who kept back, and went away? A. Yes - I did not tell the prisoner she would have fourteen years - she was examined twice before the magistrate - I did not say I knew both the men, and could take them any day - Colliss said he saw two men follow the prisoner, and one was

            . I am clerk to Charles Burrows, No. 12 Wharf, Regent's-canal - I was present when Mr. Burrows bought the barge "Emma" - the two prisoners were engaged for two or three days in getting the coals out - I saw John Willshaw take a chain out of the barge which had all the appearance of this, and throw it into the water - that was about the 23d of December - I asked him what it meant, and he said it was all right - James Willshaw was just by and must have heard it - I remember John Willshaw coming to me with an officer about the 6th of June - I was having my breakfast in the counting-house at the time - he said to me, "Do you wish to hang me, or have me transported; what is it about?" - I said it was about a chain that he threw into the water from the "Emma" barge - he said, "The chain I threw there lays there now, for so help me God, I never touched it; it is under the machine" - he pointed out the spot, and I, with the assistance of a man, raked there for nearly an hour - we found a small chain, but not the one he threw over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. This was so long ago as the 23d of December? A. Yes - it was not dark - we do not work in the dark - there were four persons at work there - no one saw him throw it over - I think he did not try to throw it on shore, it was too far for him - I am son-in-law to Mr. Burrows - I have had no quarrel with these men, nor has Mr. Burrows - one of them borrowed a shovel, and Mr. Burrows took him before a magistrate, and the charge was dismissed - I recollect walking on the side of a barge, and to save myself I took my hand out of my pocket and drew out half-a-crown, which the prisoners talked of looking for - I do not know whether they did or not.</p>

            . I was present when the prisoner James Willshaw came to my husband on the subject of the chain - he said, "For God Almighty's sake let me have the chain: I will keep it for a few days and throw it into the cut - only let me have it, or I shall be transported" - whilst my husband was absent, I asked James Willshaw how he came to do it - he said he did not know - he said he had a wife and several children, and it was for their sakes he wished to get off - I said,"What did you do with the money?" - he said, "I went over the way, where I and three or four more of us spent it in beer" - he said it was the first offence he had ever been guilty of, and he would never do the like again - I told him that was the result of being too fond of beer - when my husband returned he again requested to have the chain, and said my husband would get fourteen years' transportation, as he would be punished worse than he should - my husband said young Burrows (meaning young Perraton, who generally goes by that name) had seen him throw it over - he said, "It was not me: some of the men did."</p>

            . I live at No. 12, Wharf, Regent Canal. I purchased the barge "Emma" - the two prisoners were in my employ, and assisted in unloading the barge - about a week after John Willshaw was in custody - I was on the wharf - the chain was then in Mr. Poulson's warehouse - the prisoner James Willshaw was there - I asked him how he came by the chain - he said master gave it him - I said I did not understand the term master: I would have some name mentioned - he then said Mr. Tappin was the man who gave it him, and if I did not believe him, he would bring Mr. Tappin forward - I believe this is the chain - I asked John Willshaw about throwing it overboard - he said it was under the machine, and if we raked for it, we should find it - a small chain was found there, fit to chain a dog up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was in December you bought the barge? A. Yes: the prisoners have been employed there ever since till they were taken.</p>
               <p>MR. TAPPIN. This is my chain - I never authorised either of the prisoners to sell it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen that chain under the stern sheets? A. Yes, about five days before, when the barge went away from Chelsea before it was loaded - I know it is the same chain by a particular marked link in it, which I had marked by a blacksmith - you do not see one in five years marked like it.(

            . I am a silversmith, and live at No. 16, Tottenham-court-road - I first saw the prisoner last Friday morning - she came in with some old silver, a broken mustard-pot, a castor-top, a wine-strainer, and a gravy spoon, and asked if I bought old silver - I said yes - I weighed it, and at 4s. 9d. and ounce, it came to 2l. 2s. 6d. - she said it was left to her by will; and, from her respectable appearance, I did not hesitate in buying it - about half-past six she came again with eleven dessert and two stable-spoons - all of which had a crest, which aroused my suspicions - I said, as she had brought a quantity of plate, perhaps she would pardon my asking where she resided - she said she had not the least objection, and gave me "Mrs. Smith, No. 18, Edward-street, Hampstead-road" - I said, if she would wait at the shop a little while, and I found that correct, I would return and pay her for it - then she said, "Well, I must tell you, if you are going to seek for my residence, we have only been to take the house there - my real residence is No. 18, Edward-street, Regent's-park, and my real name is Mrs. Cash" - I said, "Perhaps you will have no objection to tell me how you became possessed of the property" - she said, Mrs. Montgomery, of No. 48, Queen-square, had left it to her twelve months ago - I said I would go there, and if I found such a lady had resided there, I would return and pay her - the station-house was in my road - I called, and told them my suspicion, and an officer was sent - I went to the square, and could find no No. 48 - I returned, and told her she had given me a false address - she said she did not say No. 48 in the square, but in a street leading into the square which she named - I thought I might have made a mistake, and said, "Will you object to accompany me to the house?" - she said, "No, none" - on crossing the road to Tavistock-square, I asked if Mrs. Montgomery had any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030026"/>relations living in London - she said, "Yes, Mrs. Bailey, in Gower-street" - I said, "Does that lady know the plate was left to you?" - she said yes - she accompanied me to a house where Mrs. Bailey had lived, some eighteen months or two years ago - I asked for Mrs. Bailey - they said she had moved, and Dr. Drew, in the same street, could inform me where she had gone to - I saw Mrs. Drew, the prisoner was with me - I asked for her to remain in the passage, but all in a moment I heard the street door bang to, and the prisoner was gone - I did not see her again till she was in the hands of the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Do you know that she offered to return the money to your wife? A. I knew she asked my wife to let her have the silver back: I was present - I said I would have nothing to do with it; if the property was rightly come by, I would give it to the right owner.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On Saturday night, about twelve o'clock, I apprehended the prisoner - she asked what I wanted - I asked if she knew McLean - she put up her hands and said, "For God's sake let me go, and I will give you every thing I have got" - I took her in charge, and, as she went along, she said, "Are you going to take my husband? so help me God, he knows nothing about it: I told him the plate was left me by a lady as a legacy."</p>
               <p>MR. KEYSER. The twelve spoons are worth 4l. 10s., and more; the two table-spoons, 25s.; a mustard-pot, 9s.; a wine-cruet, 10s.; castor top, 2s. - that is the fair valuation.</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE to MRS. McLEAN. Q. When did you see the plate last? A. I might say I saw the box every day- I saw it the very day she was taken up, in my bed-room - it was a band-box with a key to it, I did not see the spoons that day - I saw them when I entered the house first, about nine months ago - it is nine months since I saw the spoons - I cannot tell how many servants I have had in my employ - I dare say I have had six - I never accused any of them of robbing me of plate - I never said I would not hurt a hair of the prisoner's head - the spoons have my family motto on them.(

On Tuesday morning, the 27th of May, in consequence of what my servant told me, I came down stairs, about a quarter or half-past six o'clock, and missed a pair of silver candlesticks, a silver milk-pot, three silver table-spoons, two tea-spoons, two salt-spoons, a pair of old-fashioned salts, the lid of a mustard-pot, all silver, and a metal watch - my silver milk-pot, I believe, was in the kitchen - all the other articles were in the back parlour - when I went to bed, the evening before, the house was all fast - I examined some of the windows and doors myself - I cannot positively state that I examined them all - on missing the articles, I found the inner shutter of the back kitchen forced open, evidently from the outside - the shutter was forced inwards - it was entirely open - the window was open too - a man could have got in without difficulty - the articles missing might fetch about 15l. in their weight of old silver - I was not of opinion that the window was opened from the outside, at first, but on examining I am satisfied from the marks on the frame, that it must have been forced in with great pressure.</p>

            . I am inspector of the police. I was called by Reardon to his master's shop, and took the prisoner into custody - part of two silver candlesticks were delivered to me by Reardon - I produce them - I asked the prisoner where he got the silver from - he said it was given to him by a young gentleman at Islington - I asked him the name of the gentleman - he said it was Cundee - I asked where he lived - he said he did not know, nor could he tell what part of Islington he had met with the young gentleman - I then asked his own name - he said it was George Cundee - I said it was extraordinary his should be the same name: were they related - he said, "Oh the truth is, my father gave them to me" - I asked him where his father lived - he said he had not seen him before for some years, and did not know where he lived - he then said they were given to him in Orchard-street, Westminster, at the end of Union-court, where he said he lodged - I told him I did not believe his statement, and should take him into custody on suspicion of having stolen them - I searched him at the station-house, and found on him 11s. 5d. - I asked where he got the money - he said he had earned it the day before in the Borough market as an occasional porter - he afterwards admitted that he had been a great part of the day at Westminster - I detained the money except 1s. 2d., which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030027"/>he had for refreshment - since the examination before the magistrate, I have examined the shutters of the prosecutor's house, and am entirely of opinion somebody had broken in from the outside - they had attempted to cut a hole in the shutter near the bolt, and at last forced the shutter in.</p>
               <p>MR. CUNDEE re-examined. I know these parts of the candlesticks perfectly well - they are mine, and have been in my family for forty years - they were not broken when taken from my house - I know them from their general appearance, being constantly in the habit of using them - the two parts which have been produced identify with another piece which was brought to my house by a strange man who found it - he brought it to me next day - I do not know his name - I have brought it here - my house is in the parish of St. James's, Clerkenwell.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was on the reserve at the station-house - Munns was brought there by two men, named Jones and Morgan - I opened the door, and seeing no policeman with him, I asked what was the matter - he complained of being knocked down, and kicked twice in the back - I let him in, and called our inspector - he sent me for Dr. Betson - he said, after he was in the station-house, that he found something pricking, as if he had been stabbed with a knife - I examined him about the loins - there were no marks of violence there - I examined his breast, and found a cut in his coat, almost big enough for a person's fist to go through - his waistcoat was cut not quite so large - his shirt appeared a very large tear - and, on another examination, I found a little cut which a sixpence would cover - it was stained with blood - there were stains of blood on his shirt - Dr. Betson said he thought the scratches were done by a person's finger-nails, and advised him to go home - he said, as he was treated so well in the hospital before, he wished to go there - our inspector, Mr. Young, desired me to go with him. Cross-examined. Q. You found next morning nothing serious had happened to him? A. The nurse said he had been cupped for a kick on the back - he wore a jacket the same as he has now - there was a hole in it nearly big enough to receive a man's fist - the waistcoat hole was not so large - the shirt had a tear in it much larger than the waistcoat - I believed his clothes to be cut with some sharp instrument - I consider that his shirt was torn - I thought the marks on his breast were done with three finger-nails; but the clothes appeared to be cut - I myself never heard a word about the knife till we got before the magistrate.</p>

            , (policeman K 178.) I was on duty in the Commercial-road on the 22d of May - about eleven o'clock at night I saw the prosecutor with two prostitutes drunk, or pretending to be so - he said, "I will give you 1s. 6d.;" and one of the girls said, "You shall not come under 3s." - I have known Munns a long while - I ordered the girls to walk on - I at first told him I thought he had been drinking - he said he had been at Hackney flaring up, and had had some half-and-half - I told him he had better go home, unless any accident happened to him, and went with him as far as Watney-street, where he turned down - I parted with him there - as he was going from me, he said, "It is all right, Murray - (putting his hand on his breast) - I have something here from them."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you observe his clothes? A. I did- he had a blue jacket - I saw nothing unusual about his clothes - he said nothing to me about a knife - he said it was all right: he had something here - this was about an hour before he says he was stabbed.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live next door to Allen. I recollect the prisoner coming to my house with some duplicates - it is about nine weeks ago that he first came, on a Saturday evening, I think - he brought the ticket of a bed first, and wanted to sell it - I asked him to leave the ticket, and I would look at the bed at the pawnbroker's, which he did - I went on the Monday morning, but the pawnbroker refused to show it unless I paid the money - next day I went with two police-officers, paid the money it was pawned for, and then took it home - there were three other duplicates left with me at the same time - they related to other pawnbrokers - I saw these articles, and purchased the tickets of the prisoner, I got the articles out, and placed them outside my door, and sold them- I gave him 5s. for the ticket of the bed - I cannot say whether I gave him 2s. or 3s. for the others - I think it was a sheet, bolster, and blanket, but cannot swear - on Thursday morning, the 22nd of May, Allen's son came and told me a young man had left a table there for me; and two or three days previous to that the prisoner had told me he should bring one - the table is here - the blankets I sold after I had bought them - he asked me 5s. for the table and blanket together, which I gave him - I saw the prisoner about nine or ten o'clock on the morning the table came - he asked me if I had seen it - he turned round and saw it standing there - he said, "Oh, that is it" - I asked what he wanted for it - he said I should have them for 6s. as they were - he wanted the money - I did not wish to pay him till next morning, and I gave him 3s. or 3s. 6d. in part payment - I had seen him before I bought the table, when an offer was made of the duplicates of other things - I cannot say how long it was back - he used to come two or three times a week sometimes, and sometimes brought one ticket and sometimes two of various articles, which he wished to dispose of - some I bought, and some I did not, as they were out of my line - one ticket was for two miniature pictures pawned for 6d. - one for six neck handkerchiefs - one for window curtains - I redeemed those articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How soon after you got the table from Allen, was it claimed? A. Not till the next morning - I had planed it over then, and rounded the corners, which were square, but not to change the colour and shape - I usually do so if it is in a bad condition - I have always told the same story about this - one of the pawnbrokers was Whiskard, of Bishopsgate-street, and the other one opposite Church-street - I went to a pawnbroker's in Shoreditch - I think his name is Sadler or Smith - I never took particular notice - I saw the shopman at the pawnbroker's in Shoreditch - I do not know his name - I did not tell him I bought them of Mrs. Kew, and gave 1l. for them, nor any thing like it, in any respect whatever - I bought the things of the prisoner, because having known him for two years I had a good opinion of him - I do not know whether he was a housekeeper - I know he was on the point of marriage - I do not know what has become of the tickets, except two the policeman took - I redeemed what I bought, and the pawnbrokers had the tickets - I thought all these tickets (looking at them) were his property - this is for a table-cover and bed gown in the name of Keen, I should call it - he told me the person who pawned the things for him had put the name on the duplicates - she told me the name of Kew, for several of the duplicates were written plain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you mention the name of Kew to Adnum, Smith's shopman, and say you bought them of Mrs. Kew, and gave 1l. for them? A. I did not - he did not ask me- I will not swear this name on the duplicate was meant for Kew - the prisoner told me they were pawned by Kew - I am not positive that the name on this ticket is Kew - I was three or four times in the shop in Shoreditch - I fetched a bed out of pawn, for which I got 28s. - I paid 5s. for the ticket, and, I think, 15s. 10½d. principal and interest.</p>
               <p>MRS. KEW re-examined. Q. Before you returned to your apartments and missed the things, had you at any time gone to your apartments to look at them? A. Only once, that must have been about the beginning of May, I then looked about, but did not miss any thing - I had a tea-caddy on the mantel-piece containing the duplicates - it was locked - I did not examined it - when I missed all my property the caddy was still on the shelf, but it was broken open and all the tickets were gone.</p>

            . I am inspector of counterfeit coin to his Majesty's Mint, and have been so many years. This is a plaster of Paris mould to cast counterfeit shillings - it has on one part of it, the obverse side of the impression of a shilling, and on the other, the reverse side of a shilling - it appears to have been used for the purpose of casting - it is discoloured - here is some white metal, which seems similar to the shilling produced - the first shilling is counterfeit, which was taken from his mouth - the other seventeen are also counterfeit of the same description, and I believe they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030031"/>have all been cast in this mould - they are all unfinished, but in a state apparently intended to pass for the current coin - here are two which have been filed sufficient to go into circulation - the white metal spoon is similar metal to the coin - the tin appears to have been used as a band for making the mould.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I am charged with coining; it is a base conspiracy, to obtain the reward which his Majesty's Mint gives on such occasions. I was sitting in my back parlour, when Henry Wilson called on me, and asked me to let him leave the things which the officer found on the table, while he went to fetch a file; he had not left my place more than five minutes, when the officers came in and apprehended me, on the charge of coining. To deny that the coin was not there, or that I did not know that it was bad, would be saying that which no man would believe, - but, as to making them, it is entirely false. I implore you to investigate this case with mercy and consideration. As for the police-constable Goose, he has been a convicted felon, and was confined in the Brixton House of Correction for the term of six months, and has been discharged from the police-force two or three times for his misconduct. I told the police where they could apprehend Henry Wilson, but they would not do it: for their object is to gain the reward from the mint. The file found in the drawer of the table is what I have always used as a steel to strike a light with, belonging to my tinder-box; and the plaster of Paris found hanging up against the window is what I use in my trade, I being a plasterer.</p>

            . I am a police-sergeant. In consequence of information, I went to a cellar in Brackley-street - on the Thursday morning, the 5th of June, about half an hour after Lee was brought in - I found it locked with a padlock - I broke it open, and in a large heap of ashes, I found two bottles, one quite broken, and the other with a little piece broken out - I found nothing more there- when Bateman was brought out of the station-house to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030032"/>go to Worship-street, he said he knew nothing of the robbery - I told him he was charged with being concerned with Lee, in breaking open the house in Red Lion market - he said he knew nothing of the robbery - I told him I had found two bottles at the cellar in Brackley-street, and I asked how he accounted for that - he said Lee and the other brought the coats and three bottles to the cellar; that they went out first, and sold the coats, and he afterwards accompanied Lee to sell the bottles.</p>
               <p>JAMES TIDY re-examined. I know these bottles are the same as I left in the prosecutor's possession when he took the house - I had them in my possession many years, and some of them are very particular bottles - one I described before it was produced - it is blue; and here is a very particular bottle - I have had them in my possession seven years - I have no doubt of them.</p>
               <p>Lee's Defence. I and Bateman were walking in Drury-lane about half-past eight o'clock, and met two young men with four bottles - they said they would give us part of them, if we went and sold them - they would wait at the corner of Golden lane for us - we were with them till nearly ten o'clock, we staid in the cellar, and emptied two bottles - I went to sell them, and as I came out of the shop, Scotchmer asked what I had got.</p>
               <p>Bateman's Defence. Scotchmer has false sworn what I said to him coming from Clapham - as I came along, he said, "If you have any thing to say, now is the time to say it" - I told him the morning previous to the robbery, Lee and Minion came to the cellar, opened it, and called Cook out - Cook went out with them - I did not say I went out with them, or showed them any thing.</p>

About two minutes - I was then serving a customer - there was nobody in the shop when he came in - I cannot say how much money was in the till - I know there were some sixpences, and one shilling - I cannot say whether there was more than one sixpence - I think there was more than one - but I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell his Lordship, you could not say there was more than one sixpence in the till? A. Yes; I said there was a sixpence and a shilling - there was more than one sixpence - if I said "sixpences," I made a mistake - there was a sixpence, and a shilling - I cannot say how much money there was - I think there were two sixpences - I am sure there were two, for I was at the till two or three minutes before - I had no mark on the money in the till - two minutes before, when a customer came in, I served him with half-a-quartern loaf - he paid me sixpence, and I gave him twopence - there were two sixpences in the till - I was in the back-room at the time the prisoner came in - the door was open - it was day light but the back-room is dark - he could not see into the back-room, it is only lighted from the shop - there is a small window in it - I cannot say how many windows there are - I have lived in the house about three years- there are four windows in the room, it is a parlour - they do not look into the street - I was busy at the time, and was walking about - the prisoner walked out, and then ran - I said at Guildhall that he ran into Shoe-lane, out of the shop - he walked out of the shop, and ran up the lane - I saw him searched - more than I lost was found on him - I am accountable for the money in the till, in master's absence.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER MELVILLE. I live in Shoe-lane - the last witness is my servant - I had given change for a shilling a few minutes before and put it in the till - there was more silver in the till at the time - there were sixpences, but what number I cannot say - there was more than one - I went out, and when I came in the prisoner was in custody in the shop - he put his hand in his pocket, and took out one shilling and five sixpences, and laid them on the counter, and said that was all he had taken out of the till - the officer searched him and found 15s. more on him - I believe that was out of a different pocket, but I did not particularly observe, as my shop was full of people - he said that was his own money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How much did he take out and say that was all he had taken out of the till? A. One shilling and five sixpences - I am sure there were five sixpences.</p>
               <p>ELLEN BORTHWICK re-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not tell me at all events there was no more than two sixpences in the till? A. Yes, as near as I can recollect it was two - I accounted for the second sixpence by receiving it for a loaf - there might have been more than two sixpences in the till.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you an accurate recollection how many sixpences there were? A. No: I recollect seeing two, and that is all I noticed - I had not taken any sixpence from the till, shortly before.</p>

The prisoner was five weeks in my service - she was only engaged for a month - on the 30th of May, she was leaving - I observed her pocket very bulky - we were looking for a spoon which was lost - I said I must have it found before she left - I saw something very bulky in her pocket - I said, "You have something very large in your pocket, what is it?" - she said it was only her handkerchief - I said, "It is something hard; you had better come out, and let me see what it is" - she stopped a little behind, and at last came out - I said, "Allow me to see what it is; you had better bring it out; it is more than a handkerchief" - she hesitated; then pulled out some cuffs and collars, and black-lead done up in a paper - she dropped some velvet, where she stood, by the side of a platewarmer; but that was not seen at that time - the property in her pocket was mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Her connexions are very respectable? A. I understand so, and from that motive I took her - I believe the family are reduced - she was servant of all work - she received more wages than she could possibly expect, according to agreement - I paid her nothing - I did not pay her any money, except what I gave her - I did sometimes give her money - if I sent her to dine with her aunt, I gave her a shilling - I gave her money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030034"/>to spend - she received in my house 13s., or thereabout, within a trifle, from gentlemen who lodged with me - I hired her on these terms - some gentlemen were coming to lodge with me; they were very generous persons, and I knew she would receive money - the articles produced are my property - she took them out of her pocket - the shirtcollars were taken from a paper of many dozens - I kept a shop, in Newgate-street, sixteen years - the house is now pulled down - they are part of the stock - I have marks sufficient to know they are mine - I know my own work on some of them - I engage a sempstress to work for me - I can swear they are my property; it is my shape, my cutting out - I always cut out every thing - I am quite positive I cut out that collar - this calico was in her box - this velvet I can swear to.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you articles of the same description as those produced? A. Yes; I have - there are some remaining of the same texture - I kept the articles in a box, on a high shelf, in a sort of kitchen - the articles are worth 12s.</p>

               <p>MARY ACOCKS re-examined. I have lost a good deal of property before - I never preferred a complaint against any servant - a man robbed my shop fifteen years ago - I prosecuted him - I have not prosecuted any body since - a woman stole a watch from a gentleman in my house; I went to Guildhall about that; I have no recollection of any other case - this girl was brought to me as a country girl, from Plymouth; and the mother is a sempstress who worked for me - she said the prisoner had arrived from Plymouth, but I found it was all a trick - I sometimes take a servant a month on liking - she was going - it was her wish to go, as she knew I had found out she had not come from the country.(

             (City police-constable, No. 26.) I apprehended the prisoner when I got to the pawnbroker's; he escaped out of one door as I went in at the other - I apprehended him in Gray's-inn-lane - I was concerned in no plot- I was sent for to apprehend him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He did not apprehend me. Witness. He ran out of the shop - Ford and myself ran out, both laid hold of him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. What mark is on it which you can swear to? A. A W. - I marked it since it was picked up, but I knew it - I had used it a short time, and knew the pattern and colour - I have others the same - I have not the least doubt of it - I knew it when I gave him into custody - I swear I saw the prisoner drop it - I took hold of him instantly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said, "You have picked my pocket, you young scoundrel," and the policeman told him to mark it that he might know it. Witness. I am sure I saw him drop it - I saw it in motion - I did not see it in his hand - part of it might be on the ground - it fell between him and me - I should think it impossible to fall from any body else.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you try to get hold of the other, and say, "You young scoundrel, if I had you I would make you pay for all?" Witness. I did not say so - I think it impossible any body could drop it but him - there was no one directly behind but him - it was dropped right behind me - there was a lad within about a couple of yards of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030035"/>the prisoner - it was dropped in front of the prisoner, and there was nobody in front of him - I think it is impossible any body could have dropped it but him - he was as close behind me as possible - I saw the handkerchief going in a direction from him to the ground - no one else could drop it, I am certain - I am certain it came from his hand - I saw it in motion before it was on the ground, between him and me - nobody else was near enough to drop it - I am certain it came from the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was any body by you and me when you accused me? - were not people stopping for a horse and cart to go along? - I was walking along. A. He was standing still.</p>

On the 20th of May, I saw a paper parcel on one of our muslin wrappers, and found it contained some Irish linen, partly cut up for shirts - I inquired aloud in the shop who it belonged to - the prisoner said it was his, and I gave it him - I afterwards looked through the books to see if any such linen had been entered to him - I found it had not - I inquired of each young man if they had sold the prisoner any linen - they said they had not - I then called the prisoner up-stairs, and asked how he became possessed of the linen - he said it was a piece of cloth which he had from his employer whom he lived with at Bristol - I said I felt assured it was our linen, and asked him where it was, that I might see it - he said it was not in his possession, as he had given it out to be made into shirts to a woman, but he did not know where she lived - but when he found I was quite positive, he said it might be a mistake, as a friend of his named Handley had bought some Irish of him about six months before - I discharged the prisoner, and went to Mr. Handley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not that linen in the shop where it could be seen? A. Yes; he told me the woman who had the shirts to make would call the next morning for a pattern shirt, and she did call for it - Mr. Handley told me that he had bought a piece of linen at our shop, which the prisoner's sister had to cut up for shirts; and that he had a piece which he had bought of his former master.</p>

               <p>MR. TIDMARSH re-examined. Q. Do you know whether you had sold Mr. Handley any cloth? A.

            . I am a hosier, and live in the Strand. On the 15th of May, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked me to purchase these watch-guards for 25s. - I knew it was too little, and said they must be stolen - he said he gave a boy a book for them in Clare Market - I looked for a policeman, but did not see one - the prisoner left them with me, and went away - he said his name was Roberts, and he lived in Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you leave him in the shop when you went for the policeman? A. I only went to the door - my wife was in the shop - he did not object to my keeping the goods, to see if I could find the owner.</p>

These watch-guards are mine - there are four dozen of them - I sell a great many; but only two dozen of this pattern have been sold, which I have traced - these are worth about 3l. - I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there not a great many of these in different manufacturers' premises? A. These brown ones, I only know, are our make - the green ones I speak more particularly to, I think there are not many a like - I have not seen any - I cannot say when I saw them in my possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them that morning for two books and 3s.</p>

I fell in with the prisoner, in Shoreditch, on the 7th of June - he was carrying two pair of shoes in a bundle - I asked him what he had - he said, "Nothing" - I found the shoes in it, and then he said another boy gave him them to carry - there was another boy with him, who went away - he was about five minutes' walk from the prosecutor's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you there when he came into the shop? A. Yes, he asked my master for some wadding - my master sent him out for something - he did not leave his hat behind him in the shop - my master sent me out with a pair of trowsers, and when I came back I saw the prisoner come in again, with his hat on - he came for his father's wages on the Saturday night before, and master would not give him them - he said he wanted to see his father - the prisoner said he would not go out of the shop until he had the wages - but master was not angry - I never saw him angry - the prisoner's father came at last, and went into the counting-house, and the door was shut - the prisoner worked under his father - there is a square aperture over the shop - I did not look up to see if there was any female there.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER MANNERING. On the 10th of June, I directed Ash to watch my premises, and, in consequence of what he said, I went to the prisoner, took off his hat, and found this waistcoat-piece in it - it had not been sold - I said to the prisoner, "You are the thief" - we had had strong suspicion before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you had any difference with the prisoner a little before, about a coat, which he did not make properly? A. He, or his father, had done something which I did not like - he was rather impudent - I gave him a shove, and he went into the street, but the force did not push him out - I was quite cool - this was at the time he came for the wages - there is an aperture over my shop - there was no female up there - I had sent the prisoner out this day - the waistcoat-piece was found in his hat - he did not say it had been put into his hat by some one.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to LAWRENCE ASH. Q. What did your master say to the prisoner, when he found this in his hat? A. I do not recollect - he told me to get an officer, and asked if it was his waistcoat - the prisoner begged my pardon, and Mr. Mannering's - I am sure of that; and he said he would not do it any more - he said so in my master's presence - I do not know that my master heard it.(

The prisoner bought the two legs of pork - my father sent me with the pork, and told me to bring back the pork or the money - the prisoner took me as far as Harrow-alley - he then took the legs of pork out of the tray and went into a public-house - he came out again and went up the alley - I followed him - when he got to the end I lost him - I went back to my father.</p>

On the 17th of May, the prisoner came to the shop and looked at a quantity of ribbons - after giving me a great deal of trouble he asked about the price, and said he wanted to ship them - when we had arranged about the price he drew my attention to the counter several different times, and his fingers were about the ribbons, and they were removed - in one instance he desired to see some goods from the window - I got them, and noticed that the ribbons were removed more than usual - I looked at him, and saw one of his pockets was a little larger than it had been before - I then said, "Before we go any further we will settle for these" - he said, "No, no, go on" - I said, "We will make an invoice of these" - I set down the lengths of the ribbon - he several times wanted to call off my attention, but I said, "No, stay where you are"- when I had made out the invoice, I said, "Now I want the money" - he said, "I shall return in my horse and chaise, and pay you, and buy some more" - he was then going out - I got between him and the door, and said, "I want to see what you have got in your pocket" - he said, "Good God! what do you think I have got?" - I sent for the officer, and as the officer was coming in, the prisoner pulled these ribbons from his pocket - they are not in the invoice at all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you known him before? A. No - he was a stranger to me - he had never dealt at my shop to my knowledge - these ribbons cost me rather more than 2l. - they are new ribbons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have bought of him three different times - I bought 90l. worth in Holborn, and once in the Borough, and in the Dover-road.</p>

             kept an account with us - I knew the prisoner as being one his lordship's establishment -(looking at a bill) on the 30th of January the prisoner presented this bill for payment - at that time this endorsement,"R. Aickman," was on the back of it, and nothing more - after some little hesitation about the endorsement, I paid the bill - this receipt above the endorsement, and the prisoner's name below it, was written by the prisoner after he presented it - the prisoner said he received it for Mr. Aikman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He said he received it for Aikman? A. Yes. I saw him write, "Received for," and his name - I am positive the name of Aickman was there before he wrote that - the regular way of receipting a bill of exchange would have been, to have written, "Received," and his own name, if he received it for himself - a banker's clerk always signs as received for the firm - if he had received it for himself, I should not have paid the money, as I knew he was not Mr. Aikman.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had presented the bill, and written on it "Received, J. Aikman," that would have done? A. Yes, If he had said it was paid him by Aikman, as I knew him, I should have made some inquiry - if a stranger had presented it, that would have been another thing - there was some difficulty in making out the name - there is a blot on the name - I am not certain the blot was on the name when it was presented - it might have been blotted at the time he wrote, or not - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Would the bill be payable at all without the endorsement, "R. Aikman," on it? A. Certainly not.</p>

I was employed by Lord Bristol - in January last I had a demand on his Lordship for 184l. 9s. - I delivered a bill to that amount to the prisoner, about the 18th of January - this is the bill (looking at it) - I have been paid the amount of the bill since this investigation - I received no payment from the prisoner for it at any time - this receipt is not my handwriting, nor did I authorize any body to write it - I never received any bill from the prisoner for payment of my bill, or authorized him or any body to endorse any bill - the endorsement on this bill is not my handwriting, nor was it done with my authority - it is not spelt right - my name has no c in it - after delivering my bill, in January, I called at Lord Bristol's to see the prisoner, on Saturday morning, the 29th of January - I spoke to him about my bill, and he said my cheque would be up the beginning of the week from his Lordship - I went there on the 5th February again, and saw him - I asked him if I might write down to his Lordship at Ickworth, on the subject of his bill - I saw him at Lord Bristol's house, at Putney-heath - he told me to call next day at twelve o'clock, and I should receive my money - I went next day - I could not find him - I made every inquiry for him afterwards, but without success.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never gave him authority to put your name on that bill? A. No; I did not - I never saw that bill - I might authorize him to put my name on some papers, but not such a thing as this - never on any bill of exchange, or order for the payment of money - he once drew a bill on me for 10l., for his own accommodation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030046"/>- this is the bill (looking at it) - I never accepted any other accommodation bill for him, nor he for me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you may have given him leave to put your name on something or other, what do you mean? A. That bill - that is all - I suffer that to be drawn on me - he did not put my name on it - the acceptance is my own handwriting - I put that name myself - I cannot tell you what I authorized him to write my name on - I did not give him a general leave to use my name - not any thing except this.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me you gave him leave on some occasions to use your name, did you not? A. No; I did not - I have not given him permission in any way - this 10l. bill was outstanding at the time the Marquis's bill came to him.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you ever in your life authorize him to write your name on any bill of exchange, or draft, or order for payment of money? A. No; I permitted him to draw that 10l. bill on me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know of the prisoner having written your name on any other paper with your permission? A. No.</p>

            . In January last I was in Lord Bristol's employ - (looking at an account) this is in the prisoner's handwriting - in February last, by the direction of Lord Bristol, I went to Roehampton - I did not find the prisoner there - I made inquiry - I afterwards inquired in town at his Lordship's residence, but did not find him - I went into a public-house, in Crown-court, St. James's, on the 8th of February, and called for a glass of ale; and while they were drawing the ale I heard somebody come in - I took the ale off the counter, turned round, and saw the prisoner come in - the moment he saw me he turned round and went out - I put my glass of ale down, went out into the passage, and into the court, but I did not overtake him - it being a very foggy night, I lost sight of him - I afterwards made inquiry for him, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you see him? A. In Crown-court, at the Red Lion - I was standing - he came in behind me - I have not a doubt he saw me, or he would not have gone out - he never spoke to me - he saw me, for he turned out - he looked at me - I was in my livery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no apartments in St. James's-square? Witness. No; not at his Lordship's house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You sent orders for money with this? A. Yes, altogether - I cannot say that every one of them came faithfully into the hands of the parties - there were a great many, and all came back duly receipted, except two, and I ascertained that those two persons happened to be out the day he called to pay them - I transmitted this bill to the prisoner, probably the same evening as I drew it - I addressed them to him at Roehampton, or St. James's-square.</p>
               <p>(The bill was here put in and read; also a receipt for the amount, signed R. Aickman.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, although unfortunately placed in this degrading situation, I will not encroach on your time, except to assure you of the absence of any improper motives on my part when I gave the receipt for Aikman's money, not having had any intention of misappropriating his money - on that day I paid several tradesmen's bills, and by drinking with them, I got intoxicated - not having time to pay Aikman, I sent his Lordship all the receipts that night, as he requested; and knowing his Lordship would feel disappointed at not receiving the receipts, I thought it no harm to send a receipt for Aikman, intending to pay him the following morning; but unfortunately for me, in a state of intoxication, I entered a gaming-house, where, I believe, I lost all the money - this was inquired into by the officer, and found to be true - the only recollection I have of the affair is, that I went to the gaming-house - perceiving the loss I sustained next morning, I wrote to my friends for money to pay Aikman - Gentlemen, you have heard from the cashier to Goslings that he knew me - can you then, or any thinking men, suppose, as I was known there, that I should myself have presented the cheque, if I intended a forgery or a fraud? - Might not the money have been obtained without my appearing for it, or giving my receipt for it? - if fraud had been my intent, should not I have appropriated the whole sum to my purpose, and have left the country? - in obtaining the money, I acted by the desire of Aikman - he authorized me to receive it - there was nobody to take up the £10 bill where it was payable - he authorized me to receive this money for the purpose - I admit receiving it, and writing the receipt; but through the losses I sustained, I could not pay him - having received it by his desire, he knew he had no claim on Lord Bristol or the banker - hence the origin of my being accused of forgery - by charging me with forgery, he secures himself from the loss - I hope, from your knowledge of business and the world, you will not submit me to the sentence of having committed forgery.</p>

            . I am single, and live at No. 19, Bell-court, Gray's Inn-lane. On Saturday night, the 31st of May, I was going out for some beer - I passed by the end of King's Head-court, and observed a scuffle under the archway, almost at the bottom of the archway - I went up to them, and saw the prisoner and deceased fighting together, scuffling - I tried to part them, but could not - Cronin had got the deceased fastened by the neck, either by his neckcloth or throat - he had his head against his breast - I saw Cronin strike the deceased about the head and shoulder - I could not say exactly the spot - I left them and went to Mrs. Cronin and Mrs. Welch, who were on the other side of the court, underneath the parlour window, three or four yards from their husbands - Mrs. Cronin had got Mrs. Welch's back hair twisted round her hands - her hair was down - she was holding her by her back hair - I loosed her hair out of Mrs. Cronin's hand, and parted them - I went back to the men - they were in the same situation as I had left them, scuffling together - I interfered again, but was not able to part them - I caught hold of Cronin's arm, and said,"Let go of the man" - he said he would not leave him till he had given him his whack - I saw no more of it, as my mother called me away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I think you said the affair had began before you went up? A. Yes; how it began, I cannot tell - both of the women were scuffling - Mr. Welch had his coat on when I was there - I left them fighting - I did not see a man with a green shade over his eyes - if he was there, he must have come up afterwards - he might have been there without my seeing him - there were about four or five persons down the court looking on - the two men and two women were fighting and defending themselves as well as they could - I did not see the deceased strike at all - they were scuffling - I had known the parties before - I came back after it was all over - I do not know Margaret Burke by name - I do not know Mrs. Costello - there were some women there - the deceased was rather a thin man - he was not so stout as the prisoner - I do not think he was so old as twenty-eight - he was a tall man.</p>

            . I live in York-street, Westminster. My son-in-law lives at the corner of King's Head-court - I was at his house on the 31st of May - the noise brought me out about twelve o'clock, or after - I went down the court, and saw two men fighting - they were beginning to fight then - one with his coat off, and the other on - it was Welch and Cronin - I saw them fighting for about ten minutes, I should judge - they fought nearly half up the court - Welch was knocked down with a blow from the fist - the court is paved with flag-stones - Welch recovered himself, got up, and fought again for two or three minutes after that, and at the end of that time, he received a blow at the side of his head from a fist - Cronin gave the blow, and then Welch's head came down with a tremendous fall on the pavement - he laid there some time, and a man with a patch on his eye, asked me to lend a hand to carry him as he was either dead, or very much hurt - he was not able to get up - I lent a hand to carry him to the bot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030048"/>tom of the passage to the door, and then helped to carry him into the passage till the doctor came - the policeman fetched the doctor, who I saw try to open two veins in his arm - he got no blood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About how long did the fight continue altogether? A. I should judge nearly ten minutes - I did not know the parties before - the deceased had his coat off while he was fighting, and he was knocked down with his coat off - I did not see what became of his coat, nor who was holding it - I did not see the man with the patch on his eye with one - nor see him take any part in the fight - it was dark - all the parties were Irish, I believe.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I went to King's Head-court, on this night, hearing of a disturbance there - I got there a little after twelve o'clock - I saw Welch lying on his back, and his head between the prisoner's legs - I pulled the prisoner off the deceased, and in consequence of the Irish rows which there are in Gray's Inn-lane so frequently, I let the prisoner go without taking any notice - he went out of the court - I heard Welch was dead, three or four minutes after I turned the prisoner out of the court, and immediately turned round, and found him coming down the court, and took him in custody to the station-house - he said there that they had had some words, and that was the cause of the fight - the prisoner's mouth was covered with blood, and his nose with dirt - I went for Dr. Whittell, the surgeon, who came along with me to the house where the deceased lay - that was about a quarter of an hour after I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Welch distinctly? A. No, I did not; because there was a crowd of sixty or seventy people at the time we came up - I did not see him distinctly till I saw him in his own room - I saw him lying on his back, but not to tell whether he was dead - I did not see him fighting - he had his coat off; the prisoner had marks of violence, as if he had been injured.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was called in on this occasion about a quarter past twelve o'clock - I found the deceased in a first-floor room, in King's Head-court - he was extended on the ground on his back - I examined him, and found he was dead - I opened the body the following day about one o'clock in the afternoon - the whole of the organs except the brain were remarkably healthy - there was a rupture of vessels in several parts of the brain, but more especially in those vessels corresponding with marks of violence in the scalp - there were three marks on the scalp - I think very probably one was inflicted by the fist, but the other two appeared to be done by something pointed - it was not so obtuse - his head might have come in contact with something which projected on the pavement, or against the wall - I think it was something more pointed than the fist, but I do not mean to say it was any instrument - I think it was more probably occasioned by the fall.</p>
               <p>Q. What in your opinion was the cause of his death? A. Injuries inflicted on the skull - those injuries were quite sufficient to cause death - I saw no other injuries which could have caused death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do I understand you to say some vessels about the brain were ruptured? A. Yes, several - I should not say, that could be caused by the excitement in fighting - concussion might have done it, certainly, but not any exertion of his own - if he struck the other man with immense power, it would be similar to concussion on the ground - he was remarkably healthy, but certainly not a strong muscular man - I said at the inquest that I found the whole organs in a healthy condition - in point of constitution, I might have said that the deceased was a remarkably strong man, but not alluding to muscular power.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the woman was speaking to the prisoner, was there not a fight going on in the court? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You struck nobody but the prisoner? A.

               <p>Q. On your oath, did not the old woman complain of being indecently treated by the deceased? A. I cannot say - he pushed her with his shoulder - she was in front of the prisoner, inside the deceased - in passing, the deceased accidentally pushed against her - the prisoner was one of the persons there, and two women and two men, as near as I can recollect - Daley was behind me - but the woman did not complain of being pushed by the deceased indecently or rudely in my presence - the prisoner said, "He offended my mother" - McCarthy never uttered a sentence - I have not the least animosity against the prisoner - I saw a mark on him, which I gave him myself - I struck him on the temple with my closed fist; that was before I pushed the two men down - I was irritated then, because he rushed violently against me, and we quarrelled - I struck first - I knew McCarthy before - he was not sober - I had two glasses of rum and water with one or two friends at the Chequers - I had not been in any other public-house, on any drinking system - I had been receiving some money at a public-house for a sick tradesman - I drank porter at the man's house I took the money to.</p>

On this Sunday morning, I looked out of my window, hearing a noise, and observed five or six men scuffling together apparently - I afterwards saw three of them cross the street, and go towards Saffron-hill - some person came from the opposite end of the street, and said, "Here are three of them," and struck amongst them - McCarthy was one of them - I did not know the other two - the person struck McCarthy, and he never arose till I called the attention of the police to him - I do not identify the person who struck that blow - there was a further scuffle between fourteen or fifteen of them, and they went to the other end of the street - they came back - I told the police, as I thought him severely injured - in the first instance, I heard a disturbance between five or six men, and a noise as if a man fell against the house, but I could not discern that - the first thing I saw was, apparently, five or six men scuffling together - I could not see the place at the curbstone where the dispute took place - it was three houses from my window - when I got to the deceased, he laid there - he never moved from the time he was struck till he was moved by the police and two other men - he laid about two feet from the curb-stone - I should think he was struck somewhere about the side of the head - I do not know any of the people who were there, to distinguish them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The first thing you saw was the scuffle; what gave rise to that you cannot tell? A.

            . I am a surgeon, and live on Holborn-hill. I visited the deceased on Saturday morning, the 21st of June - I found him suffering from intense disease of the brain - I did not examine his head particularly - I did not see any external injury - I continued to visit him till his death - my last visit was on Tuesday, the 24th - he died early in the morning of the 25th - after his death, I opened his head - I found two marks of violence under the scalp, one on the right side, and one on the left - I found within the head, blood and bloody serum on the right portion of the brain - the brain, of itself, presented marks of inflammation, and a fracture at the base of the skull - the immediate cause of his death I believe to be inflammation of the brain, arising from external violence, and judge, from the marks under the scalp, one on the right side of the head, and the other on the left, that the injury was inflicted there - the base of the skull separates the mouth from the brain - (a violent fall generally produces that) - the inflammation appeared in its last stage when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you think if a medical gentleman had been called in, in the early stage of the inflammation, that proper remedies might have stopped it? A. It is possible - I should think it had existed three or four days - medical assistance should have been called in before - I did not see him till the Saturday - my assistant saw him on the Friday evening - intoxication would certainly considerably increase inflammation of the brain.</p>

On the night of the quarrel I was with my son standing at the corner of Castle-street - the man came up and put his arm round my waist - I turned my head over my left shoulder, and said, "Master, take your hands off from me: take your arm off from round me, I don't want to be mawled about by you" - I am sixty-three years old next November - I did not see the man's face - he took his arm from round me, and my son said, "Let her alone, that is my mother" - another man came up and said, "What is the matter, what is the matter?" - my son said, "That is my mother, he has no business with her" - the man directly struck my son, and gave him a black eye - he ran away, and my son ran after him, as soon as he recovered himself - I ran after him, as soon as I could recover myself, up Saffron-hill - a policeman ran - I got on Saffron-hill, and heard my son's voice, and called "Joe" - he said, "Here I am, mother" - when I got to him, the policeman came up, holding the man by the collar who had run away - he brought him up the corner of Castle-street, and said to my son, "Is this the man who struck you?" - I made answer,"Yes, Sir, it is" - I am sure the man put his arm round my waist - my son had given him no provocation to do that.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PRIVETT re-examined. I saw the prisoner's face - there was a mark on it sufficient to constitute a charge of assault - he had a mark on the eye.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was there not a quantity of persons standing round? A. I cannot say particularly - I was looking at the brass-founders - I had my eye on you, and saw you in possession of my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a sudden rush given - I was pushed suddenly on the gentleman - he turned round and accused me of stealing his handkerchief. Witness. There was no crush round me at all - I saw my handkerchief in his hand.</p>

               <p>T. REYNOLDS. It is false; I have had no quarrel with him - he was bound apprentice to me six years ago - he was convicted before, and I took him back again about January last - he robbed me of a considerable deal of money and some heads - I took him up again - these beads were delivered to me at Guildhall to find the owner and restore them - I had them locked up, and never found the owner - he had concealed them with some money belonging to me, and they were placed in my care by the magistrate, supposing them to be the proceeds of some felony - as soon as I took him again he began to pilfer - I did not know where they were till he took me to the place and showed me them - I accuse him of stealing 20s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was washing myself when master accused me of it - the street-door was open - I went into the yard to wash myself - master came and found the beads, and accused me of it.</p>

Yes; I got her a situation, clothed her, and put her in it - it was a foreign toy shop in Gracechurch-street - I never recommended her to any other place - to no other situation did I send her, I am quite certain - the toy shop was a respectable shop.</p>

            . I am a calenderer, and live in Printing-house-square. I know the prisoner, and had a very high opinion of her - she was at home with her father working at shirt making, until the prosecutrix got her to leave her father's home, and recommended her to a notorious place in Mulberry-court, Petticoat-lane - the prosecutrix herself told me she gave her the recommendation, as she thought the woman respectable when she kept a rag shop, and that is the cause of her getting into this situation - the prosecutrix said, the woman she recommended her used to buy things of her when she kept a rag shop, and the girl when she went there had rags to sleep on, and was asked to sleep with the nephew.</p>
               <p>MRS. CRIMP re-examined. When the prisoner came to me, she came from the employ of a tailor somewhere down Petticoat-lane, but I did not recommend her there - she did not complain that she was obliged to leave the place, and come in rags to me - she had been at home with her father - she came without a shoe to her foot - she was decent, but had no shoes - she seemed satisfied with the place - she did not complain to me that it was a disreputable place - they are respectable people as far as I know - I think their name is Malcot - she is a woman who had done business with me when I kept a rag shop - I did not recommend her to that place - I never spoke to Harris in my life but once, and that was since she left me - I know nothing about him.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HARRIS re-examined. I was at the Mansion-house after the girl was committed - I spoke to Crimp before the policeman - I told her it was through her recommending her to that place - she said, she thought it was respectable, because the woman dealt with her.</p>

I am the prisoner's father - the prosecutrix took her out of Sir John Cass's school, where she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030054"/>was a house girl - the girl was at home with me at work - she used to call Crimp "granny" - she told me her granny had got her a place to learn the tailor's business, at 3s. a week, if I did not object to her going - the prosecutrix has acted the part of a mother in every degree to my children - I do not think she meant any harm by placing my child there.</p>
               <p>MRS. CRIMP. The bonnet and shawl did not belong to the prisoner's sister - they were taken from my drawers.(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

            . I am sofa and chair-maker, and live in Windmill-street. I was at John Harris's timber-yard on the 26th of May - I saw the prisoner near the counting-house paying the clerk for some wood - the clerk went into the counting-house for change - I saw the prisoner take some veneers, put them between those that he had bought, and give them to a person who was with him - he then took up two deals and a cedar board, and went away - I told the clerk what I had seen - I went after the prisoner, and came up to him in Long-alley - he put the boards against the wall - I asked where the man was who had been with him - he said what was that to me - the clerk and the porter came up - I asked where the man lived - he said if we would go to a street in Bethnal-green, he would show where he lived - he went with us to the end of Church-street, then put his boards down, and would not go any further - the clerk left us to go for an officer - a woman came up - the prisoner spoke to her - she took a cedar board which the prisoner had, and went away with it - I sent the porter with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. There was a man named Lloyd taken up? A. Yes - I have heard the woman who came to the prisoner was Lloyd's wife - Lloyd brought the veneers back.</p>

            . I live at No. 41, Lothbury, and am housekeeper to Mr. Pearce. On the 17th of May, the prisoner came in the morning with a boy, and swept one chimney - he came again in the afternoon and swept two more - I then paid him 3s. for them, for his master, Mr. Badger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. When was your attention drawn to this circumstance? A. About a fortnight after it took place - I put down this money in my pay books, but it is not here - I did not say, when I paid the prisoner, "This is for Mr. Badger" - I said, "There is the money for sweeping the chimney."</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you give the boy some halfpence? A. Yes, I did - I sent to Mr. Badger, and this person came about nine o'clock in the morning, and about four or five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time did you see the sacks taken from the cart? A. About two o'clock - it was broad daylight - it was about three hundred yards from the station-house - Constable at once acknowledged that Crouch's van had been there - he never attempted to deny it - he said there was a hurry of business that day - I do not know that there was such a hurry of business that the men were not allowed to have their dinner - the men gave fair straight-forward answers.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you ascertained whether there was any hurry that day? A. There was - it was not a hurry that would excuse such an omission as that - Constable has been in my employ sixteen or eighteen years, and Parker six or seven - I have three or four other men regularly in my employ, and many others occasionally - Samuel Weller was a porter at my house that day, and I think he has been so since - he had been occasionally employed by my foreman before - he was taken as a witness before the Grand Jury, but it was for the purpose of the prisoners, I think - I did not inquire of him whether that was a hurried day or not.</p>

            . I am son of the prosecutor. I made out the order for the delivery of the twenty quarters of oats - I remember the officer coming, and I delivered this sample to him which I took from the bulk in our granary, from which Crouch's corn was delivered - I have compared it with the sample taken from the two sacks, and the sample from the thirty-six quarters - it is my firm belief they are all from the same bulk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there not more corn like this in the kingdom? A. I dare say there is a good deal - this corn is particularly long - there may be thousands of quarters of this sort - it is Irish oats.</p>

            . I am a corn-dealer, and live at Upper Edmonton. On the 19th of May, I purchased twenty quarters of corn for my sister - I gave this order to Hilton for thirteen quarters, and I gave him twenty-six sacks for it - the officer brought home twenty-six sacks of corn, and he took a sample.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you swear before the Magistrate "I did not measure the corn?" A. I did measure it after it came out of the van - I could not say I did not measure it - I did not say so to my recollection - I forget whether I did not.</p>

            . I was in the employ of the prosecutor on the day this happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you been there before? A. Perhaps a week or two - I never saw Constable or Parker except when I was at work there - the day stated was a very busy one - Constable's wife brought his dinner to him, but he had not time to eat it - I had no communication with Parker and Constable to induce them to say it was a busy day - there had been a mistake in counting sacks a day or two before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time of day was it the dinner was brought by the wife? A. I suppose about twelve o'clock - I cannot say how long the wife waited - to the best of my recollection, Crouch's van was there from eleven to twelve o'clock - I cannot say whether the dinner came while the van was there.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you help to load the van? A. No; I saw Constable and Parker filling sacks - the sacks were brought up by a truck or on a man's back - I cannot tell whether there were more than twenty-six sacks.</p>

            . I am clerk to the magistrates at Worship-street. I took down from Hilton's mouth what he said when called on for his defence - I read it to him - he did not sign it, nor make a mark - it was read it to him - he did not sign it, nor make a mark - it was read twice to him, and the magistrate signed it - I asked if it was true, and if he had any additions to make. (Read.) "The prisoner Hilton says, I received sacks for thirteen quarters of my master - I only received thirteen quarters of corn from Mr. Lucas's granary; but at Stones-end, a man whom I know by sight but not by name, asked me to carry two sacks of corn for him, and pitch them at the Elephant, which I did."</p>
               <p>"The prisoners, Constable and Parker, said that which was stated by Mr. Lucas and the constable Clark, was correct."</p>
               <p>COURT to J. CLARK. Q. What kind of sacks were those which were taken from the van? A. One was an old flour sack, and the other had the name of "Allen" on it.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mr. LUCAS. Q. What kind of sacks had you in your granary? A. All sorts, almost - I think I might say no flour sacks of my own - I am not aware whether I had any with the name of "Allen" on them.</p>
               <p>COURT to J. V. CROUCH. Q. What kind of sacks did you give Hilton? A. Some of my own, and some with odd marks - I do not know whether I had any with the name of"Allen" on them - I have known Hilton for nearly four years, he had a very good character.</p>
               <p>(James Winch, a publican, gave Lewis a good character; and Andrew Realton, of Edmonton, gave Hilton a good character.)</p>

             dragged me away, I saw my husband down on the ground, and

             over him - I did not see him do any thing to him; only I heard my husband say, before I brought him home, that he was kicked and stamped on by Maconolly - I helped to take my husband away - he walked about twenty yards, and then fell down in the street - Maconolly followed him - I did not see the prisoner follow him - Maconolly was daring my husband with his fist, when he followed him, to hit him, and to hit me too - Maconolly did not strike him after that - when my husband got up he was retching - he complained of his stomach, putting his hand to it - I got two men to help him home; he was not able to walk without assistance - he was very bad that night, retching and screaming. On Sunday morning, I observed about a thimbleful of blood that came from him - it went down through him - Mr. Walker, a surgeon, saw him, and he was carried to the London Hospital in a cradle - I saw him in the hospital, and attended him till he died, which was the Wednesday following, about one o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the prisoner put his hand on him, and want him to go to another public-house, was it done in an angry manner or not? A. I did not think that it was; he said he would give him half a gallon of beer if he would go- the public-house is quite close to where we lived - I cannot tell what he received for his pay; he sometimes had more and sometimes less - I took out of his pocket, (when he was brought home, before he went to the hospital,) half-a-sovereign and three shillings - I told him I had taken out what was in his pocket - he was in great pain; he did not tell me what money he should have in his pocket - he had nothing that I know of in his pocket when he went out that morning - when he received his wages he always came home and gave me what he wished - I cannot tell whether he had any more money in his pocket than what I found - I did not see any attempt made by any body to take any money from him; if any thing of that sort had happened in the public-house I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Maconolly here? A. No - he is about twenty-one or twenty-two years old,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030064"/>and a strong hale young man - when the prisoner offered to treat my husband it was all in friendship - Maconolly was on the spot when my husband complained that he had kicked him while he was down, and he appeared in a passion - and he faced me with his fist when my husband was on the ground.</p>

I knew William Smith - he was seventeen years old - he used to stop with his mother, in the daytime, in Blue Anchor-yard - I do not know where he slept - on a Tuesday in June, I was looking out of my window, nearly opposite his mother's, and saw the prisoner, George Soden, in the room with Smith - he was beating the boy Smith right and left - I did not see Smith strike the prisoner at all - they were on the opposite side of the street, in the house - I could see through their window - a man named Taylor was in the room, holding a candle to light him - I saw the prisoner, Elizabeth Hawker - she hallooed up stairs, "Go it, George, go it; you cannot give him too much" - she is the landlady of the house - I continued looking at them for half an hour - this went on for full half an hour - I cannot tell what the cause of it was - I heard the boy say, "George, do not do it any more" - Hawker called a man down, and told him to go and fetch a policeman - the person came back with one; and she ordered the policeman to go up stairs and fetch the woman down who belonged to the prisoner - that was his mother - I cannot say whether she was in the room, but I saw a woman there - Hawker was not in the room - the policeman said it was more than his place was worth, and he went away - he said if he took any body, it ought to be the man who was drunk in front of the door; that was the prisoner Soden - he was down there when the policeman came - he did not take him, but went away - he was quiet then - the next thing I saw was Hawker fastening the door - I went to bed directly afterwards.</p>

Not afterwards - but when they were coming home, before this happened, I saw them come out of Gardener's-lane; the mother, the son, and the prisoners, all four together - it was about eight o'clock in the evening, (before this happened) - Soden was drunk then- I did not notice that Hawker was - Mrs. Smith was in liquor - Smith himself did not appear in liquor - I did not see Taylor till he was holding the candle in the room - next morning (Tuesday) I went with Smith, the deceased, by his mother's desire, to a new lodging, and I carried him to a public-house, just below the hospital in King's Head-court - he was very bad indeed - he could not stand on hand or foot, and could not walk without assistance - when I saw Soden strike right and left, it was done with his fist; there were no sticks used that I saw.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. The deceased, the prisoner, and the deceased's mother, all lived together, did not they? A. They did in the daytime; but I cannot say about the night - I was in my room opposite their window - my window is a middling way from the ground - I could see out into the prisoners' window - I had seen them quarrelling before that - when they came out of Gardener's-lane they went up into the room - that might be a quarter or half an hour before - I did not see them at the Feathers - I did not see the first beginning of it - the female prisoner sent for the policeman, and he said he should take charge of the man who was drunk in the street - Soden was very drunk indeed; Hawker was not drunk; Smith was not drunk, that I could see; I was about ten yards from him - he was at the old lodging next morning, and I carried him to the new lodging - I saw him on the bare floor next morning, there being no bed - I did not see the prisoner next morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The deceased called out, "Father, come up-stairs?" A. Yes; and I interfered, fearing there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030066"/>would be another row - when I saw this, I was standing on the iron plate over the water-cock, and could see the prisoner and the deceased - I saw them at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole time that you were looking in at the window, you are quite sure you stood on the water-cock? A. I did; what I saw of the striking I saw there - while I saw him hit I was standing there - I saw Soden's face scratched - I did not see him go to the pump and wash his face - I never had any quarrel with the prisoner, quite the reverse - I never said I would try to get him in trouble to any body - I am certain I did not say so to James Taylor, nor any thing to that effect.</p>

            . I am the deceased's mother - his name was William - I was on the landing-place of the lodging, and when I got into the room, there was the prisoner Soden, the deceased, and the man with a candle in the room - I had not come home with them - I had not been in their company - I had been moving my things all day, with my son and another man from two o'clock - I had come in out of Gardeners-lane - the boy and I went and stood in Gardeners-lane, and Soden went with his sister-in-law - we came in from Gardeners-lane together - my son went up stairs first - I had the key and unlocked the door - Soden was gone then to the Broadway - this was in the daytime.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, at night, Soden and your son, and a man with a candle in his hand, were in the room? A. Yes; I saw them fighting one another - the boy fighting the man as well as the man fighting the boy - I prevented it as far as my strength would allow - this did not last five minutes after I got in - I could not get into the room at first, as the landlady detained me on the stairs, calling me names not fit to mention, and she kept calling out, "Give it him, George. You cannot give it him too much" - there never was a better man in England than the prisoner is - he never would have done it, if it had not been for her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they quarrel about? A. The lad had been six weeks on his hands, and he called him lazy for not looking about for work, as he supported him - this lasted about five minutes after I got in - they had been fighting a long time before - I heard them, but could not get to them - I was knocked down in the passage myself, and beaten, and got a bite on my flesh - Soden hit me, which he never did in his life before - he was very drunk indeed - I saw Taylor - he did nothing that I saw, but he would not offer to part them - he held the candle - I had been to the Feathers that afternoon - Soden and my son were both there - they began quarrelling there, and began to fight - I think, to tell the truth, my son began it - the prisoner never hurt him in his life, and would not have done it if it had not been for the landlady - they fought there, and that was where Soden got his face scratched and his shirt torn - the boy had been saucy to Hawker in Gardeners-lane, between one and two o'clock, and she beat him herself then - I told her that she ought to send for a policeman and give him in charge, and not beat him in that dreadful manner. After all this was over, we three remained in the room, because I could not find the key to go to the new lodging - Soden, myself, and my son, all slept there that night - we had nothing to sleep on but the boards - I had removed the bed and every thing but a chair - I could not get the key of the lodging, because the deceased had it in his pocket, and I did not know it - he was taken to the new lodging next morning, and I went to Mr. Davis to see him - he lived eighteen days after this - I always kept asking him if he complained of any particular part - he said, "No, mother" - only his limbs were useless, like a baby.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The deceased had insulted Hawker in the first instance? A. Yes; he used ill-language to her, and she beat him - I did not see Soden interfere to separate them at the Feathers - the deceased and Soden rushed out together, and I could not see who struck - I went with the deceased to the Feathers, and the prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came out of the Feathers, did not the deceased use some expressions to him? A. I could not tell, there was such a mob of people - they were quarrelling, but I could not understand the words - I did not see the prisoner thrown down on the curb - I saw him washing his face from the blood caused by the scratches - that was after he had been fighting with my boy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was not your son taken to the hospital? A. Yes, two days before he died.</p>

            . I am an assistant-surgeon at the Western Hospital, in the medical department. I went to the lodgings in King's-head-buildings by desire of the house-surgeon - I found the boy in a state of general paralysis - I think this was on Wednesday, the 24th of June - he was perfectly sensible - I examined him, and found a tenderness and good deal of pain in the region of the back of the neck - I made inquiry, suspecting he had received some injury - he complained of pain at the back of the neck - I did not observe any external bruise - he said he was unable to move either of his limbs; and he had no sensation, or very trifling - his symptoms agreed with paralysis - he did not complain of any injury - I saw no more of him till he came into the hospital on the following Tuesday, the 10th of June - I attended him there on Tuesday morning, at half-past eleven o'clock - I opened the body after death - there was one bruise on his right buttock - it was merely a bruise of the integument, a superficial bruise - there was a fracture of the fifth joint of the neck, that would affect the spinal marrow - the concussion caused by the blow would produce an injury to the spinal marrow, by causing an extravasation of blood on the spinal marrow, which I observed, and very great congestion - the blood-vessels were ruptured, and the blood was in the spinal canal - the spinal marrow itself was healthy - the vessels of the brain were very much gorged with blood; but the brain itself was healthy - I opened the chest - both the lungs were gorged with blood, and continued distended - there were some old adhensions of the right lung to the sides of the chest - I have no doubt that was the result of a former inflammation, of perhaps two years' standing - the recent injury of the spinal marrow caused the congestion of the blood on the lungs: that congestion might certainly have arisen from natural causes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it likely to have occurred to a person having the appearances you have described; I mean the adhesion from the former disease? A. No; because there was no disease in the structure of the lungs - I believe the immediate cause of his death was suffocation from the conges<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030067"/>tion of the lungs, produced by the extravasation of blood on the spinal marrow, which was caused by a blow, I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You state a blow on the back of the neck might have produced the injury to the vessels close to the spinal marrow, and that produce paralysis - how long, in your opinion, would it take to produce death? A. If the injury had been higher up, death would have taken place immediately; but I think, where it was, life might be continued about ten days - it is possible the injury might have been inflicted a fortnight before he died - a fall a fortnight before might have produced concussion.</p>
               <p>MARGARET SMITH re-examined. My son was in very good health before this - he never complained - he slept during the night after this happened; but kept me turning him from one side to the other all night.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say, when you saw your son and the prisoner scuffling, you were detained on the landing-place? A. Yes, by the woman - she did not hold me; but I could not get past her - she stopped the way - she prevented me, by abusing me and calling me names - she did not stand in my way, and say I should not go in - Soden and myself lived together as man and wife.</p>
               <p>Soden's Defence. There was a chest of drawers in the room on the night the deceased came in - it was about four feet high - some time after that, when the mother thought the boy in danger, she observed to me, "I had sooner you had taken a stick and beaten him; for his death might be caused through throwing him against those drawers" - after the mother's leaving him in the hospital, she returned to the room, which I pay the rent of, and said in a flurry, "I have put my son in the name of Smith - I have done wrong; for it is well known that his name is Longford" - I attended the inquest by order of the beadle - I cannot think of any thing being in the room but the empty drawers - I was taken up in the room, and laid down in a state of intoxication, having my shirt torn, and very bloody from the injuries I had received at the Feathers - I was supporting the boy with what I could get- he has lifted a poker two or three times to me, and called me all the bad names he could think of.</p>
               <p>Hawker's Defence. I came home about half-past two o'clock, and while we were drinking some beer, Mrs. Smith came in and called me most abusive names, and the boy likewise - I gave him a slap in the face - after I struck him, I came to the door and said, "Mrs. Smith, I insist on your going away;" and she went out in the road - when I came home, about seven o'clock at night, part of the things were removed by her son and her; and they were quarrelling then certainly; but I do not believe any blows were struck in the room - I did not go up stairs; but I said, "Mrs. Smith, do not make such a noise" - she flung a piece of chest of drawers at me - I went into my own room.</p>
               <p>MARGARET SMITH re-examined. I am the mother of the deceased. He always went by the name of William Smith.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Broadway, Westminster. On the day in question, I was at the premises where the deceased was - about nine o'clock in the evening, I went in - I heard a noise in the room - I called for a light, my son brought me a light - my son lodged in the house - when the light came I saw the deceased standing across Soden, who was down on his back - he struck Soden once in my presence in the face, while Soden was down - I went to put my arms round the deceased, and pulled him away - Soden attempted to get up twice, but was so tipsy he could not - the boy then took off his jacket, and rolled some other articles in it, to make a pillow of it - he put it under Soden's head, and we left them all in the room together, he being so drunk - I left them and went up to my son - this was between nine and half-past nine o'clock - nothing more occurred to me that night - I know the premises well - there is a water-cock on the opposite side - the cock is in a diagonal direction, and the window of the room is at least nine feet higher than the cock - I have not measured it - I have known the prisoner about eight months - I never saw him out of temper, but when he was in liquor - he was merry, but not quarrelsome.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long were you in the room? A. Perhaps a quarter of an hour - but I was in the house about an hour and a half during the quarrel - when the light was brought into the room, I saw the boy across Soden - that was the first thing I saw in the room - I had heard a noise which induced me to go down - I was in the room above - it was a noise as if somebody was attempting to make a louder noise than they did - my son brought me a light - I went to the room, and stayed there a quarter of an hour - I saw Smith standing over Soden, but not the whole time - I dragged him away, and held him on one side a few minutes, while Soden attempted to get up, and Soden fell down again - I said, "Now you see the state your father-in-law is in" - I then let go of him - I saw nothing the matter with Smith at the time, for he went down stairs - he stayed two or three minutes - he came up then, and took his jacket off to put under Soden's head - when he had done so I left them - that was after he had wrapped something up in his jacket - the pillow was not put under his own head - there was nothing apparently the matter with Smith at that time - I never saw Smith struck at all - my son had the candle - he was outside the room with the candle - it was not in the room at all - I did not see it till my son went up stairs - he was called down directly by Mrs. Hawker, to fetch a policeman - when he went for the policeman, he put the candle on the floor - I did not take it up - I never took it in my hand at all - Soden was not able to strike Smith - Smith ran down stairs very lively.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any body say, "Give it him. Taylor?" A. I never heard the words made use of - I never spoke to Woodley - I never saw him till Saturday, I believe, and I did not speak to him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Woodley charge you with holding the candle for Soden to beat the boy? A. I believe it was my son was accused of that- I never heard the words, "It is a d---d lie" - I am sure I did not use these words - I never spoke to Smith in my life - I have seen him backwards and forwards since he lived in the house.</p>

               <p>From the position in which you stood, could you see into the room? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. Then you saw no fighting at all? A.

               <p>Q. Did you hear anybody say, "Go it - give it him, Taylor?" A. No: nobody said it that I heard - Smith seemed quite well - he did not seem as if anything was the matter - he ran down stairs when I called him, and said he was quite well - I have never seen him since.</p>

I measured the place - the water-cock stands opposite the window - it is twenty-two inches high from the ground, and covered with an iron sheeting - I could not stand on it, and it is impossible for any person, if the prisoner and the others were on the floor in the opposite room, if a man was twelve feet high, to see them, for the window-sill is ten feet two inches from the ground - if the party were standing up they could see their bodies, but if on the ground, it would be utterly impossible.</p>

            . I am a marble mason, and live in Blue Anchor-yard. I saw the transaction from the beginning to the end - I saw young Taylor walking round the room, with the candle in his hand, while the prisoner struck the deceased - I do not recollect the day - it was on a Monday, the day before he left the lodgings - I saw the prisoner strike him several times with his right hand and left - both - and Taylor followed him with the light - I saw him strike him several times, and the boy fell - I saw no more of him, till after that Soden came down stairs - Elizabeth Hawker stood on the stairs crying out, "Go it, George! - Give it him! Give it him! You cannot give it him too much!" - I was at my own window, almost opposite theirs - it is not directly opposite - I could not see into the room - when he had got his satisfaction he came down stairs, she called him into her room, and said, "Come in, George, I have a drop of gin for you" - I saw no more of it afterwards - I had seen no quarrel between the female prisoner and the deceased - nor the scuffle at the Feathers - I saw the whole transaction in the room - I was standing at my window when I saw Hawker take Soden by the arm - he was in the hall, coming out of the door, and she dragged him in - I could see him very well - my window was open - young Taylor was holding the candle with his left hand while Soden struck the boy - Soden was standing up - I did not see the other Taylor there - he was not there - I saw the deceased holding his father-in-law's shoulder while he was being struck by him (the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Smith held his father-in-law's shoulder? A. Yes, while his father was striking him - I saw the policeman after it was over - I did not see him go into the room. I am quite sure the other Taylor was not there.</p>
               <p>COURT to ALFRED HALL. Q. You describe the injury to be at the back of the neck, you are of opinion that death was caused by that injury? Yes: it consisted of extravasion of blood in the spinal process of the vertebrae of the neck - a blow from a fist I think would not do it  - a fall against a door or drawers might occasion it.</p>

            . I am a conveyancer, living in Blomfield-street - the prisoner was my clerk about nine or ten months, and left me on the 12th of May - I sent him that evening to collect some rents at the west end of the town - he did not return - he had given me no notice - I saw him again about the 3rd of June, at the station-house - I had not seen him in the interval - I never gave him that cheque for any purpose - I know nothing of it - I never saw it before the transaction in question - I do not know William Harrison - the name of Temple on the back is not my handwriting, it is very little like mine - I know the prisoner's handwriting, and believe the whole of the cheque to be his handwriting - I cannot say whether the name on the back is written by him, but I rather think by the general character of the writing that it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say you believe the whole of that writing to be his? A. Yes, I do - the whole, except the banker's name across - that certainly is not his - I have had no treaty with the prisoner about settling this matter - I swear that I never asked him if he would work it out - he submitted to me that he would do it - I said that was out of the question - I never said if he would work it out I would pay the money to the prosecutor - he submitted to me that he would work out the money which he had received, and not accounted for - I said that was out of the question, on account of the amount - the prisoner's father lives in Castle-street, Holborn - the prisoner was taken into custody on the 3d of June - I have been to his father's house since that, about a fortnight ago - I think only once, since the 3d of June - I was there before, making inquiry about him - my object in going there was to tell the father I was very much surprised at his having recommended his son to me, with a knowledge, that in an office he had been in before mine, he had abstracted money from his employers - I saw nobody but the father - I never talked to him about settling it - nor ever asked him to settle it - I swear that most solemnly - my profession leads me to advance money, and issue advertisements for the loan of money - I am a money lender, and a certificated conveyancer.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are Mr. Temple's brother-in-law? Is there any similarity between the endorsement and the body of the cheque? A. The T is formed like the T the prisoner wrote at the office - there is not any very great similarity except that.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You would not swear, I am sure, that the bag you saw fall was the same bag exactly as you saw Harris carry? A. I do not know how I could positively swear it was the same bag, because it was out of my sight a minute or two - I should consider there was no other bag - I will not swear it was the same bag - how is it possible I can? - I should not like to swear it - I did not take particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When was it that you had seen Hartrup with Harris? A. I think on the Tuesday morning as I sat at breakfast - my husband heard him go in, and could swear to him by his walk - he said, "There goes Harris" - I got up and looked out of the window and saw it was him - I do not know whether they talked together at that time; but I saw him go into Harris's house - they did not talk together in my hearing- on the Wednesday night before that, in Vine-place, they were both together, and I heard them talk - I do not know what time it was - that was the time I heard Harris call Hartrup "Master" - I have been in trouble before, and Mr. Clarkson defended me - that was last September twelve months - I was charged with stealing some ribbons in the other court - I remained here five days after my trial - Mr. Harris and his wife had been twitting me about that - they told me I had been tried - I do not owe them any spite for that - I do not associate with them - I have not spoken to them - they continually upbraided my child with my fault.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were convicted - were you imprisoned five days? A. Yes - Harris upbraided my innocent child, who is not ten years old - that was most undoubtedly one of the motives that made me watch him- I saw no bag that morning, except the one which was thrown out of the window - the alley is wide enough for people to pass and repass - whether it is six feet, or more, I cannot tell - the bag I saw on Harris's shoulder looked like the same bag I saw fall - it was the same colour and bulk - I did not see any other person come out of the alley with any bag - I did not see any bag in the alley after he brought that one away.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HALES. I am the husband of Elizabeth Hales. I know both the prisoners perfectly well - Harris lives three doors from me - I have seen the other prisoner coming to Harris's place - on the 14th of May I saw the prisoners coming through Spitalfields Market, and go into a gin-shop - I saw them come out of the gin-shop - my wife followed them directly afterwards - I saw them go towards Union-street, East - I did not follow them farther.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live at No. 14, Priest's-alley, about a dozen yards from the Excise Office window. On Wednesday morning, the 14th of May, I was standing at my door about eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner Harris opposite the Excise window - I saw the Excise shutters open, and a sack thrown out - the prisoner took it up, and walked down the court with it - I had seen him there before - I never saw Hartrup before - I know Harris by seeing him twice in the Court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When did you first go to tell the Excise of it? A. I did not go to tell them - they came to me - a gentleman came - I told him what I had seen - he asked if I had seen a bag thrown out of the window - I told him "Yes" - he asked if it was a man named Harris - I said "Yes" - he took down my evidence - he said I should not lose my time - I did not ask what I should have for my time - he did not mention what I was to have - I sell fruit in the street, and I expect to be paid for my lost time; but I do not know how much.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I ask you, did the gentleman in any way tell you, you should be paid for giving false evidence, or doing what was wrong? A.

            . I am a sergeant of the H division of police. Craig brought Harris with the sack to me - I was on duty in Denmark-street, on the 14th of May - I examined it - it contained Excise papers - I asked the prisoner where he brought them from - he said from the Excise Office, Tower-hill, and he was going to take them to Mrs. Davis, in St. Mary Axe, who contracted for store papers - I asked him if he had any account of the weight - he said he had not - I asked if he was in the habit of carrying them in that way - he said he was repeatedly, when Mrs. Davis was short of paper - I asked if he in general carried them without an invoice to show the weight - he said he never had an invoice - I said I did not believe that was the way the Excise did business; I should send a man to inquire, and detain him till I found the truth - I asked him to refer me to the man at the office who gave him the bag - he said he did not know his name, he believed he was a sort of foreman there - I asked if he knew any body there he could refer me to - he said he did not know any one - that was all that passed then - I sent Craig with a sample of the papers to the Excise Office, and detained the prisoner and sack till he came back - I had received private information, and went to the Excise Office in Broad-street, City, and apprehended Hartrup near upon eleven o'clock - I saw him in a room belonging to the sorting department of the store papers - I asked him if he had been that morning to Tower-hill - he said he had - I asked if he had called at Spitalfields market on his road there - he said he had not - I asked if he went in the coat he then had on, or the one which hung up in the room - he said the one which hung up - I asked if he had seen the prisoner Harris that morning - he said he had not - I asked if he had not seen him, and drank with him that morning - he said not - I asked if any body accompanied him down to Tower-hill to the Excise Office - he said no one - I asked him if he had ever drank with Harris at all previous to that - he said he had, when he had been employed by Mrs. Davis, when she moved papers, but not on that morning, nor had he seen him that morning - I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know Mrs. Davis? A. I do not - I have seen Excise papers before - I do not know that the Excise are in the habit of selling waste paper, Except that the prisoner said Mrs. Davis contracted for the waste paper - I never saw a sale made myself - all my questions were put on mere speculation to ascertain the truth, which it is my duty to do - I was in the station-house, and he was brought in to me - he did not satisfy me - it was before I thought proper to lock him up I questioned him, to ascertain whether it was correct or not, but not with any view to give evidence - I was there to take charge of persons, and do the duty of the inspector in his absence - I consider it was my duty to question him- that is my instructions, which I receive from Colonel Rowan and Mr. Mayne - it is my duty to ask questions, to ascertain whether a parcel has been stolen or honestly come by - I do not take down in writing the answers they give.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him before you examined him you would give evidence of his answers on his trial? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The man was brought to you after you had received information; had you received information? A. I had not previous to his being brought in - I received it during the time he was brought in - I put the questions on the speculation of my own mind - the constable brought him in, and said, "I don't think this is all right" - the papers are returns which come in from the different districts for different years, some as late as 1829 - no man could look at these, and not know they were Excise papers - some of them are returns of tobacco districts, tea districts, and other things - they are waste paper.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in St. Mary Axe. I know the prisoners - I did not employ them on the 14th of May to bring any paper to me - I had not purchased any at that time - I am in the habit of buying waste paper from the Excise - we contract for the whole of it - it is brought to us in carts or waggons - we contract for it at a regular price - when they wish to part with it, they give us notice - we never have it in that way; we have notice to receive it, and some gentlemen are appointed to see it weighed - it is never sent out without our having notice of it - when they wish to send it, they give us notice, and we endeavour to take it as soon as we can.</p>
               <p>Q. They don't of their own authority, and without notice to you, send any quantity they have? A. They do not - we fetch it away in carts and wagons, at our own expense, and my sister attends to see it weighed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been connected with the Excise? A. About twenty years - we buy the paper by the son - we pay £28 for a ton of it - this sack weighs nearly 1 cwt. without the sack.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not the Excise sometimes sent paper to you when you did not expect it? A. No; not that I know of- it has not come when I did not expect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not sometimes happened, that they came when you did not expect them - have they not sent you paper without regular notice? A. No; there has been one bag, or two, which we had not notice of - they came in bags, not in wagons - I cannot tell how long it is since the last bag came in that way - my sister can tell better than I can - she manages the concern - it was brought, I know - I cannot say how long ago it is - it is a few months back - it was only that time it came in a bag without notice - I do not think I was present when it came - it was taken in and kept, but we gave notice immediately at the office, that a bag of paper was brought - that was recognised by the office, and I paid for it - it was only in that single instance - I did not think of that before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to swear none ever came except in carts and wagons? A. That is the regular way for it to come - no other instance occurred to my knowledge, but I cannot positively swear it - we had employed Harris about two years ago - he used to come with the cart to bring the Excise papers - he brought that one bag without a cart - he has never been in the habit of bringing papers, never but that one - he always accompanied the cart or wagon.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. For two years past he has come with the cart<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030073"/>and wagon, and in the particular instance in question, he brought the sack? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. And only once in a sack? A. Not to my knowledge or belief - within a few days after he brought the sack, my sister applied to the Excise - we made it known to them, and they acknowledged the sale - it was a sack that was left behind, as we understood.</p>
               <p>Q. When paper was brought, was it a custom to bring any document from the Excise? A. No - because there are always two officers to weigh it, and my sister attends the weighing - my sister always has the management of the business - she would know whether things are regular or not- it would be her duty not to keep the sack if it was irregular.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When that sack was sent in, was any account of the weight sent with it? A. No; I understood it had been weighed, and was left behind.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the weight of the sack come to you from the Excise office? A. No; it was weighed with others at the office - they always came weighed - I did not say the sack was paid for separately.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying, you did not pay for it separately? A. I cannot explain things - my sister can explain it - I cannot answer questions that I know nothing of.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You had been dealing with the Excise for papers for twenty years? A. Yes; I always know the quantity I am to have from them - the paper is weighed at the Excise office by two Excise officers, generally in the presence of my sister, and then I have to pay £28 per ton for what is delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the circumstance happened some months ago, about a sack being brought - did you speak from your own information and knowledge, or were you present? A. I spoke from information - my sister went afterwards to the office about it - I never go - I know nothing of it except what I was told - my sister had been to the Excise office just before the 14th of May - no paper whatever was to be delivered to us on the 14th of May - we had no expectation of any.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I understand you to have no expectation on the 14th of May of the particular sack forming the subject of inquiry to-day? A. No; nor had I of the delivery of the sack, of which I gave notice to the Excise - my sister can answer that.</p>

            . I am the sister of Ursula Davis, and carry on business with her in St. Mary Axe. I transact the business for her with the Excise, on Tower-hill - I generally conduct the business - the Excise let us know when there is any paper to be removed - the store-keeper lets us know - the store-keeper either comes to me or I go to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever have Excise papers delivered on your premises, except in consequence of such notice given one way, or the other? A. On one occasion a bag of paper was brought by Harris, and I went to Mr. Powell, the sorter - I was not at home when Harris brought it - I went to Powell, and told him Harris had brought a bag of paper which I had weighed, and gave him the account of the weight, and they had it put down with a load of paper, and it was paid for - it was paid for with a load of paper which was brought afterwards - I had known beforehand that the load of paper of which this was to form a part was to be delivered to us - that was weighed by the two persons authorized to weigh.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you received the bag, did you know you were going to receive a load? A. I think not - there was generally some time between one load and another - I know of another instance where a separate bag was brought, which Mr. Mayhew has a receipt for, that was sent by the storekeeper - this is the receipt which was had for it - Mr. Taylor is store-keeper - I was made acquainted with this sack before it was delivered - I had a knowledge of that bag coming before it was delivered, from an order from Mr. Taylor, the store-keeper - that was another transaction, for which a separate receipt was given - that was not part of any load that was delivered - it was a distinct thing. (Receipt read.) "Old Acts of Parliament belonging to William Parish, Esq., late commissioner, - of cwt. paid to the store-keeper.

            ." Those were old Acts of Parliament - quite a separate transaction to the Excise papers - I believe Hartrup brought that sack - on the 13th of May I went to the Excise office about some papers - I saw Mr. Powell in Hartrup's presence - I told Mr. Powell we should be glad to receive a load of paper on Thursday, the 15th, and they were to be got ready to be delivered that morning - I had not employed any body on the 14th to receive any part of that paper for me - about a fortnight before that, Harris had assisted in bringing a load home - Hartrup knew of my being engaged in purchasing papers - he has assisted in weighing it - I should think he knew the whole process well - neither Hartrup nor Harris had any commission from me to send or bring any paper on the 14th - the paper was to be brought down to the Excise office on Tower-hill, weighed, put into a van, and brought home - I was to send the van for it - that is always the way the business is conducted - they employ persons to weigh it, and I find the van and take it away at my own expense - I said nothing to Powell in Hartrup's presence, except that I should be glad to receive about a ton and half on Thursday morning, if it could be got ready - Hartrup was in the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you, on any occasion, employ Hartrup to do any thing with the paper to be delivered to you? A. Nothing; only to get it down from the rooms it was in, ready to be weighed.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Hartrup employed by you or by the Excise? A. He was to be paid by us for getting the papers down stairs - he is employed by the Excise generally - it was to be brought from the rooms where it was deposited up stairs, - I am not in the habit of going up the stairs, but it came from rooms above.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have mentioned a second instance of some irregularity in the delivery of waste papers from the Excise - my friend asks if they were not old Acts of Parliament? whatever they were, did you pay for them to the Excise as waste paper? A. To the store-keeper - I did not on account of the Excise - I paid the store-keeper, but had a separate receipt, and not from the Excise - I did not intend the money for that to go to the Excise - it was paper belonging to one of the commissioners - I do not know him - my sister knows very little of the transactions.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030074"/>Q. Do you remember the sack that came by mistake? A. The one brought by Harris, I remember it being brought to our house - we did not expect that sack, but afterwards gave notice to the excise of the receipt - they recognised it, and received payment from me - I had no notice of the sack originally - it was a sack of waste paper - Harris brought it - Mr. Powell was the gentleman I accounted to - Mr. Taylor is a clerk in the store-office - he sold me the Acts of Parliament.</p>

            . I am sorter of old stores, at the Excise office. I remember Miss Fellowes coming to the office - I do not recollect the day - I remember the day the prisoners were taken up - I think Miss Fellowes had been there three days before that - some store were to be made up, to be delivered on the Thursday - the day after the prisoners were taken up - Thursday would be the 15th - on the 14th, about twenty minutes past six in the morning, I went to the front gate, at Tower-hill, and rang the bell - I went up stairs - there are two staircases - Bateman's rooms are at the foot of the staircase in Tower-street - I went up the other staircase - I was not on the staircase which it is said Hartrup went up - I had not been into the room the paper was in for six weeks - the room the papers were kept in is in front of Tower-hill - the books were cut, and left there to be taken away, about a ton at a time, by Mrs. Davis - they are survey books, and documents belonging to them - the books she was to take away were only survey books - there were no papers of this kind for her to take away - she said herself she would take about a ton and a half - there is nothing there but survey books - they were old books - we call them survey books - there was no waste, but survey books - these papers are daily entries - they were not in the same place- the store-keeper determines what shall be sent - I am not a store-keeper - this is waste paper, but not survey books.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the waste paper to be sold put into one particular room, or dispersed in many rooms? A. It is put into one place when it is to be sold - there is not any such books, as those produced, put into that place - the waste paper is intended to be deposited in the upper room, that faces Tower-hill - it cannot, by any means, except improper ones, be in the lower room, fronting Priest's-alley - there is no waste paper, intended to be sold, in that room looking into Priest's alley - the paper is taken down from the chief office in Broad-street - it is kept there seven years- it is then all taken up to the top room, to be cut with the machine - this has not been cut with the machine - it was to be sold shortly, but not at present - this is not cut with a machine, nor would this sort of paper be cut with the machine before it is sold - it must be weighed before it is sold or delivered - I had been on duty there on the 13th - I had been there about three months - I had not been there all that day - I was there that morning about twenty minutes after six - no paper had been weighed that morning - it could not have been weighed without my knowledge - Hartrup is at times employed about the Excise office, at Tower-hill - he had no business up that staircase that morning, that I know of.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If he was engaged in moving paper, who would tell him what to take and bring down? A. He was to receive his orders from me, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say you were not there overnight? A. Not all day - I was there in the morning - I left at three o'clock - I went at four - I again left at half-past five - we all left then.</p>
               <p>Q. If paper had been weighed the night before, or in the day, would it be separated from the bulk so as to be known that it was weighed? A. Yes - there was none separated - the store-keeper's name is Cox; he cannot give directions to move paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Three months ago, we hear a bag was delivered which did not go in any wagon or cart, did you deliver that? A. I did not; I had weighed it with the rest of the paper the day she took a load - a sack was weighed and left behind - I and Cox weighed it with the rest of the paper, and it was paid for- it is my business to see that it is delivered - Hartrup sent it down before I gave my orders for it - whether it was paid for with another load I cannot say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are we to understand in that case Hartrup took on himself to deliver the paper without your taking any step to weigh it, or otherwise? A. It had been weighed with the rest of the paper, a day or so before, and left behind - he sent Harris to take it down - she was not charged with what she had, or it would be charged twice; for Hartrup told me it was left behind after being brought down - it was weighed, as I understood - I had nothing to do with weighing that - I weigh all the paper - they had no business to take it away - it left the premises, I did not weigh it afterwards - I had superintended the weighing of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you in the habit of giving strangers your basket to carry? A. No - I did not promise to give them any thing to drink at the Hop Pole - I had not been there often before - I did not tell the prisoner I was going in there - I have not seen my husband for fifteen or eighteen months.</p>

             (police-constable G 217). I was on duty in the City-road, on the 12th of June, about half-past eight o'clock - I saw the prisoner in Featherstone-street, with these two sashes on his shoulder - I asked him where he brought them from - he said from home, and he was going to take them over the water - I asked, "Where?" he said that was his business - I took him, and found the owner of the sashes.</p>

I was in Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner and another lad standing at a show - one of them had a handkercheif - they then went on - I followed them- I saw them crowd together against the prosecutrix, and the prisoner was rummaging about her clothes - I saw his hand in her pocket-hole, and he took something out - I then saw her pocket hanging out - the prisoner ran off - I told the policeman, who ran and took him - he said he had nothing about him, and he had not, but a young man got a light, and we found this purse just by a grating where the prisoner fell down - we heard it fall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him turn her pocket out? A. Yes; she was going along in the crowd - she was not sensible of what was done till another lad went and told her - I did not tell her that his hand was in her clothes - I was waiting for a policeman - I had just left work - I had not been home - I saw my sister, who said my father was not at home, and I went to take a walk - it was not very dark - I saw him put his hand into her pocket, and heard the purse fall.</p>

On Friday, the 23rd of May, I missed a piece of silk, about thirty-nine yards - in consequence of information I went to Mr. Soper, the manufacturer, in Spital-square - I then went to Mr. Barnard in London-wall - he is a parasol maker - I saw some parasols made of the silk I had lost, or similar silk - these are them - I then went with the policeman to the prisoner - Mr. Barnard questioned him as to the piece of goods which he had bought of him the Monday previous - the prisoner replied, he knew nothing at all about it - that he had never sold him any silk, or words to that effect - this parasol is one which had been cut from the piece of silk - there had been forty-two yards, and this reduced it to about thirty-nine yards - these parasols found at Mr. Barnard's appear to be the same silk - there is a defect in the figure which appears in the parasols.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it an uncommon pattern? A. Yes - I do not mean that there is no more of this pattern - I found the silk six days after I missed it.</p>

            . I am a silk-manufacturer, and live in Spital-square. In consequence of what I heard from Wilson, I went to Barnard's house - he is an umbrella and parasol maker - I saw these parasols in a box in his house- I know they are made of this silk which I made last year, it is a pattern I made for Mr. Wilson exclusively, till the close of May, 1833 - here is a particular mark in these parasols, by which I am quite sure they are made from the same piece as the parasol produced by Mr. Wilson- the cane was perhaps one hundred yards - it contained two or three pieces.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did you make the pattern for Mr. Wilson exclusively? A. Up to May, 1833 - he had perhaps six or seven pieces - I have made the same for eight or ten houses - here is a defect which runs along the whole line of the figure - a part of the white is deficient - I never made any more with this defect in it.</p>

            . I live at No. 45, London Wall, and am an umbrella-maker. I have known the prisoner several years coming to my warehouse to purchase materials for umbrellas - on Sunday morning, the 25th of May, he came and purchased two dozen of pressed horn hooks, two dozen of collars, two dozen of six-inch runners, four dozen of cane ribs, and two dozen of embossed ferrules - he then said, "Mr. Barnard, I have a piece of silk I think will suit you" - I said I would look at it - he untied this silk - I looked at it, and asked what quantity he had - he said twenty-two yards, and it was 5s. a yard - I told him I could purchase from the manufacturer as good silk, or better than that, for that price; but I would give him 4s. 9d. for it - he accepted my offer - it was twenty-two yards - I calculated what it came to - it was 5l. 4s. 6d. - my son was present, and Mr. Millingen was up stairs - I called him down, and borrowed 5l. of him - I paid the prisoner, and he paid for what he purchased of me - I made these parasols out of that silk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you buy it cheap? A. No; not cheap - there was no allowance for any defect in it - I saw no defect - I cut up many hundred yards - I looked at this before I bought it - I asked him if it was honest silk - Millingen was in the shop when I bought it, and he saw it- the prisoner has been in the habit of buying and selling- if I had not known him, I would not have bought it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You asked if it was honest silk, what did you mean by that? A. If he got it fair - he said it was quite right, I might offer it where I pleased.</p>

            . I was present on the 25th of May, when the prisoner came - he opened the silk, and asked my father 5s. a yard for it - my father said he was buying regular silk in the trade for that - my father measured the silk - there were twenty-two yards of it; and he offered him 4s. 9d., which he took - my father asked if I had any money - I said, "No" - he called Mr. Millingen, who lent him 5l.</p>

             (police-constable G 224). I went to the prisoner's house - Mr. Barnard said that the prisoner sold him the silk - Mr. Barnard said to the prisoner, in my presence, that he was the man that sold him the silk which I had seen previously at his house - the prisoner said he did not - I then told the prisoner he was charged with selling a quantity of silk to Mr. Barnard on the Monday previous, which was supposed to have been stolen from Mr. Wilson - he said he did not sell it him, that he was not out of doors on the Monday, and he had witnesses to prove the same - Mr. Barnard told me, in the presence of the prosecutor, that the prisoner sold him the silk on the Monday, and I took him on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Now, mind, I apprise you that what I am about to ask you is of great consequence to Mr. Barnard. Are you quite positive that Mr. Barnard told you that it was on the Monday that he bought the silk of the prisoner? A. Yes; I cannot be mistaken in the day - I am sure the prisoner told Mr. Barnard, when he charged him with having sold it on the Monday, that he could account for his time on the Monday, and that he was not out of the house - Mr. Barnard, in the presence of the prisoner, did not make mention of Monday, but he had to me before we went to the house, and I told the prisoner he had sold it on Monday - Mr. Barnard did not correct me in the day - he never said any thing about Sunday till he was before the magistrate - it was after the prisoner declared he could account for his time on the Monday, that Mr. Barnard changed it to Sunday.</p>
               <p>COURT to MORRIS BARNARD. Q. You told us the prisoner came to you on Sunday, the 25th of May? A. When Mr. Wilson called upon me, on the Thursday, and looked at the parasols, saying, that the silk was stolen from him, I was rather confused, and I did, in mistake, say Monday - I gave Millingen a cheque for the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Mr. Millingen paying his addresses to your daughter? A. Yes. I was confused at the moment Mr. Wilson called, but my memory came back that afternoon, when I came back from the magistrate - I was confused in the prisoner's house - I did not think of the day- I did not correct the prisoner on the spot - I had made a mistake - I first told Mr. Wilson I bought it on the Monday, but I was confused then - I told the policeman so- he came directly afterwards. I was not very well that day - I did not recollect the day exactly; I thought it was Monday - I then walked to the prisoner's house with the policeman - I did not say one word about being mistaken on the walk; I suffered the policeman to tell the prisoner it was Monday; I did not contradict it - I was agitated - I made a mistake in the day - I did not correct the mistake in any way, till the prisoner said he could prove where he was on Monday - I then said it was Sunday - I never discovered the mistake till my witnesses told me I had made a mistake - Sunday is a remarkable day to buy, but I forgot the day - when the prisoner said he could account for every moment of his time, it did not make me remember it; I never gave it a thought - he denied instantly that he had sold it to me - this is the cheque I gave to Millingen for the 5l. he lent me - I told my foreman to be here to prove that the prisoner called at my warehouse, for the ribs I gave the order for - there was no question made by any body at the police-office as to the day - I was not afraid it would be questioned - I have had money transactions with Millingen before - he has lent me money before - I cannot tell how long before; it might be a month before - I cannot tell how much, without I had my cheque-book here; it might be 15l. or 20l., it was not so much as 50l. - I do not know that it was less than 20l. - I will not swear, because I cannot particularly say - my son was in the shop I think half an hour before the prisoner came in - he was doing nothing particular; speaking about the business transactions of the week, it might be - he is at a factory of mine, and sometimes he gave me an account of what was done - he did not come till near the middle of the day - I asked the prisoner for a receipt - he said he could not write- this was in my son's presence - I had known the prisoner nine years - I never knew whether he could write or not, but I asked him to make me out a memorandum, and he said he could not write - Millingen was not present then, but my son was, and he heard it - this cheque is the one I drew on my bankers, Jones, Lloyd, and Co. - it has been to Jones's house - I cannot say when - I never asked Millingen when he paid it into Jones's house, and he never told me - I gave it him on the Monday; I think the morning part - I did not give it him on Sunday, because bankers are not open - he came on Monday, after breakfast - I breakfast about nine o'clock - I cannot say whether it was before dinner; he did not dine with me - I sometimes dine at three, and sometimes at four o'clock - I expected he would get it cashed that day - my house is not two hundred yards from Jones's - I do not think it was after five o'clock when I gave it him - I did not know whether he would get it cashed that day - I did not tell you I expected he would get it cashed that day; he might have done it - he might not have got it for two days - he did not say any thing to me before I gave it him - I was in my counting-house - I do not know that any one was present - my foreman is at my factory.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were before the magistrate, were you sworn? A. I believe I was - I think I was - I am positive I was - I fixed on Monday as the day the prisoner sold it to me, but I made a mistake before the magistrate - I did not come to my recollection till after I left the magistrate - when I got home, my witnesses put me in mind that it was Sunday - my son was before the magistrate - he heard me swear it was Monday - he did not correct me - he did not give it a thought - my son was sworn, and I think he stated the purchase was made on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did not you fix on Sunday as the right day,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030081"/>because you knew the prisoner has not the means of proving an alibi? A. No; it was Sunday - I heard my son say it was Sunday, and I said it was Monday before the magistrate - I cannot tell why I did not speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, having told it to Mr. Wilson, then to the policeman, then to the prisoner, and then to the magistrate, were you in a state of confusion all that time? A. It was the same day - I did not talk to my son in going to the office of any thing particular - I told him that the silk was stolen, and Mr. Wilson had called on me - that was before I went before the magistrate - I do not know what answer my son gave me - I was very much hurt - he said he was present at the transaction.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He sold it you on Sunday, the 25th? A. Yes; I rolled up the silk, and on the Tuesday I cut it up, - that was the 27th - and on the Wednesday I offered the parasols for sale - they were made on the Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, and on Thursday they were found - I wrote this cheque, and gave it to Millingen - it would then go to the bankers; but I got it again, because I drew my books from the bankers, I think on the Wednesday morning, when I appeared before the magistrate the second time - I received this cheque, with some others, from the bankers - this transaction took place on Sunday, between twelve and one o'clock - my shop was open - the prisoner first made the purchases - my son was in the shop - the prisoner was there a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - my son was there the whole time - Mr. Millingen was up stairs in the dining-room with part of my family - he came down when I called him - the prisoner was dressed in a drab or grey coat - he took all the things with him, except the cane ribs, which I gave him an order to receive at my factory - the silk was tied up in a pocket-handkerchief - my son saw that; Mr. Millingen did not - I did not give him the cheque that day, because he could not procure the money that day - he called on me on the Monday, and I told him the 5l. he had lent me I would repay him - I offered him the cheque - when this affair occurred, I got my book and cheques from the bankers, to prove that the 5l. I borrowed I paid him the next day - I thought the document to prove it was required, but no charge had then been made against me - I cannot tell how many of my family were up stairs with Millingen that Sunday - I dined at three or four o'clock - I went up stairs perhaps an hour afterwards - two or three of my daughters were there, and I think Millingen was.</p>
               <p>COURT to HENRY BARNARD. Q. How long have you known Millingen? A. About four years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at the police-office on the Thursday with your father? A. I went there, but I could not speak to my father - I did not go with my father - I do not recollect whether I was sworn - I believe I said the silk had been sold to my father on the Monday - I did not recollect at the time - I did swear to Monday, but I did not think of it till I was reminded, when I got home, by Millingen and our foreman - I really cannot say whether I swore to the magistrate Sunday or Monday - I heard my father sworn - he said it was Monday - I was in the shop when this silk was bought - it was between twelve and one o'clock - I had not breakfasted with my father that day - I came in at the moment the prisoner was there, and he asked my father about the silk, which he had under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by "the moment?" A. The moment I entered my father's shop, I found the prisoner conversing with my father - I came in from our factory - I am sure I found the prisoner conversing with my father when I went in.</p>

            . I keep the Cheshire Cheese, in Dean-street, Holborn. On the evening of the 26th of June, the prisoners came in about seven o'clock - I had not known them before - they and two other men brought seven pieces of timber to my yard - I said I would not have it there - I thought they had stolen it - they became very abusive - I went to get the policeman, as I was afraid of my life - they threatened to split my skull open - when I came back they were gone, and had taken three pieces of wood away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Have you told us all that passed? A. Yes - I had not ordered any wood of the prisoners - I did not say that would not do for me, if they would bring me some thinner, I would give them some more beer - they had three pots of beer.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM OLIVER. I am a <rs id="t18340703-180-viclabel1002" type="occupation">builder</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any mark on it? A. No - I was with the man for two or three hours, and told him to put one piece in a particular place - that one I can swear to - it has a particular mortice at this end, and it has some slips nailed on it - it is a kind of door-post.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many pieces altogether did you lose? A. I suppose about fifty - one I can swear to - the other three I believe to be mine - they were taken from my pile at the back of those houses.</p>

I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the landlord's pocket, who was at the fire frying a bit of ham - the prisoner put it in his jacket pocket - he pulled out a blue handkerchief, and put on the top of it - he went away soon after, and was not taken till three o'clock the next day - it has not been found - I thought it might be a lark, and that he would bring it back.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. To get to the yard where the window is, must they have opened the stable door? A. Yes; and that door was on the latch - I had shut it about ten o'clock at night, or half-past.</p>

Before the 18th of June I had a watch and some jewellery, and £160 in Bank of England notes, and a £30 bill of exchange, a pearl necklace, a pearl brooch, a garnet ring, and brooch, and the other articles mentioned in the indictment - on Tuesday, the 17th of June, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I saw them all safe - the male<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030088"/>prisoner had been in our employ between eight and nine months as servant boy - the property was placed in a box, which was locked and put in the bottom drawer of a chest of drawers, in my bed-room - on the night of the 18th of June, between six and seven o'clock, I left our residence to go to the theatre with my husband - the prisoner was at home, and shut the door after us - I returned a little after twelve o'clock, I think - the prisoner was not there - I had not given permission for him to leave - on Tuesday, the 20th of June, the prisoner had not returned - I went to the drawer between eleven and twelve o'clock, and found all these articles missing - the drawer and box were locked, as I had left them, except that the articles were gone out of the box - I lost a £50 note among others.</p>

            . I am a City constable. In consequence of information, I went to Mr. Harris, a cornchandler, on Saffron-hill, to the first-floor room, and burst open the room-door, which was fastened - I found Joseph Denny there concealed between the mattress and the bed - I searched him, and on him found a bill of parcels - he had his coat off, but the rest of his things on - I do not know about his shoes - I then proceeded to search a box in the room, and in it found 115 sovereigns - and a 5l. note in a purse, 9s. and a watch - the prisoner asked what I wanted with him; I told him - he said he knew nothing at all about it in any way - The female prisoner was taken into custody, and brought to the compter while I was there - she was searched, and two keys found tied to her petticoat-string with a piece of ribbon, one of which unlocks the box the money was found in; I tried it, and the other key opened a small box which was shown to me at Mrs. Dicas's - I did not find any jewellery myself - the box in the prisoner's room was locked - I broke it open - I afterwards applied the key found on the female prisoner to it - it unlocked it - I have not a doubt of its being the key - I had broken the lock off, but not injured it so as to alter the wards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long after you went to the room was it that the female prisoner was in custody? A. I should think an hour and a half, or an hour and a quarter - Harris gave her in charge - I saw her in a policeman's custody, who is not here - I did not show her the lock - I merely took the keys from her - she said,"What do you want with them?" - I said, "I shall take them" - she said, "Let me have one of them" - I said, "I can't now" - she did not say she had just received them from her son - she said the keys were hers when I took them from her - I left her to be searched more accurately by a woman - I found a new gown - here is the box - it is a common lock.</p>

            . I am a sergeant of the police. On the 20th of June, I searched the room occupied by Mrs. Denny - I have been on duty there the last four years, and know she resides there - I was present when the money was found - I went with Forrester to the station-house - I found this pocket-book, a pearl necklace, a pearl brooch, a gold ring, a garnet ring, and a snuff-box, in the box where the money was found - I also found a bill of exchange for 30l. - I was present when the female prisoner was brought to the compter - I found this bonnet in the room.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN to JOHN FORRESTER. Q. Now the lock is opened, look at it, would not any key open it that would go into it? A. It is a common lock; any key which goes into it would turn it, certainly - the box the property was found in, was a kind of sea-chest - some of the male prisoner's clothes were in it, and there was some female apparel there - the property laid more at the top of the box than the bottom - the money was covered with some of the clothes - the new articles of dress which I found in it, laid at the top - the money and pearls were under the things which I produce - I found a new carpet-bag under the bed - these things were in the box, and there was a coat or two in it - the woman might certainly have opened the box, without seeing the jewellery and money in it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find any key on the male prisoner to open the box? A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not remember whether it was a male or a female? A.

            . I live in Farringdon-street. On the 30th of May, I received a twenty-pound note and a five-pound note from Messrs. Hankey's, the bankers - I paid them to Mr. Dicas on the 31st of May - I also gave him this bill of exchange - it has my endorsement.</p>

            . I am cashier to Messrs. Hankey, bankers. On the 30th of May, I cashed a cheque for twenty-five pounds, drawn by J. L. Jones and Son - I gave a twenty-pound note for it, No. 17085, dated 30th of April - (looking at a twenty pound note) this is the note.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH DENNY to JANES HARRIS. Q. I paid you the rent myself? A. Yes; you gave me a sovereign and a half-sovereign, and I gave you three shillings back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BODKIN. Q. You swore the woman paid it? A. They were both there - she gave the order to the son, to pay it to me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. By whom was the room taken of you? A. By the mother, in August last - she was present when the money was paid - I did not see where the boy got the money from - I do not know on what day he came - I saw him there on the Thursday, and Wednesday, the 17th and 18th of June, and on the morning of the 19th they paid me - I do not know at what time he came on the 18th.</p>
               <p>JOHN DICAS (looking at the £50, £20, and £10 notes). There was no endorsement on the notes when I received them - the words, "Norah Denny," I believe to be the handwriting of the male prisoner, and the endorsement on the other two notes also - I believe them all to be his handwriting - there is £40 short of the money I lost - the whole house is in my occupation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had he been in your service? A. About eight months - he was as good a servant as I ever had - I have occasionally sent him to change me notes (£10 notes), but not so large as £20 - I always sent him to the grocers, North, Graham, and Co., Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you in the habit of sending him to the Bank for change? A. Never.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the female prisoner aware that her son was in your service? A. Yes: I saw her at my house on the Saturday previous to the 14th - I heard a knock at the door late in the evening, and it was her bringing home his clothes which she had to wash - he had asked me to advance him half-a-sovereign to give to his mother who was in great distress - his wages were £5 a year, and I was to give him clothes at the end of six months, which I did - his mother was certainly aware that he was in no condition to earn £10, or £20.</p>
               <p>Joseph Denny to WILLIAMSON. Q. You left me in the house when you went out? A. Yes; when I left for good I left you up stairs.</p>
               <p>MRS. DICAS re-examined. This jewellery is all mine, except this seal and key, which I know nothing of - this is my daughter's purse, she knit it - this watch belongs to a young lady who has left us for France.</p>
               <p>Joseph Denny to JOHN DICAS, jun. Q. Used not you to take me out with you of a night to singing places, and places of amusement, when master and mistress were gone to bed? A. Never - I did not take you to a house of ill-fame in Bell-court, and treat you. The prisoner behaved very attentive to me when I was ill - he would come up two or thee times a night to me.</p>
               <p>MR. DICAS re-examined. I had a good character with him, and he conducted himself well.(Three persons gave the female prisoner a good character.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent. I used the house some years. I had only one crown in my possession that night, which I gave to the lady for a quartern of gin; I had paid all the small money I had before for what I had. When he said the crown was bad, I took it and looked at it, and saw it was bad - any person in London is liable to have bad money. I was not at all conscious of its being bad. When they said it was bad, I borrowed money from a person in there to pay for the liquor. I had no intention to run away; I stopped there till the watchman came.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Can you go from your landlord's room to yours up the common stairs? A. No; it is a coffee-shop; there is one door leads into the coffee-shop, but we enter at the second door at the left of the stairs - there are other lodgers - the landlord's room is on the ground floor - there is only one staircase to the house, and only one door.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CLARKSON. Q. Had you a young lad, in the service of Mr. Moore, who has lately been discharged? A. No; not in Mr. Moore's service - there was a young man living with us for about three months, but he left three months before - I never said I knew who it was that cut away the silk - we had the young man up on suspicion - I said I suspected he would do so - we had a witness at Worship-street to prove that he had threatened it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hear him threaten any thing? A. No; I said I had reason to suspect him, because I was told what he had said - the boy's name is Lyons - he is not here - the magistrate discharged him.</p>

            . I lives in Mansel-street, Goodman's-fields, and am in the general way. On the 13th of March, I bought twenty yards of green silk, and thirty-three-yards of black, of Joseph Lazarus, and gave him 2s. 9d. a yard - it came to 7l. 5s. 9d. - I have his invoice in my pocket - I paid the whole of the 7l. 5s. 9d. exactly - on the very same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030092"/>day I sold fourteen yards of it to a casual customer, at 3s. a yard, for a dress - Lazarus came to my house in consequence of something, and I packed up the rest of the silk in a parcel, put my seal to it, and delivered it to Mr. Hart at his private residence - I am certain it was the silk I bought of Lazarus.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many Sessions ago had I the pleasure of seeing you? A. About seventeen months ago it is since I was imposed upon by the very man at the bar, through his son - and I believe you were counsel in the case - it was tried before his Lordship - I admit it - I have no reason to be ashamed of it - I was tried in the New Court - it was an unfortunate event, which I am not ashamed of, being an innocent man - I was not acquitted - Mr. Bodkin defended me - I was sentenced to six months in the House of Correction, but, in consequence of my previous character, I was liberated after five-weeks - previous to that, I was secretary and founder of a charitable institution, and have retained it since - my friends are convinced I am innocent, and was most unjustly convicted.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it a charge of stealing, some handkerchiefs, where the patterns were not complete? A. Yes, it was - they were sold with the maker's name on them.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do not you think it unfortunate that you should purchase stolen silks in so short a time afterwards? A. Undoubtedly; but there are events in a man's life over which he has no control - I used every caution, and bought them of a respectable man - the goods came to 7l. 5s. 9d., and I paid Lazarus the full amount - I have some of the satin here - I should think 2s. 9d. a yard is a fair price for it - it is not worth 4s. or 5s. in the job trade - the job trade is goods which come into hands from the decline of the season, and various modes - I do not exactly recollect how I paid the silver to Lazarus - it the 9d. was paid at all, it was in pence - I paid the whole of it- on my solemn oath I paid Lazarus 7l. 5s. 9d. - I did not keep back any portion of it, to my recollection - not a penny- I will not swear positively as to the pence - I paid the pence, to the best of my recollection - I believe 2s. 9d. to be a fair price - I have dealt in silks some years - Lazarus said it came out of pledge - that was in consequence of my remarking to him, that the silk was out of condition - it was rather tumbled, which is not uncommon in job goods - I certainly will swear it is not worth 4s. a yard - I sold it for 3s. - the person is not here who bought it of me - I sold it to a casual customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep an open silk mercer's shop? A. Yes; it is a shop consisting of two front windows - it was a parlour originally, but is converted into a shop - there is no shop window - goods are in the window - there is no name over the door - the door which leads to the shop is open by day - the street door is not shut, it many be occasionally - I swear there are goods in the window, and have been for years - there is a counter - the things in the window can be seen outside - I place sometimes ribbons, sometimes handkerchiefs and flannel in the windows - the door is not open at night, to my knowledge - if it is, it is not with my permission - the outer door is left open during the day for customers to come into the shop - I have got no light in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold fourteen yards of the silk - what became of the rest? A. It was packed up and taken to Mr. Hart - I make no entry of what I sell - I keep an invoice book for all goods which I buy - I do not keep an account of sales - Mrs. Samuels was by when I sold it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Whether you keep an entry or not, are you sure the silk you got from Lazarus was the same silk you gave up to Mr. Hart? A. It was.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH LAZARUS re-examined. Q. Did you represent to Samuel that the silks came out of pledge? A. I told him the party who sold it to me told me it came out of pledge, which the prisoner did.</p>

            . I superintend Mr. Moore's silk manufactory - I produce the silk which I got from Vann - it is worth 4s. 6d. a yard - when taken from the loom it would be in a rough state, but the value of the material by the weight and quality is 4s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Look at the green silk, if that was in a state for sale, what would it be sold at per yard to the public? A. 5s.</p>


               <p>Q. Is 2s. 9d. any thing like a fair price? A. It depends on the condition it is in - I should not like to send it out of our establishment in that state - any dealer that understands his business, would see that is not fit for sale.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live in Regent-place, Globe-road, Mile-end. I have known the prisoner between three and four years - on Monday, the 2nd or 3rd of March I went with him to Hitchin, in Hertfordshire - we slept there on Monday evening, attended the market on Tuesday, and left Hitchin on Tuesday evening - we went to Dunstable, slept there on Tuesday, attended the market on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030093"/>Wednesday, slept there Wednesday and Thursday nights, and left on Friday morning for St. Alban's - slept there Saturday and Sunday, and returned to town on Monday - I swear we were not out of each other's company six hours during the whole time, taking, one half-hour and another half-hour together - Hitchin is thirty-three or thirty-four miles from London.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You came home on the 9th? A. We came home on Monday, the 9th of 10th - yes, I can tell, for my birth-day was on the 7th - that was on Friday- I remember now from that particular circumstance - I have known Mr. Nathan, having seen him at his brother's often - I am not particularly intimate with him - we did not sleep in the same room together - we had never gone journeys together before, nor since - there was no companion with us; but we met an individual whom we both knew, both at Hitchin and Dunstable - I gave my testimony to the solicitor in this case - I did not give him the name of any individual who I met - I believe I saw Nathan again on Wednesday, the 12th, at his house, No. 6, Greenfield-street, Whitechapel-road - I went to him on business - he sells handkerchiefs - I never saw him sell silks - we took silk handkerchiefs, ribbons, and lace down with us - he did not deal in silk - he was a general dealer - he has not shop- there is a room you may call a shop, but it is a private house - things hang up in the window - I never saw silks there - I never saw him since this Wednesday that I know of- I may have seen him, but have forgotten it - I have been at his brother's many times - I cannot tell whether on any of those times I have seen him - I may have seen him - I cannot swear whether I have seen him at his brother's since or not - I saw him on the 12th at his own house - I cannot swear that he has been out of the way, but I have heard that he has been in the country - I had been at his house I think about a week before I took the journey with him - I never went to his house before that once - it was at his brother's that we made up our journey together - his brother is here - I had seen him at his brother's about a month before we made up the journey, or it might have been a week - I cannot tell whether his brother was present- some individuals were present - I cannot tell who - if I recollect correctly, one of Henry Nathan's sons was present - I know somebody was present, and one of the sons, but which I cannot swear - some of the sons are invariably in the shop - it was in the shop we made up the journey - there was not half a dozen people present - there might have been customers in the shop - we intended to be out in the country for a month, but the prisoner, at the time he was staying at St. Alban's, was rather queer in the head - I persuaded him to return home - I cannot swear whether his brother was present when I agreed to travel with him- it was between nine and two o'clock that we made the agreement - I have been in the habit of going to his house four or five times a week, and cannot speak to the hour more correctly - we slept at the Red Lion at St. Alban's - I think the landlord's name is Dalton or Salton - we slept up stairs in the first pair - the Red Lion is at the corner of the road leading to Dunstable - I think we slept at the Black Horse at Dunstable - the landlord's name is Holmes- I did not give his name to the solicitor, for I was not asked - I never knew of this till last Saturday - I do not know but somebody may be here who saw us in the country.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. A. Are you quite sure that from Monday the 3d to the 10th, he was travelling with you to Hitchin and other places? A. Yes.</p>

             (police-constable C 60). I apprehended the prisoner in Regent-street; she was not with the prosecutor - I had received information from him, and took her from his description, having seen her in the street - I said, "Have you got that man's watch?" - she said, "Yes, I have"- I said, "Give it me" - she said, "I will not" - I took a bag out of her hand, and on opening it, at the station-house, I found the watch - she said he had given it to her - I also found a sovereign, three sixpences, and two half-pence on her - the prosecutor was asked if he had lost any money - he put his hand into his pocket, and said he had lost a sovereign, and, he thought, about half-a-crown - the prisoner, said, he gave her the watch, but a gentleman gave her the money.</p>
               <p>A. LLOYD re-examined. I am satisfied I could not have given her the watch, because I would not part with it for 5l. - I missed it directly I parted, from her - I will swear I did not give it her - I kept my money in my left hand pocket - I can undertake to say, I did not give her the money - I know what money I had when I left the tavern; and missing my watch rather sobered me; I directly complained to the policeman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you give me the watch, and say, "Come up here with me, I have no money to give you, here is my watch?" A. I do not believe I did - I will swear I did not.</p>
               <p>H. LOWMAN re-examined. She told me she had got the watch directly I asked her, and at the station-house she said he gave it to her - here is a half-penny, with five holes in it, I found on her.</p>
               <p>A. LLOYD re-examined. I can swear to that half-penny and sixpence.</p>

            . I am the wife of Abraham Stillwell - we live in Little Ormond-yard - I sent my daughter to sell some rags once, but never to sell any socks, or stockings, or petticoats - I missed a great many articles at different times - these are some of them.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH STILLWELL, Jun. I am the prosecutrix's daughter - I took the all these articles to the prisoner's, at different times - I took them from my mother - I asked the prisoner if she would buy them; she said yes, and as many more as I pleased - she keeps a shop in Liquor Pond-street, and buys all sorts of things - I went there twelve or thirteen times - she gave me one penny a pair for these socks, and two-pence or three-pence a piece for these flannel petticoats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How came you first to go to the woman's? A. My mother first sent me to sell some rags - I did not tell her that my mother had sent these socks, as they were very moth-eaten - the prisoner said they were moth-eaten - I said I knew it - I do not know why - the prisoner did not give me 2d. a pair for these socks, only 1d. - I am fourteen years old - my eldest brother is ten or eleven - he went to the prisoner's shop also - I do not know how he came to go there - I did not think whether I was doing any harm - I bought cakes with the money - I have not been to any other shop but the prisoner's to sell things - she lives nearly half-a-mile from my mother's - I do not know that there is such a shop as the prisoner's nearer to my mother's - my mother did not tell me what shop to go to, when I took the rags to sell.</p>

             (police-serjeant G 11). I went to the prisoner, and asked if she had ever bought any thing of this girl - she said, "No" - I found these things there, and took her to Hatton-garden - she then said she had bought some socks of this girl.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH STILLWELL. I had been to the prisoner's shop the day before, and saw a flannel-petticoat and a pincloth outside the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they not publicity exposed? A. Yes - the pin-cloth has been sold - I send my little boy out on errands - I do not know how he found his way to the prisoner's - I never sent him there, nor this girl either - these petticoats are worth 6d. or 1s. a-piece - I sent this girl to sell the rags about Christmas - I never sent the boy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The girl said her mother had got several moths in the house, as her father was a smith, and her mother thought she had better dispose of them - I put them up for sale every day - I gave the girl 6d. or 8d. a-piece for the petticoats, and 2d. a pair for the socks.</p>

            . I get my living by putting the penal statutes in force. On the 29th of May, I went into a public-house, near Vauxhall-gate, to have a pint of beer, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning - I saw the prisoner there - I have known him some years - he was sitting at a table with another man - I saw the prisoner give the man six sovereigns, and he went to the bar and came in again and put down two half-crowns on the table- they then shook hands, and the prisoner said, "Now it is my cart" - I saw a piece of paper on the table, and a pen and ink - I should not know the paper again - it was a similar paper to this one - I considered it to be a receipt.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where had you come from that morning? A. From my own house in the Borough - I was going down the Wandsworth-road to look after stage coaches - it was the first public-house on the right after you get through the Vauxhall-gate - there were two or three persons there - I did not see the landlord - I saw a female, whom I took to be the servant - the prisoner with the other men were sitting on the right-hand - I said to him, "Jemmy, there you are" - he said, "Very well" or "All right" - I did not go before the magistrate - the prisoner's son came to me on sunday morning last - I had no one with me at that time- I do not take a witness with me - I am the witness my - self - I was going to look after coaches, or any thing else - I do not know what change the prisoner went for, but he brought in two half-crowns, and put them on the table.</p>
               <p>COURT to R. AYMER. Q. When you saw the cart at Gosport, what name was on it? A."George Porter, Hoxton, Middlesex, No. 2728," was on the plate.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SAWYER. There was no plate on it when I lost it - I had taken my board off to have it fresh painted.</p>

            (police-constable S 123). On the 21st of June, at half-past two o'clock in the morning, I was on duty opposite Euston Mews - I heard something fall - I then heard some footsteps, and saw the prisoner Charles cross the mews with a truss of hay on his shoulders, which he took into Price's stables - I called Bugden - we went down the mews to Mr. Mills' stable, but in going down we found Price's stables open - when we got to Mr. Mills we saw the mark of two trusses of hay on the ground, under the window; one was dark, the other light, corresponding with the colour of the trusses we found - the prisoner Francis was at the loft window of Mr. Mills' stable - he said, "Good morning," and asked what brought us there so early - we then went to Price's stables, and found a truss of hay uncovered, and shortly after another partly covered over - I saw Charles in a corn bin - he appeared to be asleep - I asked him when the hay was brought in - he said in the night; and it was a hard thing his master could not have hay without our supposing it was stolen - I said, "Will you swear it did not come in within ten minutes?" - he said,"No" - I then said, "Where did you get it?" - he said, from the bottom of the mews, at No, 14" - I left him in custody, and went to Mr. Mills' stable - I knocked, and Francis put his head out - I told him to come down - he came down in his shirt - I told him to go up and put on his clothes, and I followed him - in going up I saw Gission on the stairs -Francis had passed him - I asked Gission what he did there- he said he had come to call the gentleman's servant - I said it was all stuff, and told him to go up stairs - we went up, and Francis asked Gisson what he did there - Gisson said,"To call you" - Francis said he had not given him any order - Gission said, "You know you told me," and Francis said, "I believe I did" - Gisson afterwards said he had come to borrow two trusses of hay - they were then taken; and Francis said, "We have got into trouble."</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030098"/>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you known Francis before this? A. Yes; he had been groom to Mr. Mills for five or six months - I have not heard him say that he had been in the habit of making loans of hay to the cabman's servant - Gisson said he came to borrow two trusses of hay - I know that persons who drive cabriolets come in at all hours - Gisson left his cabriolet on the stand, and came there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But I dare say it may have happened that you have lent and borrowed hay? A. I would lend it to any gentleman in the mews, but not to a cabman- I had desired Francis not to have any thing to do with these two men - he had given me satisfaction.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Your friend asked you to take care of his watch? A. Yes; I had been drinking a little when I went with the women; but I was not drunk - I had been in one public-house, and stayed about half-an-hour with a young man who is now just gone in to Sydney - after I left the public-house, I had to call at a doctor's - I had the watch safe then - that was about one hundred yards before I met the women - the prisoner laid on the bed; the other woman on the floor - I had been in the house about half an hour when I fell asleep.</p>

            . I am an inspector of police. I was on duty - I saw the prosecutor asleep, and Mason was calling him to awake - I placed myself in a situation where I could see what transpired - I saw the seals hanging from the prosecutor's watch fob - I soon after saw Mason leave the prosecutor, and go some distance between the tables and join Jarvis, who was sitting alone smoking his pipe - Mason then went again and sat by the prosecutor - he did so a second time - he then went to him a third time - I then went up and collared him and Jarvis - I took them to the prosecutor, and awoke him up - his seals were gone then - I asked him if he had lost any thing - he said, "No," but he felt, and missed his seals and ribbon - I took the prisoners to the station-house, and in Jarvis's right hand pocket I found the ribbon and seals; and in his small-clothes I found the handkerchief - I went in the morning to the gardens, and under the seat I found the swivel of the watch - there was nothing found on Mason - Jarvis was sitting the length of this Court from the prosecutor - I saw Mason join him three times, and leave him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there other persons in the gardens? A. Yes, smoking their pipes; but not at that place - a person sitting where Janvis was, could see the prosecutor - it was in a straight line, and no one was between them - Jarvis did not attempt to interfere at all - Jarvis said he had been drawn into it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

Lane fell on her knees, put her arms round her clothes, and said,"It is me, Miss, it is distress has driven me to do it; they shall be made right in a few days."

            . I am shopman to Mr. Folkard, a pawnbroker, in the Commercial-road. I produce a great many articles which relate to this indictment - the greater part were pawned by Kinsman, some by Lane, and some by another female.</p>
               <p>MR. PRESTON. These are all my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Lane is married? A. Yes. for any thing I know - I did not see her husband when I first went, but he made his appearance some time afterwards - he was living there nearly the whole time - he left this country just before this discovery took place - I think on the Sunday before - he came out of his room and took leave of me - he said he was going off with the Coldstream to the East Indies - I have no reason to doubt that they were man and wife - Kinsman used to come and work there- I do not know whether Lane sent her out to pawn things- Lane said before the magistrate, that Kinsman knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How often was Kinsman there for the last four or five months? A. Almost every day - she generally waited on me, and cleaned the room - she must have known the property was mine.</p>
               <p>Lane's Defence. Among those articles there is a gold pin of my husband's, which has been in his possession for years - what I have done, I have owned to - the other prisoner is innocent.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How do you know it was her lodging? A. I inquired at the house, and they showed me into the room.</p>
               <p>AMELIA SEYMOUR. I saw this green dress, this hat, and habit shirt, and stockings on her at the office - this blue dress found at Westminster is mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you are in the habit of going to the theatre? A. No; I have a little private property, and let lodgings - I do not see gentlemen - I keep the house, No. 6, John-street, Waterloo-road - I have a gentleman and a lady lodge there - I do not remember a gentleman calling on me, and the prisoner being sent for a bottle of wine - my back parlour is a bed-room - I am sure the gentleman and I were not in that room - the prisoner was not asked to take a glass of wine - she never gave me any money - I lent her money to get decent things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I paid her 6l. or 7l. - she lent me these dresses to go out and get gentlemen. Witness. It is quite false, she took property to the amount of 16l. - I gave her 2s. a week, and maintained her - I lent her 3s.(

I am a boot and shoe-maker - I was in Shoreditch on the 21st of June - I saw the prosecutor and the two prisoners - they tried his pockets once or twice - he then crossed over to Church-street, and went into a wine vaults - they waited till he came out, and he went down New Inn-yard - they followed him; and Charles Kelly took the handkerchief out of his pocket - I told him, and we followed, but could not find him - the next night, I saw Charles Kelly, and had him taken - they were both together when the handkerchief was stolen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CHURCHILL. Q. Is this your first case this session? A. Yes; I was here last session in a case of one of the swell mob, for taking a gentleman's watch - I was the only person who saw it done - I do not know how often I have been here as a witness against boys, for robbing persons unknown - I have never been turned out of Court - I never was refused my expenses - I may have gone away without them.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you have not been refused your expenses here? A. I never was but once - I will swear I have not twice - I have gone away once or twice without them - I do not recollect having a case of two boys before Mr. Common Sergeant Denman - I was not turned out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030102"/>Court, unless the witnesses were ordered out - I was not turned out after the case was over.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember last Session being reminded of a case in a Session before, and swearing to Mr. Phillips that he bullied you out of it? A. I used those words, or something to that effect - I cannot recollect whether Mr. Lee had been counsel in that case.</p>

               <p>THOMAS TOOLE re-examined. Q. How can you explain this? A. On the Sunday night, I saw Charles Kelly turn down a little court, and I went back for a policeman - I said to him, "There is a young fellow gone down here that robbed a person of his handkerchief last night" - I described him quite fully - we went down together, and saw this man's boy, and took him - he had a cap on his head, and I thought he was the boy - I brought him out, and a mob came round - the prisoner then came out and I said, "Take him, that is the boy."</p>
