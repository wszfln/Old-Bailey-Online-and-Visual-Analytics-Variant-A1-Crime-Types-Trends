               <p>William Martin, Sen. thus depos'd. The Prisoner used to Wash one Day in a Week at my House, and to Iron another Day, so she was with me two Days in a Week constantly; I am a <rs id="t17270113-6-viclabel33" type="occupation">Victualler</rs>

The Prisoner came to help Wash as usual, and immediately, was for going up Stairs; whereupon my Wife bid her keep to the Washing-Tub: In a little Time the Prisoner attempts to go up Stairs again, and my Wife desired to know what Business she had up Stairs? She said, to see for some foul Linen; my Wife told her the Maid could fetch that down, and bid her keep to washing: But the Prisoner's making such Excuses to go up Stairs, made my Wife suspect that she must be the Person that came at my Money, upon that I goes up Stairs, unlocks my Draw where I kept my Money, and counts it over very carefully, and put Twenty three Guineas in one Bag, and laid that at the Bottom of the Drawer, and put the Moidores, some half Broads and a new French Pistole in another Bag, and lays that near the Top of the Drawer, then came down, and my Wife sends the Prisoner up Stairs with a Petticoat that was below; the Prisoner carried it up and comes down again presently, upon which I goes up Stairs again, and found my Drawer lockt as usual, I unlockt it, and took out the Bag which had the odd Gold in it, and mist the new Pistole, then I took the other Bag and told over the Guineas, which I found exactly right: I acquainted my Wife and my Son how it was, and then order'd the Prisoner to go up Stairs and brush her young Master's Cloths; my Son taxed her with the Theft, the Prisoner denied it, and offered to be search'd, but first put her Hand in her Pocket and took out the Pistole, and endeavoured to conceal it in her Hand, but my Son perceiving it, he took hold of her Hand, her little Finger being closed, and found the Pistole under it; then the Prisoner said she found it in the Room, but I being in a Passion, told her she was a lying B - h, and that she took it out of my Drawer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Martin, Jun, depos'd, That his Father told him he was robb'd, and sent the Prisoner up to brush his Cloths, as she frequently did before he went out, but when the Prisoner came up Stairs and saw him in his Gown, she desired to know what he wanted; whereupon he taxed her with robbing his Father, the Prisoner denied it, and offer'd to be searched, but at the same Time trembled, and was in great Confusion, and that upon searching her he found the Pistole upon her, as set forth in the former Deposition: The Jury found her <rs id="t17270113-6-verdict34" type="verdictDescription">

I called a Neighbour and told him I had lost my Watch, and sent my Maid for Mrs. Burgis, to tell her I must speak with her, she came about 7 o'Clock, and I asked her, why she had played the Rogue with my Watch, she denied having meddled with it, upon which I told her she should go before a Justice, and then she desired she might send for a Cloak, and a Hoop-petticoat, and whispered to a Person that I did not know, and that came in without being sent for, who went and fetched her what she wanted; when they came she was a pretty while in putting them on just at a Corner of the Room, near which there was some old Pattens, she pretended her Shoe was unbuckled, or her Garter untied, upon which she stooped down for a little Time: And after we had been before the Justice, and knocked up all the Pawnbrokers thereabout to enquire if the Watch had been offer'd to them, could hear nothing of it, the Watch was found under an old Patten, with the Cristial downward, just by the Place where the Prisoner made an Excuse to stoop, notwithstanding that the Pattens had been removed, and the Place strictly searched before.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made her Defence. The Prosecutor invited me to drink Tea and Breakfast with her, and desired I would bring my Girl with me, I went one Morning about 10 o'Clock, and asked her Maid if her Mistress was within, she said yes, but she was in Bed with a Gentleman; I went another Morning, and then a Gentleman's Footman came to the Door, and I suppose she was in Bed with his Master. So hearing she kept such bad Hours, that she seldom got up before four or five a Clock in the Afternoon, I went in the Evening about Five a Clock, and found the Prosecutor dressing of her Head, she asked me to drink a Glass of Wine, and I believe I might drink two Glasses of French Wine burnt, I enquired what a Clock it was, and the Watch was fetched and said down on the Table, I did not stay long, but went out and came again, and told her if my Child would not be thought troublesome I would leave her while I went to the Playhouse, which she seemed very well pleased with; I went away, and after some Time Mrs. Cooper sent for me from the Playhouse, and when I came she asked me why I had played the Rogue with her Watch, I, as very well I might, denied it, and they were for searching me, and I gave them leave to strip me naked (the Constable promising to look out at Window) this was in her own Room, and they did search me, and after they had so done and carried me before the Justices I was admitted to Bail, the Constable that was then charged with me, came the next Morning and told me he had News to tell me, for the Watch was found, and all further Proceedings would be stopt.</p>

               <p>Mr. Benson thus depos'd. The 17th of November I went to to my Office and found a Letter directed to me, which I could not very well read, but found it related to some unwarrantable Proceedings in my Family; and going home about 5 o'Clock, I found my Wife's two Sisters, then asked the Maid where her Mistress was, she answered, gone to Mr. Middleton's: I went to Mr. Middleton's, but they did not Dine at home that Day; she had called there but did not stay, but had been at Cunningham's Lodgings. On Saturday Morning I went out of Town, and left Word that I should not come home that Night, but came home sooner; and in the Stables saw two strange Fellows: And there used to be so many Irishmen about my House, I ordered that no Body should come there without my Knowledge; my Wife complained that it was very strange, if she nor her Sisters must have no Body come to them. I stay'd at home all Day on Sunday, and about 10 o'Clock at Night as I was at Supper with my Wife and her Sister,

Upon which, I said to my Coachman, Richard, will you stand by me? He answered, he would, I went to a Gentleman to desire his assistance, but he was out of Town; I went to see for my own Pistols, but they were not to be found, for they had been carried away to Mr. Cunningham. I then sent to Mr. Harcourt of the Crown Office, and begg'd he would come immediately, but he was not at home; I went into the Parlour, where was my Mother, Sisters, and my Wife, and seized a Pistol in her Pocket; I told them the Story, and fetched her packt up Cloths; and then sent into Shoreditch to Robert Dug's, desiring him to come to my Assistance, and to bring what Arms he could with him, or else I should be murthered:

             thus depos'd. The Prisoners came to my Shop about 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, and wanted some printed Linnen, I called my Wife, being engaged on the other side of the Shop; afterwards I came and relieved her; the Prisoners were very difficult, as most such Customers are, I shewed them some, they said they liked the Fancy, but the Cloth was too thin. Randall said they should do no good to Night, so went away, and Murfey followed; I told my Wife I didn't like the Customers, and looking amongst my Goods I miss'd a Piece of printed Linnen: Murfey came back and offer'd one Penny a Yard more; whereupon I sent for a Constable and secured her. I saw Randall standing over the Way, who observing me coming towards her, avoided me by going into an House; I afterwards meeting her in the Street, stopt her, and found my Goods I had then mist in her Custody; at which Time another Piece dropt from her, which a Boy in the Street took up, and proved to be my Goods also; and a Mob arising, some Body said they believed she had more Goods about her: However, having brought her back, and got her and Murfey in a Coach, had them before a Justice; when as Randall was stepping out of the Coach she chanced to drop a Piece of Garlick Holland, which being mine, I had but small Suspicion, having shewed them none when in my Shop; but looking upon it I found my own Mark on it: But when we came before the Justice he happened to be indisposed, and could not take their Examination, but had them committed by another Justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Devon thus depos'd. I was standing at my Father's Door, and hearing Mr. Atkinson was robbed, I and another stopped Randall, and asked her what she had got, she answered what's that to you; at which Time I saw the Goods drop from her.</p>
