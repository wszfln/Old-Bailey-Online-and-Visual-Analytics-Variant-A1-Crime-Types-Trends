                        targets="t17760522-4-off10 t17760522-4-crimeloc13"/>: our house was broke open at near three in the morning of the 21st of April: every window was made fast that night, I imagine, because I make it a constant rule never to go to bed without seeing that every window is fast keyed as well as barred. One of the two back parlour windows, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220005"/> is next the fields the people came in at that robbed the house; the screw of that window was forced, the pin was out, and the bar was forced out, so that the shutters were open: I did not hear them breaking in, but I heard the door of the room next me unlock, and in a quarter of a minute after that I heard the door shut again; then I heard somebody trying at my own chamber-door, upon which I jumped up, being much alarmed, and called out, Who is there? No answer being made to me, I was very much terrified, and immediately screamed out to Mr. Penleaze, who jumped up, and in a loud voice called out, Who is there? but before he had well said it the door was forced open, and four men rushed into the room with a kind of a yell; one had a dark lanthorn in his hand, and one had a bit of gauze under his nose over his mouth, tied behind his head: they were upon the bed almost immediately; two of them mounted up upon the bed at the feet, and came almost close up to me. Green was one of these two men; he came up on my side of the bed; his hat was fitted up in a peak, and stood high upon his head, so that I had a fair view of his face. Bates, the other prisoner, was on Mr. Penleaze's side; his hair hung lank upon his face. The other two went to the head of the bed, one on each side, and one of them held a pistol to my head, and the other stood with a cutlass before me. They said, Your money, your money, tell us where your money is. Four pistols were at this time held at Mr. Penleaze's head and mine, each of them having a pistol in his hand. They said, They came for money, and would have it; and the two prisoners said, They would not have notes, but only money: they then asked what money we had in the house? Mr. Penleaze said, we had but little, but what we had lies on the slab in the next room: they asked what slab? Immediately recollecting that that was the room where what we had of any value was kept, I had the presence of mind to direct them to another room in order to divert their attention, as it was then three o'clock, and I trusted to somebody's coming to our relief: I said, in the next room they might find a chest of drawers, and advised them to look for a bag which had some money in it in one of those drawers: they asked me which room? I directed them to that they opened first: three accordingly went out of my room, and one staid behind to keep guard with a pistol and cutlass at my head: two of them came back in less than two minutes, and said, they could find none there; then they addressed themselves to Mr. Penleaze, and said, Whereabouts did you say, Sir, the money lay, upon the slab? what slab is it you mean? he said again, the slab in the room on the right hand; at the same time he said, his son had received a little money yesterday which he had not accounted to him for: they immediately asked him where his son lay? he said, up another pair of stairs you will find him. They then left the room a second time, and two of them went up stairs; one still kept guard, but that one was neither of the prisoners. I afterwards found they had opened three chests; that they had tumbled the things about, and finding nothing in them, went away; but they did not go into my son's room. They then came down again, and just looked into the room where Mr. Penleaze and I were, and then went to the study door on the right hand of our room, and finding they could not open it easily, the man who was standing guard at the head of my bed called out to them, What are you about? they answered, We cannot open the door. One who is not yet taken opened a little drawing table that stood in my room, but found nothing in it; and one of the prisoners opened a little bureau that was also in my room, but found nothing. The study door was soon after broke open, and I heard the plate rattle as if it was putting into something. I have no doubt of the persons of the men; they were not above a foot and a half from us upon the bed. Bates was taken up that evening, and I saw him the next day with the other prisoner, and immediately knew them; I saw Green the next day coming with the officer that took him, and I knew him immediately, and he trembled like an aspin leaf as soon as he saw me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Had you no doubt of the persons of the prisoners at the office? - No, I never did doubt about them at the office. The light that enabled me to distinguish them was, besides the dark lanthorn, a wax candle that was taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220006"/> out of one of the rooms; it might be behind, for I am certain there was more light than the dark lanthorn gave, for there was no light in my room; when the others went up stairs to the room where my son lay, when they went for that purpose there was no light left in my room; there was no light of any kind in the house, therefore they could not have found their way up stairs unless they had a light with them; before they went up stairs they covered me up with the bedclothes; but the man who staid as guard left one side of my face free, so that I could see with one eye; I made a proposition to them to go away from the house; I said, if they would go I would give them some money at any time and place they should appoint, and no enquiry should be made after them; the man at the head of the bed seemed to listen to this proposal, and said to the others, what will you do? one of them said, we had best search the house; they struck at me with a cutlass when I screamed, damning me for screaming and making a noise; the cutlass missed my head and struck into the head of the bed.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Penleaze; as I was going down stairs, upon hearing my mistress scream, I saw three men coming out of my mistress's room; Bates was upon the staircase; I went back to my own room immediately upon seeing them; two of them came up and passed my room door, but turned down again to my mistress's door; I heard them engage their words that nobody should be hurt if the money was given quietly; the men came up again to the young gentleman's room; I saw them rifle his breeches pocket and take out his money and his watch; one had a candle in his hand without a candlestick: they searched the boxes in the other rooms; Bates searched the young gentleman's pockets; they came then into a room next mine, and I heard them opening the boxes: one said to the other, come along, here is nothing here; then they went away again: I saw them twice go behind my room; I stood with the door open from the first of my seeing them till the last, which might be about twenty minutes; I saw the shadow of spoons as if they were putting them into something covered; they went down to the study from me; while they were there, I heard a voice say, what are you about? they answered, we cannot open the door.</p>
               <p>How were you enabled to see these persons so distinctly? - I could see them in my young master's room, I believe, without their seeing me; I stood with the door ajar; my reason for it was, that I purposed to have gone down stairs to have alarmed the neighbourhood, if I could have gone down. Bates was the person that took the candle out of the other man's hand; but I will not swear to Green being one of the persons.</p>

               <p>On the Saturday, which was the night before my house was broke open, I saw all the things mentioned in the indictment; my loss amounts to between 4 and 500 l. I believe Bates to be the person that put a pistol to my head in the bed, but I will not swear positively to him, because I am near-sighted; the account Mrs. Penleaze has given of the robbery, is a circumstantial account of facts. I saw four men coming into the room, one came on my side and struck me with the muzzle of his pistol on my head as I was sitting up in the bed, and two were at the foot of the bed; one stayed on my wife's side of the bed all the time.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Penleaze was doubtful before the justice whether I was the man or not; so I was taken a second time before the justice, and she was doubtful, and did not know me till I had my hat cocked, and then she swore to me.</p>

My warehouse is adjoining to the place where the late fire in the Savoy was; the door was always locked. (Part of the books produced).

The next day I saw the paper advertised, and immediately upon that I went and took them all up. Wade was admitted an evidence, and she shewed me where a good deal of it laid; some was found at Birch's and some at Bailey's: the prisoner Kelly went with me and shewed me where it was; and the justices thought by her conduct she was entitled to some recommendation from them, and therefore they recommended her for mercy. Wade directed me to take up a boy who was concerned in it.</p>

               <p>I keep a chandler's shop in Drury-lane; I bought some such paper of the prisoner Barnes; I cannot say it is the same, but I believe it is; it is near a month ago; it was some time after the fire: I never saw her before. The next morning she brought me more: I asked her where it came from; she said I need not be in any fear about it, for she worked very hard for it. The next morning she returned with two or three more women with her: I did not then care to have any thing more to do with it; I began to be suspicious; I said I would buy no more, and about a fortnight after the constable came.</p>

As soon as he was gone, one of them brought with her a publican to vouch for her character, who said she was an honest woman - (looks at the paper) I am sure that is it; I had it in my custody.</p>

I saw no window broke, but Kelly told me she had cut her hand by a bit of glass in the window. This might last about an hour: the other two prisoners were there at the time: all the three prisoners and myself took some of the paper and went to Morgan, the last witness, with the paper that I had: we were at this work for two days; I was afterwards taken up for it. It was about six o'clock in the morning we were employed in it; people might be passing by, but nobody said any thing to us.</p>

I went there with Mr. Day and one or two more: I went up to the garret where we were informed the girls lived, and I saw only one girl there; we searched under the bed, and Mr. Day found a loaded pistol: we had not been three minutes before Kelly and another came up into the room; I thought she seemed to have something bulge in her pocket; upon searching her I found this watch in her hand: she cried, and said I will shew you the lads that I had it from. I took a coach and went to Frog-lane, Islington; she said she was to meet them at a public-house there; Mr. Phillips and I took Davis there; she pointed him out to Mr. Phillips; we put him into the coach; he said, What do you take me up for? I pulled the watch out of my pocket, and asked him if he knew anything of it; he said, Yes, I gave it and a pistol to that girl: he said it was given him by one Stokes, and that Stokes was gone on board a ship.</p>

I went to meet them next morning, but they did not come; I met them next night at the Cock in Craven-street in Aldersgate-street; they sent word where I should meet them; I had the watch with me, but I left the pistol at my lodgings; a person came into the house that knew me, and I came away without giving them the watch: I spoke across the table, and said I would meet them next morning at Islington; I got up in the morning to go there, and went to my mother's for my cloaths; when I returned these men were in the room, and they took the watch out of my pocket; then I went with them to Frog-lane.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see him before? - Mayo has been at the shop several times, but whether he is the person that pawned them or no, I cannot positively swear.</p>
               <p>I ask you if you had ever seen the man at your shop before that brought the buckles to you: then you know Mayo? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it Mayo or no? - I cannot positively swear that it was him.</p>
               <p>Was he the man that brought you the buckles or no? - It might for what I know.</p>
               <p>What name were they pawned in? - In the name of Wright; that is a name that he often makes use of.</p>
               <p>Was you in the shop when the man brought the buckles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And Mayo himself you have often seen before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the person that brought the buckles pawn them in the name of Wright? - He did.</p>
               <p>Was that Wright or was it Mayo? - Him in blue cloaths goes now by the name of Mayo.</p>
               <p>Was that the man? - To the best of my recollection it was.</p>
               <p>Is that prisoner in blue cloaths the person you have often seen at your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that is the person that pawned the things in the name of Wright? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that is the man that brought these buckles to you? - To the best of my recollection it is.</p>
               <p>At what time of the day did he come? - It was some time in the day, it was not by candle light.</p>
               <p>He had frequently dealt at your shop, had he? - Sometimes, not very often.</p>
               <p>From MAYO. Whether he ever knew me pawn any thing there before? I have fetched things out for people; but I never pawned things there in my life. - He has fetched things out, and I have taken some things in of him before this.</p>

             the postboy came in and called Richardson and Dawson and these three men there, and said his master and mistress were at the play, and that they would return about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Who were his master and mistress? - I do not know; and that it was easy to rob them, and he should be very glad if they would rob them, because they kept him out so late of a night.</p>
               <p>Where did you hear this? - At the King's Head, Bear-street, in a back room.</p>
               <p>Did he see you there? - I don't know; I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Was you drinking with them? - I cannot say that; I was in the room with them; I cannot be sure whether I was drinking with them or no.</p>
               <p>You had often drank there together before, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At what time was this? - Between six and seven: they all went out in about half an hour; they did not go out all together.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass about where they were to meet? - He said they were easy to be robbed down by Bayswater; I heard no more of it.</p>
               <p>Then you heard nothing settled where they were to meet? - No; Richardson and Dawson came back in about an hour afterwards, and they went out again; the others were gone.</p>
               <p>How long did Richardson and Dawson stay? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Did they go out again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to stay behind? - Because I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220018"/> had never any notion of doing any thing so bad.</p>
               <p>How came you to stay there? - I used generally to stay there of a night.</p>
               <p>You staid behind, and was much surprized at it? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did you give any information immediately? - I told one Mr. Green of it.</p>
               <p>When? - About three weeks ago.</p>

               <p>Are you positive as to the night? - It was Thursday night, and I believe the eleventh of April; we were at the King's Head in Bear-street drinking in the back room; we had been there some time, and had had two or three pots of beer; we were there about five or six o'clock, and about seven o'clock Robert Leach the postboy came with his post-chaise to the door, and stopped and called for a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Whose chaise was it? - One Mr. Palmer's in Bond-street; he put two young women out of the chaise, and afterwards came in and called to Richardson and me; Richardson and I went out to him, and the other three came out afterwards; we were going out of the back room to make water; we saw him come into the back room to look for his brother-in-law; the three prisoners followed us to the door; we were drinking the beer: said he, I have set down two gentlemen and a lady at the playhouse, and he should be glad if any one would rob them; that they had got plenty of bit in their pockets, meaning money: he went away directly from Bear-street.</p>
               <p>What was said by the parties? - It was all agreed by Richardson, Standish, Mayo, Humphries, and myself to meet him at Kensington Gravel-pits.</p>
               <p>Did you agree at what time to meet? - No; we were to meet upon the road.</p>
               <p>Where did this conversation pass? - Part at the back-door and part at the fore-door; I went out of the house and came back again; when I came back about eight the three prisoners were gone; I went home and had some victuals, but did not stay above a quarter of an hour; they went off by themselves, and Richardson and I followed them, and upon our way we called at Bruton-street Mews, Berkeley-square, where the post-chaise was put up, and had a glass of gin with the postilion Leach; he told us it was then too soon to go, as he did not go out of town till ten o'clock at night: we went upon the road and met Humphries, Mayo, and Standish by Kensington Gravel-pits at the other other side of the turnpike; the postboy told us he should be there about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>What time was it when you met at Kensington Gravel-pits? - I dare say almost half an hour after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>How long did you wait there? - Almost half<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220019"/> an hour; the postboy told us he would be driving very hard, and if we called out stop, he would stop directly; in about half an hour we saw the chaise coming very fast; Richardson called out to him to stop; he stopped directly, and we went up, some on one side the chaise, and some on the other; and one went to the horses heads: we demanded their money.</p>
               <p>Who were in the chaise? - Two young gentlemen and a lady: I got five shillings; Richardson told us he got a guinea and a few shillings; the other three came up and took three pair of shoes and two pair of knee-buckles and a watch; they took the shoes off the lady's feet, and a pair of shoes off the gentlemens feet, and a watch: I called out to Richardson to behave honourable to the lady, upon which he swore he would blow my brains out; they went off directly; they threw away the lady's shoes, but kept the gentlemens shoes; one had the watch and another had a pair of knee-buckles; Mayo had a pair of shoe-buckles, Standish a pair, Humphries a pair,

               <p>You are not a runner at an office? - I am a constable; I do not know what you mean by a runner; if I see a thief I will take him, or go any where after one for the good of my country.</p>

             replied, what is that to you? we are not troubling ourselves with you, you may go about your business: they walked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220026"/> from us twenty or thirty yards, and then gave a loud whistle or two; upon which we all went up towards Blackheath, thinking to meet the smugglers with the goods; but not finding any, we turned to the left into a road that leads, I believe, to Deptford new town; and some time after we came round to the same place we were before at; we waited there for about twenty minutes, then there came past ten or twelve men from Blackheath; they had no sticks or any thing; they passed us and went into Church-street: two men that were in the rear stopped behind the rest; we went up to them and asked them what they were waiting there for? they said, what was that to us? we asked them whether they were waiting our motions or not? we suspected by their being there, that the goods were a coming that road; in the space of about twenty minutes some men returned, to the amount of about ten or a dozen; I am certain there were not less than ten.</p>
               <p>Were they the same men that had passed you before? - That I am not sensible of: they came up with bludgeons and sticks; one cried out, Here they are: they immediately knocked down Mr. Bacon; Pierson and I took towards the watchmen; Mr. Burr made his way, and several of them after him, towards Duke-lane; immediately we went to the watchmen; we had not been there a minute before three or four of them surrounded Pierson and me as we stood against the wall; we desired them to keep off or we would shoot them.</p>
               <p>What arms had you? - We had each a pistol; but not with any intent to fire.</p>
               <p>Were they charged? - I believe one was, but I will not be certain; they said, B - t you, ye dogs, we will sacrifice you: in the space of about six minutes afterwards six men came up to their assistance; I said to

            , which way shall we proceed? he said they are gone, the best way will be to proceed to the watch-house, and make our escape as well as we can: our own party had left us, we could see nothing of them, it was prodigious dark; then six men came to the assistance of these men; upon which we took to our heels in order to get to the watch-house; we proceeded down Church-street; they set up a cry immediately and followed us: at Trinity-alms-houses at Deptford I ran against the chain, and then one struck me; I got under the chain and followed Pierson, who kept strait on; I got under the chain and kept close under the wall, following Pierson towards the old church; when we came upon Deptford-green we desired them to keep back; they were then very near us.</p>
               <p>How many might there be then? - To the amount, I believe, of six or seven, I cannot justly say; Pierson said to me, follow me, I know the way; we went down towards Deptford-green; after we came upon the green, instead of keeping strait on, he went into a turning that goes towards Hughes's-Field; I kept strait on the green; I heard him, but could not see him, it was so dark: of the people that were pursuing us, some followed me, others followed him, three followed me; I heard him cry out, O dear, at the first blow; I suppose they struck him as he was going into the turning; I did not hear any blow; I never heard no more of him till I saw him going into the boat.</p>
               <p>What time of night do you think it was when you parted? - Half after two or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>What time was it when you saw him going into the boat? - About half after four, about an hour afterwards; I came up to the London-hospital with him; I perceived he was violently wounded; he had many cuts upon his head; Mr. Dickerson the surveyor of Deptford had had him dressed by a surgeon before I came up. He died upon the 10th of May at near eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of the people that were pursuing you? - I cannot recollect them; I never had any sight of them before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have you had any sight of them since so as to be able to identify their persons? - To the best of my knowledge Henman is one, but I cannot be positive to him.</p>
               <p>Was he dressed then as he is now? - He had a frock on, and he kept down his head in his bosom to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Is he the only one you can speak to even in that way? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a custom-house officer; I attended at this time to search for smuggled goods: when we were at Deptford, we proceeded to the turnpike leading to Blackheath, where we waited some time, I believe an hour, or an hour and half; between eleven and twelve two men came through the turnpike, who spoke to the deceased, and Mr. Anchor; we were apprehensive they would ill treat them, therefore we came out to them; we were standing by a house, they immediately withdrew about a stone's cast, and gave a whistle, upon which we all four proceeded towards Blackheath; we imagined the smugglers were coming down the hill; when we could see nothing of them, we turned several different turnings to the right and left, at length we came up to Deptford Upper Town again, and at last came to the place from whence we set out; we saw a watchman, we asked him if he had seen two men go past him; he said, yes, they went down Church-street; we waited about half an hour in Deptford Upper Town, under a butcher's shamble, when we saw six, seven, or eight men pass us without any arms, and go down Church-street; the two last men stopped behind, then we withdrew to some elm-trees that were about a stone's cast from us: we asked the watchman what those men were, he said they were riggers come from Woolwich-yard; we did not suspect that these were smugglers; we stopped about twenty minutes at the elm-trees, then we saw about a dozen men coming up Church-street, every one of them armed with a stick or bludgeon; they said, Bugger them, here they are; they came up to me, I kept my back against one of the trees, I said, gentlemen, keep off; they surrounded the tree, and drove me from it, and knocked me down; I was senseless some time with the blow; after I got up again, I was among the crowd of them.</p>
               <p>Was any noise made by any of these persons? - Yes, they gave a war-hoop, something of a whistle, after they came up; they have a particular method of whistling, they clap their knuckles up to their mouths, and make such a shrill noise, that they may be heard for a mile or two. I saw Mr. Burr knocked down on one side of me; while I was knocked down, the other man got off; Mr. Burr and I ran to the right; after some little way, Mr. Burr turned to the right, and I kept strait on.</p>
               <p>Though you do not know who the men were, did you observe the dress of any of them? - There were two dressed like two of the prisoners, Henman and Harley, but I cannot swear that they were the people; it was a darkish morning.</p>
               <p>In what respect were they dressed like these two men? - They were dressed in white frocks; they had flapped their hats over their faces.</p>

               <p>Who keeps the King's Head? - I do not know his name. Gypsey George fetched another bottle of gin; they drank that; they staid an hour, I believe, and then went out; they went up Church-street, searching all the places after these officers; they staid about the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220028"/> Broadway some time; then Gypsey George said, we shall not meet with them to-night; come home, and I will give you some gin, and then we will part and go to bed; in the mean time two men knocked at Gypsey George's door, Gypsey George opened the door, and let them in; they said they wanted some money; they all had a glass of gin a-piece, and they set off to seek these custom-house officers.</p>
               <p>How many might there be in the whole? - I believe ten in the whole; they went immediately over the bridge, where, they said, the officers were gone; then they divided into two parties, one went towards Blackheath, the other towards Greenwich; soon after, those that went towards Greenwich came back, and waited till the other party came to them; then they came all together over Deptford-bridge, and went down Church-street; two men that had staid behind, came up and said, they saw the officers run to the butcher's shambles just over against where the watchman stood.</p>
               <p>Can you tell their names? - No; Gypsey George said, There are enough of us now to go and lick them; Gypsey George came up the street to where the officers were, by three elm-trees, and the other party followed; as soon as Gypsey George came up to the elm-trees, he made a loud alarm, and immediately knocked one man down with his stick.</p>
               <p>Who was there at that time? - All of them; we lost them all for that time; we heard an alarm of them in Church-street; we ran down after them; then I saw Gypsey George take down Hughes's Field; when he came down to the bottom of Hughes's Field, he seized Pierson by the collar, and said, if he did not tell his name, he would cut his throat.</p>
               <p>Who were with him? - The prisoner and myself; Gypsey George knocked Pierson down, and the other three came up and beat Pierson as he lay upon the ground.</p>

               <p>Was there any person with you at the time you was robbed? - I was by myself on foot; there was another person in company with the prisoner; I should know that person if I was to see him; I understand he answers to the name of Richardson.</p>
               <p>Have you recovered any of the things again? - No, none of them.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen them at any time since? - No, never; I heard that my watch had been sold to a Jew with a watch of Captain Young's who has been robbed.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner after the robbery? - I believe that day week at Sir John Fielding's.</p>

               <p>Can you positively take upon you to say that the prisoner is the identical person that robbed you? - The prisoner is the person that put both his hands in my breeches-pocket, while the other held me; I observed them look at me before I came up to them, which drew my attention to them; they came up to me, and the other struck me up against the bank, and said, D - n your eyes, your life or your money.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing to you at the time they robbed you? - I don't recollect that he said any thing; after they had taken my money, they stooped for my buckles; I said, Gentlemen, don't use me ill, my buckles are of no value: Richardson said, B - st your eyes, if you say a word I'll blow your brains out; after they had taken my buckles, the person who is not taken, took me by the shoulder, and Richardson struck me on the side of the face with a stick, and said, D - n your eyes, you shall not look this way, look towards London: there was a post-cha ise coming, I heard it near at hand; they left me directly, I turned again, and went to my friend at the sign of the Crown, and told him I had been robbed; I had not left the house above five minutes: the prisoner took the buckles out of my shoes, and some keys out of my pocket, which they put in again. Here is a person in court they offered my watch to that evening.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker in Petty-France; the prisoner at the bar and one Scandal, who stands here, came to my shop on Monday the 22d of April, about seven in the morning; Scandal produced the watch, but the prisoner said the watch was his property; I opened the watch, and asked a good many questions about it; I found it was not his own, for he said he did not know whether it was gold or no; I had received an information of a watch being lost; I stepped with the watch to Mrs. Mitchel, she owned the watch; when I came back again, these two men were standing in the street; they were taken up and carried before a magistrate. Scandal asked if I would lend a guinea upon it, for that the prisoner had pledged it before, and had taken it out and brought it, but they did not know what was the value of it.</p>

I made Mr. Whitbread acquainted with the whole matter, and he ordered a warrant to be got and Storer taken up; he worked in Edwards's shop, which is in Mr. Whitbread's yard; I think I saw him at work in the shop on Saturday evening, but I cannot be positive.</p>

I said, no, I cannot tell what will poison a horse, I had like to have poisoned myself once by taking mercury; Scott made answer, if I had taken arsenic instead of mercury it would have poisoned me or a horse either; soon after he asked Scott if he would buy him some arsenic: Scott said, if he wanted any he would. On the Saturday afternoon a horse was brought to have a shoe put on; I put it on; I had not nails enough, I went into the shop to point some nails, and saw the prisoner with a ladle before him on the forge; there was nobody at all in the shop; in the ladle there seemed to me to be a ball such as we give to horses that have colds; out of the drawer near the forge he took a paper with brown or yellow powder, and mixed it up together and made a ball, and put the ball he had been mixing in the ladle into a piece of paper, and laid it down upon the vice-bench: I went out to finish putting the shoe on; when I had finished the horse, he told me to go into the stable and put two old shoes on that horse that was lame; I went over with him; he got into the stable; I saw him go up to the horse's head, he had the ball in his hand; I do not know where he took it from, it was the very same ball he had in the ladle; he gave it to the horse; the horse made no resistance at all; then I turned him round to put the shoes on him; I went into the stable and laid hold of the ladle he had made the ball in, it was very nasty; I put it on the fire and wiped it, and put the paper in the fire; I said the ladle was nasty and smelt very strong; he said never mind it: on Monday morning when the horse was dead, he came into the shop where I was at work, and put his hands together and said, I would not have it known I gave the horse any thing for that full of gold; and held his two hands together in this manner (describing it): I never saw him give this horse any medicines in my life before.</p>

               <p>I had a horse of Mr. Whitbread's under my care with a fore leg: Mr. Edwards had him in hand, but could not cure him; he gave him up; I took him in hand and got him so well, that he could walk about; Edwards begged to have him again; he had him about a month; in which time he grew so bad that he flung him up again, and in nine days time I got him so well as to be able to go to grass; I was ordered to take some grass at Islington, and he was to come on Monday: upon Saturday morning I dressed the horse, and he was in full health; on Monday morning between four and five o'clock the horse-keeper called me up and told me the horse was dead; I went to the stable and found the horse dead; I clapped my hands on the flanks of the horse and said he was poisoned; then I looked behind at his burden, and he began to purge, and a great deal of stuff came from him: I would not go away till I saw the horse opened; they cut a gut and the stuff ran out; I desired to have the paunch out whole; I took the paunch out whole and opened it with my knife, and upon the point of my knife I saw this yellow arsenic, and the paper; it had been done up in the ball with the paper; it was digested, and there was the paper.</p>
               <p>Do you undertake to say the horse died of that and nothing else? - Nothing else at all; I think the man that bought it and pounded it for him was as deep in the mud as he was in the mire; they gave the horse two ounces, an ounce would have done.</p>
               <p>Was the horse taking any balls at this time? - None at all; the horse was in good health; this is the stuff (producing it) that I took from the horse; there is yellow arsenic among it: there was a dispute between Edwards and me about the horse; I do not believe the prisoner would have done it if he had not been bid.</p>

               <p>The deceased was brought up to me as nurse in the ward; I was going to put her into bed; I pulled her cap off and I perceived a hole in the top of her head; that was about a week or ten days before she died; the hole at the top of her head was like an issue hole; I said, Grace, you have got a hole in your head, how came you by it? said she, My dear soul, I fell down and hit it against the screw of the bedstead: I got some lint and made a poultice, and put it into the hole of her head, and put a plaister on it.</p>

               <p>How long did she live after that? - I believe eight or nine days, and then she died.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the condition of her health before that? - She was pretty hearty, but she went out of the house and came in again; she was about seventy years of age: I heard her make no complaint, but she seemed stupid and would ramble; we used to think she made herself wicked; that was about a month or six weeks before she died; she seemed like superannuated, and was very silly about the house.</p>
               <p>No surgeon looked at it? - We never heard a word of it she was so stupefied, and so intolerably wicked she would go into any body's place and rob them.</p>

               <p>I am in the work-house: I heard that the prisoner and the deceased had broke one another's pipes; they were both smoakers; I heard a noise; I saw him strike her with a stick four times about the head; this was about a month after the affair in the nursery; she was quite stupefied for a long time afterwards; she lived about three weeks after she received these blows; she struck him three blows.</p>
               <p>Who struck first? - He.</p>
               <p>What was the occasion of this? - About breaking the pipes; they were both smoaking; they stood close by the fire place.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts upon the head did he hit her? - It came down by the side of her shoulders; he hit her upon the head.</p>

               <p>Were they violent blows? - They came pretty sharp.</p>

               <p>The last quarrel the prisoner had, was in regard to breaking her pipe; it commenced upon her stealing a piece of cloth out of his box, and a linen apron of a woman's; she hid it for the space of five or six days; a good woman there found them concealed under the head of her bed; words arose upon that; he gave her a blow upon the shoulder, she up with a broomstick that she had, to strike him again.</p>
               <p>How long was this before she died? - It was the 16th of April that happened;

               <p>I did not see this old woman till she was dead.</p>
               <p>Do you attend the work-house as surgeon? - No; there is an apothecary attends it; when there are any chirurgical cases that require assistance, they are sent to the hospital; I was called a day or two after the death by desire of the apothecary to inspect her head, as they did imagine it had been the cause of her death; on taking off the cap I saw a small bruise, about the size of a silver groat, exactly upon the top of her head; I took my probe, passed it into the wound, and was very much astonished to find that it went in four inches between the two hemispheres of the brain; I then, in the presence of the apothecary, and some other gentlemen, denuded the skull, by taking off a piece of the scalp; I could not discover any trace of a fracture; the bone was very offensive and very carious about the size of a shilling; I then took out a piece of the bone; I trepanned her; I found the two coverings of the brain were gangreened, and eat quite through; and I undertake to pronounce that that wound, however it happened, was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>By what sort of instrument did that wound seem to be given? - It might be altered in its appearance by being neglected, that it is hard to say; it must have been by a considerable bruise.</p>
               <p>You have heard that she fell against a screw of the bed, and that she had two violent blows with that stick that broke her head; did it appear to you that her falling against a screw might occasion this? - It might; it must be some hard body that had done it, whether it was a bed-screw or a stick, or what other body, it is impossible to say; it had been of some standing, the bone could not have been so carious, as it was, soon.</p>
               <p>How long would it take to occasion that; might it in three weeks? - Yes, it might; it depends a great deal upon the habit of the body; she was 75 years of age, and wrong applications might encrease it.</p>
               <p>Did you see what had been applied to it? - They told me some yellow basilicon.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Newmarket-street, May-fair, upon what I have: on the 8th of January I was robbed of a band-box, containing the several things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) the box had a lock and key upon it; it was in a public house, the prisoner and another man took it from me between three and four in the afternoon; I was going to a place, in Covent-garden, I don't know what street; we were in the parlour backwards.</p>
               <p>Was you acquainted with the prisoner? - No; I never saw him but once before, he came to my apartments and said he was sent by the other man; the other man and I went into the parlour together; he told me his name was Fletcher, but the prisoner told me his name was Davis.</p>
               <p>Was Fletcher your acquaintance? - No; some time before I met him in the street, he called me by my name, and asked me where I was going, and if I did not know him in the country? I said I knew nothing of him; he said he would go home with me, and said he was a linen-draper in York-street, Covent-garden; he came to me afterwards to my place, and asked me if I had received any linen; he said he had sent me a great quantity by a porter, and as I had not received the linen, he must take up the porter, but he could not do it without I paid him some money first; and upon that I gave him five guineas; he came to me afterwards, and asked me to go and live servant with his sister-in-law; I agreed to go, and took my band-box and things with me, and went with him; I thought to go to the place, and he took me into a public house, and called for six-penny worth of brandy and water, and the prisoner came in; I put the band-box on a table in the parlour of the public house; they called each other out, and spoke to one another at the door; I said I did not chuse to be so late at my place, and told the other man I would not stop; that was between three and four in the afternoon; I sat about a quarter of an hour, then I looked behind me on the table, and my box was gone.</p>
               <p>Were they both in the room? - Yes, they were both together.</p>
               <p>Did you see your band-box in the room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220046"/> after they went out and talked together? - No, I did not look.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay out talking? - I saw no more of them; I don't know when the box was taken away, nor by which of them; I called the maid, and asked her if they were gone; she said she did not know; I asked the master, and he said they paid for the six-penny worth of brandy and water, and ran fast down the yard.</p>
               <p>You never saw the prisoner before; are you sure he is the man? - Yes; two or three days before he was taken, he came into the house where I was to take possession of some goods; I said I thought I knew him, and asked him if his name was not Blackett? he said it was; I had heard his name mentioned when they were together; the other man called him Blackett; and then I asked him where the other was? he said if I would give him a bottle of wine, or some money, he would tell me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I live upon what I have, I had 3000 l. left me.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to any body about this trial yesterday? - Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Did you say if this man would give you five guineas you would not appear against him? - I said no such thing; I said if the person would come and pay me half my money and half my expences, the bill might be thrown out; and he said he would put me in a way of doing it.</p>

               <p>He called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            's: I went with Mr. Clark, the first day of last sessions, to a house by Battle-bridge-wells, in Britania-street, I believe it is; Mr. Clark first sent a gentleman's servant with a letter in his hand for Mr Askew, to get the easier admittance into the house; the door was opened by Mrs. Horner, myself and Mr. Evans rushed into the house; we immediately ran up stairs, and upon the garret stairs, within three or four steps of the top, I met Askew; he had got on a cheque shirt, the sleeves of which were tucked up, and the collar was unbuttoned; he pressed very much to come down stairs; we had a little struggle with him; I insisted upon his going up stairs, and we forced him up: when we met him on the stairs, Bissell ran out of a garret that is on the left hand into a garret that fronts the stairs; we took Askew into the front garret, and kept him there till Mr. Clark came.</p>
               <p>How was Bissell dressed? - He had his coat off, a silk handkerchief tied round his head, his breeches knees were unbuttoned, he had no garters on, and was in a sweat; they both seemed to be in a working condition; their hands were all over mould and sand; they both wanted much to wash their hands, but I would not let them till Mr. Clark came up: in the front garret there was a forge fixed, a crucible upon the fire, with some metal in it, and a large quantity of charcoal lying by; there were the flasks; there was some sand, which was hot, that must have been just made use of; there was scouring-paper, and a bottle of aqua-fortis; these were all in the front garret, into which Bissell ran; there was a small earthen tea-cup, with some pickle in it, which is used in that business, and some water in a quart stone pan, of a greenish colour;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220047"/> there was, in a larger pan, some very dirty water, and by that was a scrubbing-brush, and a little earthen platter, with some common scouring sand, and the floor was wet where they had been scouring something, I suppose the counterfeit silver.</p>
               <p>Who were in company? - Clark, Evans, Heley, myself, and a gentleman's servant. I went some few days afterwards with Mrs. Horner, and found some scouring-paper, and some few other things.</p>

               <p>I was at the Old Bailey last Sessions; Mr. Clark came up to me, and said there were some coiners in my parish, and asked me, as being constable of the parish, to go with him; I went with him to this street, I think it is called Britannia-street; it is near Bagnigge-wells; Mr. Clark, Mr. Bryant, Mr. Heley, and I, went together, a gentleman's servant went with us, with a great coat, whip, and pair of boots; Mr. Clark gave him a letter, and bid him knock at the door, under pretence of asking for a person; the door was opened by Mrs. Horner; while he was speaking to Mrs. Horner, Mr. Bryant and I rushed by him; Mrs. Horner cried out, Master, four distinct times; we immediately rushed up to the garret; when we came almost to the landing-place of the garret, Askew was down one step or two; he had a cheque shirt on, his sleeves were tucked up, his collar was unbuttoned, he had no garters, his breeches knees were loose, and, if I remember right, the flap of his shirt was out before, and his hands excessive dirty, as if he had been working in some sand, or something of that kind: Bryant laid hold of him; I ran into the room to the other people, and we tied their hands; they wanted to wash their hands, we would not let them; the other prisoner ran out of the back into the fore room; we tied both of their hands there; Bissell's hands were very dirty and whitish. When I told Askew that Mr. Clark was there, he said, I would not have minded if all the men in England had taken me, if it had not been Mr. Clark; Clark blamed him, and asked him how he could do so; he said, He could not help it, it was now too late to talk about it; Mr. Clark shook his head, and said, O Tom, Tom, how could you do so! Mr. Clark, said he, it is over, and I cannot help it; Mr. Clark said, now, Tom, be candid, do show us where the things are; we searched the fore room, we found every implement that was there as was described by the other witness; then said Askew, If you will come along with me I will shew you where they all are; we went into a back room; there was a wide large chest, upon which were files, scouring-paper, and some shillings and six-pences, and upon the floor on the right hand side going in, there was, I believe, a hundred shillings, six-pences, and half-crowns; I saw likewise the aqua fortis: there was a crucible on the fire red hot, whether there was metal in it or no I could not be certain, as it was thrown on one side; I found some sand, which was broke up, that was hot; there were some moulds that the flasks had been fixed in; there were some files, scouring-paper, and a little pipkin with some wet stuff prepared, and there was another bason of water in the room of a green colour; Mr. Clark put his hand into that, and took out some shillings and six-pences: there was a scrubbing-brush lay down by the side of it.</p>

               <p>Did you see any forge? - That was in the fore room; it is not properly a forge, it is the same the refiners use on purpose to melt in.</p>
               <p>What quantity of counterfeit money did you see in both rooms? - I believe twelve half-crowns, and half a hat full of shillings; I found three shillings on Mrs. Horner, which were good; I asked her why she gave a report to Mr. Askew that we were coming? she said she thought she had a just right so to do.</p>

            ; Bryant and Evans were at that time up stairs in the garret; they called me up; when I came up I saw the two men prisoners: Mr. Askew was in a cheque shirt, and an old pair of breeches, his stockings were about his heels, and he had on a pair of slippers; he was rather in a sweat; his hands were daubed all over with a sort of mould that was found in the room; the other man had a handkerchief tied round his head, his stockings were down: he was taken down into the one pair of stairs to tie up his stockings, and he begged to be washed, which was refused<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220048"/> him; at that time his hands were the same as the other: Bissell's hands were green.</p>
               <p>How came they so? - I fancy by handling metal, or something of that sort: we went into the front garret first, there I found a furnace, some call it a forge; it is an air furnace which they melt metal in; a crucible on the fire, with some metal in it, two pair of flasks, some sand in a box which is here, warm; there was a quart pan with some water, and by the side of that was a tea-cup with something green in it; it appeared to be aqua-fortis and water.</p>
               <p>You call that pickle, don't you? - We do; there was a bottle with aqua-fortis; in the quart pan I found these three counterfeit shillings (producing them): I begged Askew would not give me any trouble, but shew me where all the things were; then he took me into the back garret adjoining to the other; the first things I saw in the back garret were three files, and other things (producing them) a bottle of aqua-fortis: these flasks are made use of in casting; whatever is cast, in making the first part of the mould sand is laid, the sand itself is of a porous nature, and would leave it spongy if cast in sand alone, but here is some facing, which, when put upon it, fills up the pores of the sand, and strengthens it, and it is cast much smoother.</p>
               <p>Court. Can these flasks be applied to any other purpose than that of coining money? - Yes; they can be used in the silversmiths business.</p>
               <p>Court. Then all we understand from it is, that these flasks are used for coining silver, but may be applied to other purposes? - Yes; searching Bissell's person I found these two shillings (producing them) and here are two six-pences.</p>
               <p>Are these bad shillings? - They are, and the six pences are bad; he had these in his pocket: in the back garret where all these things were, I found these finished shillings; and here is the metal that was in the paper; here are the files, they have something white in the teeth, but that may be done with something else; all the words that passed that I heard was, Askew said he wished we had not come so soon, if we had been half an hour later, it would all have been over; that he did not intend to coin any more, for he had took a house in Smithfield, and paid ten guineas earnest; Bissell said he came to help him move his goods: there were no goods there to carry away; there was only a great trunk or box which they worked upon by way of a work bench.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Mrs. Horner? - Not any thing particular; her hands were examined, they were green, the same as Bissell's were.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I believe you are a silversmith? - I am more in the cane head way; I have worked in both.</p>
               <p>Are you skilled in the casting of silver and other metals? - I am.</p>
               <p>You have given an account that these flasks may be used in casting other metals besides coining; I suppose your knowledge goes so far as to know that every tool produced here may be used for many other purposes besides coining? - Every thing besides the money.</p>

               <p>I am a monier belonging to the mint: this money is very bad, there can be no doubt; if you rub them on a bit of sand you see they are copper immediately; they are all of them very bad; the best not worth above two-pence or a penny a piece (one shewn him); I have seen several; this is as good as any of them, and it is as bad as bad can be.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Whether that very bad shilling, which is as bad as bad can be, strongly resembles the current coin of this kingdom? - They are so covered, I frequently take them myself by candlelight.</p>
               <p>To CLARK. Whether they were not duller than they are now when you found them, and not so much like the current coin? - They were more like the current coin.</p>

I told him I came to pay my rent to my landlord, and the office was shut up; he said he came out of Kent to a lawyer, and he supposed he was too late to meet with him; we walked together and he talked of some people in Kent; he mentioned the names of several I was well acquainted with; I said I would carry the money to Mr. Silway's chambers, for I would not carry it back again; he said he would go with me and shew me his chambers; we went up Chancery-lane and crossed Holborn into Gray's-inn-lane; we went about two hundred yards up and down, and then he said, if I would go into a public house we might have intelligence; we went into a public house, and he called for six-penny worth of Crank, and he asked me if I would sit down; I sat down, and in came the other prisoner and pulled out a purse of money, and said he had drank fourteen glasses of brandy that morning standing; he said he was a captain just come home: we went out from there, and he said he would shew me the way to Mr. Silway's chambers; then we went into Mrs. Troutbeck's and called for a bottle of wine; they hit my knuckles with a half-penny, and then asked me to put the half-penny under a bottle; while I was doing it they took the money out of my pocket; I saw the money in their hand, but they ran away so fast I could not speak; they broke a glass in their hurry in running out; the money was in a bag in my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>When they run out you felt in your pocket? - Yes, it was gone; I saw the bag in their hands, and the note was in the bag.</p>

               <p>Was that a week or a fortnight after you was plundered? - I believe it was about a fortnight.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Mattison: I fastened every part of my master's house on Monday night last; when I got up in the morning I found the chain down and the door on the single lock; I went into the compting-house and found the compting-house window shoved down; it opens from the top; there was a half shutter, which was no t taken down; there is a pane of glass broke in the window; I found the window broke and my master's desk open; I went and informed my master of it directly.</p>
               <p>Did you double lock the door and put the chain up over night? - Yes, my master saw me do it.</p>
               <p>Is it a spring lock that will shut with pulling to? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What o'clock did you find it broke open?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220052"/> - Between seven and eight; I was the first person up.</p>
               <p>Mr. MATTISON. My servant called me on the Tuesday morning, and told me the house was broke open; I went down and found the compting-house window broke; it was cut at the bottom; my desk, which had been wrenched open, was in great confusion, all the papers were moved; I looked into the drawer I keep my bills in, and every bill was gone, eight guineas, and several silver pocket pieces were likewise taken away; I referred to the bill book immediately that I might stop payment of the bills; I found many leaves had been torn out; this is the book (producing it) all the leaves were torn out that contained the bills that I had received last year.</p>
               <p>Here is a French bill of exchange, you speak particularly to that bill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the date of it? - No, it is here.</p>
               <p>From the JURY. Did you see your servant fasten up the doors that night? - I did.</p>
               <p>Were all the bills safe that night when you went to bed? - I went out at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was the bill book safe that night? - I believe so, I did not look at it; I cannot say that I had seen it that day.</p>

               <p>Was that one of your bills? - Yes, it has my own hand writing on it, marking the day it would become due.</p>
               <p>Did you suspect any one being concerned in this? - I imagined it must be somebody that had lived in the house, and knew I entered the bills in that book; one of the prisoners (the boy) had lived with me; he left me in November: there was some blood on the glass that was broke, as if somebody had cut their finger.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find any of your bills again besides this? - Yes, all of them: I lost some black silk and black sattin (the silks and sattins produced): I have looked at them all and sealed them up; I am sure they are my own property; they have my own private mark upon them.</p>
               <p>What is the value of them? - I cannot say; I believe about eighteen or nineteen pounds; they were in a press by the desk; they are all stained with blood; I saw them not many days before.</p>

I said if it is drawn upon Mr. Pollard, who is in partnership with the house in Bartholomew-lane; but this is not Bartholomew-lane, it is Basinghall-street. Copperthwaite said, It is that Mr. Pollard, and though the house is in Bartholomew-lane, he lives in Basinghall-street, and you know that to be as good a house as any in London.

When Mr. Broughton came in with the bill, he and I were at Old Will's Coffee-house together, we talked the matter over in our conversation; he promised that he would take half cash, in the course of a week or ten days, if I would give him the remainder. I sent him up 22 l. to Mr. Leveridge, he was to go to pay a note; he did not come upon the Saturday night, and then the advertisement came in. When he found I could not get the money, he said he would prevent my joining the regiment, as he knew I was an officer in the militia.</p>
