I said,"What money, child?" he said, "Here is a 40l. and a 20l. note, a sovereign, and two sixpences; I said, "It is a great deal of money for a boy like you to have - I should advise you to take it home;" he said, "It is all right, you need not be frightened;" I said, "Well, I will take care of it for you;" he rolled the notes, sovereign, and sixpences up together, and I put them into a little place in the till - I felt a little timid, and put it into the hands of a gentleman in the bar - Kay had then gone into the parlour; the gentleman looked at it, and from what he said, I called Kay out of the parlour immediately, and gave him the money; I said, "This is a great deal of money for a little boy like you to have, and I think you are in low company - you had better go home with it;" he took the money, and put it into his pocket; he said it was his brother-in-law's money: I had put it into the till as I took it out of his hand -I immediately after gave it to the gentleman; I did not look at it myself - it was rolled up; Kay took the money, put it into his fob-pocket, and then I sent for Clements, the Policeman, who came in about five minutes; I paid no attention to what passed - Kay had gone into the parlour, where Barrett was; Clements went in there - he rang the bell, and told the waiter to tell me to call Kay out, which I did; I did not hear what passed between him and Clements.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in Princes-street, Lisson-grove. I have known the two prisoners above two years; they both called on me on the 7th of December, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, in a cabriolet - Barrett had a bundle under his arm; they did not lodge with me then: Kay came in first - he presented a sovereign to me, and requested me to give it to his mother, as she was coming to work for me next day - she is a washer and ironer; Barrett was present then - Barrett said he was very unwell, and could not attend the office that night - he wanted my son-in-law, Marlow, to take a note down to the Post-office for him; I gave him a pen and ink - he wrote it in my presence, and Marlow took it; he left my house a little after four o'clock, and said, "Take care of this bundle for me - I will call for it by and by;" he said it was his red coat - I knew he was a letter-carrier; he requested me to send Marlow to the sign of the George the Fourth, Duke-street, Lisson-grove, on his return, which I did; I placed the bundle on the floor in my back parlour, and about half-past ten o'clock I wished to go to bed - I went down to Duke-street, which is not far, to beg him to fetch the bundle - he requested me to take a small glass of brandy, which I did; I saw there, my son-in-law, the two prisoners, and two other persons - they were standing at the bar when I went in: they said if I would wait a bit they would come with me - they had two bottles of sherry while I staid there - they stood and drank it; Kay paid for them - the two prisoner and Marlow came home with me, Barrett seemed unwilling to go away - I said I could not accommodate them with a bed, and he and Kay remained in my front parlour all night - they had no candle; I fetched the bundle out to Barrett, and he laid his head on it: on the following morning, at five o'clock, I called him to go to the office, as he desired; Kay said Barrett was unwell, and could not go - I did not see them; I had locked them in the room, and unlocked it to call them - I then went up stairs, and finished dressing myself; I came down again, and lighted the fires: Barrett said he was very cold - I made him some breakfast; Barrett then requested Marlow to take some letters and five sovereigns to the Post-office, and to say he could not attend - the five sovereigns were to be given to any of the inspectors; I believe there are four inspectors: after that he washed himself, and quitted the house - he gave me the bundle, saying, "Take care of this, it is my red coat - mind, it is Government property;" I put it into my back parlour - this was on the 8th of December - it remained there till Sunday, the 11th; when I went out I took the bundle up to my bed-room, which is the second floor back room - I put it on the floor, and cantered it under the bed with my foot; I returned about half-past nine o'clock at night, found my bed-room door had been forced open, and the bundle taken away - it was tied in a dirty blue handkerchief, with while spots; I had not other bundle under the bed, nor any other of that size and description in my house; I saw it again at Marlborough-street, and knew it to be the same: I have two lodgers; I left my son-in-law and daughter in the house - they have an apartment up stairs, but are generally with me below.</p>

I took the prisoner in custody, searched him immediately, and found part of the silver pen-case, the cover of an ink-bottle, some paint, and 3s. in silver; he had no shoes nor bat - he said they had pulled his shoes off by pulling him about, but when I saw them they were unlaced; he said they were his when produced.</p>

            . The silver snuff-box was a present to me eight or nine years ago; I should think it cost two guineas - the case of instruments are worth 1l., they cost me that - I had them when a boy; I looked over the wall, and about the yard, but could not find the property; I found a chisel had been thrown over the wall - the prisoner got with his hands close to the wall; he was there a very short time, but long enough to have thrown the things over the wall - I did not go up stairs between four and eight o'clock; I did not open the window - Mrs. Corbet was absent all day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About six o'clock I went from home to Portman new market, to see it - I returned at eight, went home, and unlaced my shoes; supper was not ready - my mother asked me to go to the prosecutor's, to see if my brother was there playing at cards, as there are always people gambling there; instead of going into the tap-room I went through the passage to go to the water-closet, and as I came back, the prosecutor was in the passage with a light in his hand - he said, "There is a thief in the house, James, will you assist me in securing him?" as I came in, I was surrounded, knocked about, and taken for the thief; as to the pen-case, on my dying oath, I can swear it must have been conveyed into my pocket by somebody surrounding me.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 3rd of January, about five minutes to five o'clcok, I was in my shop serving a customer, and heard a pane of glass snap; I lifted up some pictures in the window, and saw the prisoner's hands through the window, holding some paper, which was nearly as far inside the window as he could reach; I then went out, and stood behind him for about a minute and a half, and he was in the act of drawing the paper out, when I laid hold of him - he had quite moved it from the place where it had been; I brought him into the shop, and gave him in charge of the Policeman, Graham; there were three more with him, but they ran away - I did not know him before; the window had been broken before; there was a hold about the size of my two fingers - that hold was not large enough to draw the paper out; when I secured him the pane of glass was nearly out of the window - it had been broken two days before, and I put a large stiff piece of card against it, and nailed a piece of wood at the top and bottom; I put two tobacco-jars behind that - they were all removed, and the card pushed down; they continued in that way till I heard the glass crack - the paper was not actually taken away.</p>

On the 28th of November he was at the house, and went away about five minutes before two o'clock in the afternoon; he had come to nail some matting over a passion flower in the garden - he then came out of the garden into the kitchen, and staid there for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, the outside; I let him out at the side gate leading to the garden - the milkman came to the door, and the tallow-chandler's-man, with candles; they were the only persons I saw that afternoon; I did not go up stairs at all - I went into the kitchen, but no further, till about a quarter to five o'clock, when my fellow servant went up to shut up the house, and called me; I went up, and found the hall door open - I went into the dining-room, but missed nothing there; I found the drawing-room window open, and the clock gone off the marble slab; the window opens in front of the house - there is a small lawn before it: it was a French clock - my fellow-servant went out to get assistance; she brought the prisoner, who lived a short distance off - I asked him to look over the house, for it had been robbed; he said he would go, but it was an unthankful office - we went into four bed-rooms; we first went into the bed-room over the dining-room, and missed mistress' gold watch off the mantel-piece; it had a chain and seals to it; I saw the chain and seals afterwards at Hatton-garden, but not the watch: master and mistress were out - both the doors of the wardrobe in the bed-room were open; I cannot say whether any thing was gone from there - we all came down stairs, and the prisoner said, "You may shut up your house - it is very safe now; don't frighten yourselves - there is nobody in the house;" my fellow-servant went to fetch mistress - the prisoner came into the kitchen once while she was gone; Mr. Wilkinson's coachman was there, and saw him; the priosner said, "You don't want me, I will go;" mistress came home - I missed a kitchen cloth out of my drawer: I had not been in the drawing-room all day before the alarm; I was taken into custody, and bailed - I do not know when the prisoner was taken: a dusting-brush was lost off a marble slab, and a bottle cover - I was cook, and had nothing to do with the drawing-room: the bottle cover belonged to mistress' dressing-case, which was in her bed-room: I afterwards saw them at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You had known the prisoner some time? A. No, about two months - he had been in the habit of taking tea with me, and we were friendly together: I supposed him to bear a good character - I did not know he was married, but have understood so since: he was working as journeyman to Mr. Protheroe, a nurseryman - he had been in the house before, and in the kitchen with both of us: the property was safe in the morning, no doubt - he came into the kitchen from the garden, and remained in the kitchen with me till he left; I never had him out of my sight - he did not returned to me till after the property was missed - I never saw him in the house: Mr. Gostling's father lives in the neighbourhood - he has a gardener named Isaac: he was in the kitchen with me and the prisoner that day, and had a drop of beer: the prisoner never left me, and I never left him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was fetched did he use all diligence in searching the house? A. Yes: he had been in the habit of coming to the house for five or six weeks - we never missed any thing before; I had asked him to tea that evening, and he said he would come down - I go up stairs every day to help make the beds, and have seen the bottlecover by chance, when mistress has left her case open, and this appears to me to be like it; the brush was to dust the ornaments in the drawing-room - the prisoner knew the housemaid was gone for mistress; he came into the kitchen while she was gone; he went out directly, and said as the house was safe inside he would stand at the gate, and watch - the front door is wood: I found that door open - I believe it was always kept with the chain up when master and mistress were from home; I do not know whether it had been chained that day; the drawing-room window was found open, as if the person had come in at the window, and gone out at the door; the prisoner attended to his work regularly while there - Isaac went out of the kitchen I suppose a quarter of an hour before the prisoner; the prisoner both eat and drank there that day; he was on friendly terms with the servants - I did not lose sight of him at all; when he left our house he said he was going to Mr. Harrison's, to work - he came at his dinner hour to do the passion flower, and as we were at dinner I asked him to take some: Mr. Wilkinson's coachman came while the servant was gone for mistress - I cannot say whether the drawing-room window was fastened; there is only the lawn between that and the road; it has a very low balcony - it is not a French window: it cannot be reached without getting on the balcony, which a person could easily do from the ground - the prisoner came between one and two o'clock: he did not come into the kitchen till he had nailed the flower, which took him about ten minutes; I had seen him come in: I do not think he had time then to get in at the window, and take the things: he left at two to go to work -I did not see him again till he returned with the housemaid.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell him what had been lost? A. No - I said the house had been robbed; he went with us to look over the house, and saw what was missed; we all three went into mistress' bed-room together.</p>

On the last day of November, or the 1st of December, the prisoner came to my house, and offered to pledge an ormoln clock, with a shade, for 8l. - it was a large French clock, with the figures of Milton and his daughter; it had and oval wooden stand containing music - I asked who he brought it from; he said from a gentleman in Caroline-place, Regent's-park:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050011"/>I asked if he would allow my young man to go and see the gentleman - he said No, he was a strange sort of man, and he did not like to see any one, or something to that effect; I asked if he could bring a note from the gentleman - he said No: I then told him he might take away his clock - he did so; the figures represented Milton's daughter writing from his dictation; I did not try the music - it appeared like the music of a musical snuff-box- he told me there was music in it, and I saw there was a string to pull out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have been a pawnbroker many years? A. I have been there six years and longer in the trade; his account was suspicious, but I was not positive he had stolen it - my suspicions were not strong enough to detain him; I do not know that I ever saw him before - it was either on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday: I think it was a fine day, but cannot charge my memory - he had a brown coat on; I should say it was the same as he has now - I talked to him for ten minutes; I cannot say what figures were on the clock - my impression was that it was a silver dial; it was white, I believe- I can almost swear it was not a gilt one; it was a round pendulum, I think, but it is impossible to recollect those minute particulars; Milton and his daughter would strike any body before any thing else - it was superior to what I see on many clocks; I cannot say whether there were two holes to wind or one, or whether it would strike.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you open it? A. No.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Simmons-street, Chelsea. About the 29th or 30th of November the prisoner came into the nursery-ground where I work - he gave me 1s. to fetch some beer; we drank it, and I went to dinner - he came to the same place next day, and was talking about a young man who was out of place - he said it would be of no use for that man to stop in a nursery, he had better go and get acquinted with a cook, as he had done, and then he would have plenty; he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out some sovereigns - there appeared to me about twenty; I immediately went away.</p>

            . I keep the Duke of Wellington public-house, Crawford-street, Marylebone. This clock was left at my house, to the best of my recollection, on Tuesday, the 29th, or Wednesday, the 30th of November -Burford, who is servant to Mr. Abbott, of Wyndham-place, came that day with a stranger, who I could not swear to; they went into my parlour, and had two glasses of brandy and water, which the stranger paid for - the stranger then asked me if he could leave these two parcels, which were tied up in two silk pocket handkerchiefs; the clock was in one parcel, and the stand in another - I gave him leave; I did not then know the contents: he told me they were heavy, and to take care of them; I took them up stairs, locked them up, came down, and asked him particularly whether any stranger was to have them, and what time he would fetch them; he said he would fetch them himself between seven and eight o'clock that evening, but he did not come; I heard nothing more of him - the bundles were in my custody till last night. On the 22nd of December a young man came to me, with Burford, for the clock, but I refused to deliver it to any body but the person who left it - they came a second time; I did not deliver it, but went next morning to Marylebone-office, stated the case to Alderson, the officer, and the Policeman came and received the clock.</p>

I said, "That is Watford," meaning that was a word used at Watford - nothing more passed then; I walked on about thirty yards - he kept just behind me, and when I came to the George gateway, (that road leads on Uxbridge-common,) there were two men standing in the gateway, and as I went across the gateway I received a very heavy blow from the prisoner, which knocked me down - he was behind me, and gave me a heavy blow, which cut my eye-lid open; I hallooed Murder! and called Hitchin, knowing the watchman, who was going before me; I fell with the blow - my hat was knocked off; I saw the prisoner pick it up, and when I called Murder! Hitchin! they all three ran away together - I had seen the prisoner before; he belonged to lockenden two miles from Uxbridge - I never had any acquaintance with him; my handkerchief was in my hat; I ran after them about thirty yards, calling Murder! and picked my handkerchief up, but have never got my hat - I could not overtake them; the prisoner was taken next evening.</p>

It was; it all took place in a very short time; Uxbridge is a large town - I never spoke to the prisoner before; I was knocked nearly six yards - he was behind me when he struck the blow, but there was a good gaslamp over the gateway; he was behind me, or rather on one side when he gave me the blow - I knew where he lived; I did not go to his house - he had no home but his father's, and I did not expect to find him there; I expected he would be denied - he was found at a public-house a mile and a half from where he lived; I had been looking for him all day.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Uxbridge. About twelve o'clock at night I heard a cry of Murder! I had seen the prisoner at Uxbridge that night, and tried to persuade him to go out of the street; when I heard the alarm I found it was the prosecutor - I could see the shadow of the prisoner's back as he passed the gate, on hearing the cry, and to the best of my knowledge it was the prisoner; there were two short men with him - he was the tallest; I tried to catch them, but could not - I took up the handkerchief in the way they ran, and gave it to Johnson; he was just getting up when I got up to him, and his eye was bleeding; I was about forty yards off when I heard the cry.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. His back was towards you, and you caught a glimpse of a man who you thought was tall? A. Yes; the prisoner appeared sober when I saw him -I had been sent for to get him out of the Bell about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock; I did not see the face of the man who ran from Johnson, but there was a strong lamp just by - I had my lantern in my hand; to the best of my knowledge he is the man - I did not see his face; I had got him and others out of the Bell, and they refused to go away, as they said they were on the King's highway.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. You turned to look at a horse - were you not rather flurried? A.

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner wait there till the prosecutor came back? A. He waited a minute, looked up the court, and then went away; I saw the prosecutor come back - I rather think I had seen the prisoner and that man go out together between ten and eleven o'clock that morning, but am not positive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you remember what kind of a day it was? A.

            ; we had agreed that morning to rob Mrs. Cole's house - Davis was the first that spoke about it; he told us that Mrs. Cole was out - the prisoner was present, and we agreed to meet at the Queen's Head in the evening, which we did; I was there at five o'clock - the prisoner, I believe, did not come till about six; Davis was there between five and six - Kite did not come then; while we were there we agreed to go and break open Mrs. Cole's house - we sat out for that purpose about ten minutes after twelve o'clock; before that we went to the Two Sawyers, and from there to the Bell - that was the last place we were at before we set out to do the robbery; we went from the Bell to Mrs. Cole's - we met Webb, the watchman, in Bell-lane, after we came from the Bell; when we got to Mrs. Cole's we sat in the summer-house till we heard the watchman cry half-past twelve o'clock - I then gave Seth a short crowbar out of my pocket, and he went and made an attempt to get into the back part of the house; finding he could not easily gain an entrance he went to the front - the house is all enclosed; he wrenched open the front parlour window - he first opened the window, and then burst the inner shutters in; there was no outer shutter - I believe the window was fastened; it is a folding window - I am sure it was closed; the shutters were fastened - Davis, Kite, and Seth then went into the house, and I stood outside; they had no light till they got in - they struck a light when they got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they carry a tinder-box with them? A. Yes; they had been in nearly two hours before I saw any thing of them - they then brought me three or four bundles tied up; I carried them, and put them into the summer-house - they all three went back into the house, and had not been there long before their light went out; Kite and I went across the road, to a gentleman's house opposite, where there is a lamp, and got another light - after they had been in some time they brought me out some wine in a jug; they then went back, and stopped some time - I went to see if they were not coming; they made me stop and drink some more wipe in the house, and we all came away together - we took the bundles from the summer-house, and went straight to the Queen's Head stables - Webb came there two or three minutes after we got there; he saw Kite and Davis, and asked them what they were doing there - they said they had been out having some beer; Webb went away, and then one of them either let or kicked down a jug which they had brought some wine in - Webb then came up and made an alarm; Kite and Davis were the first two who ran away - I followed them; Seth was left behind in Queen's Head yard- I took with me two bundles, which contained the knives and forks and two tea-pots, and a bundle containing plate.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050014"/>Q. Then had you seen what was in the bundles? A. No - I saw what the two I had contained; I went up the lane leading from Whitton, and concealed them in a garden there - I saw a weather-glass at the Queen's Head, also a tea - caddy and two paintings; they were loose, not in bundles - I saw them all at the stable; they had all been brought from Mrs. Cole's - I never returned to the garden; part of the things have been found - I went with the officer to show him where to find them; I was taken up on suspicion on the Tuesday week following, and told what I knew the second time they had me at the office -Seth was taken before me; I took the officer to the garden - the knives, forks, and tea-pots were found, but not the plate; I was committed to give evidence, and have been a prisoner ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You come to give evidence to save yourself? A. Yes - nobody was present when I buried the things; I did not fetch the plate away afterwards - the hedge I concealed it in has since been cut down; I concealed it behind the bedge, between that and the paling - Davis told us to meet in the evening to concert the plan; I agreed at once to meet him - I had no spite against Mrs. Cole; I had no intention of any thing of the kind till Davis proposed it -I should not have gone if he had not said the lady was out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Seth discharged, after you gave evidence against him? A. Not to my knowledge - I know William Croft, and was at the Queen's Head with him after the robbery; I had no quarrel with the prisoner there, nor did I threaten to do for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, in the presence of Croft, when the prisoner charged you with charging him wrongfully, say you would not have done so if you had been sober? A. No; I was not in his company at the Queen's Head after the robbery - I was never in his company; I helped to carry his brother's sedan chair - I never had notice that I should not carry it any more; the crow-bar belonged to Smith, the landlord of the house where I lodge - I took it without his leave; I did not furnish the fire-box - the summer house is about fifteen yards from the house; they had not got into the house before I left the summer-house - I went up to the house to see if they had got in; they had opened the window before I got up to them - I was not tipsy, I was sober; I had very little to drink - I will not swear I was sober; I was never taken up before for any thing - I repented very soon after committing the robbery; I did not go away - I was backwards and forwards; I did not give information through fear.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it from repentance and the love of justice? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have been asked if you had any malice against Mrs. Cole, did you at all consider about robbing any other house? A. No - I have not been at liberty since I was taken up, to be at any public-house- I said nothing about the robbery to any soul alive till I was before the Justice; I had no quarrel with the prisoner - no promise of forgiveness was made to me to make a confession; I have not seen or heard of the plate since it was buried.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Twickenham. On the night Mrs. Cole's house was broken open I met Bunce, Kite, and Davis in Bell-lane; I went four, five, or six yards further on, and met Seth - I knew them all before from children; they were going towards town -Mrs. Cole's house lies that way; about half-past four o'clock in the morning I was going by the Queen's Head, and heard a footstep; I went up in the yard, and saw Kite and Davis - I asked what they were at there; Kite said he had drank a good deal of beer, and was full of piddle - I saw two metal tea-pots on the ground close to Kite's feet; I asked if they were going to be there the rest of the night - they said Yes; I saw nobody but them then - I went away through the yard to my own yard, which is close by; I heard Kite come and call Jem three times - I thought it was his voice; he was calling me -I made no answer; I found he came very near my yard, and I crept into my wash-house - Kite appeared to come close to my yard; he came round, and then went back to the stable where I first saw him; I thought I would see what they were up to, and as I went along I heard something fall down, which made a smash like galss - I then ran into the yard, and hallooed Robbers! Thieves! and sprang my rattle; four men rushed out of the stable directly - I told Kite and Davis, as they passed me, that I could swear to them both; I saw Bunce run, and then saw Seth - I am certain I saw Seth; I went into the stable, and saw all the property scattered about - I saw a barometer, tea-caddy, a pair of pictures, a good many sheets, and table-cloths, some loose, and some things in a large dark shawl; I staid there till the landlord of the house came down, and delivered it to Neale, while I went and got Begent, a constable - I then delivered all the property up to him. and he took it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you hear Cole's house had been robbed? A. About half-past seven o'clock that morning; I saw Seth afterwards, but did not take him, because I could not see his face, as he had his left arm covered over his face when he ran by me out of the stable - I said I could not positively swear to him; I now swear to the best of my belief, not positively - his height, stature, clothes, and every thing corresponded, and I know I had seen him about ten minutes past twelve o'clock; I knew where he lived - he was not missing that I know of; I do not know when he was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Bunce always to be found? A. I do not know; I never knew of his going away - I am sure it was

             I saw in Bell-lane, because he spoke to me - he was making water then, and I positively believe he is the man I saw rush out of the stable; I have known him ever since he could run from his cradle.</p>

            . I live at Twickenham, and have lived there twenty-two years - I had been away from my house for a few days before the 11th of December, but I came home every morning and shut the house up every night - there was not a drawer but what was locked, and every part of the house barred and secure; I was at home on Sunday morning the 11th, and left the house about ten o'clock - I did not lock it up myself at night, for I was taken ill, and Mr. Allnut, a friend of mine, locked it up and brought me the keys - he is not here; the windows do not shut very well; when I left in the morning it was shut as well as it would, and the shutters were fastened with two bars, both of which were fast - I was ill and did not return to the house till Wednesday; I observed every drawer broken open - the back door was broken down, and the window bars were bent; I did not see them myself - I found my property gone; all this property is mine - 40l. would not pay for what I have lost; my house is in Twickenham parish, in Middlesex -I pay rates to Twickenham.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you no servant? A. No, the servant was gone - Mr. Allunt went to see every thing right; I did not see him, as I was in bed - he put the keys into the drawer of the room I was in, about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you mean to return to that house to occupy it? A. Yes, I have returned, and intend to occupy it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was in the habit of calling after he left - was he not paying his addresses to the housemaid? A.

            . I keep a public-house in Little Guildford-street. I gave Dryden the duplicate to examine the watch, and redeemed it myself the same evening, from Townsend's; it was in February, 1831 - the prisoner had offered me the duplicate for sale the day before; he said he had been out of place some time, that he had heard of a place, and secured it, but every thing he had was in pledge and he was not able to go to the place for want of linen - that he had been better off, had been in good places, and had a gold watch in pledge - that it was his last resource: he offered me the duplicate for 4l.; I asked how he came by the gold watch - he said he had bought it of a butler who had been out of place some time, and was obliged to part with it - he gave me the duplicate, and I gave it to Dryden to inspect the watch; I got his answer, and then gave the prisoner 2l. for the duplicate, and redeemed the watch; he said it was in for 8l. 10s., but did not say whether that had been advanced at one time or more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose the duplicate stated 8l. 10s. was advanced? A. Yes; he occasionally used my house, and conducted himself well, as far as I could see.</p>
               <p>MR. YATMAN. This is my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe a considerable quantity of property was taken at the time? A. I estimated my loss at 50l.; this is all I have recovered.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I received this gold watch from Noble, and have produced it here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord, I am innocent of the crime; it is the first time I have ever been in this situation - the robbery was, as I am told, committed on the 29th of August, 1829 - a long time ago; they said some plate, sovereigns, and rings were taken besides the gold watch: I lived with Mr. Yatman, and a year and a half before the robbery I left - I served Mr. Yatman honestly, and when I left he recommended me to his mother-in-law, Mrs, Mitchell, No. 10, Chinawalk, Chelsea. When the robbery took place I lodged with Mr. Rawlings, Gloucester-mews, Portman-square - I heard of it, and that they said I had something to do with it, whereby I went to Mr. Yatman, told him I had not, and where I was on the day and night of the robbery - he seemed quite satisfied; Mr. Yatman will say this. My Lord, the watch I never stole, but bought it of a Mr. Tester, who kept the Little Bell, in St. John-street, Smithfield, for 10l. - Mr. Tester died eight months ago, but his brother remembers something about the watch; he drives a coach on the north road, and promised last Friday to see the widow, and will be in town tonight with his coach, and bring word; how Mr. Tester got the watch I do not know - I had money from the West Indies, and so I paid the 10l. for it. Mr. Yatman's housekeeper must remember I had money: I was out of place, and so I soon wanted money, and pawned the watch - then I got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050017"/>more money upon it, 2l., and then 30s. more; at last I sold the duplicate to Mr. Noble, as I could not redeem it. My Lord, this is the truth, and my character stands good - I am a young man, twenty-eight years of age, and have a respectable mother living: I have always done justice to my employers that I have lived with. The worst crime I ever was guilty of was getting tipsy.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Smith, at Woodcock-hill - I have been with him about half a year. I have seen Wells at his house, but I did not know his name; I saw him there on the 16th of December - he came about half-past six o'clock in the morning with a black mare; he was there three or four days - he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050019"/>there on the Wednesday before Christmas-day, but I cannot say whether he remained there from the 16th till that Wednesday, but I think he did; I remember he was there that Wednesday night, and Freeman was there- I went up to bed between nine and ten o'clock, and a short time afterwards, apparently, they came up stairs after me; Freeman and Wells had been at Smith's house before then; I have seen them came together - I did not see Wells on the Thursday morning, but I saw Freeman about nine o'clock, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. Your master is a large farmer? A. He has about fifty acres of land. I believe - he has taken in harses and cattle to keep; I cannot tell whether he has taken a licence to sell beer, since the new beer act - Freeman was there at the time Wells came with the black mare; they did not came together that morning - Freeman was in the habit of coming there; I do not know where he lives - I have been about that neighbourhood all my life; I do not know that Freeman is a man of that neighbourhood - I lived at Mr. Child's before I lived with Mr. Smith, which is about a mile from Mr. Smith's: there may be four or five or six fields between them - Mr. Smith's and Mr. Child's fields are together; the field the heifers were in is three fields from Mr. Smith's house - other persons drink at my master's.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Did Wells ever come with cattle? A. Not with droves of cattle - I did not know him by the name of Wells; we used to call him Shepherd.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You had seen before that Wells and Freeman together, drinking as friends who knew each other? A. Yes - Wells brought the mare, and Freeman was there at the time; I think he had been there a day or two - when there they lived at this beer-shop; I believe they slept together - they both slept in the house, and up stairs, I believe; I slept up stairs - I cannot tell how many bed-rooms there are in the house; I have slept half a year in a room at the top of the house - I cannot say how many rooms these are at the top of the house; I have never been all over it.</p>

            . I am game-keeper at the Rev. Mr. Thellerson's, at Elstree. On the Thursday before Christmas-day I was out early, and heard a gun fired - I came into the road, and met Freeman, coming along before some beasts; I wished him good morning, and he crossed out of the road - I was by the side of a wood; I believe the road is in Bushy parish - there were two heifers behind Freeman, and Wells was behind them; Freeman had a stick down by his side - he put it down as if to conceal it, and he let it drop; the man who was out with me picked it up - I wished Wells a good morning, and asked if he had heard a gun fired; he said, "I think I did;" I think Ereeman was fifteen or twenty yards before the beasts - it was a very light morning; the clock had just gone one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. All you saw of Freeman was that he was walking fifteen or twenty yards before the beasts? A.

On the 22nd of December I went to Wells' house, to apprehend him, as I had information that he had come home - I found he was in a beer-shop, at Wilsden, near Tring; I went into the shop, and told him I was come to apprehend him - he asked what for, and I told him on suspicion of stealing Mr. Southernwood's mare; there were two Leifers against the door, and when he came out I said, "Whose beasts are these?" he said,"They are mine;" I asked where he got them - he said be bought them of a Welchman at Barham-wood; I took him to Tring, and put the beasts in Lord Manners' park- Mr. Child saw the same beasts in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where had you put them? A. In Tring-park; I am certain they are the same I showed to Mr. Child on the Sunday, Christmas-day - I put them there on the Thursday morning, the 22nd; I saw them several times, and am quite sure they were the same.</p>

On the 15th of December I had a horse and a mare running in one of my fields, and the next morning I missed the mare - on the 27th of December a man brought her to my yard again, and asked if I had not lost a mare; I said I had - it was my own mare.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. How long had you had her? A. Twelve months last Michaelman; there was no brand or mark on her - I am sure it was mine, from the general appearance; it was a black mare of the cart kind, not fit for riding - I have driven her in a cart many times; I am quite certain it was mine - she might be seven or eight years old, and worth about 20l.</p>

            . I am servant to George Smith, the prisoner; he lives at Woodcock-hill, near Edgware, and keeps a beer-shop - I have been with him half a year. I saw Wells come to my master's house on the morning of the 16th of December, about half-past six o'clock; he brought a black mare - I saw him riding her; he came up the gateway into the yard - she had no saddle; she had a bridle on - I took her in; Freeman was in the house at the time - Smith was not up; I took the mare into the stable, and tied her up; she remained there all that day, and the next night - my master got up soon after Wells came; I saw them together afterwards - they went to the stable, and just looked at the mare as they passed by - my master said something about the mare, but I did not rightly understand it; he said something that I was to do with her, but I did not hear what he did say; she was afterwards put into the hog-trough field, which is one field from the road - I know all Smith's fields; he has no other field, but what comes up to the road; he had his own cows and beifers in a field adjoining to this one - I saw the mare in the field, but I had no charge of her; I did not hear any thing said about her breaking out of that field - I did not turn her on the common; the last time I saw her in the field was on the Saturday before Christmas, to the best of my knowledge; she was brought on the 16th, and turned out on the Saturday; she staid there till the next Saturday - I did not turn her out, but I saw her after she was turned out by some one; there was a gateway, leading into the field she was in, before she went in, but no gate; after she was in there were two rails and a post put up - there is a wood by the side of that field; I do not think cattle can be seen in that field from the road without people take particular notice; I think I saw Wells at my master's about three months ago, the first time, and he has been frequently there since - he has stopped there two or three times: he sat in the same room, and drank and associated with my master - I remember Mr. Bull coming to my master's on the Monday morning after Christmas; I cannot say what time it was - no, it was Tuesday morning; I saw Bull and my master talking together as I went by the door; I did not know that Mr. Bull came to arrest my master - my master sent me down the road to call Mr. Morris; I have seen Mr. Morris at my master's, but not very often - I went to Wilsden, and Mr. Southernwood showed me the same mare that Wells brought to our house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How much room have you for horses? A. Enough for about three or four in the stable; the mare did not have any corn - I did not hear what my master said about her, and cannot exactly say whether he spoke to Wells or to me; I did not put her into the field; my master had no other servant but me - I did not see any carpenter or labourer at work; I thought Mr. Freeman and master put up the rails and post at the gateway; Mr. Freeman was there that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are your master's fields all grass? A. Yes; he takes in cattle to graze - I was with him at the time of Barnet-fair; he might have one hundred cattle there then - none of them belonged to Wells- this hog-trough field is drier than the others; there were cows in the further field - the mare might be put in the hog-trough field, because it was dryer; my master's house joins the road - his stable joins the house, and there is a gateway by the side of the house, which leads to the stable - I do not know whether they wanted to conceal the mare; I would not have taken it in if I had known it had been stolen - I have seen other persons drinking with my master besides Wells; he has drank with drovers - many people, who keep public-houses, sit down and drink with their customers; I was in bed when Wells went away - the mare remained there; a rail or something must have been put up to prevent her from getting from one field to another, and these rails were put up after she was turned into the field; all the fields were wet, but that was the driest.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then your master preferred this mare to his own cows? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying just now that you believed Freeman put up the rails? A. There was no one there but him and master.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sworn before the Magistrate that Freeman put them up? A. No; I made my mark before the Magistrate.</p>

            . Q. Did you not swear before the Magistrate, and put your mark to it, (reads) "My master and a man of the name of Freeman put up some posts and rails across the gateway after the mare came in?" A. No, I did not swear that they put them up; I said they were put up, and no one was there but Mr. Freeman and my master - I was not there when they were put up; I did not see them come from my master's yard - when the mare came I put her into the stable; Mr. Smith and Wells came and looked her down; my master's cows were not taken in at night.</p>

            . I am constable of Tring. On the 26th of December I went to Mr. Child's, at Edgwarebury, about half-past eleven o'clock at night: I got assistance and started again at twelve, to find this mare - from the information I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050021"/>received, I and three assistants beat all the fields round this hog-trough field, till four in the morning: about four we came to Smith's house - I called him up, and said I wanted a mare that Wells had brought to his house; he looked out at window, and said he did not know a man by the name of Wells - I am quite certain of that, but he said he knew a man of the name of Shepherd - he got up and came down, in as short a time as a man could well get up; he came down, and I went in and told him he was my prisoner - he immediately called up Kirby, to go and fetch Mr. Morris, and after some considerable time Morris came, but I told Smith I could not stop any longer, and I should go if he did not come; after I got him out in the lane, and made him secure as a prisoner, Morris came- there was some conversation between them, but I cannot tell what they said; he said before Morris came, that the mare had been brought there, but he had never seen it since Saturday evening - I said, "It is very odd you should take in a mare to keep, and not know what has become of it, and a mare of the value of 20l. or 25l.;" he still persisted that he did not know what had become of it from that time - I then took him, as a prisoner, down to Edgware, and then to Tring: he said we might have his horse and cart to go to Barnet to fetch Freeman - I knew Wells; he is a man who goes about buying rotten sheep and such sort of things, and is sometimes on the parish.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ask him who took the mare away? A. Yes, over and over again, and he said he did not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say Smith got up as quick as a man could? A. Yes; we had been hunting about in the dark for this mare, but could not find it - I do not think that was because it was dark: we beat the fields almost as close as a gentleman would for game - Smith said he knew a person who went by the name of Shepherd; he did not deny having had the mare there - he did not offer me every assistance to find it; I do not remember that I was asked that question by the Magistrate - I swear he did not offer me any assistance to go round his grounds to see for the mare; he offered me his horse and cart to go to Burnet to find Freeman - he acknowledged the mare was there till the Saturday night before Christmas, about four or five o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he mention when she first came there? A. He said a man of the name of Shepherd brought her there, but I do not believe he mentioned the day of the week or the month.</p>

               <p>Smith's Defence. Wells brought the mare to me three weeks ago last Friday morning, before I was up; my man took her in, put her into the stable, and gave her a bit of hay - I said, when I got up, "Shepherd, you are forward;" he said, "Yes, I have brought up a horse for a friend of mine, who has been distrained on for rent, and he wants to put it here for a few weeks;" I said, "I don't know what to do, I have but one field that is dry;" I said to him in the course of the day, "Shall I turn her out?" he said,"No, the mare is hot, she may as well stop to-night," and she was turned out the next day into the hog-trough field, which is the driest I have got.</p>
               <p>MRS. GOODMAN. I live at Smith's; I am his wife's mother - he keeps a public-house, under the new Act. I remember Wells going away after he brought this mare, and I heard him say to Smith, "Take care of my mare Mr. Smith till I come again, and that will be in the course of next week" - he paid me his reckoning; Mr. Smith often drinks with his customers; he is in the habit of taking in cattle - he uses his grass-land in that way after he has got his hay in; I think he had six or seven hundred cattle at the time of Barnet fair - I knew Wells by the name of Shepherd.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Wells was well known to you? A. No, not very well, I have known him from eight to ten weeks - he may have been there five or six times; Mr. Smith has kept this beer-shop since April.</p>

             when we lived in Red Lion-court, but did not know her by name then - I had seen an old woman in her company, who was related to her, and I believe slept at her lodgings in Red Lion-court - she used to carry a basket about the street; I have seen matches in it, but I do not know what else - on a Friday in August I saw that old woman in our room; I know it was Friday, but don't know the day of the month; I remember Ann Buton coming to my father's place to inquire about the old woman, I think that was the same day as she came, but am not quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time on Friday did the old woman come? A. I first saw her in the afternoon - I come from school at five o'clock, and believe she came afterwards; whether she had been there while I was at school I do not know - my mother and father were in the room; they had some beer, and afterwards some coffee; I believe it was about nine o'clock, but am not quite sure - we sometimes have coffee and sometimes tea, and generally have it about five or six; I believe the old woman had one cup of coffee, and after that she went and laid herself on the bed, which is on a bedstead; I did not notice whether she went to sleep or not- I used to sleep with my father and mother, in the same bed.</p>
               <p>Q. After she laid down on the bed, tell us what you saw anybody do? A. I saw my mother come (she had then been on the bed about half an hour); my mother went and clapped her hand up to the old woman's mouth - she kept it up to her mouth I dare say for half an hour; she kept one hand on her mouth and the other somewhere about her chest - she continued to do that for about half an hour; she then took her hands off - she was standing up, leaning over towards her, while she did this.</p>
               <p>Q. While your mother was pressing her in this way, did you not observe the old woman's eyes? A. I walked towards the window where my father was looking out, and did not see her eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the woman's eyes while you walked towards the window? A. Yes, I saw the woman's eyes rolling - I believe that was after my mother's hands were on her; I never saw her move nor heard her speak after my mother left her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain it was after your mother took her hands off the woman, that you saw her eyes roll? A. Yes, it was when my mother took her hands off; I did not hear her speak or see her move after that - I have seen two or three dead persons; they were not in that house - the old lady appeared to me to be dead.</p>
               <p>Q. When did your father go to the window? A. I believe it was before mother put her hand up to the woman's mouth - he was sitting by the fire before; I believe he had some coffee with the old woman - I saw her go to the bed, and believe it was before that that my father went to the window; it was open, and he was looking out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it open while the coffee was being had, or afterwards? A. I believe it was after; my father opened it - he had his elbows out of window; I could see him while I was looking at my mother by the bed - I was not looking all the time; I was standing with my back to the fire - the bed was opposite me, and between me and the window; when I saw my mother at the bed I could see the window - the bed is not very high from the ground; while this was doing, I heard my mother say something about some hospital, I am not quite certain which; I believe she was then speaking to the old woman, but do not know whether it was to her or my father - neither of them gave any answer; my father said nothing that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. What took place next? A. Some time after, my mother carried her down stairs; I believe my father came towards the fire - he must have come round the bed to get to the fire; I think it was about half an hour after he came to the fire that my mother carried the body down - she lifted it off the bed herself; I did not see any body assist her - she carried it loose like a baby in her arms; I believe my father remained in the room when my mother carried the body down - I did not see her return any more that night; I went to bed about twelve o'clock - my father came to bed after me; I awoke in the night, and heard some screaming - I do not know whether it was Friday or Saturday; I did not see any one at home that night - I got up about seven o'clock in the morning; I believe my mother was in the room, but do not recollect seeing my father - my mother was up: I go to school at eight o'clock - I went down into the cellar a few minutes before eight, towards the privy; I went to look for some ducks, as I had been told there were some in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you heard there were ducks in the cellar? A. I believe it was some time before that - I looked about the cellar; there was some light there - in looking for the ducks, I came to the corner of the cellar where the stairs are - it is a sort of a hole made by the stairs turning round; it is rather darker there - I saw the sack there in which the old woman was: I could see nothing but the top of her hair; the top of the sack was just as if a string was tied round it, but not close - I am sure it was the head of a person that I saw; I believe the hair was something black and grey - I have since shown Mr. Harris the bed that was in the room at the time; I think I saw my mother take a sack from under the bed - I am not quite sure whether it was that night or afterwards; I did not notice what she did with it - the sack was just as if it was turned inside out; I believe I saw the same sack in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Saturday night, the night after this, did you see your mother carrying any thing down Goodman's-yard? A. Yes, I believe it was between eleven and twelve o'clock; she was carrying a sack across her shoulder; it had something in it - I was taken by the officer, when my father and mother were taken into custody; I first told of this to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050023"/>my schoolmaster or the Magistrate, I do not remember which I told first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How old are you? A. Twelve years last Christmas; I went backwards and forwards to school till I was taken into custody - I saw my master and school-fellows: I have been a prisoner in the House of Correction since I was taken - I have been in the same cell with Hawkins, the gallery-man; he is a prisoner, and minds the things there - my schoolmaster has questioned me about this in the gaol; I do not remember anybody else - Hawkins questioned me the first time I came there; I do not recollect his asking me after that - my schoolmaster examined me once or twice; I do not remember anybody else except the steward - he is a prisoner; I have often been examined in the presence of the Magistrate, and Mr. Lea might ask me a question coming along - I was examined by some persons in a room; not before the Magistrate - the solicitor for the prosecution was one of them; I do not know whether there were four or five persons there - I do not recollect that any officer questioned me besides Lea.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this happened in August? A. I was at school; I think it was August - I believe two or three families live in the house; there were persons in the house at the time the old woman was there - I saw some people on Friday; I did not mention to any body what I had seen - I my father, and mother, were all taken up on the same day: I went to school on Saturday morning, and had a half-holiday in the afternoon - I believe I got to school as the clock was striking eight; it is not far from Goodman's-yard - I think Mrs. Buton was at the room when the old woman was there; I did not see her - I first saw the old woman some time after five o'clock; I believe my mother fetched the coffee - I think I had a little white mug full; I am not quite sure whether the old woman took any - she placed herself on the bed; I was not far from the bed - I could not tell whether she was asleep or not, nor whether she was awake when my mother approached her; I do not know at what time the body was carried out - I did not speak to my father; a boy named Shields said the ducks belonged to him before the Magistrate - I did not know it before; I went into the cellar, to use the privy, which is there, but did not use it - I did not go to look for the ducks after what I found; the place where I saw the sack is dark, but I could see it, and see that the hair was partly black and partly grey - I could see plain enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when your mother went out on Saturday night with something in a sack? A. I do not know; I think I was up stairs, and saw it from the window - there are three flights of stairs; Goodman's-yard is wide - there is no watchman there; I have seen a Policeman close by there at times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Do you talk to the children of the families in the house? A. Sometimes; there is only one cellar and one privy to the house- they all use it; all who want to use it must go down stairs - I spoke to nobody about Mrs. Walsh before I was taken up; I believe Mrs. Buton asked if I had seen her, but I am not sure; I believe it was dry weather and warm - we sometimes had the window open, and sometimes not; I had my eyes on my mother while I stood by the fire - I said nothing to her; I did not examine the sack in the cellar - I believe I touched it, and ran up to school.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. If you had gone straight from the cellar stairs to the privy and back, should you have seen the sack? A. No; there is a window to the cellar, and a shutter, which opens outside - I think the shutter was open when I went down there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw Lea, the officer; did you not say to him that on the Friday night you had bread and cheese for supper, all of you? A. I do not recollect it; I think I said coffee - I do not recollect telling him that we all went to bed at eight o'clock, nor that my father came to bed to me, and the old woman made her bed in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the old woman's countenanee while she was having her coffee? A. I think I have said she was sleepy; her face seemed to me just as if it was brown and yellow - I think that was when my mother had her hand on her mouth, but I am not quite sure; I have seen two little children dead next door to us - I do not know how long ago it was; they used to come and sit at our door -I have played with them, and taken them out a walk; they were younger than me.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the old woman's eyes rolling about, did you see any alteration in the colour of her face at any time? A. Sometimes it might be red, but I think it was brown and yellow after her eyes rolled; it seemed dirty when she was drinking coffee - I did not see any difference in her face from what it was when she was alive; I think I told the Magistrate I had not used the privy, but I am not certain - I was examined three or four times, if not more; I did not tell the same story at first - I told the Magistrate the woman was alive on Saturday morning, because I did not like to tell; I told the true story to the Magistrate afterwards - I told nothing till after I was taken up.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Prescott-street. I have heard the account the last witness has now given of the manner in which the woman was treated; a hand being held on her mouth and breast for half an hour was quite sufficient to produce death by suffocation; the appearances of the eye mentioned by the boy might be produced, and most frequently are.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that effect be while the hand was on the mouth, or after? A. The motion of the eye is generally considered the last action of life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. If a person was destroyed in this way, would there not be a material change in the appearance before and after death? A. It is not a matter of course; suffocation generally produces an effusion of blood, but that might be modified by age; it is difficult for one who has never seen a person suffocated to state what would be the appearance; I have never seen one suffocated, but have seen them afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Would there be less appearance of change after eighty years of age? A. It depends very much on the constitution.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would suffocation be more readily produced on a person of that age than one younger? A. I should think decidedly so.</p>

            . I am a surveyor. I have made a plan of the premises in Goodman's-yard - here is a correct representation of the locality of the place, and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050024"/>plan representing the attic where the persons live; the room is eleven feet broad from the fire-place to the window, and thirteen feet long - I have since measured the bedstead which the boy has pointed out - it is six feet long, and four feet two inches wide; if it stood between the fire-place and window there would be four feet three inches between the bedstead and fire-place, and three feet six inches from the bedstead to the window; here is a correct model of the cellar, which I have prepared; there is only one aperture which throws light into the cellar; the privy is in the corner, by the light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The ray of light would be thrown almost perpendicularly? A. It would; the place under the stairs would only have the reflected light; when I had been down there some time I became accustomed to the light, and could see better than at first; the part under the stairs is certainly darker than the other side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. When you had been there some time, were you able to see any thing under the stairs? A. Yes, before I had been there long.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Would a person going to and from the privy be likely to see any thing under the stairs? A. No, I think not; if they were looking about for any thing I conceive there was light enough for them to see a sack there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she take the body down with the clothes on? A. I did not see her take any of them off; I do not recollect seeing her go out of the room before she took the body down - whether she mentioned the London-hospital or Guy's I do not know; I do not recollect what it was she said about the hospital - I think I told the Magistrate she said something about an hospital, but nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him she told you she took the body to the London-hospital? A. Yes; she told me on the Sunday morning that she took the body to the London-hospital - she said it herself; I never spoke a word to her.</p>

            . In August last we kept the house, No. 7, Goodman's-yard - the prisoners lodged in the garret; we occupied the ground floor, and have three children - the eldest is eight years old; Mrs. Shields lived on the first floor, and had two sons, one about twelve and the other fourteen years old - Mrs. Steel, a lone woman, lodges on the second floor- the privy for the use of the house is in the cellar, but it is not much frequented, as there are a great quantity of rats in it - there is another close to the house on the ground, which is mostly used; the cellar is moderately light - the window is generally open about seven o'clock - one of Shields' boys has ducks in the cellar. On Friday, the 19th of October, I perfectly well remember seeing an old woman come to the house; she was tall - I did not see her face; she had on a black stuff gown, a light blue shawl, and black willow bonnet - her feet were through her stockings, and she had men's shoes on; I said, at the first examination, that it was an old dark shawl; I did not say it was black - I have now charged my memory better, and recollect it was blue; I observed her particularly, on account of her looking so very poor - I rather supposed, by her carrying a bundle, that she had come to lodge there; she had a large bundle, tied in a rug - it was about ten o'clock in the morning; though poor, her things behind appeared tidy, but I did not see her face - she went up stairs; Mrs. Buton came afterwards to make inquiries if I had seen an old woman go into the house - I think it was the next morning, but am not positive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you go into the cellar on Saturday? A. I cannot tell; I at times put greens down there, but whether I had any then I cannot say - I never went into Cook's room while they lodged there; I was at home on Saturday night - I am always at home at night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. When did you first recollect that the shawl was light blue? A. I cannot say - I strove to recollect after I was first examined, and remember it well; I did not hear Mrs. Buton examined, nor heard a description of Mrs. Walsh's clothes; she was shabby altogether, but tidy.</p>

             was my grandmother; she was eighty-four years old, and a very tall, hearty woman; I never knew her ill but one week for the last six years - she did not stoop, but was very upright; she got her living by selling tapes, lanes, &amp;c. about the street, which she carried in a basket, and she took alms, if they were given to her, and got sometimes apparently more than she wanted; she used to get out between ten and eleven o'clock in the day - she was very comfortable, and clean in her person; she washed her hands and face every morning. On the 19th of October I saw her; she wore a black gown and a light blue shawl, with a border to it, nearly a quarter of a yard wide - it was a very tidy shawl for a poor person; I would have worn it myself - some of the colour was washed out; she had a black willow bonnet on; it was broken in the crown, and pinned with two pins - she wore a purple figured stuff petticoat; it had a kind of leaf on it - and an old shift, very much pieced, but a good colour - she had a pair of grey worsted stockings, which I had knitted for it; they were quite different from what are sold in the shops - they were very much broken at the heels and had not been mended; she wore a pair of small sized men's shoes, which were too large for her, and by their wearing the heel the stockings got broken - I made the pocket for her which she wore on the 19th of August; I had shortly before obtained her a lodging with Mrs. Shaw; I saw my grandmother in Houndsditch, on the 19th of August, at twelve o'clock in the day; she lodged at Shaw's then, and had lodged there for a month - I saw her again at five in the afternoon, in Cutler-street, and found out, by what she then said, that she was going to move to the prisoners'; I had called myself, about twelve o'clock that morning, at Cook's, and saw a bundle tied up in a corner of the room, between the two windows; I did not see Mrs. Cook - I opened the bundle, and found it contained my grandmother's night-gown and night-cap, her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050025"/>small mattress, rug, and sheet - I saw young Cook there when I went; I know it was the 19th of August, because my sister's little boy went to Norwood to be nursed - young Cook had been in the habit of seeing my grandmother almost every day for nine months - she had lived with me ten or eleven months, when I lived at No. 2, Red Lion-court, and then Cook lived next door to me - when I went to Cook's at twelve o'clock, I left a message for my grandmother; when I met her at five o'clock I did not stay long with her, for I was rather angry with her for going to Cook's - I tried to pursuade her all I could not to go; when I saw her at five o'clock I appointed to call on her at Cook's next morning, and told her not to go out till I came; she agreed to that appointment - Mrs. Cook had several times told me she wished my grandmother to lodge with her; she knew I was her grand-daughter, for she was a very inquisitive woman - she said she should like her very much to come and lodge with her, and I said I had got her a lodging - I have never seen my grandmother since I parted with her in Cutler-street;

             is my sister - I saw her that evening after I parted with my grandmother, and learned something from her about my grandmother's going to Cook's - I went to Cook's next morning - the clock struck nine after I got into the room; I found Mrs. Cook there, but nobody else - I looked towards the fire-place and said, "Where is the old lady?" Mrs. Cook said, "She is just gone out;" I said, "Why, I am very much surprised that she should go out when she expected me here the first thing this morning; she said the old lady had told her she expected me; I said I was surprised she should go out so soon?" - she said she had gone out soon, to be home soon; she said Cook was very partial to the old woman, and they had a jolly good supper last night - I said, I was very glad they had enjoyed themselves, and should take the liberty of asking what they had for supper; she said they had potatoes and meat, and that Cook went out and got a drop of something short, to make the old lady comfortable, that Cook seemed very partial to the old lady, and she slept on the bedstead last night; I was very much surprised, and said, "I never knew her sleep with any person, and that she had her own bed to sleep on; her bed laid there the same as I had left it the day before - I had tied it up after examining it, and it appeared to be in the same state as I had left it; when I said I was surprised, she said Cook doubled up that piece of sacking last night to put the old lady on - I saw a piece of something coarse laying on the bed at the time, and said, "What do you mean, Mrs. Cook?" she said Cook doubled it to put underneath the old lady - she said the old woman had got no shift on; I said,"she must have had a shift on" - she said she had none, but if I would give her one she would wash it for her; I said if she was in want of a shift I would give her one, but I did not think she was in want of one; I had taken her a clean shift and cap on the Friday or Saturday before - I said, "Mrs. Cook you must have examined the woman very close to know she had no shift in one night;" she made no reply to that; she said "You have got a small tub, a frying-pan and coffee-pot to give the old lady" - I said I would bring them as soon as I saw her; I had taken those things from her the day before; Mrs. Cook was going out, and asked if I would give her a drop of gin; I said I would give her some beer; she said she could not drink beer - I came out with her, and having my suspicions, I went with her to Bishop's gin-shop; we each had a glass of gin, then went from that house to Brown's public-house, in the Minories, and had two pints of beer; I said it was very strange the old woman should go out when she expected me; she said, "You seem to think from what you say, that we have murdered the woman" - I said, "I hope not, Mrs. Cook;" she said, "From what you seem to say, you think we have destroyed her at our place;" I said, "Mrs. Cook, you put the words into my mouth, but what I think I don't speak now, but you will know of it hereafter" - she wanted me to go to her house to have something to eat; I said I had business to attend to, and would not go - she said she had some cold meat at home; she asked me so often to go that I gave her 3 1/2d to get a 1d. loaf and some cheese; she was to bring it to Brown's, and we were both to have it there - she went out with the 3 1/2d, I stopped there about two hours, and she never came back; I went in search of my grandmother for three-quarters of an hour, about the streets and places where I knew she used to go, but could not find her - I then went to Austin's in Houndsditch, and pawned a gown in the name of Walsh for half a crown; I then went to Anderson's in the Minories: he is another pawnbroker - I afterwards went to Cook's lodgings; I got there between five and six o'clock in the evening - both the prisoners were in the room; I said, "Mrs. Cook, has the old lady come home yet;" she held up her hand and beckoned, as if to tell me not to say anything - she gave me no answer; her husband was sitting in a chair; he stood up as I went in, and went towards the window - these signs were made behind his back; he stood at the window two or three minutes, and she whispered to me very softly, and said, "You must not tell Cook that I have been in your company, or drinking with you" - Cook went down stairs in a few minutes; he said nothing - after he was gone Mrs. Cook told me that Cook had beat her most unmercifully - she had marks round her face, and was quite red; I asked why he beat her - she said he had beat her so, through going out with me, that he said she had no business to go out with me, looking after the old lady - that he said she had no business to go out, in case anything should drop about the old lady; I went several times to Cook's to enquire for my grandmother, and to some prisons, hospitals, and poor-houses - Mrs. Cook went with me to one poor-house; I could hear nothing of her, after searching on Sunday and Monday - I went to Cook's room between six and seven o'clock on Monday night; they were both in the room - I told them where I had been looking for her, and what I had been doing; Mr. Cook said I had better wait till the month was up, and very likely I should hear of her, dead or alive then - Mrs. Cook asked me eight or nine times to stop there that night and sleep, as I was so tired; Cook was sitting in a chair, cleaning his boys boots, and could hear what she said - the boy was in the room - she asked me so many times I said, "I have a sister's house to sleep in, and do not want your lodging;" she said I might sleep on my grandmother's bed, and perhaps while I stopped there, my grandmother might come home.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe then you made some complaints at the Police-office? A. Yes, it was not till October that Lea took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050026"/>this matter up; I heard the female prisoner say something about hot or cold, but that was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How old are you? A. Twenty-nine; I lived with my grandmother for about a year before she went to Shaw's - she lodged there a month all but two days; I saw her almost every day - I was never a week without seeing her; I saw her after giving her the shift, on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she had on the patched shift on Friday? A. She put it on while I was in the house, and could not take it off till I took her another; I gave her the shift the week before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mrs. Cook say Cook had beat her numercifully for getting drunk with you? A. Yes, she said so, but she did not get drunk with me; we only had two pints of beer and a quartern of gin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did you look at the sacking? A. I did not take it in my hand; I saw there was sacking there - I never knew such a thing to be put on a bed; it laid on the bed, folded up as a blanket or sheet - I did not open it; it was new canvas - it was more like what is used to carry coffee in; she went out readily with me, to look for my grandmother.</p>

            . I am Buton's sister - my husband is a boot-closer; I am Mrs. Walsh's grand-daughter. On Friday evening, the 19th of August, between six and seven o'clock, I went with her to Mrs. Cook's lodging, in Goodman's-yard - it was the day my child went to Norwood; I went up to the door of the garret with her, and left her there - I heard Mrs. Cook's voice, but did not go in; I saw my grandmother go into the room - she was then in her usual health, and had on a black willow bonnet, rather broken in the crown, a blue shawl with a border, the colour rather washed out, a black stuff gown, a purple figured stuff petticoat, a pair of grey knitted stockings, and a pair of rather small men's shoes; I had a child in my arms, fourteen months old - as we went to Cook's my grandmother turned up her gown, put her hand into her pocket, and gave the child a biscuit - her pocket was between her gown and petticoat; I could see it - it was a pocket which I had seen Mrs. Buton make her I am certain; I noticed an iron mould on it - this was at the top of Houndsditch; we continued together till we got to Cook's - I had given my grandmother the shawl which she wore; there was a stain on the shoulder of it; when I left her at Cook's door she had her basket in her hand, which she usually carried about the street - she was then clean in her person and her clothes; I was on very good terms with her, and if anything had happened to her I should have gone to her immediately, if sent for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Had she ever been a pauper in any workhouse? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did you know Mrs. Cook before? A. I had seen her, but never spoke to her; I have heard her speak, and knew her voice.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. About the 16th of October a gentleman named Simpson came to me with Buton and Basey - in consequence of what they said I went in search of the female prisoner; I went to White Horse-court, having heard they had moved there; it is close to Goodman's-yard; I went there on Friday, the 28th of October, and found Mrs. Cook coming out of the court - I followed her to Rosemary-lane; Mrs. Buton was with me, and pointed her out; I did not know her before - I went up to her, and told her she must go with me before a Magistrate, respecting the old lady who had been at her house in August, and had been missing - she said the last she saw of her was on the Saturday morning - that the old lady gave her a halfpenny to go and get a halfpenny worth of sugar, and she had given the old lady her breakfast about seven o'clock, before her husband came home, as she did not want him to know she breakfasted there; she said she left the pot on the hob for Cook's breakfast when he returned: I asked her what time Cook got up that morning - she said between four and five o'clock - she then said, "Have you got Cook?" I said No - she said, "Go and get him directly;" I asked her where he was - she said he was at work in letter C warehouse, St. Katharine's dock, and said, "Go for him directly" two or three times over - I asked what time she went to bed on the Friday night - she said they all went to bed about nine o'clock; I asked what she had for supper - she said cold meat and coffee; Mrs. Buton, as we went along, said,"You know, Mrs. Cook, what you have done with the old woman;" she said if she had done any thing with her God would burn her soul in hell flames - she said that after she gave the old woman her breakfast she (Cook) went to the Tenter-ground, and left the old woman and Cook smoking by the fire, and when she returned she found the room swept up, and the old woman gone; I then locked her up - she said, "Make haste - go directly for Cook;" I went to the docks, and called him out - Mrs. Buton was with me; I told him a young woman wanted to speak to him - he came out; I said, "That is the young woman. I suppose you know her;" he said he did - I said he must go with me before a Magistrate, respecting an old woman who had been at his house in August last, and was missing, and there was a great mystery about it; he said very well, it was very proper it should be inquired into - I asked him what time he went to bed on the Friday night the old woman was there; he said the old woman was there on the Friday night, and she had made her bed in the corner of the room; I asked what time he went to bed - he said at a quarter-past eleven o'clock, as near as he could recollect; I asked what he had for supper - he said hot meat, and to the best of my recollection, tea; he said they all went to bed at that time, and he saw the old woman in the morning at breakfast - he said he got up very early that morning to look for work, and he thought it might be about seven o'clock when he returned; he could not recollect whether the old woman was gone before he returned or after.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050027"/>Q. Do you mean that he said that, at the same time as he told you he had seen her at breakfast? A. Yes; I locked him up in a separate cell from the woman - his wife asked when I returned if I had got him; I then went to Aldgate charity school, and took the boy - I told him his father and mother were in custody about an old woman who was missing; the prisoners were in three separate cells- the man was in the middle cell, between the woman and boy, and I heard a conversation between them; the woman began it - she called out Ned, and said, "Ask little Ned who told him to say what he has been saying about me;"- the man called out, "Ned, your mother wants to know who told you to say what you have been saying about her?" the boy answered Nobody - the man returned the answer to her; she then called out "Ned, ask Ned how he came to say what he has been saying about me;" the man repeated the question, and the boy called out very lond, "Why because she did it;" the woman said, "What does he say?" the man told her, and she then said, "Oh, Lord Jesus, that we should suffer for this, what we know nothing about;" the man said, "God knows I had no hand in it," and then he said again, "Never mind, there is nothing in this world that we wish to live for - there will be forgiveness by God in the last moment;" that is all that passed then. On the 22nd of December, as I brought them to Newgate in a coach, the man said I had had a great deal of trouble in this business - I said Yes: the woman said, "With all your trouble you have not found the old woman's body;" she said that all the things she sold, the grand-daughter had brought to her in a bundle - she did not say which grand-daughter; she said, "That was the old woman that was taken to Bethnal-green work-house."</p>
               <p>Q. You mean Mrs. Walsh? A. Yes, she alluded to her; the man corrected her, and said it was Hoxton work-house - she said, "That was the woman that died in the London-hospital;" the man then said if he should suffer for it, as no doubt he should, it would all come to light who had done it - I produce a pocket, which I received from Mr. Elder, of the Tower, also a basket and jug, which I got from Mrs. Tibbles - a sack, which I found, cut open, on the prisoner's bed; (they had nothing else to cover them,) and a cap, which Mrs. Buton gave me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The first information you received was in October? A. Yes; I had not seen the boy before I took him - what he said to me was while he was in custody; the grand-daughter might be a yard and a half behind us when I had a conversation with the male prisoner - Mr. Wilmot was in the coach with me- I have heard the woman had three grand-daughters, but one has been dead some time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. When you locked them in separate cells, had they the means of knowing you were listening? A. No; I was on the steps of the office - it was about the second or third examination.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You have some black stuff in your hand? A. Yes, two pieces; I found them in a corner of the cellar in Cook's house - one of them appears to be the cuff of a gown - it is bombazeen, and the other is a piece of black stuff, apparently a piece of the tail of a gown; I found them about three weeks or a month after taking the prisoners, up in a dark corner, near the privy - I had not said a word about the woman's clothes in the coach, when Mrs Cook said the grand-daughter had brought them - there had been no examination that day; they were merely called in and committed - the witnesses had been examined a fortnight before, about the clothes; she also said, if any body had put the old woman away, the granddaughter must have done it.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What did the boy tell you about the old woman making her bed? A. He told me when I first took him that the old woman made her bed in the corner of the room, and they had bread and cheese for supper - that was when he was considered a prisoner under this charge, as being concerned with his father and mother- he said they went to bed at eight o'clock, that the old woman made her bed in the corner of the room - that he went to bed first, his mother next, and he did not see his father come to bed at all; he afterwards said he was very much frightened, and was a great mind to run down stairs.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The conversation with him was before he was examined at all? A. Yes, it was after he was admitted an evidence that he said he was a great mind to run out of the room, and he was very glad he had told the truth.</p>

            . I am a widow, and carry on business in the clothes line, in Rag-fair, Rosemary-lane; I know the female prisoner quite well. The first thing she brought to me was a pair of stockings; that was about the middle of September - she asked if I would buy them; I looked at them; she said they were a very good pair of home made stockings, and asked 6d. for them, saying they were well worth 8d.; I gave her 4d. - they were what I call lead colour, made of worsted, and had been worn; I sold them the same day, and have not seen them since - the heels were darned with white worsted, which appeared lately done; they were knitted, and different to what are sold in the shops - she brought me a cap a very short time afterwards, and asked if I would buy it; it was a cap of this kind -(looking at one) - I looked at it, but did not buy it; I cannot say whether it had thread or cotton edging, but it was a cap like this; she brought me some darning cotton in skeins, and something else, either tape or stay-laces, I do not recollect which; they were wrapped in paper - I think it was the day after she brought the cap; she brought me, a day or two after, a parcel, wrapped up, and asked me to buy it; I unfolded it - there was a petticoat of a plum colour with a figure in the pattern, and there was a linen shift, which was a very good colour, but mended, by pieces being put on; I did not buy these things, or the tapes, &amp;c. - when I went to look at the things she said, "Put them down by the side of you, I don't want any body to see what I am selling you;" a day or two after she brought me a shawl, which I did not buy; I looked at it - it was blue, and the middle was plain; there was a light border five or six inches deep - Mrs. Cotton, who sat next to me, bought it; the colour was very much washed out, and there was a place on the shoulder which seemed to be a stain; after Mrs. Cotton bought it she left it in my possession for two or three days - she also brought a rush basket to me; it was not like the one produced - she offered me a pocket, which Mrs. Channel bought; (looking at one) - this is it; I know it by this iron mould.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. When was you first spoken to about this? A. I cannot say; it is more<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050028"/>than two months ago - I went to Lambeth-street the same week; I bought nothing but the stockings, and do not know the person I sold them to; I do not recollect buying clothes of any other person that day.</p>

On a Sunday, about four months ago, I saw a woman who had been brought there in a coach the night before: I found her in a very exhausted state - her body very much emaciated; I should say she was between sixty and seventy years old - I did not perceive any vermin when I saw her; I should think the emaciation had been of slow progress - my attention was not called to the fracture till two or three days after; that was of recent standing - I did not notice her teeth; I could hardly judge of her complexion, she was so very filthy, covered with dirt - when I first saw her I thought she was merely exhausted for want of food, and ordered what was necessary - I afterwards saw the same woman in Mary's ward, at the London-hospital.</p>

            . I am nurse in Mary's ward, London-hospital. I recollect an old woman being brought there the latter end of August; she was in a very filthy state, and had a fracture in the hip - she told me her name was Catherine Welch, and that she came from Waterford; I made a memorandum of her name at the time - she told me she was sixty-one years old, and had no relations whatever; a gentleman came to see her - I do not know whether it was Mr. Parkinson; she had no front teeth - her hair was grey; she had very little in front - it was entirely grey, quite white; I recollect her dying - she had her hair on then.</p>

            . I am assistant nurse in Mary's ward. On the 25th of August I remember an old woman being brought from Tibble's; a gentleman came to see her- I cannot say whether it was Mr. Parkinson; the woman was in a dirty state - she had clean linen on, but had vermin about her; we took her clothes down into the burying gound, and they were destroyed there, they were so filthy - we asked her several times where she came from; she said from Waterford - she gave us no other name: she was as dark as a mulatto - I am certain of that; I washed and cleaned her, and noticed she had two toes, one lapped over the other in an unusual way, and she had bunions on both feet; I fed her, as she was too exhausted to feed herself - she had two teeth only in front, in the top jaw: she had two front teeth in the bottom jaw, but I did not notice any more - I only noticed two teeth in her upper jaw, and two in her under jaw: she died there; I was present afterwards when her grave was opened, and her body taken up - it was shown to Mrs. Buton and Basey; I recognized it as the woman I have spoken of - I had tied a cotton roller round her face, and found that on the body then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You do that to most who die there? A. Very seldom, only if they have nothing else; other persons were dug up in consequence of this - she was a very dark brown woman, not red in the face.</p>

               <p>Ross' Defence (written). I am innocent of the dreadful offence with which I am charged; I trust you will excuse me, and not think me wanting in parental regard and affection towards the principal evidence in this melancholy circumstance and case, but I cannot help repeating that my son's statement is false throughout, but I leave my unfortunate case in your hands, and most earnestly pray that God will pardon my child, and that he may ere long he brought to confess that I am innocent of the charge - I calmly resign my case to your hands.</p>
               <p>Cook's Defence (written). I can only repeat what I have before stated at the Police-office, Lambeth-street, that I am entirely innocent of the horrible crime laid to my charge; I again repeat also that my son's statement is one tissue of falsehood and lies - I shall throw myself upon the attention and discrimination of an intelligent Jury and merciful Judge, and patiently and calmly resign myself to their decision.</p>
               <p>Ross. I left her at the fire-side, smoking her pipe; this woman knows she was dirty, and the colour of a Portuguese - she had nothing on but rags: I told this woman of it - she said if she gave her a shift she would go and sell it for tobacco; she never would let her sleep in her house without throwing her things down in the cellar: I know a gentleman sent to my child in prison, and told him to lay the blame on me, to clear himself; I blame the school-master for corrupting my child, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Cook. The boy left the room and went to school, leaving the old woman and me in the room; she swept the room up, smoked her pipe, put some matches into her basket, and said she should go out, but not stop long; that is all I know of her, so help me God.</p>

               <p>Mr. G., I cannot now address you as a friend, after what you and your wife has been saying, that we imposed upon you, that you had bought this and that; now I should like to know what you bought, but that is not the question - last night Mrs. Glasscock gave the landlord warning that we should leave to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050031"/>morrow, and the answer was we must pay a week's rent, and I conceive you should pay half as well as me; you know how I am situated with the landlord - was he not one of my bail when I got into trouble for you? and could I, as a man of feeling, to him, my wife, or myself, fly in his face - you care not who suffers, who wants, or swims; but to be candid with you, unless you pay half I will clear myself, and give information of you to your master and to Mr. Gardner, the Bow-street officer, about what has passed; you know what for - why should I suffer for one who cares not for me; you know what I mean without speaking plainer - unless you send me 15s. on Friday morning, at half-past eleven o'clock, I shall come and ask you for it, and if not, have satisfaction, I want; I shall ask for your master, and relate the whole - I wish to be your friend, but your had principles will not let me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you in partnership with your father? A. No, he is the sole proprietor - Ward was the waiter who had the care of the plate; I do not recollect whether he was there in November - I think he was there in October; the prisoner made this statement in the presence of Bates, the officer - I used no threat or promise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he had reason now to suppose it was stolen, but not at the time? A. No, I am sure he did not.</p>

            . I know the prisoner. About the 11th or 12th of December last I had a conversation with him about Glassborow; it was two or three nights previous to his being taken - he told me he was in a difficulty, and that Glassborow was acquainted with that, and unless he let him have 15s. by ten o'clock that night, or the next morning, he should go to Mr. Crockford's, and report him respecting the plate that he had pledged- he said William knew he was in trouble, that his brother-in-law and landlord were bail for his appearance, that he had pawned plate before, and was taken in the shop by an officer, and he thought it a hard case to suffer, through William not letting him have money to procure a counsel, as he expected to have his hearing last Session; the 15s. was to pay part of his rent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you lodge at this house? A. No; I knew him and Glassborow - I have had sufficient left me to live on; I was never in trouble - I was once taken about a handkerchief, which Gilby, a coachman, lost - I have pawned things for Glassborow, eight or nine times, in my own name.</p>
               <p>MR. CROCKFORD. I believe these to be my father's property - we have no mark on them; I might have a difficulty in swearing to them, had it not been for his confession, but here are three patterns of the kind we lost - there is a small a, b, and c, on them, and the letter n; they were produced when I had the conversation with the prisoner; one spoon is a pattern very rarely to be met with - Glassborow was in our employ, exclusively, for twelve months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Glassborow had told me he had stolen them about a fortnight before I was in custody, and that is what I told Mr. Crockford.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Moseley says I told him this on the 13th - I was in custody before that; I had never seen Glassborow till the Friday before I pawned the two forks - he met my wife, and said he wished to see me; I went to him at Crockford's, and on the Monday morning, he asked me to pawn the forks for him, and said he had bought them of a distressed waiter at White's hotel, for 30s. - I pawned them at Page's, where I was known, in my mother's maiden name, and gave my right address - I had no idea of their being stolen, and received no benefit from them - on Thursday he asked me to pawn the spoons which he had bought of the distressed waiter; he told me afterwards that the waiter who had the care of the plate was discharged, and he was sorry for it, because he had stolen it.</p>

            . Nobody but the prisoner was left in the shop, and only me and my wife were in the house; she was in the kitchen with me all the time - the prisoner must pass the parlour door to go out; this seal is mine, and belongs to the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 11th of November he accused me of stealing a watch and other things, and on the 18th I said if he did not raise my wages I should leave him - we had words, and I asked his wife to lend me 4s., which she did; I put my clothes on, and left - he said he would fit me somehow or other.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL CARELESS. I said no such thing - he borrowed nothing of my wife in my presence.</p>

               <p>MR. ORCHARD. This is our property - I never gave him orders to alter it; if it wanted altering it would be given to people in our house; we keep hands there on purpose - it is not the business of a sack-maker to do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it an entire tarpauling? A. Yes, except the lines - we sometimes send them out without lines; I can swear to the canvas, because it is made expressly for us - I cannot say our foreman did not send it out, but if he had he would have done wrong; it is the regular size, and does not want an additional breadth; it is finished, and if a larger one was wanted we should make one and not alter this.</p>

On the 19th of December I went to bed about ten o'clock; the house was quite safe - I had an ass in the passage, which parts the two houses; it is arched over - there is no yard between that and the house: I was called up about seven o'clock by my daughter, and found ten or twelve feet of the wall cut down to let the ass out, which was taken away; I found it at Waltham-abbey, in about a fortnight- I have seen the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not swear, on the Testament, that you would not hurt me, if I discovered your property? A. Never; he said he knew the party who stole it, that he was very sorry a poor man with eight children should be robbed, and he would take me to where it was; but when he had taken me eight miles, he ran away and left me.</p>

I have no doubt the Jury will find me guilty - if I had done murder I could not have been more tormented in my mind, and knowing the man had a large family I determined to go and tell him where it was- if I had had 7s. I would have got it back; I went to his house last Friday, and told him all about it, and said if he did not mind losing a day's work I would go and shew him where it was - I took him, and shewed him the Green Man - he said, "Don't come in, I will go in and ask if they sell donkies - you go about your business;" I went home, glad that he would recover it; when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050034"/>got home he sent his servant for gin, and gave me in charge - I do not get my living by thieving, or I should not convict myself, which I have done.</p>

On the 10th of December, about half-past one o'clock, I went, by Mr. Pite's direction, to his shop, and bought a boa, three silk handkerchiefs, and three pairs of stockings, which came to 50s.; I gave the prisoner 30s. and a sovereign, which Mr. Pite had marked and given to me the evening before.</p>

               <p>MR. PITE. I spoke to the prisoner about a quarter before two o'clock, when I came up from dinner - he said, "I have sold a boa;" I said, "Have you given a cheque?" he made a cheque of it for 30s., and another cheque for 15s. - I am not sure whether he said what he had sold for the 15s., but I think he said, "I have sold some silk handkerchiefs for that;" after he had put the cheques on the file, and gone, I counted the money, for I had previously put in 1l. 5s. 5d., which was marked, and took from it the remaining cash - I then found there was 2l. 5s. more than when I left; I could not accuse the prisoner of taking any, till I knew what had been laid out- I sent for Mr. Brook, who had laid out 2l. 10s., and there was 5s. short; I took the prisoner up stairs, and asked what he had taken from the customers at dinner time - he said, "I have put cheques for it, 30s. and 15s.;" I said, "Is that all you sold?" he said, after some hesitating, "I have sold some stockings;" I said, "You did not give a cheque;" he said, "Yes, I did" - I said,"You have not put the money into the drawer;" he said,"I have;" I said, "You have not" - I said, "What money have you about you?" he pulled out some in his purse, and I asked to look at it; he refused - I sent for an officer, who searched him, and found the 1l. 19s. in his hand, and 3s. or 4s. more at the watch-house, 5s. of which was marked, and I can swear it is part of the money I gave Mr. Brook.</p>
               <p>MR. BROOK re-examined. Q. Did you consider yourself responsible for the money, and that if you had lost it you must have paid it to Pite? A. Yes, I considered it mine while it was in my possession.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then they did not run off together? A. No - I did not see either of them give a blow on the neck to any body; I am quite sure it was not Keen who took the things; there is not a word of truth in that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean that West is mistaken as to the one who took the things from the chaise? A. Yes; I only saw the plaid cloak taken - that was the last thing taken.</p>

               <p>COURT to THOMAS WEST. Q. Did Bowman strike you on the Wednesday? A. Yes, and I turned to my brother,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050038"/>and said, "There he goes; they are the people who robbed the gig;" I followed them, and told the officer.</p>

               <p>MR. CASSELL. On the 19th of November Mr. Moss told me that John had something to say to me; I went, and he told me his brother had been robbing me for some years, and had given him the money; I said, "I suppose the money in your box is mine?" he said "Yes, it is;" I said, "And likewise the money you paid for your watch?" he said, Yes; I asked how much his brother had given him at one time - he said, as much, or more than was found in the box; he said his watch cost five guineas - I then asked what money he had received from Mr. Leach, his late master; he said between 11l. and 12l., and he had given 50s. for his trousers - I said, "Then you have not above 5l. left?" he said No - James left me in January, 1831, but he was still in the same house with his brother.</p>

            's Defence (written.) The prisoner solemnly denies ever appropriating to his or any other person's use, any property belonging to Mr. Cassell; the watch found on my brother John I have every reason to believe was paid for out of wages he received from his last master, Mr. Leach, in April last, when he received 11l.; the key was bought shortly after: the prisoner was with his brother when he bought it; I never knew that he robbed his master till he was taken; respecting the note Mr. Vann produces, it is to be stated I never confessed to Mr. Cassell, nor any other person, but being told that my brother said almost word for word, in the note, which Mr. Cassell told me in such a manner, that I was induced to write down what appears in the note produced by the officer, in hopes of not being prosecuted for a crime I am conscious of never committing.</p>

            . I am a porter in the City. I was in John-street, and saw the prisoner lean over the waggon, and pull out this white deal box - he brought it from the middle of the road, and rested it on the curb; the waggon was going on - I saw two men at the corner of Cooper's-row; they told me to watch him while they fetched a Policeman - he turned up Gould-square; the box was on his shoulder; there was no thoroughfare, and he turned back along Cooper's-row, into George-street, and by that time I heard the Policeman halloo Stop thief! he then dropped the box, and ran away - I took care of the box: Howes claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not lose sight of the person? A. Not till he dropped the box, and then the Policeman kept him in sight; he walked with it - it was not my place to lay hold of him; I am only a lad - I was never in trouble; the waggoner was on the other side of the waggon - if I had gone to give information I should have lost the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I first saw the prisoner in George-street, Tower-hill: he had the box on his shoulder - I called Stop thief! and he immediately dropped it; I pursued, and did not lose sight of him at all- I took him ten or twelve yards further on, in George-street - he had fallen down when I came up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see any body else in the street? A. No; I cannot say there was nobody: I did not stop to look at the box, but pursued him - I caught a glimpse of the box as it fell; my eyes were not off the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 24th of December, I saw the prisoner in Broker's-alley, between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening, with a ham under his right arm; I followed him down Castle-street - he turned into a baker's shop, at the corner of Brownlow-street, and asked the way to Lincoln's Inn-fields. - I said,"I will show you;" I asked where he got that ham from- he said "I brought it from Tottenham-court-road, and I am going to Mr. Dickinson's" - I said, "I think you stole it;" and he then said, "I did take it, but for God's sake, keep it, and don't say any thing about it;" I took the ham home, and on the 26th, some person broke into my house, and stole it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I went home at twenty-five minutes before eight o'clock; I went into the yard - I saw this gown between our premises and the master's premises; I took it up, went out with it, and was taken - I did not prevent the officer seeing it, but I said if he would go to a fit place, I would let him see it.</p>

            . Bird came to the station-house on Friday, and said there was going to be a robbery at Mr. Bradley's that day, and I should be able to catch them - I went there, and saw Sheen and Bird in company with another person; Bird left them, came to me, and said the person could not steal them exactly at eleven o'clock, which was the time he had mentioned, on account of a scavenger's cart being there; I then met him again, and he said the other two were gone up Union-street to steal some bars of soap from an oil shop, but there would be no delay, and that Sheen had asked him what he spoke to the Policeman about; he told him he had fallen out with his uncle, and he spoke to me to make it up.</p>

The Magistrate sent me word about this case, and I came down; I had first seen Bird three weeks before - he came to my private door one night, and said there had been a clock stolen from my premises, if I went to Mr. Thomas, the beadle, I could apprehend the thief; I said I would consider of it - in a few days afterwards he came again, and brought me this letter - (read).</p>
               <p>Dec. 27, 1831.</p>
               <p>Sir, You have been robbed daily by a fellow named Robert Birch; you may find a pair of black trousers at Mr. Hawes', a pawnbroker, in Whitechapel-road; if you give him in charge I will attend at the office to-night or to-morrow as a witness.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WOOD.</p>
               <p>You may find him to-day, at four o'clock, in Stamford-street.</p>
               <p>MR. BRADLEY. He was to wait for an answer, and I went to him; he urged me to take up the other man - I said I would have nothing to do with it; he said I should find the ticket on him, but I declined it; on the Friday morning he came and said this man was to come and steal a pair of trousers, or something else, whatever he could get, from my house; he went to the Police-station, and gave information that this felony would be committed; my lad said I ought to make him some remuneration, and I sent 2s. - the officer then came, and said he thought one was as bad as the other; I have found that the trousers were pawned as stated in this letter.</p>
               <p>Bird's Defence. I did not write it; I cannot read writing; a young man wrote it, and told me to take it - I had no intention of taking the things; I had orders to stand about the window, and I said if I saw any one take any thing I would stop him - I was told to get a Policeman, and the Policemen were waiting.</p>
               <p>Sheen's Defence. Bird told me that Nock gave him 1s. to go and take something, but if he did not like to do it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050049"/>himself to get somebody else to do it - he asked me to go and do it.</p>

I said, "There is something wrong about a watch;" she said so help her God! it was a long time since she had seen a watch, she wished she had; I found on her seven half-crowns, one shilling, and 10d. - I said, "Where did you get this money? you have not had any thing lately;" she said, "What is that to you?" I searched her, but found nothing more - she then said it was the change of a sovereign which a man gave her for a shilling.</p>

            . I am an officer of Portsoken ward. On the morning of the 24th of December I was in Cutler-street, about half-past seven o'clock; I saw the prisoner running as quick as he could, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I approached, and laid hold of him; I asked what was the matter - he said nothing; I held him a few minutes; a person came up and said, "That man has dropped a box in Hounsditch, at the corner of St. Mary-axe" - I took him back, and there was the box.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not a good sized bowl? A. Not very large - I could not be seen; they stood about two yards and a half from the counting-house, and about two and a half from the door -I was down in a moment - the door was shut; master did not wish to give charge of them, as they had taken nothing, and the officer said, "I will take it on myself."</p>
               <p>WILLIAM YOUNG.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not wish to prosecute them? A. No, I would sooner put up with the loss - I lost nothing then; there were more valuable things, but they could not see them.</p>

The prisoner came to our shop, and produced a pair of shoes; I was going to make the duplicate for them, when she produced another pair - I saw a lable of Mr. Clarke's in them; I said, "These are stolen, I am sure Mr. Clarke would not send them to pawn;" she said a woman outside gave her them to pawn - she went out, and said the woman was gone, but Mr. Clarke was her master, and she wondered how the woman should give her shoes that belonged to him; I took her to Mr. Clarke.</p>

Yes; it is my mark which I put on when they come from the manufacturer - it is 5-5, meaning they are the fifth size, and No. 5; I had about twelve pairs of the running sizes, from one to ten - I had not sold this size; my wife sells, but not to gentlemen - I had no shopman but the prisoner; I bought them of Mr. Surridge in Newgate-street.</p>

            ; I gave him the candle - I did not follow him to the privy directly, but went there in, I suppose, two or three minutes after, and he was there with the light; I did not go into the privy - I looked in, and saw the child in the corner, laying on its back; Newton held the light, he was in the privy - one of the child's legs was stretched out a little; the knee was bent; its clothes were a little way up above the knees - it appeared to be dead; Newton had got into the privy when I got there, and had the same candle in as I had given him - I saw nobody come out, I went and gave information to my next door neighbour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You did not know this child before? A. No; Newton lives in the opposite house to me - the privy is common to the house I live in, but not to the one Newton lives in; he does not live the length of this court from the privy - I went into the privy, when I trod on the child's leg; I had no light then - I had one, but it blew out as I turned the corner, before I got to the privy; I went back to light it, and met the boy Newton as I returned with it - I gave it him, and stood there, being so frightened; I was a good deal alarmed - Newton was there three or four minutes before I followed him; there are seven or eight houses occupied by different lodgers - Broad Arrow-court is about a quarter of an hour's walk from where I live.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is there a passage to the privy? A. There is a passage to go into it, but not before you come to it - it belongs to more than four houses, and stands in a little corner; nobody who did not know it would take it to be a privy - it is kept shut, and nobody can open it unless they know how; you lift up the latch, shove a knee against the door, and it opens inwards - doors generally open so; it used to lock, but the lock is broken - I take the handle of the latch in my hand, and then give it a shove in; it is harder to open than most doors - I know the prisoner; she once lived next door to me, in one of the houses the privy belonged to, right facing the privy - when I gave Newton the light, I had turned the corner, and was in Little Cheapside; I saw nobody come out of the privy as I stood; while he was gone with the light nobody could come out to pass me without my seeing them; there is another way which they could go.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of a night was this? A. It was not very dark; there are two gas-lights, one by the privy, just at the corner - a person could come from Golden-lane into Hartshorn-court, and into the privy that way.</p>

On the night of the 3rd of December Cane told me what she had seen in the privy, and gave me a candle - I was coming out of my mother's house to go on an errand; to the best of my recollection it was between eight and nine o'clock - it might be later; I had not heard a clock strike - it might be between nine and ten, for what I know; I went to the privy, pushed the door with my foot, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050055"/>could not get it quite back - a man came out, and blew the candle out; he pushed me against another door facing, and then a woman came out - it was a lusty big man; he had a long black coat on, which came down to his knees.</p>

There is a gas-light - he had a black hat on, and a bit of crape round it; the woman had a light shawl on, with a high cap on - it might be a bonnet; it was white - I think she had a dark gown on, with light flowers; she was a littleisk woman - I could not see her face; the man went out at the end of the court, towards Payne's-buildings, nearest Cane's lodging, through Little Cheapside, and the woman went the other way, through Hartshorn-court, towards Golden-lane - Sookers came up, and Mr. Nolan was there before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Nolan bring a light? A. He might, but I do not know, I was in such a fright - the man and woman had got away then; I hallooed, and Nolan came up - when Sookers came, Nolan told him to go in and pick the child up, as it might he in a fit; I staid in the court, and did not go into the privy at all - Sookers took it up, and brought it out on his arm; I told a good many people at that time that I had seen a man and woman come out- I think Nolan had the light when Sookers took the child up.</p>

            . I am a calico-glazer, and live at No. 4, Little Cheapside, three doors from Hartshorn-court. On Saturday night, the 3rd of December, I heard Cane seream out; she ran to my door - the privy is three doors from ours, and about twenty yards - she said,"Mr. Nolan, there is either a child or a bundle in the privy;" I ran to the privy directly, and picked the child up - I did not take a candle with me; Newton had one in his hand when I went into the privy - it was lighted; several women were standing round the door when I came up, and Newton was just inside the step of the privy - I got there within a minute or a minute and a half after Cane screamed out; I went immediately to the privy - Newton had the candle inside the privy - it was never in my hand; I went directly, and took the child up in my arms - it laid on its back, towards the left hand side of the privy; Sookers took the child away - I had hold of her hands, and felt her feet, and said, "The child is dead;" the hands were quite cold - my mother also went out, but I reached the privy before her; I saw nobody but Newton inside the privy - three or four women were outside; they were fearful of going in - I suppose the child's clothes were turned up above its knees; I saw nobody running - nobody could have run past our door without my hearing them: I heard nobody - Newton said nothing to me about a man or woman that night, nor that any body had struck him; I did not wait to speak to any body, but went off to Mr. Smith's with the child - he mentioned it to me on the Tuesday morning, but I am certain he did not mention it in my presence that night; the privy is very long - the child lay on the left-hand side; the feet were about a foot from the door; there is a good deal of space between the door and the seat on the left hand - I suppose it is six or seven feet long; the door opens to the left - nobody can open the door unless they are used to it; you lift the latch up and shove it; it would open with a key, and without one by a person used to it - it is a latch lock; the handle is only to pull by - it does not communicate with the latch; I have known the prisoner three years - she lived right opposite the privy, on the first floor: she lodged with Mrs. Burn - that was within three months; the privy is used by the people of the house she lived in - I examined the privy door afterwards; is did not appear to have had any violence used to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew Sookers? A. Yes, he lives in Hartshorn-court, not so near the privy as me; when I got up there were several women about the door - I did not notice their faces; I ran into the privy directly - I was there before Sookers; I found the door quite wide open when I got there, and ran in directly -Mrs. Cane came after I was in; she came into the privy as I came out with the child in my arms - I gave it to Sookers in the privy, and we went off to Smith's with it; I took it up as Sookers told me - he said, "Are you frightened?" I said, "I am," and he took it out of my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was on the spot as soon as you were? A. I was in the privy before him; he was coming up Hartshorn-court as I came up Cheapside - I have known the prisoner three years; she was formerly of the Catholic faith, I believe, but I never spoke to her - I have heard her father has turned Protestant, but never heard that she had; I am a Catholic.</p>

            . I am a costermonger, and live at No. 1, Hartshorn-court. On the 3rd of December, about twenty minutes to ten o'clock, I was going through Hartshorn-court, towards Whitecross-street, and heard Cane scream; I know the time, because I looked at the clock when I was up stairs - I shut the door, and came down directly; it wanted twenty minutes to ten by the clock in my house: heaving Cane scream I made towards her as quick as possible - I saw her, Nolan, and Newton, all in the privy with a candle; Newton held the candle, which was burning - I looked in and saw the child laying on its back; I took it up, and took it to one Daltons, and then to Dr. Smith's - it was dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mrs. Cane did not come in after Nolan had taken the child up in her arms? A. No; she was there before - I took it from the ground, and kept it in my arms till I took it to the station - I had said to Nolan, "Take the child up," and he put his hand towards it, but he could not lift it, and then I took it up- he did not ask me; Newton was going towards the privy when I got up; when I heard the scream Cane was towards the privy door.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it was a quarter to ten o'clock? A. I went into a public-house about twenty-five minutes to ten, and had not been there four minutes when my daughter came, and told me the child was dead at the station-house; I ran there directly - I saw the clock in the public-house, which is in Type-street, Chiswell-street, and it was twenty minutes to ten when I came out; it is about the same distance from Red Lion-court as Hartshorn-court - I ran as hard as I could; I had gone home that evening about seven minutes after five o'clock, and did not go out till after six.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you state it to the Coroner to be twenty minutes to ten o'clock - you are made to say in your deposition that it was about ten? A. Twenty minutes or a quarter - it must have been a quarter to ten, as near as I can say; I cannot read writing.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? Six or seven years, I believe; she lived next door to me about a fortnihg: I never heard the child complain of any injury - I never observed any bruise on her arm: she wore short sleeves - she had neither stockings nor shoes on when she went but with the prisoner; she had taken her little boots off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner was in the habit of nursing your child, and appeared very foad of her? A. Yes - she appeared very fond of children.</p>

               <p>Q. How are you able to swear to her? A. I saw her go from Bunhill-row station-house in a coach, and said she was the woman, and swear to her features - the lamps were lighted, but they were some distance from me; I saw enough of the features to swear to her - I did not speak to her; she had a child in her hands, walking by her side - it had neither shoes, stockings, nor bonnet on, and seemed to me to be crying; she said, "Do not cry, we shall soon be at home;" she was going towards Coleman-street, towards Whitecross-street - she went up by Payne's-buildings, which would lead towards Hartshorn-court: the child had a dark frock on, and its hair seemed to me to be dark - she was going in a contrary way to Broad Arrow-court.</p>

I did not hear the child cry: they were going towards Cowheel-alley, they were not near Broad Arrow court, and going in a direction from the privy - I did not speak to the prisoner; she had on a light shawl, a light gown, and a bonnet, which I think was silk, but a lightish colour, not dark - the child had nothing on its head; I cannot describe its dress - when I first knew the prisoner she lived in Hartshorn-court, near the privy.</p>

I was saying I heard a man and woman were taken up for it; I had heard nothing about it till then - I did not tell her I had seen anybody come out of the privy, nor that I knew nothing about it; I said I heard the child was found dead; I did not know what privy it had been found dead in; I worked for Mr. Reid, of Brick-lane for the last twelve months; I have not worked for him since last harvest, but have worked for other people; a man that I lodged with knew I could mend shoes, and had given me money to get nails and leather to mend them - I was idle for a week or a fortnight before that; I worked for a gentleman in Charingcross last November, and for others since; I was never charged with any theft, and was never sent to prison - I never was taken up as a thief.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the privy you speak of in the passage between Hartshorn-court and Little Cheapside? A. It is at the end of a few houses; I was coming in a direction from Golden-lane - the privy is on my left-hand side; I did not notice whether the door was shut - I saw her face; she turned away, and then I saw her back - I did not speak to her - I never spoke to her that I know of; when I knew her she lived opposite the privy.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the night of the 3rd of December Mrs. Duffey applied to me, and I took the prisoner into custody about ten minutes to nine o'clock that night; I had not then heard of the child being found - I took her in Broad Arrow-court, standing close by the door where she lodged; I asked where she had left the child - she said she had not seen the child since she had given it a penny at her (the child's) father's door; I took her to the station in Bunhill-row, and as I went along I asked where she had been from the time she gave the child a penny; she said she had been to a place where she had been used to wash and clean the house down; she mentioned no name nor place; I asked her the same question at the station, and she said she had been to Mrs. Lee's in Rotten-row - I took her to Rotten-row - she pointed out No. 13, and took me to the front room, second floor, where I saw a man in bed; she said to him, "What time was I here to day Mr. Lee?" he said "I have not seen you to-day:" a woman then came into the room, whom she called Mrs. Lee - she asked her the same question; Mrs. Lee said, "I have not seen you since last Tuesday;" I then took her to the station-house - she then said she had not been to see Mrs. Lee, but Mrs. Warren, in the same house in Rotten-row. I went back myself, saw Mrs. Warren, and detained the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she take you to this place without any inducement on your part? A. She did not volunteer to go - I did not ask her, but took her there; I did not tell her her answer would be given in evidence against her, nor did I say she must tell me where she had been.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any woman with her when you took her? A. A woman stood close by her; I do not recollect how that woman was dressed, whether she had a cap or honnet on.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She lodged at your house? A. Yes, for a fortnight; the Policeman came to my house that night - I believe it was about five or half-past five o'clock- Mrs. Duffcy lived next door to me; I was at home all the evening, poorly, and kept my bed - she went out that day, and came home a little before five o'clock, or a little after, for good, I believe; she ran out on an errand, as she said, after that, and came home, as well as I can tell, about eight o'clock, or a little after, and stood at the door till the Policeman came; I did not see her, but heard her speak about eight o'clock.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the Police division G. On Sunday, the 4th of December, I was at the station-house in Bunhill-row, and saw the prisoner there - when I heard she was charged with murder, I cautioned her that if she said any thing it would be given in evidence against her, but if she chose to send for any body where she had been she might - I took a rough memorandum of what she said; (referring to it) she stated that she was at Whitechapel, at Mrs. Henry's, in Colchester-street, from ten o'clock in the morning till five in the afternoon - that she then went to see her friend in Rotten-row, and at six she met Mrs. O'Brien, one of the nurses of St. Bartholomew-hospital, and walked about the neigbourhood of Finsbury-square till about seven o'clock, with O'Brien, went home a little after seven, and remained at home till she was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have on this memorandum,"The prisoner, Robert Tye, lives at Greenwich" - was he in custody? A. That relates to something else; a man she had cohabited with was apprehended - it was stated to me that a man had been seen to come out of the privy; I endeavoured to find who he was, and asked if she knew Tye - in consequence of her answer I went to Greenwich, and apprehended Tye; he accounted satisfactorily for his time, and was discharged; I recollect her saying she had been to see a friend in Rotten-row, though it is not in my memorandum; I put down what I thought necessary to refresh my memory - I put down O'Brien's name to go to the hospital, to see her, but the people from Rotten-row had been to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see your sister before she went out? A. Yes; she had a dark coloured stuff frock on - I think she had her shoes on; she wore no stockings nor bonnet; I saw her shoes on at five minutes to two o'clock, when I went to work.</p>

            . I am an apothecary, and live in Banner-street, directly opposite Payne's-buildings. On Saturday, the 3rd of December, a dead child was brought to my shop by Sookers; as far as I can remember, it was between nine and ten o'clock - I should think between half-past nine and ten; I examined it in a very cursory way - the shop was surrounded by a mob; the man said he had found a dead child in a privy - I felt it, and said it must have been dead for some little time, and we could do nothing to recover it, he had better take it to the station, till the parents were found; I should think it had been dead an hour or an hour and a half, but that opinion can only be formed by circumstances - its legs and arms were uncovered, and, of course, cold; I form my opinion from the degree of coldness of the body - it was comparatively uncovered, except the frock; it was not quite cold - it struck me it had been dead about that time; it depends on the temperature of the air, as to the time it would take to cool- being in a cold exposed place would make a difference of perhaps an hour, and if she had been walking all the evening in the cold air, she would cool sooner,</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any decided opinion that the child had been dead more than half an hour? A. I could not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If a person died a natural death in bed, would it not take longer to cool than if exposed? A. Certainly; I have stated the time I saw it, as far as I can judge, from circumstances, and cannot tell nearer than that.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it half-past nine o'clock at least? A. To the best of my recollection, but I do not swear that.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, in Chiswell-street. I was called to the station-house, in Bunhill-row, and saw the body, about ten o'clock that night; the extremities<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050059"/>were cold, and the body warm - I should suppose about eighty degrees there was a considerable degree of warmth; I formed a supposition that it had been dead about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you be mistaken a full hour in your calculation? A. I might be very easily mistaken; I examined the back part of the neck; I found stains - discolorations as if some violence had been applied - marks of violence, and the jaws were very firmly clenched; I saw it again between twelve and one o'clock the same night, and made a further inspection, but found no alteration - I then examined the whole body; I did not strip it before - the parents objected to a post mortem examination at the time; I am not quite certain whether it had shoes or stockings on - I think it had shoes on without stockings; that is more conjecture - I should think the heat of the body was 70° at the second examination: I saw it again on the Tuesday morning, before the Coroner sat - it was then stripped: I and other surgeous examined it - it was opened; the vessels of the brain appeared exceedingley turgid, from excess of blood deposited there - on the spinal chord I observed nothing more than ordinary: the stomach appeared to have carried on its healthy action up to the time of death - there was a small quantity of vegetable food, which resembled potatoes, in the stomach, which had been received into it recently before death; the mouth opened easily then, the tongue pretruded, and was indented by the upper and lower teeth - I discovered a bruise on the inner side on the fore-arm, a discoloration, that must have occurred during life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the marks you had before noticed on the neck? A. I did; I could not distinguish how many there were - there appeared to be more on the left side of the neck than the right; there was a mark on the right and more on the left - these marks might be produced by the fingers and thumb strongly pressed on that part, and from the appearance of the neck, the teeth being clenched, and the mark on the side of the arm, the state of the stomach, and the blood on the brain, I conclude the child died by unnatural means, that is from suffocation.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time elapses between the death of a person and the coldness of the body? A. That depends on the circumstances; it would be a much longer time cooling than in a case of natural death - it might take four, five, or six hours; it depends on circumstances, and the situation where the person died - if exposed to cold when alive, and then remaining in the privy, it might be five or six hours becoming cold; it might take an hour or two longer if the person was under shelter - I guesed the degree of heat by applying my hand, and may be mistaken; blood heat is 98° - a body would be about two hours losing 18°; when I saw it at midnight it might have become stiffer, but I did not direct my attention to that - the marks were most apparent at the back and side of the neck; I suppose violence had been applied by pressure at the back of the neck, and not blows, by the hand grasping the back of the neck, not in front; one hand might be placed at the back of the neck, and the other on the mouth, without there being any marks on the throat or front of the neck; if there had been any blows we should have found traces underneath - I did not myself operate on the body; Mr. Rance and Mr. Brookes did.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have spoken of pressure behind the neck, and a hand on the mouth, were the appearances consistent with that supposition? A. They were - if the hand had been applied to the threat there would have been marks in front.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What length of time would it take to destroy the life of such a child by pressing the back of the neck and holding its month? A. If the passage of air was intercepted death might occur in four or five minutes; the general appearances of the child were healthy - I noticed a patch on the stomach, but as the gastric juice acts on the stomach after death, I thought nothing of that, as there was time for it to have been caused.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FRANCIS RANCE. I am a surgeon, and live in the City-road. On the 6th of December I went with Mr. Brookes to examine the body - the weather at that time was extremely hot, and the air very humaid, so that decomposition was very rapidly taking place; these was discoloration over nearly the whole surface of the body; on examining it internally, there was a small mark, as if arising from pressure on the left fore-arm, but owing to the great discoloration, and the decomposition, I would not take on myself to say: there was no other violent appearance on the surface of the body - the tongue prosuded through the teeth, which were firmly closed upon it, and indented it, making marks on the tongue; the muscles of the body were rigid and firm, except those of the neck, which were in a very flaccid state; I assisted Mr. Brookes, who opened the body, and observed in the abdomen the viscera contents in a state of perfect health, commencing at the lower part of the abdomen: we found the bladder was empty; the intestines contained scarcely any solid matter, but gas - the stomach was in a healthy state, and it appeared digestion was going on at the time of death; the stomach contained a small portion of food, with two or three pieces of potatoes; the thorax or chest were examined - the lungs were collapsed, which proves the last act of respiration must have been an expiration; the heart appeared healthy, but nearly void of blood - on opening the right auricle a small quantity of blood was in it, and on dividing the pulmonary veins a small quantity of blood issued from them - we next examined the vessels of the neck; the cellular membrane contained a little serous fluid - on dividing the jugular veins a considerable quantity of fluid blood escaped; we then examined the head - we found no external marks of violence on the scalp, and no fracture, but on removing the bones the blood vessels of the brain were very much distended, and in a state of turgescence; there was no appearance of a rupture of any vessel, nor any deposition of fluid in the ventrical of the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. In dividing the vessels of the neck some fluid blood escaped, and the integuments were in a flaceid state? A. Yes - my opinion is, there must have been considerable pressure on the neck; I should state, that on removing the bandage tied round the head, a considerable quantity of serous fluid, slightly tinged with blood, escaped from the nostrils; the further examination of the neck was conducted by Mr. Whittell - there was no appearance of fracture; the impression on my mind is, that death was occasioned most probably by external pressure - the internal part of the windpipe was examined, and nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050060"/>had been put in to choke; I found no foreign substance which could have caused death - I should think the pressure had been applied on the left side of the neck, from the quantity of serous fluid there; pressure on both sides would prevent the return of blood to the heart - there might have been pressure on both sides, but I am certain there had been on the left; I should think death was caused most probably by the stoppage of respiration.</p>
               <p>Q. Suffocation by pressure? A. Yes - I should think five minutes would be nearly the extent of time required to destroy the child's life by pressure, but it has been said it has been done in half a minute.</p>

            . I am surgeon of St. Luke's. I have heard the evidence of Mr. Rance, and was with him at the post-mortem examination; he has clearly stated the facts which occurred; I agree with him in the conclusion he has drawn; but I certainly think no reasonable man could entertain a doubt that the child came by its death by unnatural means; I have had very extensive opportunities of opening bodies, and never opened one more generally healthy in my life; the tongue was very deeply indented, as if considerable violence had been used; the marks on the back of the neck certainly indicated that some force had been applied; I should say death was caused by suffocation - by pressure on the vessels, which were not able to return the blood to the heart; four or five minutes would destroy a child's life in that way.</p>

            . I left the 50l. bill in consequence of that agreement; I never saw any of the company besides the prisoner, nor any body pretending to belong to it - I saw a gentleman named Brown; there was a little stock in the warehouse, but it was thrown away in a few days - they could not get it pickled - the salmon was put in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050061"/>pail, and I believe burnt; I never sold an article - it was all moon-shine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Who did you see in answer to the advertisement? A. I received a letter three or four days after answering it, and went to Peels', and saw a strange gentleman, who referred me to St. Mary-hill - I have seen that person many times since - he is now out of the way; after the agreement was signed, Brown said he was about going into partnership with Earle; I took the prisoner up on the 18th of October, to the Mansion-house; I called with Brown on Mr. Tibbets, my brother-in-law, in Austin-friar's, as there was a suspicion of the bill being genuine; I never knew it was in Brown's hands to negociate - it was taken there to know if it was genuine; I saw Brown in October, when the prisoner was discharged from the Mansion-house for want of the bill being produced; I never saw Brown till he referred me to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you and Brown negociating to take the business into your hands, and supplant me? A. I know nothing whatever of the circumstance; I have been at great pains and expence to find Brown, to place him with the prisoner; he came to the Mansion-house voluntarily to clear himself; one sample of salmon was produced, and after a short time taken away; I was once allowed to take one pot of salmon for my own use.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was the stock? A. That was to be brought from Ireland - he represented that he had a right of fishery there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had you any circulars printed for your use? A. Not for my use; as I understood I was going a journey in a few days I put five hundred circulars into the hands of a commercial friend to distribute; I have a few of them here - there were two or three thousand about the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first complain to me about the bill? A. I could not see him for a fortnight, nor find his residence; I took him up about the 15th of October, but the bill not being due we could not produce it, and he was discharged; he gave me an order on Brown for the bill, but since he was at the Mansion-house, I have lost sight of Brown; I gave Mr. Walker notice on the 6th of October, that the bill was only lodged as a security.</p>

            , this is it, (looking at it) - I received it for building the oven, which I agreed with Earle about; the balance was 2l. 13s. 6d. more - I knew nothing of Brown before: the last time I saw him was at the Mansion-house, where I attended respecting this bill, before it was due.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you explain what passed between you and Brown, when he put the bill into your hands? A. I was to have had half my account in money, and half in two months - I could not get the money; I left town, and left my foreman to settle it - this bill was handed over to him; Brown said, "I will endorse this bill over to you if you will give me 20l. out of it" - I was glad to get any security, and said I would, if he would agree to give me good security, but his security was not what I wished, and I kept the bill, as I found it was a very good one; Brown wished to get it back - I would not give it up, and he said, "If you will arrest Earle, and get him out of the company, I will come forward with my friends;" the prisoner gave orders for the oven on the 24th of August, and Brown ordered some additions to it - they pickled a few pots in it; I tasted it - I think I saw about two dozen pots.</p>

I know the Act of Parliament about joint stock companies; allow me to say that on the 11th of August, the draft of a lease for very considerable premises at the bottom of Gray's-inn-lane, was sent to us for perusal, and on the 15th of August I saw the prisoner - his statement to me was, that he had fishing in Ireland, for nearly one thousand years, and there was a proposal, on his part, to dispose of a secret for curing fish, with the fishery, and the lease of the premises at St. Mary-at-hill, to twenty persons, and the prisoner was to receive an annuity of 2000l. for twenty years - on the 7th of August he saw me respecting a meeting which he said was to be held between himself, and a person named Gage, and others, on the 18th; he saw me respecting the party, and on the 22nd, he said the meeting was postponed; he continued from time to time to make that statement.</p>

            . My father lives at Doncaster. I have an appointment as surgeon in the East India Company's service, and lodge in Hatton-garden; I have known the prisoner about five months, but not for the last two months - I lent him several sums at different times; he wanted a further loan, and in October placed in my hand the duplicate of this chain, among others - I redeemed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not, on my discharge from the Mansion-house, give you an order on a lady to receive some duplicate? A. Yes, this was one of them.</p>

            . I live in Webber-row, Waterloo-road; I was a linen-draper, but was unfortunate in business - I never failed; I am now agent to a house at Manchester. Mr. Earle requested me to call on Mr. Woodhill, which I did, and asked what Earle's account was; he said he had got a great many things back - I said, "Will you be satisfied not to appear against Mr. Earle if you are paid, as he has married the daughter of a Member of Parliament?" Mr. Woodhill said, "If you, or any body, will come forward and pay for the goods, I will not appear at the Mansion-house."</p>

             came to me, and said he had a nice silk handkerchief to sell - I asked where he got it; he said he found it - I went into the prisoner's house; he came in, and asked the prisoner if she would buy a nice silk handkerchief - she said she did not want one; he showed it her - she asked what he wanted for it; he said 3s. - she said she had no money, but she could get it; he said, "Get what you can;" she went out, and brought in 2s. - I did not introduce him to the prisoner; I went to her house one day, when he was sitting there drinking gin - I was never present when any conversation took place about thieving; I never heard any conversation about a man hanging in a forest with a watch in his pocket - they were talking, but I do not recollect about what; I was a neighbour, and used to go into the house - when he offered the prisoner the handkerchief for 3s., he said his mother had a box at home, with silver spoons and money in it, and if she liked he would bring it to her; she said, "For God's sake boy, don't do any such thing;" that is all that I heard pass.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on your solemn oath, do you mean to state, that in your presence, no conversation took place respecting a man having a watch in his pocket? A. No, and no conversation took place about thieving.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite certain when he offered the handkerchief, that he said it was one he had found? A. Yes - there is not a word of truth in the statement of the prisoner desiring him to go and steal any thing from his mother, nor did she say if a man was hanging in a tree with a gold watch in his pocket, she would take the watch, but if there were any halfpence she would not take them.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HARLING re-examined. Q. Is this the boy who was present when the conversation took place about the watch in the man's pocket? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who were present at this conversation? A. Her husband, her son, Fulbrook, her daughter, and the child; Fulbrook was there listening to the conversation about the watch in the man's pocket; my mother had some silver spoons at home in a box - I do not know whether she had any more silver, nor whether there was any money in the box - I never looked at that time; I had looked into it last winter - that was the first time I looked at it, and then I stole a sovereign out; I proposed to the prisoner to go and steal some silver out of that box, and she said, "For God's sake, don't take the box, but bring what is in it if you can get it;" she did not give me a reason for not taking the box; I do not know whether Fulbrook was present at the time, nor whether her daughter and her husband were listening - I will not swear that Fulbrook was not there; I never was accused of stealing any thing but what I mentioned in the last trial - I was accused of stealing a loaf of bread - that was after I stole the sovereign.</p>

On the 17th of December the prisoner came about a quarter-past five o'clock in the evening (he had called several times before for relief); he brought a letter, which I took up stairs to my master, leaving him in the hall; my master desired me to take the note down again, saying he was to take it to Baron Ompteda; the prisoner urged me to take it up again to my master, which I did; I came down again in a minute, and heard the door slammed too; I came down and looked out, but the prisoner was not in the street; I then looked into the parlour, but did not miss any thing; my master came down, and we missed a time-piece off the mantel-piece, and a blue cloth cloak from the hall; I had seen them safe when I opened the door to the prisoner - he had been there on the Saturday before, and my master gave him five shillings.</p>
               <p>REV. WILLIAM KUEPER. I recollect the servant bringing me the note addressed to the Baron Ompteda, and the prisoner requested me to deliver it to him - he had been with me the day before; I told him if he would bring me a line from any respectable person, I would attend to it, instead of which he came in the morning while I was attending duty as Chaplian of the King's German Chapel; I was angry with him for coming at that time; he came again in the evening, and brought this letter, which I sent down again - the servant brought it up again, and I took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell me to bring you some certificates? A. Yes - I understand he has been a corporal in the army - he says he is a Hanovarian.</p>

               <p>ROBERT McCREBER. I am a Thames Police-surveyor. On the 9th of December I was sent to watch a house kept by Larkins, a plumber, in <placeName id="t18320105-124-crimeloc710">Charles-street, Westminster</placeName>

            . I live in Charles-street, Westminster. I knew Mr. Larkins, he is a plumber; I had seen the prisoner go to his house before with lead of this description on his shoulder - on Friday, the 9th of December, I was in my shop, and saw him go by with Mr. Holroyd's cart; I did not see him go to Mr. Larkins' that day - the cart was standing nine doors lower down, and I saw the prisoner take a roll of lead out of it on his shoulders, and go towards Mr. Larkins; I saw the officer stop him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Larkin keeps a plumber's shop, and so does your husband, I believe, in the same street? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any one from the State Paper-office here? A. Yes; it was Jubb who went with the waggon, not the prisoner.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Holroyd - the prisoner was a labourer employed at the State Paper-office, and Jubb was the carman. On the 9th of December four pieces of lead were loaded into the cart, which had come from Mr. Maltby's wharf; this piece appears to be one, but I could not swear to it when it has left the shop.</p>

               <p>MR. HOLROYD. I have the invoice of the lead - a sheet of lead is very large, but this happens to be the end which has the mark No. 5,178, and the weight 12 cwt. 20 lbs. - I have no doubt it is mine.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went to get a goose? A. Yes, at Leadenhall-market; I was sober and collected as I am now - I consider that I was sober: I had had a glass or two to drink - Mr. Montague bought the goose for me; I did not give him the money to buy it- he brought it in, and I paid him for it; he is the landlord of the Poulterers' Arms - I told him I had come for a goose, and he went out and bought it; I had a drop of bitters, and each one round who thought proper to take some were welcome - he could not refuse to serve me with spirits, because I did not ask him; he did not refuse to serve me - it being Christmas time I had a buttock of beef to give to my customers; I had not opportunities to cook it at home, so I took it to my sister's that day - I dined at the Swan, and had a drop of porter; I did not stop after four o'clock the first time - I was not drinking there all day; I was sober when I left, and I consider I was sober at ten o'clock at night - I went to the Swan after Godfrey had been searched, but that was after ten; I consider I was sober then - I had never bought a goose, and thought Mr. Montague was a better judge than I was; I was so confused about the money that I do not recollect whether I drank at the Swan after ten o'clock - if I was drunk then I am now; I went to acquaint my sister with it - to make short of it, I did not take any thing into my lips; I was not drinking with Ray, the officer, at the Swan - the prisoner was there, but I did not drink with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember going to the Poulterers' Arms on the 29th of December, and seeing Lewis, the waterman, there? A. I was there once since: it might be on that day - I saw two persons there, but I did not know their names; they came in while I was there - I did not say, in their presence that I had hoped that some of Godfrey's friends would give me 5l. to settle the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean you said there that you felt the prisoner's hand in your pocket? A. I mean to swear that it was so; I said so at the watch-house, and before the Lord Mayor - to cut the matter short, I did say it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to swear that you recollect saying so at the watch-house? A. I have not a correct recollection, but I have not the least doubt that it was so.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you say at the watch-house that you felt his hand in your pocket? A. I do not exactly recollect; I might not have been asked the question.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say so before the Lord Mayor? A. Yes, I did say so; my deposition was read over to me, and I am pretty sure I signed it - the question was asked, "Do you recollect Godfrey's hand being in your pocket?" and I said Yes - I should not have let Godfrey go, but he got out before I could get down stairs.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How did you know that it was his hand from your brother-in-law's? A. He had hold of my right arm, - he let my arm go, and put his hand into my pocket; a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050070"/>young man named Atterton had hold of my left arm - my brother-in-law was not in the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then what did you mean by stating before the Lord Mayor that the prisoner and your brother-in-law were taking you up stairs? A. Because I told them I would not go to bed; when I felt his hand in my pocket I said, "Godfrey has got his hand in my pocket."</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you say any thing to this effect, that you would not have kicked a 5l. note out of doors if any of the prisoner's friends had sent it to settle the business? A. I have no recollection of any such a word; Mr. Montague told me at the bar, "You were drunk that night when you came to buy the goose," and I said, "Then I am drunk now;" I had a glass or two that night after I met Mr. Montague - I suppose I had four or five glasses; I do not know the two Lewis' by name - some men wanted to kick up a quarrel with me (looking at two persons); yes, these are the men - I did not say before them that I would not have kicked a 5l. note out of doors if any of the prisoner's friends had sent it to settle the prosecution; I do not recollect any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever had a proposal made to you, or have you ever made a proposal to any one else that this matter should be settled for 5l.? A. I have not; the Lord Mayor said if the money was not made up he would commit him for trial.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to the White Hart on the evening of the 24th of December, on the subject of this charge; I found the prisoner standing before the fire in the tap-room - I searched him, and found only two halfpence on him; I rather think he was the worse for liquor - the prosecutor appeared to have been drinking a little, but he was not to say drunk at the time; about twelve o'clock the same night I went to the White Swan, where the prisoner lodges - he was in bed; I awoke him, and asked what money he had - he said four or five shillings, which he had received from his master; I do not think he was more drunk then than when I saw him at the White Hart; I desired him to put on his clothes, but I had before examined his pockets, in the presence of the landlord, and found 4s. 6d. in silver, 4d. in halfpence, and two sovereigns - I asked where he got the sovereigns; he said he could not tell, he had no knowledge at all of them, nor how they came there - I took him to the watch-house; he remained there an hour and a half or two hours - I asked him again if he knew or recollected any thing about the sovereigns; he said No, somebody must have put them there for a lark.</p>

            . I was at the White Hart, public-house, on the evening of the 24th of December; the prosecutor was assisted up stairs between seven and eight o'clock, by me and the prisoner; his wife said, if he did not go up stairs to bed, she would; I laid hold of his left arm, and the prisoner had hold of his right; he was rather restless, and would not go up; he got on the landing, and Godfrey got him round the waist; he was on him from five to ten minutes - he would not go to bed; he wanted the prisoner not to pull him about, and just as he got on the landing, before he went into the room, he said, "Godfrey, you had your hand in my pocket," and when he got into the room her brother-in-law said,"Fearon, give me your bag;" Fearon then said,"Godfrey has got it;" he had not said and thing to Godfrey about it - Godfrey was then gone down stairs; I cannot say whether Fearon was the worse for liquor - his wife came up when she heard the call for the money, and said "Godfrey has gone out with his hand in his pocket, why the d - I don't you go after him," and some one went; Godfrey came in afterwards, and Fearon said,"Godfrey, you have got my money;" he said, "Fearon you are the last man I should think of robbing," and he took a bitter oath to it.</p>

"he said Yes;" I said, "What do you want?" he said, "I will tell you," and he looked about for an officer - I took hold of his arm and walked to the watch-house; is it likely I should have gone with him to the watch-house if I had been committing a robbery.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 22nd of October, about eleven o'clock at night, I was called to Bentley's, and in the front room, on the second floor, found the prisoners laying on the floor, bleeding from the head; Hughes laid straight along on his back, and Worsley had her arms round his neck, crying out."Lord have mercy on me!" I asked them what was the matter, and who fired the pistol - Hughes said, "I fired one pistol at her, and the other at myself;" the woman only said, "Lord, have mercy on me;" I immediately ran for the doctor, and when I returned found two doctors there - my brother officer came in, and we picked up two pistols at the feet of Hughes; Worsley was put on the bed - they were afterwards carried in a boat over to St. Thomas-hospital.</p>

            . I practice as a surgeon. I was fetched to Bentley's about a quarter or twenty minutes past eleven o'clock; the male prisoner laid on the floor, and the female with her arms round his neck - I found her bleeding slowly from the ear; the bones of the ear were shattered - I cannot swear a ball had entered there, because I could not find one, and believe none has been found - I cannot swear what the wound was inflicted with; there must have been a discharge of something into the ear - I had her put on the bed, and examined the man; I found him bleeding from the ear, but very slowly; he said he thought he could feel a ball in his cheek - I examined, but could find no ball in either of them; in all probability I should have found a ball, if there had been any - I introduced my finger an inch and half into the wound - I should suppose the wound had been done either by a ball or the wadding of a pistol, but I do not recollect the particulars, as I did not expect any proceeding would take place.</p>
               <p>Q. If a pistol was fired close to the woman's ear, would the wadding produce such a wound without a ball? A. I think it would if it was rammed down tight; I considered the woman dangerous from the concussion, but after that was over, I considered danger over, and sent them to the hospital; Hughes was asked if he shot the woman, or whether they shot each other - he said he shot the woman first and then himself; the woman was requested by Mr. Bentley to indicate whether she wished Hughes to shoot her - if she did, she was to hold up her finger, and she held it up; I heard Hughes say "Elizabeth, are you still living? or is she dead?" he asked her if she did not wish him to shoot her; she said she did, or indicted so by signs - I do not recollect which: I remember Hughes saying he was an unhappy man, that he was an unfortunate man - I heard the woman speak, but do not know what she said; I saw them at the hospital next day, and heard Mr. Bowry ask the woman if she wished Hughes to shoot her - she said she moved her cap for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If the pistol had been put close to the ear, and loaded with ball, would not it have gone through the head, or shattered it to pieces? A. Or rebounded - search was made for the ball, but none was found.</p>
               <p>There being no evidence to prove the pistol was loaded with a bullet, as charged in the indictment, the prisoners were.</p>

On the 10th of December I saw this coach-cover at the White Horse, Fetter-lane, and knew it to be my manufacture; I cannot tell when it was last in my warehouse - I never saw the prisoner till he was in custody; the coach-cover was kept in my warehouse, in Montague-close, by St. Saviour's church - they hang near the door till they are dry and fit for use; when I saw it, it appeared to have been recently dressed and fresh - the prisoner was taken the same night; Bonus, who had bought it, said he did not know where he lived - it is worth 26s.; it was in a very unfinished state, and should not have been sold in that state - I told the prisoner we should hold out no promise to him, but he was at liberty to say how he came by it; he at first said he had manufactured it, and on being pressed where he dressed it, he said he bought it of a man in the street - I asked if he knew his name; he said not - I asked how he was dressed, and what age he was; he said he could not tell, and on being further questioned, I think he said he bought it in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you at the last trial say a word about the account he gave of it? A. No, his Lordship did not ask me, and I heard some objection taken to what he said being stated; he did not in my presence say he had received it from Pearce - I cannot tell when it was taken; I have no mark on it, but know the dressing, which is peculiar, and I have no hesitation in swearing to it - I cannot swear I ever saw this identical cloth on my premises: I should think it had not been dressed more than three weeks previous - I believe Pearce was in my employ eight or nine years ago, but I do not know him; I have heard he lodged in Moregan's-lane - he was not charged with this; Bonus said no doubt we should hear of the prisoner about Whitechapel.</p>

            . I am foreman at the White Horse, Fetter-lane - I have known the prisoner all my life. On the 3rd of December I saw him in the street, opposite the White Horse, and bought this cloth of him; he asked 15s. for it - I gave him 14s., as it had no strings; he has been a large farmer, but I have seen very little of him for seven years, till within the last year - I asked him no questions; Edgington's foreman called for orders - I told him I could buy them better than of him; I showed him this, and he said he thought it was Mr. Edgington's property - he did not swear to it at the time, and I took no further notice of it; I did not know where the prisoner lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he has once been much better off? A. He was worth 8,000l., I believe, but fell into misfortunes - I believed him honest; he has dealt in sacking, hay, and straw for the last year - I bought two cloths of him before; he brought this through the street openly, under his arm, and told me he manufactured these things himself - I see nothing remarkable in it; he was always about Whitechapel - it may be worth 18s. or 20s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you swear this is completely finished? A. Certainly not, it only wants strings - the prosecutor claimed it from the peculiarity of the dressing.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. What do you usually give for covers? A. The usual value is 1l. with strings; I did not know this was wider than common - Mr. Edgington found that out.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 10th of December, in Bishopsgate-street, and as I took him to the Compter I told him it was for having a till in his possession of Mr. Edgigton's - he immediately fell down in a fit, and said nothing: I inquired in Whitechapel, and got information where he lived - I went to his son's and found no manufactured cloths there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Bonus told you you would find him in that neighbourhood? A. Yes; he at last gave me the name of Pearce, as having got it from him: I went to Pearce in consequence of his information - he has been convicted.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has Pearce been convicted of this offence? A. I took him on account of this being stolen, but finding other property there nothing more was said of this; he is convicted of robbing Deacon and Co., of Smithfield - he lived in Morgan's-lane, Tooley-street, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's warehouse.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Had you known the prisoners before? A. I had seen them; I had seen Bourne in company with Morgan.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Freeman and Hall. I have the waste-book here - here is an entry made by me, as dictated by the prisoner, on the 12th of September, in which he accounts for 20l. 19s. 6 1/2d. received from Mr. Gobby; on the 18th of October here is an entry, which I took down from what he told me, in which he accounts for having received 10l. 16s. - and on the 1st of December I have written, from his dictation, 47l. 16s. 4d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were these entries made during the hurry of business? A. Yes, when customers might have been in the shop, not in the evening; we put the name of the person from whom we receive money, and I take it to Mr. Freeman or Mr. Hall, generally in the evening - I account by this book; I never had money over, which I could not account for - I have not made mistakes in entering cash; I have made mistakes in the quantity and quality of goods - that would make a difference in the amount.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When you give the money to your masters, they put their initials to the entry? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the prisoner an opportunity of seeing what you wrote in this book, when you received the money? A. Yes; I took down what he said, and when I cast it up at the end, he asked what the amount was, and I told him - he said it was right; I did so constantly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not made mistakes in entering money received? A. No; I have been called to account for mistakes in this book.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to MRS. GOBBY. Q. Have you not sometimes objected to the price of the goods? A. I have made abatements - I have sometimes paid him less than he asked for the goods, but not unknown to his master: the bill was not brought with the price of the goods made out - that was left to him: invoices were brought sometimes with the goods - he has asked me a higher sum than I have paid him.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did he ever give a receipt for a larger sum than you paid him? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. FREEMAN. I received on the 12th of September 20l. 19s. 6d. - here is my mark to it; my partner received the second and third sums - these invoices and receipts are the prisoner's writing; here is a book of the money received from each customer, in the prisoner's hand-writing - here is "Mrs. Gobby, on the 12th of September, 20l. 19s. 6d.; on the 18th of October 10l. 16s., and on the 1st of December 47l. 16s. 4d., which exactly corresponds with the account taken from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had he lived with you? A. Rather better than a year and a half - I believe we took him at 60l. a year, and from June, 1831, he was to have 100l.; I or my partner receive the money every night - it is not allowed to go for two or three nights.</p>

               <p>MR. HALL. I stated at the office that he asked my permission the following day, to go into the City to purchase goods - he said he had some money to pay to Mrs. Gobby - I do not recollect that he told me the amount.</p>

               <p>MR. BROWN. The prisoner never paid me one farthing on account of Mrs. Warren.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the habit of paying you any sums without stating from whom he received them? A. Yes, when he sold for ready money, but when he debited the coals, I made inquiry who the persons were, and where they lived;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050080"/>he booked Mrs. Warren, of Shepherd's-bush, three sacks of coals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. What is the value of three sacks of coals? A. 10s. 6d. - I accounted with him every night; I never kept any running account with him except when he got drunk, and could not give any account of it - this is a receipt (looking at one) for 1l. 4s. on the 9th of August, which was the last day he was in my employ; he came home very tipsy, and there was money he could not make up, when I discharged him; I have a person named Westbrook in my employ - he may in one or two instances have received money of the prisoner when he has come home drunk, and it was too late for me to see him, but he never accounted with the prisoner; I always did that.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. He had accounted to you for 1l. 4s.? A. That was on two or three different nights, when he came home short of money - it had nothing to do with this charge; when he went out in a morning, he loaded a certain quantity of coals, and it was his duty to come to me in the shop every night, and give me a correct account of them all - I put it down at the time; I understood he could not read or write - I was very particular, and generally repeated what he said; I took down the account of the 14th of June, from his month, and am quite certain he has never accounted for any money received from Mrs. Warren since that time.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner in the course of the summer; I had three sacks of coals of him - I paid him half a sovereign and some silver; I think it was 6d. - he came to me again in November, and I said, "There is a mistake between me and Mr. Brown, for he has sent to know if I owe him any thing;" he then asked if I would take 15s., and pay Mr. Brown over again; I said I was very sorry, and would do any thing on his behalf, but I had given my word that I had paid the money, and I would not take it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he ask you to take it on his own account? A. He said, "Take it and pay Mr. Brown over again;" this case was heard at Brentford, and I think the prisoner was dismissed; I would have taken the money, but after passing my word, I could not do it; I did not state that before the Magistrate -I was not asked, and I kept it back, in hopes the prisoner would get his liberty.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN re-examined. Q. Do you remember the prisoner debiting Mrs. Leek with this money? A. Yes, on the 7th of July, for three sacks of coals, and on the 21st of July one sack, amounting to 15s.; he said they were not paid, and desired me to book them - he never paid me the money.</p>
               <p>- WESTBROOK. I am in the service of Mr. Brown. The prisoner's wife brought me 2l. when he was at the tread-mill, and she requested if my master sent me to any person where he had booked coals, to pay it, and when I saw the prisoner, he desired me. if I was sent to any of the persons to whom coals were booked to pay it out of the money, and not let Mr. Brown know a word about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have been in the habit of receiving money of the prisoner? A. In one or two instances; I have taken it to my master, and he has put it on the shelf and come and cettled for it - I never was engaged as a clerk.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you receive this money for? A. To pay in part of any thing he had received without telling my master; my master never kept a running account with him; the prisoner was apprehended in November, I believe; I had received the money before he was charged with embezzlement, and I was to pay it as if it came from the customer.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. BROWN. Q. Would that sum have made your book right? A. Oh! certainly not.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 13th of December, I had a concert, and was in the room the greater part of the evening; I was in conversation with Mr. Arundell, a carpenter, and Mr. Blunt, an attorney; I was sitting facing the fire place, in the second part of the room; while I was in conversation, the prisoner came up and had a little conversation - he was quite a stranger; I had not seen him before, to my knowledge; when he spoke to me, I spoke to him, but I cannot say what passed, but I am pretty well sure he sat down at the table - I remember passing a joke with Mr. Blunt, and I think the prisoner went to another part of the room; I did not see him again till the concert was over, when I was having some conversation with Mr. Bell, respecting some deeds Mr. Blunt was drawing up; the prisoner came and sat very close to my side; I wished the conversation to be more private; I said it was very unfair for him to come and sit by me while I was talking to those gentleman on business; I told him his company was quite a bore, and there were other parts of the house where he might go to; he said where could he go; I said, "You may go into my parlour if you think proper;" he said, "May I go into your parlour?" I said Yes, and he went into the parlour - it is a parlour for company; I do not know whether there was any one in it then, but I should think there was, as the concert-room was cleared; when I had done speaking to those gentleman I put the lights out, and went to the bar - I stopped there some time; I then went into the parlour, where I saw the prisoner, Mr. Blunt, and several other persons - I do not remember saying any thing particular, but I passed a similar joke to Mr. Blunt to what I had done in the concert-room; I do not remember joining in the conversation; I sat in the elbow-chair, laid my head on my hand, and dozed into a sort of sleep - I might awake once or twice in the course of the evening, but did not join in the conversation; when I awoke the last time, I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050081"/>the prisoner and Mr. Perry going away; I went to open the door for them, but they were before me, and got the door open before I got to them; I bade them good night, and the prisoner said something to me about masonry; the prisoner and Mr. Perry went away together; I closed my doors, went round my house, and went to bed; I saw no more of the prisoner that night - I was not alone with him that evening at all, and to my remembrance, I had never seen him, before; on the following Saturday, an old man brought me this letter, wrapped up in this case - this is the letter, but I never read the whole of it, because there is so much of it - I was in the bar when it came; Dr. Newman and two more respectable gentlemen were there; I took off the case, and laid it on the bar table; I opened the letter sufficiently for Dr. Newman to read a word or two, and I said "Here is a nice little letter;" I thought it might be from some of my family for money; I went into my parlour, and read part of it; I could not understand it; I turned it over three different times to know if it could be for me or not, and the last time I turned it, I spelt my own name letter for letter.</p>

            . I was a clerk in the office of Mr. Collins, No. 33, Spital-square, for fifteen years; I left him at Christmas. I know the prisoner perfectly well, and I believe this letter to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you known him? A. Five years last December; I am sorry to say that he has been given to drink for the last two or three years, but he has had considerable sums of money of mine, and I have found him honest.(Letter read)</p>
               <p>"SIR, - The occurrences of the other evening are still fresh in my recollection, to what the relate, a moments reflection will present; or in other words, an attempt most deliberately made by you of a most disgusting and abominable character, which my resistance, and the dread you apprehended of an exposure, rendered abortive; any thing short would have rendered me equally culpable as yourself. Much as I have heard that there are in existence creatures bearing the outward form of men, and addicted to those bestial propensities, I had nevertheless, in a great measure discredited such realities, until the affair of Wednesday morning unveiled that doubt, and awakened the too horrible conviction, that I had at length unhappily fallen into the hands of one of the detested advocates and perpetrators of a crime loathsome and abhorrent; and in one too of all others, on whose unsullied reputation, this every thing is staked, and dependant entirely upon public opinion for patronage, support, and protection. The circumstances under which it was at tempted, I need not here detail, being of so gross and flagrant a description, that the recollection of them can never be dislodged from my memory, indeed I have not been well since; and on the most serious and mature deliberation (and I have not been hasty in forming my resolution) that it is but a right to which decency has a privilege, to enforce that, so during and insulting an outrage should be submitted to magisterial investigation, for the effectual suppression of advice of the blackest die, unpardonable an the eyes of Heaven, and horrifying in those of men. I thought it right, however, are I proceed to extremities, to put you in possession of my resolution, with a view to your being sufficiently impressed with a proper sense of the situation in which you have placed yourself, your character, and reputation - it is I say for you to consider and weigh well the consequences how you stand, and how your interest may he effected; not only as it regards your moral character as a christian individually, but in your public and accountable capacity as a licenced victualler, will fall under the servest lash of well deserved reprehension, and subject yourself to the contempt of all your friends, your family connexions, and the derision of the world. Should I repeat it, this affair once get buzzed abroad that"the worthy host" had himself made an attempt of the kind, and with fastened doors, securely and carefully barrid by his own hand, under his own dwelling, a licenced receptacle for refreshment and entertainment, in the hearing of his own family and servants, and that upon the person of an occasional visitor, unwarily entrapped within his fangs; the name of "Hemingway" would become as odious as the wretched miscreants who, but a few moments since, expiated their crimes amidst the execrations of thousands. Upon deep consideration of the purport of this letter which I have sent to you in private, not wishing to risk the possibility of its falling into other hands than your own by the post. You must be aware of the very perilous precipice on which you stand; and it is by your answer, for me to know whether you wish to hazard the result of the affair being made public by an application to the Magistrate for a warrant, it being a criminal charge, and of a capital nature; my deposition must be registered on oath, to obtain that document for your apprehension, which when once done, you will only have yourself to blame; nothing on my part can afterwards he allowed to impede the regular course of justice. Need I say more to point out clearly to you the rain that must be the inevitable consequence of disclosure. The affair as yet, I pledge myself, is unknown to any mortal on earth, even my own wife has not had the slightest intimation of the matter. Is it not for your interest, character and peace of mind, to let it remain so? How many in your fine in your neighbourhood, would glory at your shame, and exult in your disgrace; on your character, as the proprietor of a house peculiarly privileged, yet under peculiar restrictions depends every thing; the hazardous speculation in which you have embarked must fall into ruins in the estimation of its frequenters. The probable suspension of your licence may be the disasterous result; and independent of the awful consequences attendant on conviction, and placed at a criminal bar, on a charge of so revolting a nature, must mar for ever your future prospects - your credit with your brewers and distillers would be fast upon the wane, and you will never regain that respect which your condition in life otherwise entitles you to; but entail upon a rising family, a dreadful stigma which time can never destroy. I am, Sir, your obedient Servant, J. T. MORGAN.</p>
               <p>1, Sydney-street, Mile-end, 16th December, 1831.</p>
               <p>P.S. The bearer of this will wait your convenience, to bring back your answer; if you wish any reasonable time to do it in, say so, and send the letter inclosed, privately, to me, either at my house, or 35, Spital-square, Norton-falgate."</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MR. HEMINGWAY. Q. What passed between you and the bearer of the letter? A. I called him, and said, "Have you any knowledge of the person who sent me the letter?" he said, "He is a lawyer in Spital-square;" I said, "Oh, dear," or "Dear me," or"God bless me, he has sent me a letter of a very disgraceful nature, and wishes me to give him an answer - how to give him one I do not know; tell the person to call upon me;" he went away, and in less than a quarter of an hour, the bearer of the letter and the prisoner came to my house - the bearer came in, and said I was wanted outside; I went outside, and saw a very about man - I advanced towards him, and said, "Do you want me, Sir?" he said No; the prisoner came into my house in a very few minutes - I had told the messenger to tell him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050082"/>come in; I was in my parlour - the prisoner opened the door, and said he wished to speak to me privately; I took him up stairs into the saloon, where the concerts are held - he then said he had sent me a letter, and began to accuse me of the guilt of the letter; he said, "I have sent you a letter, and I shall accuse you of the whole of it;" I said"For what?" and began to talk to him respecting what I had read of it: he said I was guilty - he did not say of what, but he alluded very strongly to a base purpose; he said he should abide by what he had written - I replied,"I have never insulted you in my house, nor any other person, to my knowledge;" I told him I could swear it, and would swear it, which I did, and asked him if he thought I was an Atheist or a Deist - he said No; I then lifted my hand with a firm resolution, hit my hand on the table, and said, "So help me, God, and so help me, Jesus Christ, you never was insulted in this house by me or by any other person, or may 1 drop;" he said my swearing would have no effect, he was a lawyer, and his oath would be taken, but mine could not, only by evidence which I could not obtain - he then began to talk of my credit with my brewer and distiller, and how glad my neighbours would be to hear of it; this was on Saturday evening - he said there was a better was of setting it, if I would give him something in the shape of a 10l. note, not even his own wife, nor any creature upon earth should know it; I told him I was not prepared to give him 10l., but to call again some night next week - he proposed Tuesday; I said that was a concert night, he had better make it Monday - he agreed to call on Monday; he said he would walk into my parlour, and call for a pint of porter or ale till I saw him - he begged of me not to show the letter to my wife or any other person, but I do not remember that he said why - he then left, and I went below to my parlour; Mr. Hickmott was there, and before he went away Mr. Perry came; I made an arrangement with Mr. Perry for the Monday evening: on Monday evening I saw the prisoner again - Mr. Perry was there in a small anti-room between the club-room and the saloon; he was there in pursuance of our arrangement - the prisoner came into the parlour, and called for a pint of ale; I came down when I heard the bell ring once, and the prisoner walked up stairs with me - Mr. Perry was then in the gallery of the saloon, and the prisoner was in the saloon, under the gallery, just at the edge of it, so that he might be seen: a person in the gallery could hear the conversation in the saloon, and see the person if he thought proper: I said to the prisoner,"My good man, you ask me 10l. for what I am not guilty of - it is a deal of money to give away for nothing, knowing myself not to be guilty, nor nothing like it," or words to that effect;" I am a family man, the father of ten children, and I have a good wife - you must have made a mistake when you left my house and gone somewhere else;" he said No, he had not - I said, "You must have gone somewhere else - I will allow you might he in liquor, and probably went to a bawdy-house;" he said, "No, I did not;" I said, "There or somewhere else you must;" he said, "I did not, by God;" Then (said I) I will say no more, but for my own peace of mind allow me to ask you one or two questions: - Did you, after you bade me good night, return to my house again?" he said, "Certainly not, Sir;" "Did we pass five words together during the whole time, or the whole night while you were in my parlour with me?" he said, "Not on this business, but on commercial business we did;" I then said, "Can you suppose or think, in your own mind, that I am a man who would he guilty of so abominable a crime as you formally accuse me of?" he made some reply, but he moved somehow at the time, and I did not distinctly hear it, but I think it was "No," in a low tone of voice - I put the question, and did not care about his answer; I said, "If you will walk into my anti-room, which is private, I will endeavour to get you 5l.;" he said nothing less than 10l. would do - I showed him into the anti-room, where there was a little fire, but no light; in going down stairs to get a light I saw Mr. Perry at the bottom of the stairs without his shoes: there was no light in the saloon.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Then how could Mr. Perry see any person there? A. He was close to the window, which would show a light - there was no lamp outside, but you might see the shadow of a man's person: I could see the top of the table plain enough.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did you say to Mr. Perry when you saw him without his shoes? A. I asked him to walk up stairs, as I had a word or two to say to him - I showed him into the anti-room where the prisoner was, and asked him if he had any knowledge of the prisoner's person (the prisoner and myself were the only persons who had been in the saloon while Mr. Perry was in the gallery, I am quite certain of that) - Mr. Perry said Yes, he had a knowledge of him from last Tuesday evening; the prisoner then said, "Yes, sir, I think I have a knowledge of you; I remember you" - I then said to Mr. Perry, "This person has accused me of a very bad crime;" Mr. Perry said,"Indeed;" I then put out my arm, pointing to Mr. Perry, but could not recollect his name, though I had said it a minute before - I said, "Mr. -, Mr. - ;" he said Perry - I said, "How to tell you I cannot tell" - the prisoner said, "I thought you were acquainted, but I perceive you are not, as you don't know his name, and as you seem determined on its being made known, if you don't begin, allow me;" I said, "Yes, any body but me" - the prisoner then began to tell Mr. Perry, in some sort of way, of my ill usage to him, and said I had acknowledged to it within the last five minutes; Mr. Perry said, "Indeed, sir;" I did not make any remark - Mr. Perry then said, "Before you go any further, allow me to ask what might your name be?" and the prisoner said, as far as I can recollect, that his name was

               <p>Q. Had you acknowledged to it? A.

I was at the prosecutor's house on the night of the concert, on the 13th of December; I saw the prisoner there - I was not much in Mr. Hemingway's company that evening; I was not sitting with him: the prisoner sat on my left hand from the time he came into the parlour till we left the parlour together; the prisoner was not alone in the parlour with Mr. Hemingway at any one moment till we went away together; the prisoner and I were the last persons in the house- he was after me, but close to me; I opened the door, and he followed me - we were the last two persons in the house - when we got out I went to the right and he went to the left; I saw him go beyond the house, and bade him good night - I heard Mr. Hemingway fasten the door of his house before I bade him good night; in consequence of what Mr. Hemingway said to me I went on Monday evening into the gallery of the concert-room; I think it was from eight to half-past eight o'clock - while I was there Hemingway and the prisoner came into the concert-room; there was no light in the room for me to see the prisoner, but I knew him by his voice - I heard the conversation which passed between them; I was there for that purpose, and had taken off my shoes, that I might make no noise- when they came in Mr. Hemingway said, "My good man, you ask me for 10l. which is a great deal of money, and you know that I am not guilty;" he said, "I am a man of family, the father of ten children: you must have been mistaken, and gone somewhere else" - the prisoner said he had not; he said, "You must; the prisoner said,"No, by G-d, I did not; I went straight home" - Mr. Hemingway said nothing further on that subject, but he said, "Do I look like a man that you would suspect of being guilty of any thing of the like?" the prisoner said,"Certainly not;" Mr. Hemingway then said, "If you will retire with me into the anti-room I will go down and see if I can get you up 5l.;" the prisoner said, "Nothing less than 10l. will do;" they left that room, and went into the anti-room - I then came from where I was, and met Mr. Hemingway on the stairs; I had not then put on my shoes - I then went into the anti-room; Mr. Hemingway introduced me to the prisoner, and asked if I knew that gentleman; I said certainly I did from what had occurred on the Tuesday previous - he said, "Here is a very awkward circumstance occurred here with me;" I said,"What might it be?" he said, "Upon my word I can't tell you?" he said, "Mr. - , Mr. -, Mr. - ;" I said, "Perry is my name;" the prisoner said, "I see you are not very well acquainted, if you will allow me I will tell;" Hemingway said, "Any one but me" - the prisoner then said that Mr. Hemingway had put his arm round his neck, kissed him, gone down on his knees, unbuttoned his breeches, and behaved in an indecent manner to him on the Tuesday evening; I said, "Is it possible that he has done this?" he said Yes, and he had owned it within the last five minutes; I said, "You will excuse me, what is your name?" he said, "

               <p>Q. Had Hemingway owned any thing of the kind? A. No, certainly not - I then rose up from my chair, and said,"You are a d-d infernal rascal, and have not a bit of man's flesh about you - out of this house you shall not go, but under the protection of an officer;" Mr. Hemingway then began to call him a rogue, a liar, and a rascal, in a high tone of voice, and stamped with his feet; Mrs. Hemingway came up, and begged her husband not to be in a passion, as he had got everything provided; I then desired her to leave the room, but prior to her coming up, the prisoner fell on his knees, and called his God to witness that what he said was true; Mr. Hemingway followed his wife down - the prisoner followed him, and I followed him; I took hold of his coat, and gave him in charge of the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CLARKSON. Q. Were you at the house between the Tuesday and the Saturday? A. Yes; I went there one night, and was there on the Saturday night, I suppose as late as twelve o'clock; I have seen Dr. Newman - he is not here; I went on the Saturday night, about eight o'clock - I went there on the Sunday; I first heard of this transaction on the Saturday, about the time I went in; I saw the letter - Mr. Hemingway and I made an arrangement on the Sunday that I was to go into the gallery, and that he would bring the prisoner into the saloon, that I might hear what transpired, and that he would put such questions to him as we thought proper, and one was to ask whether he looked like a person who could be guilty of such an officer, which the prosecutor did, and the prisoner said No, not at all; he spoke that as loud as he did the rest - he did not say it in a muttered tone, that the prosecutor could not hear; I should think not; I could hear it very plain - the prisoner was under the gallery; the window was on my left hand, and the prosecutor stood close against the window, on one side of a table - I cannot tell which side the prisoner stood; one was farther off than the other, but I cannot say which was furthest - I had never seen the prisoner in my life till the Tuesday, but I knew his voice by having so much conversation with him; I cannot tell whether the answer the prisoner gave to the question, whether the prosecutor was a man likely to commit such an offence, was so low that Mr. Hemingway could not hear it; he was not a quarter the distance from the prisoner that I was - I should consider he must have heard it - whether he paid any attention to it I cannot say; he might be in that state of mind that he could not pay attention to every word - we had prepared an officer below; the same officer was in the habit of attending the house - I was perfectly sober on the Monday evening; I had only had a glass of gin and water, while we were waiting for the prisoner; I was sober on the Saturday evening - I was not drunk on the Tuesday; I might be rather fresher than I was on the other two nights - I had taken more than I generally do; I swear the prisoner left the house that night at the time I did, and Hemingway and him were not alone any time that evening - I had not lost sight of them; they did not change their room; after they came from the concert-room they were in the parlour, and they were not alone there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen, - When you shall hear the strict and undeviating line of honesty which I have hit her to pursued, with oredit to myself and satisfaction to my employers, I trust that you will not suppose, that I would, all at once, invent and write a letter, involving such consequences as it does; my prosecutor has undeavoured to support his own case, and blacken mine, but in the eyes of God, he is the only guilty man - the letter was written in my own hand, and subscribed with my own name and residence - the bearer was ordered to answer any questions: on my first interview with the prosecutor, be expressed his earnest desire to have it made up, and appointed me to meet him on the Monday, when he placed the witness in ambush, to get rid of the adium himself, and to place it on any shoulders: when the inspector asked what I had, I voluntary took out the copy or draft, from which I took the letter, with only a few verbal alterations. Did this look Like guilt? Should I not have destroyed it if I had been guilty? Whatever may be the consequence of this prosecution, I have not acted designedly wrong; if I have erned in writing the letter, instead of bringing the prosecutor to the bar of justice, it was done in ignorance of the consequences of it. Perry passes much of his time at the prosecutor's, but it was utterly impossible that he could tell what took place between one and two o'clock on the Wednesday morning: he was intoxicated, and might have gone out; I had myself gone out once or twice, and what inducement could he have to watch me away; not a soul was moving in the horse when the prosecutor let one out, at twenty minutes to two o'clock, and no eye but the eye of Omniscience was witness to what was done.</p>

            . I work in the brick-fields, and have four or five brothers. I was taken up on this charge, but discharged; the prisoner lodged with me - I was with him at Cooper's on Saturday evening, the 17th of December; I live about a mile and a half from the public-house, and when I got home it wanted half an hour to twelve o'clock; the prisoner went with me home - my wife was up; the prisoner went to bed down stairs, and we went up stairs; I was not out with him after that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he remain in bed all night? A. I cannot say - there are four rooms in the house; no one sleeps with the prisoner - Foy and a great many more were with us at the public-house; the prisoner is a brick-maker- I had a brown rough great coat on that night; the prisoner had a white smock-frock on - I know Mr. Austin keeps pigs; we came by his mill to go home, between eleven and twelve o'clock - I did not take the key of the door: the prisoner might have got out.</p>

I lost 4 lbs. of bacon on the 9th of December, did not see it taken, but I had lost a piece before which made me notice my bacon - the prisoner was in my shop, and he said to a man who I bought baskets of,"I shall go;" I missed the bacon, and the man said, "I will go and see for him;" he pulled a basket off the prisoner's shoulder, and my bacon was in it - he had not got two dozen yards from my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Was not the prisoner also selling baskets? A. Yes, and he put down his basket to wait while the other man sold me one - the bacon was on a sideboard close to him; he could look at me, and put the bacon in the basket - the other man was near the bacon; I did not see the other man turn his head; the prisoner did not deny that he had taken it to me; but before the Magistrate he said he did not know that it was in his basket - when the basket was taken from his shoulder he ran down a narrow street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the shop, and a young man was buying butter scrapings - I got fifty of one hundred yards from the place, and the man came running after me, pulled the basket off my back, and took the piece of bacon.</p>

On the 5th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in my kitchen, on the ground floor, and saw the prisoner in my shop, drawing himself back from a stooping posture, with his hands in his breeches pocket; he appeared confused - I went and asked what he wanted; he asked if I sold varnish - I said No, and he went out; I looked at my till, and found it open - I had seen it quite secure five minutes before; I missed a box, containing half a sovereign, and about 14s. - I went to the door, but could not see him; I described him to Collins - he had a paper cap on; I am certain he is the man.</p>

            . I live at Uxbridge. Mrs. Murphy described the man to me, as having a paper cap on; I went and saw the prisoner about sixty yards from the house - I followed, and secured him; he said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050087"/>would trounce me if I took him - I took him to the shop, and found 12s. 6d. in his trousers pocket; I took him to the office, and while the constable was searching him I sent to ascertain what Mrs. Murphy had lost; I then went, and found near the spot where I took him this box; the half-sovereign has not been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How far was I down the turning? A. About twenty feet, and I found the box down there in a garden.(Box produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I went by the shop I saw a young woman come out; I went in to ask for mahogany varnish - she had none, and I came out; I went down a turning, which certainly is no through fare - I went for a necessary purpose, and as I came out the gentleman seized me.</p>

            . I am junior house-surgeon of Middlesex-hospital. The deceased was brought there on Wednesday, the 30th of November, about an hour after the injury; I found a bruise in the lower part of the back of her neck - it appeared to have been struck by somethink very hard, just over the spine; the skin was slightly grazed - it was such a bruise as was likely to be produced by a blow from a small hammer; she said she had a bruise on her arm, but I did not observe that - I desired her to remain in the hospital, but she would not; I saw her next day, and she complained of a numbness on the right arm, and great pain in the right leg, which I thought depended on the injury, and next day it was rather increased; she complained both days of great pain across the breast, and great difficulty in breathing - the pain in the neck where the blow was was very severe; she complaned of great palpitation at the heart - these symptoms will arise from a concussion of the spine, which a blow with a hammer would cause: on the third day she could not come to the hospital - I attended her at home, and found the symptoms aggravated: on the 12th of December she came to the hospital, and was transferred to the care of Mr. Sabine- I attribute all the symptoms to the injury.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did she not appear in delicate health? A. She did not appear a good constitution - she would have had a better chance of recovery if she had come into the hospital; she lived two or three hundred yards off, and was able to walk, by leaning on another person.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon of Middlesex-hospital. I attended the deceased from the 12th of December till the 24th, when she died; in my judgment she died from concussion of the spine - the numbness of the arms continued; there was a great deal of swelling on the back of the neck - she could not walk when under my care; there was no paralysis of the lower extremities - I examined her body on the Monday; there was nothing to be observed at the examination - there are several cases of concussion of the spine when nothing has been seen at the post mortem examination; I attribute her death to a blow on the top of the spine - a blow from a hammer would be sufficient to cause the symptoms, and produce the concussion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If in a struggle she grazed against a door, might not that cause concussion? A. If any hard substance struck her on the spine; she could have been attended to much better if she had come into the hospital at once - she would be seen much oftener.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you a doubt of the cause of her death? A. None.</p>

            . The deceased was my mother. On the 30th of November, between five and six o'clock, I had a dispute with the prisoner about the staircase window - the prisoner insisted on having it shut, and my mother, on account of the smell of paint and oil-cans on the stairs, wished it open; I met Martin on the stairs that evening - he shut the window; I opened it as I went up, and in three or four minutes after I found it shut - I opened it again, and as I came back Martin's room door was open, and he said, "You b-y set of thieving b-rs, I will be master!" I think he was sober - he went on with his abuse; my mother came out, and intreated me to go away; I did so, but had not turned my back a moment, before I heard my mother cry out "He is murdering me! help me!" I was not a yard off - I turned back immediately, and found him in the act of shutting his room door - I pushed it with my hand; he immediately came out, and struck me on the head with a small headed glazier's hammer, which he had in his hand - he is a painter; the blow cut my head open, and stunned me; he was in the act of striking me another blow, when Mrs. Clark came up, and parted us: when I saw him shutting his door my mother was standing on the landing - she did not fall; I helped her into her room - I examined her neck, and found a great swelling as big as my fist between her shoulders; the skin was grazed at the top of the spine - she went to the hospital by herself; I went to the office for a warrant, and when I returned I found her in bed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When your mother called out, did you hear a scuffling? A. Certainly; I heard nothing about his going to nail the window down with the hammer.</p>

            . I live on the second floor, in the same house, but am not related to the last witness; my children called me to hear what was going on - I was in my room, and after a short time I heard words between the prisoner and Avins; I heard the deceased say, "You mean, pitiful wretch, you shall have it," and from the sound of footsteps and voices it seemed as if she left the landing, and went into her own apartment - I immediately heard a violent rushing at the room door; I heard two or three violent blows, as if knocking against the prisoner's room door, or against wood - there is a small lobby between the two doors; immediately on that Murder! was called three or four times - I went from my own room up stairs and then the whole party were in Martin's room -Avins had his hand on his shoulder; Mrs. Avins seemed to be pulling her son from Martin - I went between them, and said, "Forbear, what is all this for?" they attempted to strike each other - I never saw a hammer in the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You heard a rush, as if something was being knocked against wood? A. I thought so - I rather think it was a knocking against the door; the box of the lock has been loose ever since - it was not so before.</p>
               <p>MR. LONGSDALE. If she had fallen against the edge of the door the bruise might have occured, but I should think then she would have struck her head; the flat part of the door could not have done it - it was a round circular bruise, and appeared to have been given by a hammer; if given by the edge of the door I should say the surface would be larger.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you would be more decided in your opinion if you had seen the door? A. Certainly; it might have been caused by any hard substance, the key or the knob of the door.</p>
               <p>MARY CLARK. There is a knob to the door; I did not preceive any key - I am sure it was the deceased who called Murder!</p>

               <p>Q. What did he do? A. Nothing that I know of - he did nothing with a stick; I was examined before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the Coroner that he struck at you with a stick? A. No; I was in the dark - I told the Coroner I could not see: I cannot read - I have not said he struck at me with a stick when I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say he struck at you with a stick - you did not know whether he struck the child, but you screamed out that he had killed the child? A. No, I have not said it - I did not hear the child scream.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any harm done to your child that night? A. I cannot say whether it was during the morning, or whether it was him or the children - I took the child to the hospital in the morning as its arm was broken; I did not give it any blow - I did not know whether it was him or the children, as I took her out of bed, and put her into bed with my landlady's children; the child did not scream out, but I said, "John, you have hurt my baby;" he was drawing the stick in his hand, and it fell by the bed-side out of his hand; I then said, "John, you have hurt my baby," but I moved it to my side, and it went to sleep again; it died five days after - I went to the Middlesex-hospital: it was taken care of by the doctors there - its arm was broken that night by somebody; I cannot say whether it was by myself, the children, or him - I never had the stick in my hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The child went to sleep after you heard the stick fall? A. Yes, quietly; it never cried after that - the room was quite dark; the landlady's eldest child is about twelve years old - I was not sober enough to remember what I did; I had some gin about half-past five o'clock, before I came home, and had beer at home; the prisoner is a well disposed man when sober.</p>

            . I keep the room in which the witness lodged; I knew the prisoner by the name of Gower- he came to my room on this day, and we all slept in one room; I sat up drinking with them, and went to bed about half-past one o'clock: they went to bed at the same time: I was not tipsy - there are two beds in the room, and my four children slept there; they did not beat the child - the prisoner and Mahoney had been jawing - that awoke me; the prisoner wanted to go out to his employ about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and she would not let him; I had locked the door, and told him the key was on the box - he asked to have the door opened, and asked for his neck-handkerchief; I heard a violent blow on the bed, and the baby screamed out immediately; Mahoney said,"John, you have killed the child;" he returned, and struck a light, to look at the child - I had said to her, "Why do not you get up, and get the man his neck-handkerchief to go to work?" he said, "I have left my wife and family, you ****, and neglected them for your sake - you have given me something to drink, which compels me to follow you;" he said if he did not get his neck-handkerchief, he did not care if he hung at Newgate; I cannot say what he meant; when he found the baby's arm was broken, he ordered her to go to the hospital, to be taken care of; he said something about a ****; I got up, and lighted a fire - he laid hold of the stick in his hand, and wanted to strike her again with it, but I laid hold of him, and prevented him, and the father of my children also, who slept in the room; they went out together, leaving this child in bed with my children.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When he found the baby's arm hurt, was he not very sorry? A. He was, indeed, more so than the mother; I did not see the blow given myself - the mother aggravated him very much indeed, and put him in a passion; he begged her to let him go to work, but she would not - I was sober: the prisoner appeared found of children.</p>

            . I am surgeon at Mount-street infirmary. I was present at the examination of the child's body, which was conducted by Mr. Howship, before the Coroner sat - the only mark of external violence was a fracture of the left arm; we found bile effused in the cavity of the abdomen, and a small rupture in one of the ducts which convey the bile from the gall-bladder to the intestines - the vessels were all healthy; on one side of the brain there was a slight fullness - the fracture of the arm was recent; the child appeared to have had proper nourishment - I cannot form a distinct opinion of the cause of death, as such slight causes will produce death in children; the appearances found were sufficient to cause death, and they certainly proceeded from violence; if it was hit with a stick, though under the clothes, those appearances would he produced, the bile and other appearances, as well as the fracture.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you examine the lungs? A. I did - I could not tell whether it had had a cough; children of that age are liable to a hundred ailments, that after death the appearances would be equivocal; the fracture continued, but I could not say whether the arm had been set - there was no bandage on it, and it was too recent to expect union to take place; there was no external appearance on the arm - it is exccedingly possible that the fracture could be produced without, but I should expect some mark.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Would not the probability be more in favour of non-appearance of marks, the child being under bed-clothes? A. Certainly, but it might have had marks- the mere fracture would not produce the appear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050090"/>ances I have described, but if the stick hit other parts it might.</p>

            . I examined the child - a blow given on the Led-clothes certainly might have caused the appearances; a stick like the one produced, used by a powerful man like the prisoner, would be likely to produce external marks; but under the bed-clothes it would be much less probable - I cannot give a positive opinion of the cause of death, but the appearances cannot be doubted to be sufficient to explain it - such appearances could searcely be produced without external violence - I apprehend if blows were given in the front of the infant, it would be more likely to have produced the appearances.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Death might have originated in a great many things? A. It might, certainly, in so young an infant; it is probable a drunken woman in bed with the child might account for the violence - I should not expect to find external marks on the arm - I had a man under my care, whose leg was carried away with a cannon shot and the other broken, and there were no external marks; I am disposed to think an infant's body is not more likely to betray marks - I consider the fullness of the vessels of the brain unimportant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I paid every attention to the child from the time the mother was put to bed, till I went to her lodging by appointment, and know nothing of what is laid to my charge; the man of the house went out with me and his wife to a public-house, and the child was put into their bed with their children for four hours.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. STURGEON. Q. You have been here before on this case? A. No - I prosecuted one Sykes last Session, for talking out my goods, and unlawfully pawning them: he was not convicted - I did not ask for my expences; I took the prisoner to Worship-street, and he was dismissed - I never trusted him with goods after that; I lent him 2s. at Worship-street, on the 5th of November, out of humanity - I have no recollection of being in the same public-house with him; he did not drink with me - I know Pope, a tailor: I did not go to Pope with him since this - I sent a cloth there by a porter; I believe I have never been in his company since - he appointed to meet a person at the Woolpack, in Hart-street, and I took him there; I cannot say whether I drank out of the same pot as him there, but should think not, as I gave him in charge - I told the Magistrate at Worship-street, that I occasionally employed him on jobs as a porter; (looking at some letters) these are my hand-writing; I never pawned any goods in the prisoner's company, nor has he pawned any by my direction - I have goods in pawn, which were pawned by him without my consent.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this an accommodation bill? A. No, I gave value for it - I got the acceptance probably five or six weeks after parting with the goods; I was promised a bill for them - I visited the prisoner in the Compter, as I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050091"/>was repeatedly sent for, and it was called an act of crnelty that I did not go; he said, "It is no use keeping me here, you will get nothing out of me;" I did not ask him for money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the bill drawn for the amount of the goods, and no more? A. Exactly - I drew it on Mr. Kohlbeck; I only knew the prisoner as a porter, and would not have trusted him - I never divided profits with him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at the Woolpack, charged with forging this bill; he seemed very much affected, and said he had been made a dupe of by a man named Sykes - he has been in custody ever since; he traversed this indictment last Session.</p>

            . I was tried here last Session, for stealing two pieces of cloth from Mr. Johnson - his Lordship stopped the case, and Mr. Phillips, I believe, threw up his brief; I have instructed my attorney to bring an action against Johnston, respecting that indictment, but he advised me to stop till this prosecution was over - that was three weeks ago; no writ has been taken out, as I had not got the money; Johnston stated to me that he had received a bill from Cleasby, drawn on Koblbeck, and it was not paid - this was at the corner of Bunhill-row.</p>
               <p>Q. At any other time did you hear any thing? A. I saw the prisoner and Johnston at the Bird Cage, where the bill was drawn; I was reading the paper at the time, and heard them talking about a bill on Mr. Kohlbeck - it was not mentioned whether it was young or old Kohlbeck; I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you do not know whether he described it as drawn by old or young Mr. Kohlbeck? A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>MR. STURGEON. Q. Did Johnston use any expression about the bill? A. So many expressions have taken place between Johnston, me, and Cleasby, that I really cannot recollect; our business was altogether - Johnston has said,"I don't want this person to know this - and the other to know that;" he employed me and Cleasby to sell his goods in different parts of the town for cash, as there were so many bills coming due; and he took care never to have any body present but us.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever know him deliver goods to Cleasby, to bring him the money for them? A. I have known him deliver him goods to sell where he could, for cash or bills; he has sold to different people at Shadwell, and I have seen them divide the profits - I know the goods in question were at Read's, the cloth-worker, in Dudley-court, Silver-street; Cleasby told me they were pawned there - I never knew him employed as a porter; if he was going to the west-end of the town he has brought a cloth for Johnston, and I have done so for him; these letters are addressed to me - Cleasby got orders for goods, and sometimes Johnston let him have them on sale or return - he used to deal with me in the same way; I have seen them divide the profits.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did they divide the profits? A. At the Bird Cage, Wood-street; I had a good opinion of Cleasby.</p>
               <p>Q. If he has said you made a dupe of him, should he be believed? A. Certainly not; if he said so it is a deliberate falsehood - I always acted honestly to him and the prosecutor; I know Johnston so well, he is capable of any thing.</p>
               <p>MR. WILKINSON. Johnston has not paid me the bill, but he has given me security for it.</p>
               <p>The following are the letters which were read.</p>
               <p>September 18, 1831.</p>
               <p>MR. SYKES, - Now pray do your best to-morrow; I am sure you would if you knew how much depends on it - if we can but retrieve the mischief Cleasby has done this time, another chance of living will be left - return as soon as you can, for I am all anxiety; see that Cleasby is provided with the amount of the cut he bought yesterday, as also the black so long standing; you know it is not only the Basinghall-street concern, but another bill will return to Leeds on Tuesday, unless you provide part of the money - get in all unsold goods, whether in your hands or Cleasby's, and let us have a fair start again. The Petershams he wants are ready - I shall be in the City in time to send them out. S. JOHNSON.</p>
               <p>To W. Sykes, Esq. September 21.</p>
               <p>SIR, - I found myself so unwell this morning I did not go out, and had I gone it would have been eastward and not after you - I complain, as usual, that you act as if you considered it my whole duty and business was to attend on you; you must think I am anxious to know what is going on, and had you stopped five minutes, or gone five yards out of your way, I should not have thought it a great compliment; I got only 7l. from Jack, and was obliged to borrow at three places - I shall be at your house at nine o'clock, as usual. Did Cleasby bring in the cash, as you said he would, for that old black and the cut? if Gasden is to be paid, why not now, while it is so much wanted, and lays by him idle; I hope Thompson's goods are returned as well as Jones' and others, who have them to give an answer - quarter-day is at hand, and the things at Chelsea will be lost. Pray do not start in the morning again and leave me in ignorance - when you are obliged to do so, write.</p>

               <p>Another letter was read, in which the prosecutor complained that the defendant was always avoiding him, and giving directions respecting goods.</p>

On the morning of the 4th of January, before the usual time of opening the gates, the prisoner came to me at the gate, and asked if he could get out; it was then about ten minutes past seven o'clock in the morning - I asked him where he came from; he said from the dock, where he had been all night watching the Princess Vittoria - I said that ship did not want watching; he then said he had been watching a craft alongside of it - I said"What is in it?" he said brandy - I said that was Mr. Lucy's; he said Yes, it was - I asked what he gave him for watching; he said two shillings - he kept shaking, and said he was so cold; I said, "I hope you have not brought any brandy away" - he said No, and took off his hat; I felt a gimblet in his side-pocket, - I then searched him - I found on him a tin tube, a handkerchief tied round his body, and a bladder fastened to it, containing five pints of brandy; I said "you have plundered your charge;" he said "It is only a little drop, take no notice of it;" I said I must, and took him into custody - I went to Mr. Dunbar, who went with me into the boat, called the Charles, by the side of the Princess Vittoria; there were ten pieces of brandy in it - I found a spile in one, the size of the gimlet which I found on the prisoner; I took the brandy to the dock, where it was guaged, and eighteen gallons found to be deficient - I then went on board of the Maria, which also laid along side of the Vittoria, and found some skins of brandy under her head-sheets, and some under her stern-sheets; there were eighteen gallons and a quarter of brandy in all, which seemed to be part of the same quantity.</p>

            . I am a locker in the Customs. I was at the rum wharf of the West India docks, on the 2nd of January; I guaged ten puncheons of brandy to be shipped on board the Vittoria; No. 29 had one hundred and eleven gallons in it, and No. 33 had one hundred and twelve gallons - I was present on the 4th of January, when they came back to be re-guaged by Mr. Russell, and I chequed them; in No. 29 was a deficiency of nine gallons, and in 33, nine gallons also; they had been in the lug boat, by the side of the Vittoria.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they of the same quality as near as could be? A. There might be two or three tenths difference in the strength.</p>

            . I am a guager in the Customs. On the 4th of January I guaged No. 33, and on the day following No. 29; there was a deficiency of nine gallons in each; I tried the brandy found in the skin, and that taken from the bulk, there appeared a difference of about 1 1/2 per cent. between that and the bulk - the shifting it from vessel to vessel would account for that; I have known it lose 2 per cent., by racking and by evaporation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In drawing it off it is exposed to the air? A. Yes, and I imagine that it will lose strength by that; there might be some exposure to the air if it passed through the tube - it might not be a close fit, or the bladder might not be closed tight.</p>

            . I am principal of the Police at the docks. On the morning of the 4th of January Luke brought the prisoner to my office; I made him no promise or threat -I asked where he got it from; he said he had it from a craft of brandy he had been watching for Mr. Lucy, in the Export-dock, along side the Princes Vittoria; I asked if he had any more - he said he had not, that he was going to take it home, and no other person had been concerned with him; I suspected that more might have been extracted, - I desired Luke to make a search, and they produced in all, eighteen gallons and a quarter, in eleven bladders.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure he said it was his own doing? A. Yes, he persisted for four or five hours in the same story; a person could take that quantity of liquor out of the vessels, but such a thing has not occurred for a length of time, as it is very difficult to do it.</p>

The Fleet - I have had no quarrel with the prisoner; I have had his sister in prison for robbing me - she was tried in this Court, I believe, two Sessions ago; she was a servant of mine - I have no wife - the prisoner did not sleep at my house while I was in confinement, nor for two or three months before; he had slept at my house, in the same room as I did - there was one bed in that room, but occasionally there was one made for him; his sister slept with me.</p>

I went to the prisoner's house on the 3rd of December - I found a great quantity of linen there; this is it - here are five cravats and other things; Mrs. Watson has selected some part of it, which she knows; some of it was in the washtub, some on the backs of chairs, and some on the washingform; there are from thirty to forty articles in all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they in the room into which the street door leads? A. Yes; the house is in a court, and as soon as I opened the door, these things were there.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was present at the search of the prisoner's house: I found this top of a lady's shift in an old saucepan, by the side of the fire, covered with water; it forms a whole shift with this other part, found by Mead.</p>
               <p>MRS. WATSON. This shift is one of the articles lost from my husband's house; it belongs to Mrs. Jones, of Hackney- it had her name on it, but it has been picked out - it was whole when I lost it; here is a table-cloth torn in half - it was whole when I lost it; here are some glass-cloths, with the name cut off.</p>

In consequence of information I went to a furrier's shop, on the 12th of December, the prisoner was standing at the door, and his son was inside offering this skin for sale, at a very low price - I went in and took him; he did not hear what I said to the boy - I took him to the station, and from what he said, I went and took the prisoner to the station; I questioned him, and he said it was given to him by a young man named Watson, in Long-lane, to sell.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She said, "Let me put this skin into the drawer, and the Captain shall never have it any more;" this passed on for a month, and one Sunday, John Watson came to the door, and I let him in - he said "Is Margaret up?" I said Yes; she came to him and said, "How did you leave Henry?" he said, "In good spirits;" she said "I have the skin, do you think he will ask for it when he comes home" he said No; then said she "I will have it sold, and divide the money between us," and they gave it to me to sell.</p>
               <p>MARGARET WALTERS. That is not true - it was given to me by Captain Monro; I had shown it to the prisoner.</p>

On the 8th of December I was coming along Great Marylebone-street - I saw the waggon, and the coat on the sacks of potatoes; I saw the prisoners pass, and look at it - I hid myself, saw Field get on the wheel of the waggon, take the coat, and give it to Jones; they ran one way - I pursued, ran past Field, and took Jones with the coat; a man came up, and I told him to take Field, which he did.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Queen-street, Seven-dials. On the evening of the 29th of November, the prisoner came to my shop with another young man, who carried a bedstead; the prisoner said he had a bedstead for sale, and asked if I would buy it - he asked 3s. 6d. for it; I offered him 3s. - he went away, came back again, and said if I would stand a quartern of gin I should have it for 3s. - I gave him the 3s.; we all three then went to a public-house, and had the gin - the prisoner afterwards came with an iron pot; I gave him into custody - he said his father bought the bedstead for him six months before; it wanted a leg - I did not know him before.</p>

            . I live at Hadley. On the 23rd of October the prisoner came to my house, about half-past one o'clock; he asked what I had done with my ducks - I said I had got rid of some, and some persons had got rid of some for me; he then asked how geese were - I said they were too dear for me; he said he knew where there were some to be had cheap - I said I supposed on the cross - he said No, it was all right, that he had them from a person he had been ditching for; I said I had no goose money - he paid for what he had, and went away: he came again in about an hour, with a goose in a sack, and asked if he could leave it there, and call for the sack by and by - he gave it to my wife, and as he passed me he said, "The goose is in that;" there was one in it, which did not appear to have been killed above ten or twelve minutes - the head was nearly severed from the body; I put it into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050101"/>sack again - I afterwards delivered the same geese to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had the sack been out of your sight? A. It had not been out of my premises; he was not in the habit of selling geese; I meant by the cross, that he had come by it in a dishonest manner; I said I would have nothing to do with it, but he brought it.</p>

On the 18th of November I heard a knock at the door; I had been in the dining-room about a quarter of an hour before them, locked the door, and put the key under the mat, close by the door - it was then I saw the silver spoons; a woman, who was housekeeper, was in the house with me; on hearing the knock I opened the door, and saw the prisoner and Willis, who rushed in as soon as I opened it - Willis said, "I want to see Mr. Wardsworth;" I said he was not at home - before that he turned the handle of the parlour door, which was locked, and then ran up to the drawing-room; I followed him - he looked over the rooms, to satisfy himself that Mr. Wardsworth was not there - he looked over different rooms; he was up stairs four or five minutes; I then followed him down stairs, and saw the dining-room door open; Willis could not have opened it, because he was with me - nobody could have opened it but the prisoner - I found the prisoner in the dining-room alone, taking down the curtains; I asked what he wanted - he said, "My name is

I have been in possession once for the prosecutor; I have been in a house with a bill of sale - I was in this house afterwards with a bill of sale, in possession for a person named Cooper; I went into possession on the evening of the 18th - the deed was executed that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you having been servant to the prosecutor five days, on the fifth day take a bill of sale from Cooper to take your master's goods? A. I took a bill of sale - I was merely attending for Mr. Wardsworth while he got a little money advanced on the goods; I then became servant to Mr. Cooper - he is a wharfinger, and lives at Pickle Herring-wharf; I believe he has the bill of sale - the goods were all taken away; not under the bill of sale about a dozen men came in one day, and held me down while they took the goods away - I have been a brewer, and have very likely said that I was a broken down brewer; I was put in possession of the bill of sale about five or six o'clock, the same night the curtains were taken away, which was between eleven and twelve o'clock; my master had come home about five; I was put in possession - I had seen 
               <persName id="t18320105-207-person1828">Cooper</persName>
             that day; I have seen him and my master visit, perhaps five or six times, about a year and a half ago - I do not know where the woman remained while I and Willis went up stairs; I believe Willis is a bailiff, and had come to arrest my master - the prisoner had been to the house the day before I believe; the goods were taken in open day.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, be cautious, did you not say you were waiting in the house, and would not say you was in possession till more goods came in? A. No; nor that I would remain in the house as the prosecutor's servant, and not take possession till more goods came in, for it was not worth while - nor to that effect; I did not say I was waiting to take possession when more goods came in, nor any thing to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs with the bailiff, was not the maid servant in the hall? A. No, I believe not - she is not here; I do not know where she is - I know I left her down stairs; there was no other servant in the house; I do not know Mr. Wilkinson, a pianoforte-maker - I recollect a person taking a pianoforte away; that might be a fortnight ago - no complaint was made against <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050104"/>him, to my knowledge: the spoons which were taken were tea-spoons - I do not know where they were bought; I never heard master say he had a large quantity of plate coming home, with a crest on it; these had no crest - they were nearly new - I did not know Mr. Richards, the linen-draper; the bailiff did not say he had come to arrest master - he said he had a writ against him; the prisoner said he was Mr. Richards, and took away the curtains - I never went to Mr. Richards to claim the property back, nor did Mr. Wardsworth, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. The spoons were never claimed by any body, only the curtains - then the spoons, at all events, must have been stolen? A. Certainly; I went before the Magistrate after I had a true bill found against him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. A true bill could not be found till the Grand Jury sat - did you complain to any Magistrate? A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. The Sessions, if I remember, were on the 4th or 5th of December, at Clerknewell? A. It was at Westminster - my first appearance as an accuser was before the Grand Jury; I dare say that was about a fortnight after the goods were taken - I believe the prisoner was taken up the first day of the last Session; the prosecutor went to Mr. Clark's office, got a certificate of the indictment, and then went to the Magistrate - they took him that evening on the certificate, in Mr. Richard's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him before a Magistrate? A. No, he was taken to the Police-station, and then discharged; he was taken before Mr. Minshull about a fortnight or three weeks before Christmas - my master did not attend then to make a charge against him; I went there - I got there about half-past twelve o'clock; he was then liberated on bail - I went to inquire, and found him liberated; I did not go before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at this gentleman, (Mr. Harmer) - on your oath, do you mean to say you went at twelve or half-past twelve o'clock, and the prisoner was discharged? A. Half-past twelve o'clock; I went to inquire of Mr. Burchall - I went into the clerk's office, and inquired there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that Mr. Minshull, hearing the story from Mr. Richard's employer, took his own recognizance to appear? A. I do not know, nor do I know that he has surrendered voluntarily, nor that he has never been in Newgate - I believe it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him as he walked here today? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Do not you know this trial stood over from morning to morning here for the prisoner to surrender? A. I have heard it; I do not know it - I was here yesterday, but I do not know that he was not tried because he was not in custody; I have not seen him waiting about to surrender - master has not told me that he had not surrendered; I have not received any notice of his intention to surrender, neither last Session nor this - I do not know that he has been on bail ever since; I was told he was on bail.</p>
               <p>Q. During the five days you were there, a great many people came after your master? A. Yes, several people who came after bills for goods sold; very little came into the house while I was there - there were a few things, such as eatables and beer; no furniture, nor any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you to swear that no person came to take away different articles? A. After that they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Alleging that they had been swindled out of them? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. An indictment was found against the prisoner? A. Yes; he was afterwards apprehended on a warrant, a fortnight or three weeks before Christmas.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know where he lived? A. Yes, because we had apprehended him - I do not know why he was not taken before; I merely went to identify him - I did not make any deposition; I told Mr. Wardsworth what had happened.</p>

             and Co. of Oxford-street, and purchased the goods named in this bill,(looking at it); I bought some crimson silk curtains - I believe I had six brass hooks of Mr. Richards; the bill amounts to 31l. 19s. 10d. - I had known Mr. Richards about twenty-eight years; he said nothing about the mode of payment - I called on him before I ordered them: he had a very large stock of goods, and was very desirous of selling me goods to furnish my house; he proposed to me to purchase not only these, but other goods - I received the goods named in the invoice, part on the 19th of October, and part on the 28th; I had some servants to make the silk up into window-curtains - part of them were put up in Clifford-street; I used about three dozen hooks - I believe about two dozen were taken away with the curtains - I had purchased part of the braiding of Mr. Richards; that was part of the braiding included in the bill - I also used on the curtains other braiding, and hooks, besides those supplied by him; I was in the house on the morning of the 18th of November, and left between nine and ten o'clock, leaving Aylett behind - I had a woman in the house; I breakfasted in the parlour - the curtains were all up then, and there were a dozen silver spoons, which I intended to take away with me, had I not been obliged to go out on important business, and I left them on a small sideboard; I returned about five o'clock - the curtains and spoons were gone; I was informed a person, describing himself as Richards, had been there - I spoke to my solicitor, and the Sessions were just on; I immediately went to find the bill, the Session being two or three days after; it was the Westminster Sessions - I had a good deal to attend to of importance: I know I went the first day of Westminster Sessions, and found the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do on finding the bill? A. I went to the Clerk of the Peace, in Carlisle-street, Soho, and I was to wait - I was referred to the Old Bailey; I applied here on the first day of the Session - Mr. Clark or his servant told me I must wait till the first day of the Session; I could not have a warrant till then, because the Jury must sit; I obtained the certificate, and got a Police-serjeant and his man that very evening, and took the party to identify him - I took him to the station-house in Marylebone-lane; there he was known to the party, and they discharged him - I was recommended to go to Scotland-yard against the Police; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050105"/>went to Bow-street three or four weeks afterwards, and obtained a warrant, which was executed - I did not attend at Bow-street when he was taken on the warrant, because I did not know of it - I have not got any of my property back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure you should know the property again if you saw it? A. I do not know that I should - I did not put the stitching in it; I did not make them - I was in business last at Manchester at Waterloo-place, Southwark, No. 2; I was in business there from the time of the panic till about two years ago - I was there from 1824 to 1828; I do not recollect what month in 1828 - I had a docket struck against me there, which I superseded; I left Waterloo-place about two days before Christmas - I have done a little commission business since that, in buying and selling malt; I was a spirit-merchant at Manchester - I have not dealt with many persons in the malt line in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in any line? A. I have got so many things in Chancery, I have done no business except buying a trifling article or two - I have done nothing but the malt commission business since I came to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live first when you came to London? A. I stopped sometime at a public-house at Islington - I lived there three or four months; it is at the corner of Sun-street, about half a dozen doors from Finsbury-square - I got out of the coach at Islington, and stopped at the Green Man, opposite the Angel, about four days, and then came to lodge at this house; I do not recollect the sign - it is the corner of Sun-street and Crown-street; one end runs to Bishopsgate-street - I do not recollect the landlord's name: I paid him a week in advance for the lodging - I took no receipt, I had witnesses enough - I then took the remaining part of a lease from a person named Benjamin, in Union-court; I believe it was No. 13 - I was there about six months; it was No. 13 or 14, I do not know which - Mr. Stirtevant, the Common Councilman, was my landlord - I went from there to Stingo-lane, No. 8, and have lived there from that time to this, pretty well occasionally.</p>

               <p>Q. The inquiry is not where your family lived, but where you yourself lived? A. All my family lived in Union-court; I lived in Stingo-lane two or three months - my family did not live there; I staid in Stingo-lane two or three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to from Stingo-lane? A. I lived at Sydney-terrace, Sydney-square, No. 2; my family lived there at the same time - I went from there to No. 10, Sutton-street, close by; I stopped there six months - I stopped three months myself, and left my family there; I think I was in Sydney-terrace near six months - I was arrested in Sutton-street, and went to the Marshalsea; I was arrested for three or four sums on some bills - I do not know the amount together; they swore to sums and upwards - I defended the actions myself; I have had a verdict for the third - and the fourth I compromised, to prevent any difficulties.</p>
               <p>Q. After defending three actions, what was the sum you remained in prison for? A. Why, near 30l. - I remained there a few weeks for that sum; when one person arrested me, and went to trial - then they lodged a detainer; I was there about a month - I am married: I took two ladies to Mr. Richards - I was there four times, and think I took two; I am not quite positive: I did not take my wife there- it was after I got out of the Marshalsea; I did not tell Mr. Richards I had been in the Marshalsea - what occasion was there for that? he knew me when I had 1000l. in my pocket, and he had not 1s. - I did not promise to pay him ready money for the goods; I bought the spoons in question from Thomas Wilkinson, Piccadilly - here is the bill and receipt: they amount to 4l. 6s.; they were paid for before they were stolen - I never had an office in Somerset-house; I did not represent to Mr. Richards that I had an office in Somerset-house, nor a place, nor any employment there, nothing of the kind; I never said so to the prisoner, or to any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to him, when he came with 7l. worth of goods, which is the last portion, that you could not pay him till you got your money, but you would pay him when the quarter was up? A. No, nothing of the kind - if any body has said so, it is pure invention; these were the only spoons I had in the house, and the only ones I had bought - my wife was down at my brother's, in Hertfordshire, at the time; I have four children - two were in Clifford-street; one is concerned in a steam-packet, the other was now and then at Clifford-street - sometimes he was at Margate; I had looked at some other spoons, but not ordered them in, nor had I ordered any plate.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a bill of sale at the time Richards took your things - you were removing from Clifford-street? A. No, I was not, but I was pressed very much by Mr. Bailey, and had immediately to raise about 700l., and I had seventeen workmen there - I ordered some plate afterwards from Mr. Hamlet: whether he was to supply me depended on the price - I had looked at a considerable quantity of second-hand plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bespeak any plate of any body else - I am not talking of looking at it? A. I think I did, of Mr. Thomas, in Bond-street; I bespoke none of any other, to my knowledge, except to Mr. Wilkinson - I believe I ordered no more; I might go into a shop, but I believe not- I am sure I did not bespeak any other plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply for any - did you try to get any from any body else? A. No, I did not - I swear that; I do not know Mr. Oswald.</p>
               <p>Q. In Great Russell-street - now, I tell you he is in Court? A. Oh, I will tell you; I went to look at a tea-pot there, because I did expect a sum of money - I told him to put my initials on it, but I should not take it till I got the money, and begged him to take care of it till I did - I wanted nothing but the tea-pot, and did not want to get that, for I left word I should not have it; it was taken to my house to be seen, certainly - I believe I told Mr. Oswald I wished my wife to see it; she was not living in the house then, but she would be in town in a day or two; I did not tell him I wanted a large service of plate - I said if he had got any thing cheap, I should want some - I was furnishing a house, and laid out a great deal of money; I cannot say how many persons I bought goods of on credit - I will tell you why I could not pay my way; my landlord was ill, and kept me three months without a lease, that kept me out of about 300l., which I expected, and I expected to receive some money from Manchester - other tradesmen, whom I had bought goods of, took them out of my house; no one took them by force, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050106"/>Q. That you will swear? A. Yes; Mr. Bailey and Mr. Wilkinson did not indict either of them for robbery- Mr. Wilkinson never applied at all, to my knowledge, for payment for his pianoforte; he, Mr. Bailey, and all came together - there were twelve or fourteen of them and their men, but I was not there; I did not take any steps - Mr. Bailey sent in a bill for 400l.; the painoforte was about 70l. I sent to Mr. Bailey, about three weeks before, that I should give him the security of a gentleman in the Lord Chamberlain's-office - I owed Mr. Plasket, the wine-merchant, 30l., Mr. Goodey, a tailor, 16l., but he owes me a little, I had some child's clothes from Mr. Lock, another tailor; I owe Mr. Whiteley, an ironmonger of Holborn, 7l.; I offered Mr. Bailey security; I told him if he was not satisfied with a gentleman he was acquainted with not to serve me, not to send any thing, and when he sent me about 20l. worth I said, "Go to the Lord Chamberlain's-office, and ask your friend again;" then he sent them - I do not know whether he took the goods away; they are not in the house now -

             is the person in the Chamberlain's-office; he holds a berth there now: he gives his name on the card, and I believe he is there to-day; I do not know that he became security - I owe Mr. Foster, a linen-draper of Oxford-street, 8l. or 9l., and Mr. Blaket, of Regent-street, 8l. or 9l., Mr. Mortlock, a chinaman, of Regent-street, 40l. - I believe Mr. Williams, a silk-mercer, claims 4l.; I was to pay 160 guineas a year rent for the house in Clifford-street, besides taxes; I was to do all the repairs before I had the lease.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me the name of the attorney you went to after Mr. Richards robbed you? A. I mentioned it to Mr. Reynolds, of Clement-street, Kingsland-road, and to his clerk: I never saw Richard Miller, who is now a Policeman, letter C. No. 50 - I came out of the Marshalsea more than twelve months ago; I do not remember after that being in a public-house in Fleet-lane with

             and some women - I might be in Fleet lane; I remember a man, named Biggers, in Fleet-lane; I do not know a woman named Cann - I have heard of a woman named Jenkins; I was many times in Fleet-lane, next door to Biggers', at a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drinking in company with two women and a man there, Mrs. Jenkins being one of them? A. Very likely - I am sure I was; I have no doubt but I told a man there that I had been just discharged from the Marshalsea.</p>
               <p>Q. The man I allude to is Richard Miller - did you ever tell him you were acting with others in getting goods and selling them? A. Never - that I am sure of; (looking at Miller) I do not recollect him - I never recollect seeing him; I might be drinking with him at a public-house in Fleet-lane - I was not a gentleman then.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did you never tell a man that you were employed acting with others in getting goods and selling them, and did you not propose to Miller to join you? A. No, I did not; if I did, I must be completely in liquor, and lost - I did not propose that Mrs. Cann's husband should give the references, and that I and Mrs. Jenkins should sell the goods; I swear that positively - nor that we should share the money; it is totally untrue - nothing to that effect passed; if you could bring half a dozen to swear it, I would still deny it - if true, I would admit it.</p>
               <p>Q. What took you to drink with a Policeman? A. If he came into the parlour to ask me a question, I do not know, he might take advantage and ask me a question, for some motive planned by other parties; it was Mrs. Rivett I took to Mr. Richards' - she is the wife of Mr. Rivett, who is in the Lord Chamberlain's office.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he in the Lord Chamberlain's office? is not be a trumpeter? A. Yes, he is, and I will tell you what he is - he attends before His Majesty at the coronation; and he collects the Peers' fees; he lives at No. 12, Belmont-terrace; I believe I took but one lady to Richards' - the other lady whom I believed that I took, lis

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 2nd of November he employed me to look after his potatoes; they were harrowed up, and were to be picked up by the women the next morning - I saw the prisoner in the field; he came out about half-past ten o'clock; a person named Walden was with him - the prisoner had a bag on his shoulder; I took Walden at the time, but the prisoner got away - there appeared to be as much in the prisoner's bag as there was in Walden's, and that had a bushel of potatoes in it; the prisoner's bag seemed to have potatoes in it - he went off as soon as he saw me run.</p>

            . I am a pupil of the London-hospital. The deceased was brought to the hospital on the 12th of December, about ten minutes past eight o'clock; I found a deep lacerated wound on his left cheek, about two inches and a half long: the cheek bone was laid bare, and a branch of the temporal artery had been divided, which bled profusely - I should consider it was an instrument of this kind which made the wound: there was a contused wound on the bead, such as might have been inflicted by a more blunt piece of wood; several of his teeth were loose, as if he had received a blow from a man's fist - he was between sixty and seventy years of age: I stopped the haemorrhage - it had been dressed before, but not sufficiently to stop it; he died on the 2nd of January - Mr. Scott, the surgeon, superintended my management of him; he had every thing done that the nature of the ease required - had he been a young man he might have been saved; I think the wounds were the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you believe the cause of his death was a wound produced by an instrument of this description? A. I should think the wound on his cheek was from a blow, with the sharp edge of this piece of wood - I think it could not have been produced by falling, unless he had fallen on a scraper, or something of that kind.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had been attacked in Petticoat-lane by several Jews, who surrounded and robbed him; and the deceased must have fallen, in his endeavouring to get from them, but he had not struck him.</p>
