A. Gray &amp; Co., who were stated to be very substantial persons; in fact, the order was given as for J. A. Gray &amp; Co.—on 14th December, those goods were sent from Leeds—on 16th December I received a second order, amounting to 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the order—I saw both the prisoner and Hughes on that day—Joseph Hughes wrote the order, in Webster's presence—Hughes did not, on that occasion, say for whom the goods were; he had told me that all fabrics that they ever bought were for Gray &amp; Co., of Canterbury—that order was ultimately executed; the goods left Leeds on 26th January, and were delivered to Smiths', the packers, in Camomile Street—from what I saw in the newspapers, I wrote to Webster about Hughes, of Millwall, and I received this letter in reply—I do not know Webster's writing—(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner stating that the signature to the letter was hit, it was read as follow:</hi> "7th January, 1868. 4, Great Winchester Street, Old Broad Street, London, E.C. Merchants and Shippers. John Webster &amp; Co., London Agents for J. A. Gray &amp; Co., Canterbury, New Zealand. Dear sir, Your favour of this morning we beg to acknowledge, and say, in reply, that the report alluded to by your friends, in the matter of the Millwall Shipbuilding Company, is entirely distinct from the Millwall Rolling Mills, of which Mr. Hughes is the head, and we wish you to convey this to your friends.")—I received this letter, signed "J. B. Hughes" (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I should say the signature is the same handwriting as the orders they gave me—in consequence of that letter, I sent goods to Messrs. Smith, the packers (<hi rend="italic">This was from J. Webster &amp; Co., per pro W. Hughes, dated 22nd January,</hi> 1869, <hi rend="italic">directing the goods ordered to be sent to Smiths', the packers</hi>)—Hughes had told me distinctly, the first time, that they bought no fabrics except what were for Gray &amp; Co.—he did not say so specially with reference to those goods—the goods were sent from Leeds to Smiths'—those goods have not been paid for; they were to have been paid for in a month—I made application for the money, in the first place to Joseph Hughes; Mr. Webster was stated to be away, ill—he afterward wrote to me, and I called on him, I think, some time in March—I did not get my money—I executed a third order—at the time I did so I under-stood the second order had been paid for—the amount of the third order was 158<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Joseph Hughes wrote that order, professedly from a letter he had in his hand from Gray &amp; Co.—he gave me the order person-ally—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; it is dated March 4th, 1869—Hughes distinctly said those goods were for (tray &amp; Co., of Canterbury—they were what we term black union cloths—those goods were sent to Messrs. Smith, the packers—the first order that was given to me was for the same manu<lb/>facturer that executed the third order—at the time I executed that order, I was under the belief that the goods were to go to J. A. Gray &amp; Co., of Canterbury—there was a special time named for the delivery of these goods, "To catch a certain ship, and they must be in London on 8th March"—289<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. would be about the amount due to me—I did not go to the referees after the first time—I have since been, on one occasion, to Ethel<lb/>burga House, where Owen Ford &amp; Co. carried on business; that was the</p>

               <p>day after I heard that Webster had absconded, not later than that—I believe it was the first week in May, and I believe on the Monday after Webster was reported to have absconded on the Saturday—the last time I went to Webster's place was on the Friday previous to his, absconding; I can't give you the date—I did not find him there, the warehouse was locked up—when I went to Owen Ford &amp; Co.'s, on the Monday, I saw the man there representing himself to be Ford.</p>

De Vecchi. Navone &amp; Co.—I did not say I was glad of it, for that Japan was a better market than New Zealand—I will swear that—I said probably it might be a good market—I believed it was, and that it would realize a profit; but they were not sold to be sent to Japan—I should not have trusted Webster if I had thought he had to find a market for his goods—they were not sent on speculation—perhaps parties do send out goods on speculation, but I was not sufficiently satisfied with Webster's amount of capital for that—if they had sold better at Japan than at New Zealand it would have made no difference to me, if I was paid the money; but there was the false pretence, that they were bought to go to Gray &amp; Co.—I said I believed Japan was a good market—I did not say I was glad they were sent there, nothing of the sort—I did not say it was a better market than Canterbury—I am paid by commission—I have no idea what profit these kind of goods would make in a good market—I should say not twenty or thirty per cent, nor twenty—in the ordinary course, goods of this sort, destined for foreign markets, are sent to packers like Smith.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Parkington &amp; Co., champagne and claret shippers, of John Street, Crutched Friars—in January last, I received a note from Webster &amp; Co., inquiring prices; in consequence of that I called on 28th January at No. 4, Great Winchester Street—I there saw the prisoner and Hughes—I was introduced to Hughes by the prisoner—I mentioned the fact of my having received the letter—I forget whether I took it with me—a general conversation took place—I told them I had not any wine at the price they wanted, but I could sell them wine at a higher price, which I quoted—they talked together with myself, and said they had orders to send wine to Australia, they did not know that they were limited to price, but they would be glad to see my wines if I would let them have samples—in the course of conversation I asked what business they were carrying on, and they told me they were merchants,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186908160006"/>
               <p>general merchants, I think—I don't know whether the word "genera" was used, but that was what I understood them to say—they said they were not in the wine trade, but they had received orders from some of their friends, or constituents, I forget which word they used, in the Colonies, to send them wine—I asked for references—they gave me Messrs. Owen Ford &amp; Co., of Ethelburga House, Bishopsgate Street—I went there and found that name up—I saw a person, I can't tell you his name, I understood he was one of the partners—I received a very satisfactory reply to my inquiries—in consequence of that reference I furnished the wine—this is the order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is dated February 20th, for seventy-five dozen of 56 champagne, at 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen at Epernay—the "56" probably refers to the year of the vintage—I received this note, dated 9th March, it is simply an inquiry when the champagne will be ready—I think it refers to some subsequent order which we did not execute—it is on one of Webster's lithograph headings—I don't know in whose writing—[<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. INOAMKLLS</hi>. I believe this to be in Hugheb' handwriting]—We ordered the wine from Epernay, and on its arrival in bond we shipped it on board the ship we were directed to do by Webster &amp; Co.—we imported the wine direct from Epernay—the shipping order came in this letter, and we lodged the wine to that order—it was sent to the dock—I don't know it of my own knowledge—I saw the prisoner subsequently on several occasions—I don't recollect any particular conversation about the wine—I have no doubt it was alluded to many times, that it was shipped, because a further order was given—I can swear that I told him the wine was gone, and he said he was glad to know that the thing was on its way—I received these papers.</p>

Frinneby &amp; Son, bristle mer<lb/>chants, of 143, Cannon Street—on 5th December last, we had a communi-cation from Webster &amp; Co., and on the 12th I called on them, to know about the terms—I saw Webster and Hughes—I asked them the terns they would accept, twenty-eight days and one-and a-quarter, or a four months' bill, and they agreed to a four months' bill—it was stated on the letter that the goods were for New Zealand—nothing was said to me at that time about where the goods were to go—Mr. Frinneby saw them on the occasion of receiving the letter—I saw Hughes again, about the 18th January; he then said the goods were to go to the East India Dock, and he would send us a shipping note—we did not have it, and they were sent to the Poplar station—the prisoner was not present then—we received this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on 22nd December, 1868. [<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WALLIB</hi>. This is Mr. Webster's handwriting.] This is an order for brushes, and other things, to be sent to the Poplar station—this other order was received the same day. [<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, in Fenchurch Street—I have known the prisoner for some time—I believe, when I first knew him, his place of business was at Ethelburga House, Bishopsgate—I knew there was such a firm as Owen Ford &amp; Co.; they had offices, I believe, on the same premises—I am not quite sure when I first knew the prisoner in Great Winchester Street; I rather think it is some four or five months since I first heard of their being there—I had done business with him when he was at Ethelburga House—I don't recollect when the last was—in the early part of April, this year, a man named Hughes called upon me—he referred to an intended shipment they were making, of shirts, to Australia, and spoke to us relative to advances—I don't think he told me at that time where the goods came from; I think we knew before we advanced any money—he brought the invoice, it amounted to 148<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and was for three bales of shirts from Moses, Levy &amp;Co.—the entire amount I advanced was 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., including charges; the amount in cash was 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that ad<lb/>vance was made on 125 dozen shirts, to be forwarded by the <hi rend="italic">Swiftsure</hi>—62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of that advance was made by cheque, and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, not by cheque—I have here a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 5th April, but I think that refers to another transaction. [<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WALLIS</hi>. The endorsements on these cheques are both in Webster's handwriting.] I rather think both those cheques were given to Hughes—I obtained the bills of lading, and shipped those goods to some person at Melbourne; not in my own name: the bills of lading were made out in our own name, but they were shipped as from Webster &amp; Co.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill of lading referring to those goods—on 20th April I advanced other moneys on goods—I rather think I saw Hughes on that occasion—I may have seen Webster during the course of the proceeding, but, I think, finally I saw Hughes—those goods were two cases of clothing, and one of shirts—before making the advance we saw an invoice—I am not sure whether it was an original one, this is a copy of it—the amount of it is 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there is no date on it, but the transaction occurred on 28th April—I advanced on that 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I see this was the transac<lb/>tion in which 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in cash, and 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid by cheque—Hughes came to us and represented that Mr. Webster was away ill, and he was in urgent want of cash. [<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WALLIS</hi>. The endorsement on this cheque is Webster's.] We sent those goods to Sydney—I recollect Hughes</p>

               <p>balling and showing me an invoice from Parkington &amp; Co.—I have not the invoice now, nor do I think we ever had an original invoice of that—I have a copy which was handed to us at the time; I have no recollection who handed it to us, it came to us from Webster's office—I am not certain whether I sent out the original invoice—in some oases I know we did not get the original invoices, and that may have been one of them—I saw Hughes with reference to this champagne—it is an invoice for seventy-five cases, at 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I advanced money upon that invoice in con<lb/>junction with some other goods—I don't remember how much I advanced in respect of this particular wine; there was no special amount set aside for that, the whole was taken together—I advanced 174<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. upon invoices amounting to 308<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there were three or four different invoices of goods submitted together, and they were all dealt with together; we could only account for them altogether when we got account sales of the entire lot—we were to sell the goods on behalf of Webster &amp; Co.—we charged them a commission on the combined lot of goods—we were to receive account sales from our correspondent for the entire lot—it was one shipment of goods, although comprised in different invoices—I. Solomon &amp; Co., of Melbourne, were the consignees of these goods—Myers &amp; Son were our Sydney agents; they were both our correspondents—Messrs. Frinneby's ten cases of brushes were not included in that advance; I advanced upon those in February last; they were also taken in conjunction with another invoice of goods and com<lb/>bined in the same bill of lading; the gross amount advanced in that case was 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the other goods were three bales of canvas, the grow amount of the invoices upon which that advance was made was 193<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the advance, exclusive of charges, was 109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 174<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced on the 308<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. invoices included charges—it was 147<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; without charges—the charges were amounts paid out for Webster &amp; Co., insurance, and other things, which they would have to pay—we saw the original invoices or copies before advancing the money—I rather think we saw Mr. Frinneby's invoices—the brushes were sent to Melbourne, to Mr. Davis; he is also a correspondent of ours—they were sent from the East India Dock—I believe we advanced money on goods in the same way when Webster was at Ethel<lb/>burga House—I have never had an opportunity of rendering him an account sale of the goods, a sufficient time has not elapsed; this last week only we first got definite returns upon one transaction, which was the very first—we have had no account of any of the goods in June—the account we received last week does not refer to any of the goods that have been in question here—I never saw Joseph Hughes at Ethelburga House; I was never there myself, but I saw him during the time they were in business at Ethelburga House—he interfered in some of the transactions upon which I advanced money while Webster was at Ethelburga House.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> for two or three months—there is very great uncertainty as to the pried the champagne will realize in Melbourne; it depends upon the state of the market there—sometimes it realizes a good profit, sometimes not—as to the cloth, there is nothing like a certain calculation to be made with respect to the profit it will realize; it is a very uncertain market; if the market wag good it might realize 20 or 30 per cent.—I have not sent any goods to Gray &amp; Co., of Canterbury, direct for Webster &amp; Co.—they sent them them-selves; but they passed the documents through our hands—there were two shipments, the first was in November last—I rather think they were both in November—that was all I forwarded to Gray &amp; Co.—we made advances upon those—we have received the returns and accounted to Webster &amp; Co, for the difference, deducting our charges—I know nothing about the Japan market—it is sometimes the case that goods intended for a particular market are sent elsewhere—we have done so ourselves—from information acquired after the goods have been provided, sometimes on the arrival of the mail, getting advances upon goods thus exported is not at all uncommon—we frequently make them to houses of undoubted respectability, old established houses—there is nothing unusual or irregular in it—when we receive the accounts from abroad we are bound to account to Webster—we make out a statement, and hand the surplus, if any, and demand the balance if there is a deficit, if the goods do not realize our advances—as a rule we calculate to leave ourselves pretty safe, although we are often mistaken—is far as I was aware Owen Ford &amp; Co. were at Ethelburga House in 1868-9—we never had any transactions with them; we only knew them by name—we made inquiries and found they had been there a considerable time—I believe they are known by name in the trade as iron and spelter merchants—we have had their invoices pass through our hands—I have no idea how many years they have been there—I never heard of them until Webster introduced their name to us in November last.</p>

I am a cashier in the Imperial Bank—I produce the ledger containing the prisoner's account—it is not in my writing, it is one of the clerks'—the entries are made from the moneys paid in and paid out day by day—it is checked every night, not by me—I may have checked some of these entries, I don't know—I refer to it from time to time—the first payment by the prisoner appears to have been on 7th December—none of these entries are in my writing, they are made by the ledger-keeper or someone who acts for him—if a cheque is presented, before paying it I should go to the book that Mr. Wallis has referred to, which is copied from this book—the prisoner was furnished with a pass book—that is made up from the vouchers we pay, and agrees with the ledger.</p>

I carry on business at 114, (Goldsmith's Row, Hackney Road—I know Philip Payne well; but I do not know what he is—I have seen him in the prisoner's company, and his brother, Joseph Payne, at the Anchor public-house, Goldsmith's Row—Joseph Payne had apparently accepted the bills for Chapman, and felt anxious to get them back—Chapman said that it would not matter, and produced two letters, and said that Payne was perfectly safe, because he was holding these letters, which he drew from his pocket book—he was all right because he had got these written documents from Mr. Nancy—they were handed to me to read—I read them, and should know them again, one in particular—I left them partly at loggerheads, which I presume they have been ever since—I had two other interviews with them; but that was the last—I have been present at perhaps fifty conversations between Payne and Chapman, because I lived next door; but only at three when the bills were referred to—there was only one meeting where they each met together and the bills were mentioned, and that was the one I have mentioned—Mr. Tenpenny was there—the subject of the conversation was that Joseph Payne accepted the bills for Chapman, and felt uneasy, and wanted them back again because they were forgeries—forgery was mentioned, and Chapman produced the letters, and said that he had got them all in the palm of his hand—I had been to Nancy with Mr. Tenpenny, a fortnight before—Chapman sent me</p>

               <p>there—he wanted to know whether Chapman was going to prosecute hint—I afterwards saw Chapman; he lived a quarter of a mile off—I wished Chapman at once to go and see Nancy, who I believed would not interfere with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Oldham's Gardens—in April last I repeatedly called on the prisoner—early in May he requested me to call on Nancy &amp; Co., with Corbett, as to some complaint Mr. Nancy had against him—I understood from the prisoner, at Northampton, that there had been a quarrel between them—after we came away we saw the prisoner, and told him that the prosecutor had said that if he came forward, and assisted him in the accounts, he would not proceed to prosecution—on the evening of that day I went to the prisoner, at his request, and found the two Paynes, the prisoner, and Mr. Corbett in a room; and after some dis<lb/>putes between them, the question of the bilk of exchange came up, and the prisoner said that he did not care about Nancy, he had him sufficiently in his power—referring to some bills of exchange which he had furnished to him—shortly after that the younger Payne came to me, and took me with him to the prisoner and the elder Payne, who said that he had accepted the two bills in the prisoner's parlour, at the prisoner's request, and that they were forwarded to the prosecutor—Chapman heard that—Paynes said that the persons had no residences; but I explained to him that it was equally a forgery—we had some more conversation, and I came away—I am not sure whether the names of the acceptors were mentioned—there were three or four bills—Northampton was mentioned—the bills were sent up by the prisoner because they were written so badly; they—were to be written in better style by Payne, who told me, in the prisoner's presence, that he had signed them—other bills were sent for Payne to accept, which were accepted in the prisoner's parlour—I had other conver<lb/>stations with the prisoner, In my character of clerk to Mr. Hicks, which I consider were privileged communications, as an attorney.</p>

Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A traveller to Mr. Trotman, a ginger beer manufacturer—I go about with a cart to the customers—I remember this was the 5th October, because I had a holiday on that day—we were very busy last season, and on 5th October we were beginning to get slack, and Sunday was a very cold day; and on the 5th I did not go out with the goods—I was going to the Harrow Road—I left home about 4.30—I then lived at 44, Bolsover Street—I got out of the train at the Chapel Street Station, to walk across Paddington Green, and happened to pass Dr. Beale's house, in Porteus Street—it was not out of my way—I did not speak to him—I was spoken to about this prosecution about a week after-wards or a fortnight—I don't remember exactly—it was not a month—I met Mr. Denyer in Oxford Street—ho said he had taken a writ out for Dr. Beale and it had been served by him on the Monday, and I said, "On the Monday? I saw Dr. Beale on the Monday!"—that was not all the conversa<lb/>tion there were passing remarks as well—we were talking about money affairs, and he said he was in a little embarrassment concerning this Dr. Beale—he said he had served a writ on him, and I said I saw him on the Monday that he said he served the writ—he said he had served it on the previous Monday—I really forget what day it was I saw Mr. Denyer—I am not sure whether it was in the same week as the 5th—it may have been the following week—Dr. Beale was on the door-step when I saw him—he seemed to me as if he had shown the lady that I saw him with out at the door—he went in again—I should think it was about 5.15, 5.20, or 5.30—I swear that between 5.15 and 5.30 I saw him on the door-step, at his own house—I can't be mistaken about that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, in Latimer Road, Netting Hill—I have known Dr. Beale about six or eight months—on 5th October I went to Mr. Denyer's house; and after I had been there I went round to Dr. Beale's residence, in Porteus Road, about 6 o'clock in the evening, and saw him going out of his house—I am quite sure it was him—I did not speak to him—I had, on a previous occasion, seen him for Mr. Denyer, and I am quite sure about his being the person I saw.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He disputed his liability to pay Mr. Denyer the sum claimed of him, did he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he promised to pay the bill in the course of a week or two—when I presented the bill it was due—I forget the date; it was some time before this transaction—I don't know whether it was after 5th October that I was spoken to about this matter—it might be a months, six months, or twelve months—it may have been a month, or it may not, or it may have been six months—really don't</p>

               <p>recollect what date it was Mr. Denyer spoke to me about it; he told me he wanted me—I was required to make an affidavit, or something, against Mr. Beale, about my seeing him in the evening—I don't know that he said what day—I knew the day—he called and asked me if I remembered seeing Dr. Beale on that day—he knew I had seen him on that day, because I had seen him afterwards and told him so—that was some little time after-wards—perhaps a week, or two or three days—I often see him—when he asked me if I remembered the matter, he told me he wanted me to go with him to swear an affidavit that I had seen Dr. Beale on 5th October—that was what it amounted to.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Sullivan. Q.</hi> Did not you charge me with loitering? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—you said that you had been catching a dog for a lady; but I did not hear her say so—I told you I was an officer—you told me where you lived—I went all over Whitechapel; but could not find it.</p>

I was with Howlett, and took Reynolds—I told him he was the man I wanted, and I should take him in custody on suspicion of being concerned in the burglary at Dr. Buncombe's on the night previous—he said, "Me! you make a mistake; I am not the man you want, it is a different man altogether"—I took him to the station, and Anderson identi<lb/>fied him—I found this centre-bit and <hi rend="italic">jimmy,</hi> at 6, Wentworth Street—I took them to the prosecutor's house, and they corresponded exactly.</p>

There was a witness at the Police Court, to prove where I was, and I requested him to be brought forward; but he sailed for Sierra Leone during the remand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Reynold's Defence.</hi> I shall call my employer, a respectable man, and master of two houses, who will tell you that at 6.30 on this day, I was working at his side. I went that morning at 6 o'clock, and he let me in, and I never left him till 1 o'clock, when I went to dinner. He has known me three years, and therefore I think you will take his evidence before Martin's; he will nay that the tools were constantly passing from my hands to his. It is two miles off; and it would be impossible for me to go two miles there and two miles back in the time he stated at the Police Court. I am innocent. Nothing was found in my possession. I do not know where the house is.</p>

I am manager of the King's Arms, Uxbridge, of which Mr. Edge is landlord—on the evening of the 29th July I saw the prisoner standing at the bar, with a glass of stout in front of him—Mr. Beasley, who was in the bar, said, "You have soldiers billeted on you to-night?"—I said, "Yes; they have gone to bed"—Mr. Edge said, "It is getting late"—I said, "I am quite ready when these gentlemen are; it is 20 minutes past 12"—the prisoner said, "1 o'clock is the time to close," and that he should be served again—I said "We do not keep open till 1 o'clock"—he said, "I know the house better than you do, I shall be served again"—I said, "The law compels me to close at 1 o'clock, but there is no law to make me keep open"—he said, "I will dare you to put me out"—Mr. Edge turned out one gas burner, and I said, "I want to go to bed, our soldiers are going away in the morning, and I shall have to get up early; will you go out?"—he said he would not, he should stop till 1 o'clock, and dared me to put him out—we had a struggle, and fell together, and got up again—I held him at arm's length against the wall, getting him to the door—he could see into the street, and seeing a police-man he walked out—I held the door open, and he pushed me twice and said, "Skinner, you have the worst of it"—I directly felt blood running down the leg of my trowsers—I put my hand in my trowsers, and my hand was blood all over—no one had touched me but the prisoner.</p>

I am an agent, at Castle Street, Falcon Square—on 7th December I went to the premises in Addle Street, in consequence of a letter I received from my principals—I saw the prisoner there, and asked for Mr. Raudnitz—I was told he was not within—I said I had had a letter, and had called in consequence—about 4 o'clock the same day the prisoner's brother, Anthony Raudnitz, came to my place and selected some goods from samples—I subsequently delivered the goods mentioned in these invoices (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); one invoice is for 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were delivered on 1st January—previous to the delivery of the goods I had mentioned that some security should be given me, and accordingly, from a packet of bills, the prisoner's brother drew one drawn by Mortlock &amp; Co. on Jones, for 7891 francs, and after that I allowed the goods to leave my pre<lb/>mises—they sent their porter to fetch them—I got no security for the second lot of goods—Anthony Raudnitz gave me the acceptance—the pri<lb/>soner was present, and examined the invoice—"Raudnitz &amp; Co," was written across the acceptance—there was a mistake in the invoice, and I paid Anthony Raudnitz the balance in cash—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill I received—it fell due on 23rd February, and was never paid—I gave instruc<lb/>tions to my about in Manchester to inquire about the bill before it fell due, and I made inquiries myself in Paris—I saw the prisoner in reference to those inquiries early in February, in Addle Street—I told him that I had reason to believe I had been defrauded, that I had made inquiries in Manchester and no such firm existed, and that the large branch in Manchester was only a small room, in a bock street, with nothing in it except a boy—that the man Jones, in Paris, whom they said was one of the first bankers, had absented himself about two years ago, and had never been heard of since; and, therefore, I said I should place the matter in the hands of Messrs. Wontner, which I did—the prisoner referred me to his brother, who seemed very much alarmed, and said that he had been deceived himself; that he had given the value for the bill, and that if I did not return it to him at once it would prevent him from obtaining redress, and he begged of me to give up the bill, and promised he would give me another—I said, "No," I wanted the money beforehand—I saw them again in a few days, after Messrs. Wontnor had written on the subject—I told them I had reason to believe they were scoundrels, and the prisoner said he would not allow his brother to treat me like that, and it was agreed that they should give me another bill and part cash—they then gave me a bill on J. Harris &amp; Co. for 294<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at three months, for 13th January, and the balance, 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, to make up the amount—that bill was never paid—I supplied all the goods at manufacturers' prices—all the money I received was 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furrier, carrying on business at 25, Goldsmith Street, Whitechapel—I work for Messrs. Christy; they order caps, and I make them up—I buy the fur myself—during Easter week I went with a person named Reynolds to the prisoner's public-house, at Whitechapel—I saw a sealskin cap lying about in the parlour, of my own make—I asked the prisoner whether he purchased it at Christy's—he said, "Is it your own work?"—I said, "Yes"—he did not say whether he bought it at Christy's—he knew I worked for them—Mr. Reynolds is the prisoner's cousin—the prisoner they asked me if I could alter the cap for him into a turban shape—I took it home and altered it—he asked me if I would buy five sealskin caps—I looked at them, and found they were my own make—I asked what he wanted for them—he said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would not take them then, and went home to alter his cap—I went and made a communication to Messrs. Christy—they gave me the money to go and purchase the caps—I went and saw the prisoner; he showed me the five caps again—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for them—I charge Messrs. Christy 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for some of them, without the lining—I took them to Christy's after I bought them—on the Friday following, the prisoner came to my place, and said, "I have got a new lot of cape for you"—I went and saw him on the Saturday—the caps were brought from up stairs, in a shawl, or something of that sort—there were eighteen sealskin caps, and twenty-eight Balmoral caps—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for the eighteen caps, and 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the Balmorals—he showed me a sealskin waistcoat, and said I must take that as well, as it was of no use to him, and I gave him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I paid him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the whole—on 12th July he came to me, and said he had some more caps—I went to his place, and saw thirteen more sealskin—he wanted 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more for those—I said I could not purchase them then, and went out—the officers went in and took him—those caps were lined—I called his attention to the lining being rubbed in one of the caps—he said, "I did not do it"—I asked him once for a receipt—he said he had the receipt of his own, but he gave none, and I did not ask him again—Reynolds was only present on the first occasion.</p>

On Friday morning, 30th July, about 1 o'clock, I was on duty in the Oliver Road, Leyton, and saw the three prisoners coming out of the prosecutor's parlour window—I was within about two yards and a half of them—there was a high iron fence between me and them, and the gate was locked—it was quite light enough for me to distinguish them; I had got my lamp, and the moon was shining—I swear positively to the prisoners—I had hold of Smith afterwards—I can't be mistaken about it—when they got to of the window, they threw a bundle over the side wall of the garden, and jumped over the wall after it—I went round into Wilmot Road, and met them—I saw them all three together, getting over the garden wall into the Wilmot Road—they ran away—I followed, and caught hold of Smith, who goes by the name of White—the other two then turned back, and assaulted me with either a brick or a stone, on the head—they made my head bleed—they rescued Smith out of my custody, and all got away—I afterwards apprehended Smith and Jones at Barnet in the Bell, beer-shop, on Sunday, 1st August—after they got away I went back to Mr. George's premises, and called him up, and found this bundle in the garden, where I had seen the prisoners throw it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Smith. Q.</hi> When you came into the beer-shop, at Barnet, why did you not take me at once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went to the door to let the Barnet policeman know that you were there—J was not in and out three different times—I identified you at once, find Jones was thereat the same time—I told you the charge when I got you outside—Barnet is about fourteen miles from Leyton—you had on the same clothes you have now, to all appearances—you told me you were at Barnet on the Thursday night, at the Star coffee-house—I went there, and found it was false—I am sure you did not say Friday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">James. Q.</hi> If you were sure I was one of the men, what made you fetch the master of the house, and ask which was the other man that came in with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not; there was a young man there who lived at Barnet, who I told not to leave, when he wanted to go out—that was not because I had any doubt about him—I told him afterwards that he could go—I did not ask you where you slept on Thursday night—you said you slept there on the Thursday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Edwards. Q.</hi> When did you apprehend me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Wednesday, 4th August, on Stratford Bridge—I had not seen you since the robbery, that I am aware of—I did not see you at Stratford when the other prisoners were having their hearing, on the Monday.</p>

I suppose from a chisel or screw driver—I got that during the struggle—the other men made their escape—the police then came to my assistance—in my struggle with the second man, I suppose I tore this coat, but I can't swear anything about the other man at all—I know I floored two, and had them under me by each collar for a certain time—I can't say whether the second man bit or kicked me.</p>

On 22nd July, at 7.30 p.m., I was on duty in High Street, Deptford, and saw thirty or thirty-five persons at the bottom of the street, blocking up the thoroughfare on the pavement, and causing an obstruction—I spoke to Connolly who was there, and told him to move on—he said that he should not—I said that the shop-keepers complained that respectable people could not pass, and begged he would move away—he said, "No, I shall not, not for you; I shall stand here just as long as I like"—I asked him civilly to move again—he said, "No, I shall not, not for a b—like you"—I went into High Street and got the assistance of Beard, we returned together, and Connolly used very bad language—Beard asked him to move away and not make a disturbance there, upon which Connolly struck him a violent blow on the mouth with his fist, and ran twenty yards down King Street—I ran after him and caught him—Beard came up, and Edwards and Walsh—Connolly knocked me down twice, a mob got round, and stones and brickbats were thrown in all directions—I still held Connolly when I was knocked down—I was struck on the arm with a stone, thrown by Kirby—I also received a kick in the ribs—I cannot say who from, but Connolly hit me in the chest—I saw Mansell within four yards of me, throwing stones—I lost my helmet in the tussle with Connolly, he was so violent—I held him a quarter of an hour, and then he got away, and went down Old King Street—Kirby was taken on the Saturday night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer—on 17th May last, I apprehended two persons, named William Green and William Simpson, on a charge of having in their possession a gold watch and chain, supposed to have been stolen—I searched Simpson's house, and found there certain property—the case was brought before the Lambeth Police Court on Tuesday, 18th May, and remanded till the following Wednesday week—on Saturday night, 22nd May, I received a letter, in consequence of which I went to the Elephant and Castle the next night, where I saw the prisoner Richards—he said, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Jemmy,</hi> how are you?"—he shook hands, and said, "Come along, let us go over the way and have a glass," which we did, at the Rockingham Arms public-house—I did not say anything about the letter, nor did he—he was standing waiting there when I went up—a friend who I met at the Elephant went across with us to the Rockingham—we had a glass and came out—Richards said, "Let us go down below, and have a glass there"—when we came out, he took hold of my arm, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jemmy,</hi> I will tell you what I want to speak to you about; you aid Ranger have got old Black Miles and <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> Green, have not you?"—I says, "Yes"—he says, "I suppose you don't want to get them convicted, do you i"—J sail, "No, not particular"—he said, "And you found a lot of stuff there"—I says</p>

               <p>"Yes"—"Well," he says, "old <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> Critchley has been down to me, and wanted me to see Potter; I told him no, that would not do, to leave it to me; now, look here, <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> says you can have twenty <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>, and I can get it for you; no one shall know anything about this, mind, excepting ourselves—we then entered the County Terrace public-house, and as we got to the bar, a man well known to me came from the further end, and shook hands with him—we had some refreshment, which Richards paid for—the other man, turning his eye round to the back of him, says, "It is too hot here, for I think these are two <hi rend="italic">coppers</hi> behind; go down in the Dover Road, there is a nice quiet place there, you know where"—we then came out of the public-house, and Richards said, "Come along, we will go this way, let us go down to the Dover Road"—I says, "No, that is not good enough for me"—"Oh," he says, "it is all right"—I says, "No, I won't go, for he might have witnesses there, I have none"—he pressed me very much to go, and I told him at last I would not go—he then said, "Come along, let's go and see an old friend of mine, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Hamilton"—he then took hold of my arm, and walked quietly up the Kent Road—he said, "How are you with Ranger?"—I says, "All right"—"Well," he said, "look here; you need not fear, for there is no one shall know anything about this, excepting us, you and me and Ranger; you may as well have the twenty <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> as not, for they are sure to get off it, for we are going to send some parties to <hi rend="italic">buff</hi> to the stuff—we then entered the American Stores, Walworth Road, which is kept by <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Hamilton—we were in there a short time—we then came out, and he said, "Now, look here, you can easy do it in this way with Ranger; say, 'Now, Ranger, what do you think of this? we are sure not to get no owners for the stuff we have got; let's get the poor devils <hi rend="italic">turned up</hi>, and have them for something better'"—he said, "We are going to send some parties to <hi rend="italic">buff</hi> to the stuff, and you can easy say as this, before the Magistrate, that you have made inquiry about the property, and you believe it belongs to the person who is now in Court; we know what you can do if you like, for the one you have been before (meaning the Magistrate) will do what you ask him, for we don't want them to be remanded over and over again"—after receiving the letters I have alluded to, I communicated with my superior officer—I made a full report of it in writing that night, and I acted under his direction and with his assent—before parting with Richards he said, "Now, look here; meet me here to-morrow night, at 9 o'clock, and I will bring you the stuff"—I promised to do so—on the following night, Monday, the 24th, I met him with Ranger, at the Elephant and Castle—he came up to us, and shook hands with both of us, and invited us across to the Rockingham Arms to have something to drink—he turned to we and said, "Well, Ham, how's things?"—I said, "All right"—he then turned to Ranger, and said, "I assure you, Mr. Ranger, that no one will know anything about this excepting ourselves; it will be all quite right"—I says, "Well, have you brought it?"—he says, "No, I have not; I have not seen <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi>"—and then he said, "Directly you get them <hi rend="italic">turned,</hi> you shall have the money"—"turned up" means "discharged from the Police Court"—I turns to Ranger, and says, "He has not brought it now"—Ranger said, "Oh, that won't do for me"—I says, "No, a promise is a promise"—he then looked up at the clock, and said, "Well, I know where to go and find <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi>; will you wait here five minutes; but-look here, it is 9.30 now, will you wait here till 10?"—I said, "Yes"—he then left the</p>

               <p>house, Ranger following him—and at 10 o'clock he came back to the public house—Ranger was back before him—he said, "Well, I have seen <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi>"—I gays, "Where have you been?"—"Down, to the William the Fourth, in St. Andrew's Road, and <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> says that if you will meet him in the private parlour of the Elephant and Castle to-morrow, at 12 o'clock, you shall, have the money"—we then parted, and I went to the station—I made a full report of all that had taken place—I received directions from the superintendent, and next day, at 12 o'clock, we went to the Elephant and Castle, and there met Richards—he says, "Well, have you seen <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi>—I says, "No, where is he?"—he says, "I saw him get out of a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> about five minutes ago, and go down the Borough"—he then invited us to go into the Elephant—after waiting there a short time, we told him we could not waste our time like that—"Well," he says, "I can't make out where he has gone to"—after waiting a short time, he said, "Look here, I will run down to the <hi rend="italic">Barrister's</hi> and see if he is there"—the <hi rend="italic">Barrister</hi> is a theif who goes by that nick-name; he keeps a coffee-house—he went out, and after a short time he returned, and said, "Well, come along, <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> is over the way; follow me"—we followed him, and across the road, in the Causeway, we saw Critohley standing about twenty or thirty yards from the Alfred's Head public-house—we went up to him—he said, "Well, Ham, this is a bad job, for, so help me God, that it all the old man's stuff that you have got"—he then invited us to go into the Alfred's Head, and we, all four went in and went up into the corner of the bar—Critchley said, "Tom tells me that you, Mr. Ranger, is a perfect gentleman, but I don't know you so well as I do <hi rend="italic">Jemmy,</hi>" or "Ham,"—I am not sure which he said—I then saw him put his hand in his trowsers pocket and pass something, to Richards—I am quite positive it was money, by the rattle of it when Richards took it in his hand, and gold—he looked up at the clock, and said, "Well, Tom, I must be off"—they both went just outside the door, and Richards then returned to us again in the public-house, and after finishing his glass of ale, he said, "Well, I must be off, for I am busy up at the rail to-day; come a little way with me"—after going a short distance from the house, he said, "Well, I have got it for you"—Ranger said, "Yes, I know you have"—he then put his hand in his right hand trowsers pocket, and from that hand he counted ten sovereigns, and gave it to Ranger with his left, and gave me the other ten; ten more sovereigns—he said, "Now look here, don't let us have any misunderstand-ing about this, Ranger; now mind, if they don't get <hi rend="italic">turned up,</hi> you must return this money, for I am responsible to <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> for it; now then will be no occasion for me to see you for a, day or two"—I omitted to State that when he first came back from Critchley, in the Causeway, he said to us "<hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> tells me there is some mistake about this affair for Mr. Chipperfield, the solicitor, and the witness, have gone down to-day, thinking they were coming up to-day,"—we then left him—I went back to the, station and handed the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over to the superintendent—on the Sunday following I apprehended Critohley at his dwelling at Brixton—I afterwards went to the Brighton Railway in search of Richard—I did not find him—I went to his house, he was not there—I watched his house all night—on hearing that he was in custody, I searched his house in Carlton Road, Peckham (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Thomas Tilson, the chairman of the Surrey Sessions, censured me, not for procuring the keys but for allow<lb/>ing the landlord to do such a thing—I was not censured for procuring skeleton keys, skeleton keys were not mentioned by Sir Thomas Tilson—I was not suspended then, nor ever in my life—the matter was reported to my superior officers, and Sir Richard Mayne told me I must be more careful in future—that is about four, or four-and-a-half years ago—both the men were acquitted—I opened the box in the absence of one of the men, not the one at the Elephant and Castle—Richards has been employed for a long time at the Brighton Railway; I don't know how long, as long as I have known him—he has a pension as a superannuated policeman.</p>

About 12.30, on 24th June, I met the two prisoners in the Walworth Road—I had known them by sight for some time—they were going towards the Elephant and Castle—I stopped them, and said, "Where are you off to this time of night?"—they said, "Going home"—I said "Home! what do you mean? where do you live?" Bristow said, "2, Hanover Street"—I said, "Where are you going? to Maguire—he said, "I am going home, I live there, too"—I said, "Where have you come from now?"—Bristow said, "I have just come from my father's house, in Trafalgar Street; I have just been married to-day, and I am going home to my wife"—Bristow had a very heavy chain on—I said "Well, you won't go home yet, for I shall take you to the station, and see what you have got about you"—I called another constable and took them both to the station—I searched Bristow and found this chain and locket—I also took a stud put of his shirt—I took a watch from his pocket, and said "How do you account for this watch and chain"—he said, "I have been</p>
