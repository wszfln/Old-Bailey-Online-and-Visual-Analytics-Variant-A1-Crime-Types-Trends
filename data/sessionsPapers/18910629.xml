                  </hi>. I am manager of the Shoreditch branch of the London and County Bank—on 25th May Mr. Musgrave brought me this cheque—the prisoner was called into my room, and I said, “Who do you come from?"—he said, "Charles Baker and Son"—I said, "Who are they?"—he said, "Provision dealers in Finsbury Market"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189106290008"/>
               <p>I said, "I thought Finsbury Market was pulled down, and that Waterlow's were there"—he said, "Not altogether; there are some houses there"—I looked at the directory and could not find the name—he said, "There is nothing wrong about the cheque, is there?"—I said, "There is something very wrong; not only is the cheque forged, but the book from which it was taken has been stolen. What made you tell me you came from Charles Baker and Son?"—he said, "Oh, I don't come from them; I took it from a man at the Horns, who asked me to present it for him"—the Horns is a public-house close by Shoreditch Church—he said he did not know the man, he had met him casually that morning, and he did it as an act of kindness—I. said, "Then you ought to help us to find him. Will you sit down, as I have sent for the drawer?"—I had sent a clerk to the drawer, and in a short time Mr. Winfield came—I asked the prisoner his name, and he put it down, "Joseph Marshall, dealer;" he said he lived at 28, Kingsland Road, near the gate, at the top; there used to be a gate there—I said, "There you are wrong, because I know how the numbers run; 28 is at this end of Kingsland Road"—he said, "I don't mean in the main road, but in a turning out of it"—I said, "Near the canal or near the warehouse, or where?"—he said, "Near the canal"—I said, "Is it Ware Street?"—he said, "Yes, it is down Ware Street, 28, Louisa Street"—I handed the prisoner over to Winfield, who left with him with the intention of going to find the other man at the Horns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner said he had been drinking with the man at the Horns for about an hour—he did not ask me to send some one to the Horns to find the man—when I told him I had sent for Mr. Winfield he expressed a willingness to go with Mr. Winfield to find the man—the prisoner was in conversation with me for about ten minutes before Mr. Winfield came.</p>

Charles Baker and Son—this other cheque is a forgery—about noon, on 25th May, I saw at the bank the prisoner and Mr. Anning, and was shown the cheque—Mr. Anning told me what had occurred, and asked me if I knew anything about the cheque—I said it was an imitation of the way I signed for my firm; it and this other were cheques out of a stolen cheque-book—Mr. Anning said I had better take the matter in hand, and I said I had better see Sergeant Joyce about it because he had the matter in hand—I took a cab outside and said, "We will go and see Joyce about this"—the prisoner said, "It is a very little way, we can walk there in a minute or two"—I suppose he was referring to the Horns—I told the cabman to drive to the Dalston police-station—on the way I asked the prisoner if he lived in the neighbourhood—he said, "Yes, I live in Ware Street"—he was detained by an officer and subsequently charged.</p>

I was called at half-past eleven on this night, and saw the prosecutor with a crowd round him—he gave the female prisoner into custody—I did not see the male prisoner there then—I charged the woman with being concerned in stealing the watch and chain which the prosecutor said he had lost—on the way to the station</p>

I was called to this disturbance, and took to the station one of the persons who was afterwards discharged—at half-past one a.m. Henry Volger voluntarily came to the station, and the prosecutor then charged him with stealing his watch—he said, "I know nothing about your watch; I have come to see what my wife is locked up for; I ran away because I was afraid of being locked up my<lb/>self"—the prosecutor had been drinking, but he knew perfectly well what he was about—the prisoners had been drinking a little, but knew perfectly well what they were doing—no money was found on the male prisoner—on his collar were blood stains—the prisoner said he had cut his hand—the prosecutor had an awful black eye, and he had a wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living at the Sewerage Works, Isle<lb/>worth—on 8th May I was living at 2, Sidney Street, Gray's Inn Road, with the deceased, John Hackett Jones, as his wife—I had been living with him since 20th February last; I had known him some years; he was a carpenter and joiner; he and the prisoner worked together; they were not related—on the night of 8th May we left home at twenty minutes to ten, and went for a walk; on returning, we came down Euston Road; when we got to the corner of Belgrave Street we met the prisoner: he came out of Belgrave Street; he rushed up to the deceased, called him a b----swine, and deliberately thrust his umbrella into his face; I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189106290015"/>
               <p>screamed for a constable, and the prisoner ran away—the deceased merely snatched the umbrella out of the prisoner's hand; he did nothing to him—a constable came up and took the deceased to the Gray's Inn Road Hospital—the deceased handed the umbrella to me, and I gave it to the constable—I have known the prisoner between ten and eleven years; at one time I lived with him, and had three children by him; I left him five years next September; I had not seen or heard of him since until this occurrence—the deceased was quite well at the time this happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As far as I know there was no ill-feeling between them—I could not say whether the prisoner was drunk or sober on this night, he ran away immediately it was done—I had not been drinking—the deceased only raised his hand to snatch the umbrella from the prisoner—the prisoner plunged it at him—I did not see the prisoner afterwards till I had issued the warrant—he never told me that he was exceedingly sorry, and that it was an accident.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital on 8th May, when the deceased was brought there—he had a wound of the lower eyelid, on the right side of the face, and he had apparently some injury to the eyeball itself; there was blood in it—he was then quite sensible—he became unconscious soon after, and so continued to the last—subsequently there were signs of cerebral irritation—on 11th May I found it necessary to extract the eyeball—in the course of that operation the nature of the injury was more fully disclosed—he died on May 16th—I then found that he had a hole in the bony roof of the orbit, that is the part of the skull which covers in the eye, the cavity in which the eye rests—on the eyeball being removed some part of the brain substance escaped through the hole in the bone—nothing more could be done, and the cause of death was injury to the brain, arising from some traumatic cause, from some violence of some sort—that was connected with the fracture—the wound was about half an inch square; the piece of bone was pushed backwards and so turned on a hinge, like a trapdoor, and so passed into the brain—such an umbrella as the one produced would cause such an injury, by the ferrule end—with the exception of some slight disease of the left lung the deceased was a healthy man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found no evidence of his having been a hard drinker—a very slight stroke with a sharp weapon would be sufficient to destroy the eyeball; I do not call an umbrella a sharp weapon; a man swinging an umbrella about, and accidentally striking the eyeball, would be sufficient to account for the injury to the brain—I do not think it likely that the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189106290016"/>
               <p>injury would be caused by the deceased drawing the umbrella forward against himself in the attempt to wrench it from the prisoner; if he fell against the point it might, provided the other end was fixed—the wound was three inches in length from the corner of the eye inwards.</p>

I am a joiner, and live at 24, Rodney Residences, Rodney Street, Pentonville—I have known the prisoner about ten years—on the morning of 8th March, about a quarter past twelve I met him in Rodney Street; he asked me to have a drink at the Rodney's Head; I did so—he asked if I had heard that Jack had brought Jennie up to London and was living with her in the neighbourhood—I said I had—he said, "Is it not enough to make a man wild, to think he should bring her into this neighbourhood where she had lived with me previously?"—I said, "It is rather galling"—he said he should stick the b----b----to the heart yet—he was very excited and under the influence of drink—as I was parting with him he said, "You can tell Jack from me that I mean going for him"—I had known the deceased about the same time as the prisoner, about ten years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not attach any importance to what he said, I did not think he meant doing it—I knew he and the deceased had been friends until the last three or four years; I never had much to do with either of them.</p>

               <p>Samuel Smith and Co., wholesale boot and shoe manufacturers—I have had business with the defendant for about five years—at the end of 1889 he was bankrupt, and made a private arrangement to pay 17s. 6d. in the £ to his creditors—he paid all creditors with the exception of four or five; we received the whole—about 20th October last year he came to see us—before that he had been in negotiation with us for us to advance money to him for the purpose of carrying on his business, and a balance sheet had been shown to some one on my behalf—we wrote and requested that a later balance-sheet should be shown—on 20th October he came and saw me and produced these two balance-sheets of 7th January and 14th October, 1890—the first one shows an estimated surplus of £418 19s.—in the second one the balance is not carried down, but the assets exceed the liabilities by £795 odd, practically £800—I called the prisoner's attention to the difference between the two balance-sheets, and asked him to account for the very large increase between January 7th and October 14th—he said he had been doing a larger trade; trade had been exceedingly good, and the amount of his gross profit had been exceedingly good, to the extent of 25 or 27 per cent, upon his returns—I asked him for his books, and he said he did not think they would be required, and they were left behind at Wrexham—I made an appointment to see him on the following Satur<lb/>day, at Wrexham, at his own shop, to examine his books, and also cursorily to look through his stock—I attended pursuant to that appointment—I did not see his books; he said he had sent them up the previous day to my warehouse in London—I looked at certain portions of the stock to satisfy myself it had been purchased at a correct price, according to Jones's description, but I was able to make no further investigation—I returned to London on the Monday or Tuesday following—the books which Jones said he had sent had not arrived, and I did not get them till the 21st November—he brought me his banker's pass-book, a detailed account of his stock, and a diary containing his takings from 21st January—I asked for a list of creditors, and he said he had no other books; these were all he had—I went through the books—no book stated the liabilities; I satisfied myself as to assets—on that I came to this agreement with the prisoner on 21st November. (<hi rend="italic">This was an agreement to advance</hi> £400 <hi rend="italic">to enable the prisoner to complete the purchase of the shop and premises at Hope Street, Wrexham, for</hi> £2,550, <hi rend="italic">on his undertaking to obtain a first mortgage of the premises for</hi> £2,100 <hi rend="italic">at</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">per cent, per annum, and to give the prosecutor a second mortgage for the advance, and to cover any indebtedness that might arise for goods or cash supplied from time to time; and also to give him a policy for</hi> £500 <hi rend="italic">on the life of his father in the Refuge Assurance Company; the cash loan to be represented by the prisoner's acceptance of the prosecutor's draft at six months' date, which would be renewed from time to time at interest of</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">or</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">per cent., according to the Bank rate; the prisoner to do all the business he could with the prosecutor and to give his goods the preference, and to permit him to inspect his books and take stock, so as to ascertain his position; to keep such account books as would show his position, and to adopt all suggestions the prosecutor might make for the better progress of his business, the arrangement to be terminated by the paying off of the indebtedness by the prosecutor giving three months' notice</hi>)—I paid him this cheque for £50, which has been passed through our bank and paid—Jones took it with him—two or three days afterwards I saw him, but before that I sent him a cheque for £100 in pursuance of the agreement in reply to his request in writing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189106290023"/>
               <p>—then I had this letter of 27th November. (<hi rend="italic">This from the prisoner stated that six of his creditors had taken proceedings against him, so he had not used the cheque, but returned it enclosed; that the property had been taken over by Morris and Co., and his solicitors had advised him to call his creditors together, and if they would give him time to pay he should do the same trade with the prosecutor as he had arranged, and repay him; and it added that he had made a little error in his last balance-sheet, that bills coming due for next year were in a book, and he had omitted putting them in the sheet; that they were not much, hut whatever turned up he should pay in full</hi>)—the £400 balance shown in the balance-sheet of January 7th, which was alleged to be prepared by independent parties, induced me to part with my money, and also the balance-sheet of 14th October.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I certainly desire to prosecute the prisoner—the agree<lb/>ment of 21st November is my composition; I have had no legal ex<lb/>perience—I am carrying on my own wholesale business, and retail busi<lb/>nesses in various parts—I parted with my money on the two balance sheets; nothing operated on my mind beyond the interview we had—all I have parted with is a cheque for £50, that is the only sum I am prose<lb/>cuting the prisoner for—I knew he had been in difficulties, and that he had paid us a composition of 17s. 6d. in the £—before 21st November a bill for about £13 or £14 that the prisoner had given me had been dis<lb/>honoured—that was 24th October, I think—I did not know the prisoner was illiterate; there are two totals in the second balance-sheet—I knew the prisoner was taking steps to purchase his own premises in the main street, Wrexham, and it was with reference to that purchase that he had these interviews with me; he asked me for an advance to enable him to complete the purchase—I took no steps to inquire as to the value of those premises—I have heard they are let at the present time; I do not know for how much—I should be surprised to hear they are let at £170 a year; they were offered to me at £120; the vendor's solicitors wrote to me before I prosecuted the prisoner—I ascertained from him he was pur<lb/>chasing for £2,550; I do not suggest that was not correct—they were premises on which he had been for some years—I was to hand him £400 in cash from time to time, but the dates were verbally arranged with him, and as security for the £400 I was to have a second mortgage on this property, for which he was giving £2,550—I wanted more security, and so I was to have also a policy for £500 on the life of his father, who was over sixty years old, I believe; and I was also to have as much of his trade as he could give me, and he was to conduct his business under my supervision, and keep whatever books I liked—the £50 I gave him was to go straight to the solicitor of the vendor of the premises, I believe, and I believe it did go to him; I don't know it—I am not prosecuting in this case; the trustee, Mr. Price, is—I am the one man complaining—the £50 was to pay part of the deposit on the purchase of this property—a portion of the money for pay<lb/>ing the deposit of £255 had been advanced by his solicitors or the vendor's solicitors, and they held the policy on the prisoner's father's life, and it was to be handed over to me—of the £255 deposit the prisoner had paid £75 before the representation to me, and £180 were advanced by the vendor's solicitors—he afterwards paid the £50 from me to go towards the £180—I found the prisoner an exceedingly sharp man of business, not because he got £50 from me; before that—he told me he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189106290024"/>
               <p>had had an offer of £200 for the premises before these proceedings were instituted—I prepared this agreement without any legal assistance—I sent the cheque for £100 about the 24th or 25th November—Morris and Co. were the vendors solicitors—I was paid the last half-crown of the composition of 17s. 6d. at the end of September or beginning of October, 1889, I think—he asked for extended time, and it was paid then.</p>

I am a solicitor and registrar of the Denbighshire County Court, holden at Wrexham—I produce the file of pro<lb/>ceedings in the bankruptcy of James Gilbert Jones—the date of the prisoner's petition is 3rd June, 1890; the adjudication was on 7th January, and the prisoner is still an un discharged bankrupt—he was publicly examined on 13th January, 10th February, and 10th March—the examination was taken by a shorthand writer, transcribed, read to the prisoner, and each separate sheet signed by him. (<hi rend="italic">Parts of the shorthand notes were read</hi>)—I produce the order of the County Court Judge directing this prosecution; application was made to him <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi> at Wrexham----after the examination he made the order to prosecute upon the report of the trustee alone.</p>

"above the window—on 20th April there was a strike at his yard; I did not join it—on 20th April I took a cab out of the yard—about 8.45 p.m. I turned into the Strand; I was hailed by a fare, who told me to drive to Ludgate Hill Station—I was set on by about thirty cabmen, among whom were Taylor, Smith, and Hawkins; they called me blackleg, and followed me; I drove through Fleet Street, and after a deal of trouble I got to Ludgate Hill Station; it took me thirty or forty minutes to get from Charing Cross to the station; the crowd of cabmen pursued me the whole way, threatened to kill me, and tried every possible way to do so; they drove up against me, <hi rend="italic">jockeyed</hi> me and <hi rend="italic">chiveyed</hi> me—after leaving my fare at the station I came back to Fleet Street; Taylor, Smith, and Hawkins were waiting for me at the corner of Fleet Street and Ludgate Circus, and followed me—I drove to Bow Street Police-station, saw a constable, and</p>

               <p>I shouted out, and he came into the road and stopped the three cabs that were following me, and then an inspector came out and directed that the numbers of the cabs should be taken, which I saw done—I had known Taylor before by sight, driving a cab; I had never spoken to him; I knew his face—he was following alongside of me all the time, from the time I was shouted at in the Strand till the time I got to Bow Street; a little over an hour, I think—I saw him during the whole of that time—on my oath, Taylor is one of the men who followed me in the Strand, and whose number was taken at Bow Street—the prisoner is not the man, I am sure; he was not driving Taylor's cab that night—he was not stopped and his number taken, that I know of—Taylor does not resemble him in the slightest way.</p>

I have been billiard-marker at the Grapes, Gerard Street, between four and five months—I have known the prisoner using that house for six or seven months—I have known Taylor eight or ten months, I think—between seven and eight p.m. on 20th April I saw Taylor there; he came with his cab, and stayed there till about closing time—I saw him four or five times during that time, and between times he marked a game of billiards for me—the governor played—I did not see him in the billiard-room, but I saw him go upstairs to it between nine and ten—he stayed there half or three-quarters of an hour—I saw the prisoner at the house before Taylor came—I did not see him leave the house, but I know he did—I heard him talk to Taylor—I saw the</p>

Benson's—at the time I was arrested I had in my pocket eleven more of the letters addressed to different jewellers in London—at Aitcheson's and Benson's I received a little parcel—the one I got at Benson's I handed to George at the City News Rooms; the one I got at Aitcheson's I handed to the prisoner at the City News Rooms—when I gave George the one I got at Benson's the prisoner was there—I won't swear he saw me give it to George—he was on the premises—it was a diamond ring I got at Aitcheson's, and then I went to "Wales and McCulloch, and then I was arrested—the parcel at Aitcheson's was opened in my presence by the assistant, and he showed it to me, and put a little note inside.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 87, Arthur Road, Brixton—on 26th January last a man of the name of Foster, his wife and two children, came to stay with me—they left on 7th May—while they were there the prisoner came very frequently—I remember his bringing something to the house on 3rd April—I thought at first it was a toilet service; it was covered over with a sack; it was brought by the prisoner's younger son—I never saw what it really was; I imagine it was put in the front room upstairs—I never knew the Christian name of the Foster who lived there; his wife used to call him Will—he and the prisoner were very often together; the prisoner would come the first thing in the morning sometimes, and remain the whole of the day—he has been there certainly as late as eleven at night—I never went into the room while they were there together; I never tried to do so—I heard something going on in the room, a kind of filing or rasping, like some hard substance, and a kind of clicking or tapping—that sort of noise continued sometimes the whole of the day—Foster went on 7th May; his wife gave notice the afternoon before—I noticed a newspaper just before they left; it was dirty, it seemed as if by black lead—I thought at first it was soot, but I tried it with my fingers, and nothing came off—the night before they left a fire was made of a lot of paper and things.</p>

Are they in your writing?"—he said, "No; they are not mine"—I said, "Do you recognise the writing?"—he said, "I have seen the writing before on many occasions; I can't say where, exactly; it is very much like the Writing of my own son; I don't say it is so, but it is similar.</p>

I am cashier at the Princes Street branch of the Union Bank of London—on 16th June the prisoner presented this draft at the counter—I noticed it was a second of exchange, and asked him whether he was the payee Amos named in the body of it—he said, "No"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "From Debenham's auction-rooms; a man named Wood gave it to me there, and told me to come to the bank and get cash for it"—I referred to our advice-book, and found that the first of exchange had been paid on 19th May, which rendered this second valueless—on turning round I saw the prisoner's back passing through the swing doors on his way to the street—at the same time a shout was raised, "Stop that man!"—the prisoner was outside the bank door; our messenger brought him back, and he was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon at Talbot House, Hyde—I frequently attended the late Mr. Benjamin Ashton during 1889—when I first attended him, in April, he was very weak, suffering from the effects of kidney disease and diabetes, and he was a martyr to rheumatism—he was better when the warm weather came, and I did not see so much of him from July to November—I saw him at the end of November—he said one night that he had had a stroke, but I thought he had fallen, fainted; he had smoked too many cigarettes, I think—that was at the latter end of November, on an occasion when Mr. Burchardt and his mother had been—he had chronic rheumatism, and was ill, but not bedfast, at the time—the rheumatism was then chiefly in his hands, which were very stiff-and contracted; it was on both sides, but the right side was the worse—on Saturday, 21st December, he sent me a message, requesting me to go and see him, as he had got a fresh cold—I was in bed with quinsy, and could not go—he said if he went any worse he would immediately send me word—I had a report on Sunday, saying he had a cold, but I was not to go if I could possibly help, but I went at nine o'clock on the Monday morning, and saw him—he was extremely weak, and suffering from acute bronchitis and rheumatism; his hands were contracted—he was in bed in the first room on the right-hand side as you go in, where he always was, and where his bed was—I told him he was very seriously ill indeed—I saw him that day and the next—I was with him nearly the whole of Christmas Bay, up to nearly midnight, with the exception of about two hours in the afternoon—I am informed he, died at six o'clock on the following morning, the 26th—he was perfectly clear in his mind—on Christmas Day I saw there the prisoner, the male attendant, Maddock, a kind of housekeeper, Mrs. Williams, Swinfen, and Mr. Turner, a solicitor—I saw him sign some cheques on Christmas Day—he was lying on his back in bed, and Swinfen brought the cheques and put them on a book, and then a pen was put into his hand, which was taken bodily and guided—it was entirely passive in the hand of the man guiding it—the pen was across the palm of his hand—these cheques are similar to those I saw—his fingers were stiff and contracted, and the joints enlarged, and that condition of things had existed for weeks before—when he sent for me on the Saturday, saying he had a cold, it was purely out of consideration for me that he did not insist on my coming—he had been extremely weak for some days before I saw him—I should say that he would not have been able within forty eight hours of the time I saw him to, un<lb/>aided, jot down figures on a memorandum paper; he could not have written anything without help for forty-eight hours after I saw him, that is my opinion—he would certainly not have been able to be up walking about the place or looking after his books within that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Hyde branch of the Manchester and Liverpool District Banking Company—the late Mr. Benjamin Ashton had an account there for upwards of seventeen years—I was very well acquainted with him, from a business point of view—he used to come and see me at the bank—he was very careful and methodical in money matters—this pass-book of his shows his dealings with his private account at the bank—he had also a mill account at our branch, and there is a pass-book showing his operations on that account—both pass-books relate to the years 1888 and 1889. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to the witness speaking as to the contents of the pass-books, as he was not the person who had made the entries. It was arranged that next morning an examined copy of the account should be produced</hi>)—I heard of Mr. Ashton's death on 27th December, the day after it occurred—in the course of 1889 I remember communications coming to the bank as to how his cheques would be signed in the future—on 11th April I received a communi<lb/>cation from him, saying that his cheques would be signed by John Lynch, and were to be honoured—we acted on that till 27th May, when we received orders from him that in future we were to honour his cheques when signed by Cook and Swinfen—that continued till 6th July, when he directed that the cheques were to be signed by himself, and counter<lb/>signed by Swinfen; that continued till his death—this cheque on the Stockport branch, on which the word Hyde appears, is signed B. Ashton—I have searched through five years to see the way in which he has signed—during that time he has never signed or authorised to be signed any cheque B. Ashton—the latter part of his life he used to sign Benjshton—up to the spring of 1889, when Lynch signed, he signed Benjamin Ashton—he did not sign Benj. when he signed alone; he introduced the abbreviated form at the time he associated Swinfen with him—there were 884 cheques in the five years, and Messrs. Sharpe's had a few before—in no single instance was the initial used—no cheques were issued to him with the Stockport branch printed on them—this cheque was never presented at Hyde; if it had been we should not have paid it for three</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189106290053"/>
               <p>reasons, because it still remains a cheque on the Stockport branch where Ashton had no account, because his cheques at that time had to be signed and countersigned, and because being signed B. Ashton, it was different to the signature he was in the habit of using—when a cheque was not specified as being on the mill account, it was put to his private account; he invariably marked his cheques "mill account" if he wanted them to go to that account, but he put no memorandum when it was to go to the private account—these cheques, dated 26th and 28th December, were pre<lb/>sented and paid; the signatures are perfectly formal, and they are on proper forms taken from the cheque-book—that of 28th was paid by the executors' instructions—I heard of Ashton's death on 27th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If the correction from Stockport to Hyde had been verified by the signatures of Ashton and Swinfen, we should have paid it, provided the signatures were satisfactory—I never received business letters from Ashton—I have here two documents from him, only one is signed by him, and that is a receipt signed "B. Ashton"—his signature did not vary very much till he became cramped with rheumatism—he never signed a cheque "B. Ashton"—when he could write properly he signed "Benjamin Ashton"—it is not impossible that we should have honoured cheques signed "Benj. Ashton," because his signature never varied—he did sign "Benj. "occasionally; he never signed "B. "—the "Ashton "is always the same—we have a register of customers signa<lb/>tures, on which we pay—we have cashed his cheques when signed "Benj. "without special authority to do so, but we should not cash them if they had been signed "B. "Ashton.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We should look at the writing of any cheque brought to us, and satisfy ourselves as to the genuineness of the writing—I have not the slightest doubt that this cheque of 15th March is in his writing—before this cheque altered to Stockport could be dishonoured it must go to the Hyde branch; if that branch paid it they would do so on their own responsibility; one branch has no duty of paying another branch's cheques—when it got to Hyde it would be dishonoured for other reasons—if a client has authorised some one else to sign with him we cannot recognise his signature alone—I should think he had cancelled his own signature; his own signature alone ought not to be paid till his order was rescinded—if we were satisfied that the signature, B. Ashton, was that of our client there might have been no objection to paying the cheque, but this cheque did not satisfy us—we should not have paid it after these orders from April to the time of his death—after the order of 16th July a cheque so signed would not have been honoured—we should mot have honoured this cheque supposing it had been duly in order after we received intelligence of Ashton's death—a cheque received after the death of a man would be returned marked "Customer dead.

               <p>the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway claim—I was with him from about 12.30 till five—that was the last time I saw him alive—I think it was about 20th November; somewhere about the latter half of November—I received notice of his death on 26th December, and went to Pole Bank on 27th—I went into the room he used as his sitting-room, which they called the drawing-room; on the ground floor—I saw book sand papers on the table, and in other parts of that room—I am not certain if it was that day or later that I saw the mill books lying on the table; I think it was two or three days later I noticed them particularly, but there were papers in the room—I went on that day to the safe, which is on the same floor, and I looked through his writing-desk, which was in the safe Mr. Cook, one of his clerks, or Mr. Swinfen, I think, gave me a key with which I opened the safe—I took the desk out and just looked into it to see if there were any instructions as to his funeral, and if his will was there—I put the desk back and locked the safe with Cook's assistance—I kept the key of the safe and took it away with me—on the same day I went with Mr. Turner to the Hyde branch of the Manchester and Liverpool District Banking Company, and saw Mr. Hunt—I stayed in Manchester till the 31st—I was at Pole Bank one evening for a few minutes, and I went there on the morning of the burial (the 31st)—I attended the funeral—I saw the prisoner that day; I had never seen him before—I saw him in the large room at the side of the house on the ground floor, called the dining-room—Cook introduced me to him—he spoke of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire claim, and told me he was very anxious to see me, and he produced a letter from Mr. Boss, the secretary of the company, to tell me that Mr. Ashton had authorised him to try and settle this claim without going to law—he wished me to read the letter—I had not got time, and I just looked at it—he ex<lb/>plained the nature of it, and mentioned that he had been down to Long Barns, in Essex—I told him I was an executor under the will, and I could not tell him what we were going to do with things at Long Barns, but we must keep things going as they were—he said he had been in charge of the—place for Mr. Ashton; he told me he had done a good deal of business for Mr. Ashton, and in case I wanted any assistance he should be very glad to be of use to me if he could be so—he mentioned he might be of use to me round Pole Bank with regard to the mills, I think, and round there—I told him I was now in my position as trustee and executor, and I could not tell him what I meant to do; I could not give him any information on the subject; that things would have to be kept <hi rend="italic">in statu quo</hi> till I got probate of the will, and had power to act—he said it would be very advantageous to settle the railway claim without going to law—as far as I remember that was the sum and substance of the interview—he did not mention the existence of any cheque, or that he had any claim against the estate; he only said he had had business transactions with Mr. Ashton; he did not say anything about what they were—he never mentioned that he had any claim—I had had a letter from him, I think, a night or two before the funeral—I tore it up, it was only asking for an interview—I had to talk to Mr. Cook and Mr. Swinfen; Mr. Turner and a cousin of mine were there—I went from the dining-room, where I had been talking to the prisoner, into the drawing-room, my uncle's sitting-room—the prisoner was in that room, and I think Mr. Turner, and Cook and Swinfen were in and out; three or four of us were in the room at the</p>

               <p>that was said at that interview—there was no mention of the cheque or of any claim—about the middle of January I came to London—about the 28th January I saw the prisoner at Mr. Sharpe's office; he wanted to find out the prisoner's position; the prisoner said Mr. Ashton had proposed leasing the farm to him, and he made us a proposal to buy us right out; he wanted to know if we would sell—I think I asked him if he could pay cash for it, and he wanted to know if we would take pay<lb/>ment in Consols; and he said he had got a reversionary interest in the life of some person for £14,000; but it did not amount to anything—he never mentioned the cheque or the claim—I think it was in the first week of February, 1890, that I had determined to appoint a new manager to Long Barns—the prisoner had told me a bailiff was in charge of the farm, but I had left the prisoner in possession; I told him if he would keep things running on he could do so—about the first week in February we appointed Mr. Marshall as manager of Long Barns farm—I was present at the interview of 13th February, but I don't think I was present when Mr. Sharpe told the prisoner of that appointment—Mr. Sharpe went into the room, and spoke to the prisoner about it, and afterwards I saw the prisoner—I heard it was arranged between Mr. Sharpe, Marshall, and the prisoner that Mar<lb/>shall should take charge of the farm immediately, and the prisoner said he was going down on business to Essex, I suppose to inform the bailiff of the change—I had no conversation with the prisoner about that matter; I think I spoke to him for a few minutes about the railway claim—on the evening of the 14th I think he came to see me at the Hotel Metropole, where I was staying; he had returned from Essex, and mentioned having seen Marshall there—we had a long conversation that evening, and it was then he first mentioned about this guarantee for £1,200 and about this French lady—we conversed about Long Barns, and about the railway case, and then about Mr. Ashton, and then I think he asked me whether I had heard any reports about Mr. Ashton and any woman, and said he had seen Ashton in Paris in 1868, the Exhibition year, I think, with a Frenchwoman; and he asked if I had heard anything about it, and if Mr. Ashton had left his private affairs in good order—I told him his affairs were all in very good order as far as I knew, but I had put all his private books and all his accounts into Mr. Sharpe's hands, and the accounts in the hands of the accountants at Manchester, and that all the things would be put into order and arranged shortly; we had not been through them all at present—he asked me whether I had come across any guarantee at the Stockport branch of the Manchester and Liverpool District Bank, and I asked him the particulars about this guarantee, and told him I had heard nothing about it so far—he told me Mr. Ashton had guaranteed a sum of £1,200 at the bank, and he explained that he (the prisoner) had used this money to pay to a certain Frenchwoman for Ashton, and that he had used the guarantee in order that Ashton's clerks, Swinfen and Cook, should know nothing about the matter; that he had guaranteed this sum so that the prisoner should draw it—then he explained that he had paid sums of money to this lady on behalf of Mr. Ashton, one at Charing Cross and one at Newhaven; he did not mention King's Cross then—he told me he brought a document back from the lady and gave it to Mr. Ashton, who was very glad to get it, and destroyed it—I asked what</p>

               <p>the document was; he said it was a bond or settlement of some sort—I asked whether he knew the lady's name—he said, "No;" he did not describe her by any name—he said at one inter<lb/>view she had a youth with her—he made no mention then of two. boys—I said, not knowing anything about this guarantee, I should like him to communicate himself with my solicitor; that I did nothing without my solicitor's advice, and I wished him to communicate with Mr. Sharpe about the guarantee—he said the lady had received large sums of money from Mr. Ashton—I asked how much it would amount to altogether; and he put it at about £3,000; he had actually paid her £1,200, I understood, at those two interviews—I think that, was all the conversation—I said, "Good-night," and he went to catch a train—down to the 14th there was no mention" of a cheque or of a claim—he knew I had not settled the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire case; we discussed it that evening, but I knew nothing about it, I had left it in Mr. Sharpe's hands—the next morning I saw Mr. Sharpe, and told him what the prisoner had told me the previous evening about this guarantee—then this letter of the 18th February was written by Mr. Sharpe. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that they should be glad to hear from the prisoner that he had cleared off the overdraft for which the Manchester and Liverpool District Bank had given a guarantee on his account.

               <p>letter written by Maddock for the first time, as I saw the cheque for the first time—Mr. Jowett produced the letter by Maddock; it was on this piece of blue paper—I cannot remember much that was said about that—I cannot remember whether the pencil memorandum was produced then; my attention was mostly taken up with the cheque—I had seen a great number of my uncle's signatures, the signatures of his later life and former signatures—the colour of the ink and the signature of this cheque caught my attention at once; and the date of the cheque struck me too, from what I had heard about Mr. Ashton not being in a condition to sign cheques on the 23rd of December, within three days of his death—Mrs. "Williams was one of the women, I believe, who were employed at my uncle's house, Pole Bank, to assist in nursing him and other things, with Maddock—after that I did not see the prisoner again to have any conversation with him—under my instructions the guarantees were paid on the 19th of May, when I saw him at Mr. Jowett's office—this guarantee of the 20th December, 1888, for £300, is signed "Benjamin Ashton," and this is the other of the 15th of November, 1889, for £900; they were paid, as we were satisfied they were genuine—in the end this railway claim was settled for £2,000 on our behalf, and each party paid its own costs—the settlement took place last year—the probate of my uncle's will was £220,000, if I remember rightly, and there was some land also—roughly the gross value of what my uncle left was a quarter of a million sterling.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The railway company may have originally laid their loss at £30,000—I cannot remember how the letter of 24th December from Mr. Ross, the secretary of the company, to the prisoner was worded—he produced the letter, but did not read it to me—I read it afterwards—he was thanked by the company—I had heard rumours about my uncle in connection with women Before I went abroad in 1880; I was astonished when I heard of the large sums he had paid to the French lady; I did not believe the story; I had to pay £1,200 on the guarantees I did not connect them with the lady—I received the keys of the safe on 27th December from Cook, and from that day till the discovery by Oakshott I carried one key, and I think the other was in the safe—as far as I know I was the only person who had a key to it—when I saw the prisoner in the house on 31st December I had the key in my pocket—although he had seen me several times he never spoke about the documents—the copy of the alleged forgery was first shown me by Oakshott, who said he had taken it out of the safe—I did not see him find it—I think I told the prisoner at our first interview that nothing could be done till after the probate—I may have said at that interview that I did not know much about my uncle's affairs—on the 14th he asked if my uncle's affairs were in good order—the prisoner told me he had other matters of business to discuss—he told me that at the Woodley station interview, I think; and again at some other time he mentioned to me that I should find he had had lots of business with Mr. Ashton—he said there were other matters of business he desired to discuss with me; he gave me the impression they were quite unimportant—when I said my co-executor was abroad, and nothing could be done until after probate, that was not with regard to talking about business, but as to selling' Long Barns—I did not say I could not tell what my legal position was—I told him more than once that my brother, who was my</p>

               <p>co-executor and co-trustee, was away, and that made it rather difficult for me to do anything in the railway claim and the sale of Long Barne—I had seen Halstead once before for a few minutes; he was practically a stranger—we spoke about nothing but the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire matter before him—Mrs. Williams was called as a witness at the civil trial—she fainted three different times in court—Maddock left my service after the civil trial, at his own wish—I did not discharge him—he has not asked for a character—he told me he had employment somewhere in the neighbourhood round Stockport, I think—I don't know if Mrs. Williams is a tenant of mine now—I don't know all my tenants; there are a good many of them.</p>

I am one of the firm of Sharpe, Parker, Prit<lb/>chard, and Sharpe—we acted as executors of the will of the late Benjamin Ashton—I saw Mr. Burchardt from time to time after Mr. Ashton's death—I first saw the prisoner at my office on 17th January, 1890—he explained to me and Mr. Burchardt that he was employed by Mr. Ashton to manage the Essex farm, and that Mr. Ashton intended to give him some interest in it—the interview may have lasted half an hour—that was the only matter discussed at that interview—nothing was said about a cheque, or about any claim he had on the estate"; he made no claim of any sort—I told him he would be properly remunerated for anything he had done for Mr. Ashton, or for the executors—I think probate was taken out on February 7th, and I saw him again on the 13th in a separate room—I said I could not see him as anything but agent, and we had decided to appoint Mr. Marsham to manage for the trustees—that is the Long Barns property—I took him to the other room, and introduced him to Mr. Marsham, and they made arrangements about meeting at Chelmsford the next day, but nothing was said about a cheque, or about any claim on the estate—I had the railway company's claim before Mr. Ashton's death; there was an action against him, but they had not gone into the question; I wrote one letter to tell the solicitor who the executors were—I saw Mr. Burchardt Ashton the next day, or the day after, in conse<lb/>quence of which I wrote a letter to the bank at Stockport, and received an answer, in consequence of which I wrote this letter to the prisoner the same day.

               <p>and Charing Cross, and on two occasions she was accompanied by a youth who was so like Mr. Ashton that it was evident he was his son—I asked him to point out in the bank-book which were the items which had been drawn out for the purpose of payments to the lady, but he could not do so—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the book—I looked at the items and saw they were all small sums—in reply to my questions he said that Mr. Ashton gave him a cheque to clear the balance off; I asked if he had got the cheque with him; he said no, he had got it at home, and I could see it; I asked if he had got any papers to vouch the payments to the lady; he said he thought he had got enough at home to prove them—that was the first time I had heard of the cheque—I told him he had better consult a solicitor; I hardly knew what to say to him, I wanted to bring the interview to a close—about 15th March I received a letter from Mr. Jowett, en<lb/>closing an account from the prisoner—the prisoner handed me an account of the expenditure at Long Barns, and Mr. Jowett sent me another account of a further claim. (<hi rend="italic">This was for</hi> £1,000, <hi rend="italic">and cheque</hi>£375; <hi rend="italic">total</hi>, £1,375)—on the 17th I received a letter from Howe, written on the 14th.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have acted as solicitor to the late Mr. Ashton—he had a good many, I think—I made a will for him in 1879—I knew nothing about his banking account till after his death—he did not say that he had advanced the money out of his own business, or tell me he had begun to advance money in 1887—he did not tell me at that time that his banking account only showed a balance of £108—I asked him whether he had not assisted Mr. Ashton to sign cheques—my first conversa<lb/>tion with Maddock was on May 14th, 1890; the action had not begun then; he told me that this document was drawn up by him on the late Mr. Ashton's authority—he was a servant to the executors, looking after the house—I saw him next in London, when I took his proof, and he completely contradicted his first statement—I asked him why he had told such a lie—he said, "Because you took me unawares, and I did it on my own responsibility," and I think he said he had seen me with Cook and Swinfen on 14th May, and he did not want them to know about his having signed the paper—I think Mr. Ashton had no actual consulting solicitor, but went to outsiders to get advice; he cited a solicitor's name to me—I have made a great many inquiries about the railway claim, and no doubt the prisoner busied himself about it in Mr. Ashton's interest.</p>

I live at 175, New Land, Stockport—I was in Mr. Burchardt Ashton's service, and left on March 19th—I was employed by the late Benjamin Ashton from July, 1889, doing first some outdoor work for him for a day or two, some piece-work—he then engaged me as his per<lb/>sonal attendant—I did not sleep in the house, but I was there all day up to 6.30—that arrangement continued down to his death—he was very ill for a short time before his death; his hand was so stiff that he could not feed himself, and I used to feed him—on 21st December, the Saturday before he died, he was very ill in bed, and Dr. Tinker was sent for, but could not come—he had taken to his bed on the Wednesday or Thursday before that Saturday, and he was worse on Saturday—I left him in bed at 1.30, and did not go on Sunday—I went back on Monday morning and he was worse still—on that day Br. Tinker came—I did not see the prisoner-at Pole Bank on the Saturday before I left that I remember, nor on the Monday, or on Tuesday, the 24th; but I saw him there on the Wednesday, Christmas Day, in the drawing-room first, then in the hall, and then he came into Mr. Ashton's room, which he had made into a bedroom—he was in bed—he died on the 26th at 6 a.m.—I was there when he died—the prisoner came there on the day of the funeral, and I did not see him afterwards—on March 5th there was a sale at Apethorne Mill—I met the prisoner there—he said, "I was just coming up to your house, I want you to write a bit of a note for me"—I said, "Well,</p>

               <p>I am not turning back now "—he said, "Oh it will do at any time "—we parted; I was going to the mill, and he was coming out—I next saw him on 12th March at Trianon, that is another mill—there was a sale there; he said, "I forgot to come up; I will come at the first opportunity "—I was then living at Pole Bank—I next saw him on 19 March at Woodley Mill, which was another of Mr. Ashton's mills; he said he would come up at the first opportunity, and we went and had a drink—I saw him next on the Monday afterwards, the 24th, at Pole Bank; I let him in, and we went into the drawing-room—he said, "Have you ever <hi rend="italic">wrote</hi> me a note like this?" I said "Let <hi rend="italic">us</hi> have a look at it"—he showed me something, and I said "No"—he said, "If you will write me this it will be a good thing for you"; I said, "It would not be right for Mr. Burchardt," he said, "I will make it all right"; and then I wrote it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); he supplied the paper, it was blue paper, similar to this—this is what I copied it from—he said it was an old envelope of Mr. Ashton's—after I had written it he said, "If I get it I will give you something," and picked the papers up, this one, and the one he Drought, and took them away, and I left—on 14th May Mr. Sharpe paid me a visit at Colebatch, and questioned me—I believe I made a statement to him—I went to London towards the end of October or the beginning of November, and went to Mr. Sharpe's; I was sent for and made a statement to him—after that, in November, I received a letter from Mr. Jowett's office, and went to him at Stockport—I saw him alone first, the prisoner had not arrived—he asked me some questions, and showed me a document; he wrote my statement down, and went out and brought in the prisoner and read my statement to him—it was the statement which I have made here—the prisoner contradicted that I wrote the note by his direction, he said that I wrote it, and brought it down to his house; but I said I had only brought one into the house in my life, which was a note relating to the sale of the Essex farm—Mr. Jowett asked me what my expenses were—I said, "Fivepence," and he paid me—that was my railway fare from Woodley to Stockport—as I went down the street Mr. Howe followed me, and asked me what I had been and told him that for—I said, "Simply to tell the truth, and you know it"—he said, "Well, it won't do for you to go and tell them fellows that," and asked me to go back to Mr. Jowett's office and contradict my evidence—I said, 'No, I have given my evidence, and it won't do for me to go and tell two different tales"—he said, "They are not supposed to know how many notes you brought down; you are throwing me many a hundred pounds away "—I said, "Well, I can't help that"—he said, "You are just the man that can help it"—I said, "How?"—he said, "By going and contradicting your statement"—I said, "Well, I am not going to do it"—we then parted—that was at the end of November, and the next I saw of him was at the Court in London in 1891, when I gave evidence for the defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I wrote that document I was caretaker for the estate, acting in the interests of Mr. Burchardt, looking after the house—I made this note in his interest.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was appointed caretaker immediately after Mr. Ashton's death, and remained so during January, February, and March, and down to March this year, when I left of my own accord.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Stockport—I have known the prisoner since 1881—on Monday, March 2nd, 1891,1 was going towards the Teviotdale Station at Stockport, at 9.40 p.m. by the outside clock, and met the prisoner—I spoke to him; he turned back with me and went to the station, and had some conversation in the dining-room, in reference to an action I had brought against him for a client of mine for £300; the conversation lasted ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then I mentioned the case of Howe <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Burchardt—I had seen a report in the evening paper of what took place in the High Court, and told him it looked very black against him—he said it would be all right when Mr. Willis, his counsel, had replied, and I should see it in a very different light—I then said I had heard about the French lady nearly twenty years since, from a gentleman who knew Mr. Ashton very well; that Mr. Ashton had a woman whom he kept in France, and that was the only extravagant thing he did; and when he went to France he dressed in a proper way—(he used to wear clogs at home and fasten his buttons with a piece of string)—I got up to leave, and he said, "Have you got a promissory note of about 1887 or 1888 that you could let me have? "—I said, "No"—he said, "By Gosh, if I could get one I would get it signed and <hi rend="italic">do them another"</hi>—we then parted, and he arranged to meet me next morning at my office in relation to the action I had brought against him—he called there at 9.30 a.m. and said, "I cannot stop now, I have just received a telegram saying they have found the note"; he said he would call again—I said I was going to Manchester and could not see him if he did—he met me in Manchester on the Tuesday in reference to my client's action, and after we had talked over the business matters' he said that they had found the note, and it was dated 1888, and the stamp on it was 1882, and he had telegraphed to London that they had found it, and he had given it to his lad to send off—I said I was very glad if he had found it—I made a note of the conversation at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made the note at Manchester, but not of the con<lb/>versation of the previous day—Howe owed my client £300 and interest—the only security I had was a promissory note with an agreement to execute a mortgage—we discussed whether he should execute a bill of sale or not—nothing was said about cancelling the original promissory note which I had—by far the greater part of the conversation was about my client's affairs which he was mixed up with—I have known him to speak to since 1881, but I have known him by sight more than that—he told me he began life as a porter at a railway station, and worked himself up to stationmaster, and then became a coal-merchant—he is a respectable hard working man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The £300 was advanced on September 27th, 1889, and</p>

"—he said, "I have a cheque of the late Mr. Ashton's for well over £1,000 "—the first I saw of the cheque for £1,375 was at the end of 1890; Mr. Jowett showed it to me—£265 was paid in on December 27th, 1889, the very same day, and operated upon.</p>

               <p>case were placed before me to form an opinion upon them—the first was a photograph of the cheque of the 23rd December, 1889, 50,389, and a pencil memorandum on an envelope, as well as the contents of the envelope, a photograph of the conclusion of a letter said to have been dated January 26th, 1889, and the admitted writing of the late Benjamin Ashton; also eleven cheques dated between January and December, 1889, all purporting to be signed by Benjamin Ashton, some with and some without assistance, but the balance of them with—I also had thirty-five other cheques from November to December, 1889; sixty-seven in all, and a bundle of ten letters, and a post-card admittedly in the prisoner's writing, and my opinion confidently is that the cheque of 23rd December, 1889, is in Mr. Howe's writing:, and not Mr. Ashton's—the disputed signature has only the initial "B" for Benjamin, and Mr. Ashton signed his name in full on all the cheques except one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi>

I compared it with sixty-five signatures, but I found a difference in some of them because he was assisted—the signature on the cheque of April 4th, 1889, is the first shaky one; it is signed Benjamin, and on April 9th the instruction for the codicil is also signed Benjamin—those two are shaky, but appear to have been written without assistance—in the six following cheques his hand was guided by Frederick Swinfen, and they all have "Benj.," not "B" only; here are forty-one cheques preceding the disputed one where the signature has been guided, and all have "Benj. "(<hi rend="italic">The witness handed the documents to the Jury, and pointed out the points of similarity between the prisoner's admitted writing and the cheque</hi>.)—in my opinion the writer of the signature must have had the actual copy before him—I believe Mr. Howe wrote the cheque; that is only my opinion. (<hi rend="italic">Pointing out particulars in the letters "B," "s," and "n," the last stroke of the "n" being always imperfectly formed in the prisoner's writing</hi>.)—that was not a characteristic of the deceased, but it appears in the signature of 26th January, 1889—in the assisted signatures I did not find the prevailing characteristics of the old man's writing as when he wrote unassisted—if a person holds your hand and writes your signature, it will bear some of the characteristics of the-person who holds your hand—I have formed the opinion, from the documents before me, that the endorsement, the memorandum outside the envelope, and the memorandum inside are not in the writing of the deceased Benjamin Ashton—this "T" is like the "T" in "Turner," this "H" in "Howe" is like a "T," and the long dash after the "e." agrees with that in Howe in signature No. 1—I am comparing them with undisputed samples of Howe's writing—the "P" in "Private" on the pencil memorandum finishes just in the same way as that in Parkhurst, Page, and Parker—the finish of the "P" in "Private "on the envelope is just the same; there is just a loop and a down stroke, and the "B" in "Bills" in the pencil writing agrees with the "B" in "Barns" in Howe's writing.

               <p>of the cheque, but these are not my points—the "3" in 23 and the "3" in the memorandum are not totally distinct—in the "23" in the memorandum there is a little stroke before the "3" begins, and it is there in the other, but it is very faint; one is done with pencil and one with ink—7 is usually made by one operation of the pen, but in this "1375 "the pen has been lifted at the bottom of the first down stroke of the 7—you can scarcely tell that the 5 in the memorandum is a 5; it is totally distinct from the 5 in the cheque.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner, and was assistant to the divisional surgeon of police at that time—by the inspector's request I examined the prisoner on 20th May about 2.15 a.m.—Mr. Stacey was there—I came to the conclusion that the prisoner is a person of unsound mind, and filled up the necessary forms for his removal to the workhouse as a lunatic.</p>

About a quarter to five on Tuesday, 2nd June, I was on duty in Birkbeck Road, Leytonstone, and met the prisoner hurrying round the corner of the Birkbeck Tavern out of Union Road—having just heard a policeman's whistle, I stopped him; in his struggle to get away, this box with six cigars fell out from under his coat—when I and another constable were taking him to the station we passed the prosecutor's shop—the window was broken—I found this piece of brick inside the window, among the boxes of cigars—at the station fifty-eight cigars were found in the prisoner's pocket.</p>

She was a drunkard. I am truly sorry I am in such a position; I had known her upwards of thirty-six years; I never knocked her about in my life, only this last performance.</p>

I live at Coombe Farm, East Greenwich—I am a market gardener—I have known the prisoner seventeen or eighteen years—I have employed him many years—he left my employment two years ago—on Monday, 15th June, about 2.15 p.m., he came to my shed and asked for employment—I told him I could not employ him—he said, "You made it rather rough for me when I was in Australia"—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "You have been writing to Sadler and Miller"—I said, "Who are Sadler and Miller?"—he said, "You know all about it"—I said, "I do not understand you; you must be mad"—he abused me, used bad language, and became threatening in manner—in consequence of that I said, "I shall go and fetch a policeman; you are not fit to be at large "—I went out of my shed, followed by the prisoner—I saw a policeman in the Ferndale Road, standing at the corner of the new police-station—I beckoned, and he came to me—we followed the prisoner, who had gone on in. front—when we got within three or four yards of him he turned suddenly, produced this revolver, and fired two shots at me and the policeman—he took too high an elevation and fired over our heads wildly—he looked wild in his eyes, and seemed very excited—I was afraid of him in the shed, because I believed him to be insane, because of this letter I had received from him. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was from the Coffee Palace, King Street, Melbourne, of September</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd, and complained of not having seen Annie Smart, and stated the writer was coming by steamer to England in the name of J.

I am an engineer of 92, Wellington Street, Woolwich—on June 14th, between 12 and 1, I was going down Beresford Street, and saw four men whispering outside the Music Hall; I knew them, they proceeded about twenty yards and then stopped and whispered again—the prosecutor crossed the road a few yards ahead of them with a soldier, who walked with him twenty or twenty-five yards—the four men went over to the prosecutor, and the prisoner said, "God blind me, do you want to fight?" putting himself in a fighting attitude and hustling him, and the other three closed in by the lamppost, and the prisoner held the prosecutor with his left hand and gripped his throat with his right hand—the two taller men helped themselves to the prosecutor's watch and guard, and took everything out of his pockets while he was on his hands and knees—I <hi rend="italic">bared</hi> well in, but seeing the soldier ahead I thought it was a get up for me, and I shouted out and they ran away—the prosecutor was dazed; I pinched his arm and shook him, and said, "Pick yourself together, my man, I will stick to you," and insisted on the soldier coming back—I gave a description of the prisoner at the station—I had known</p>

I am potman at the Palmerston—I knew the prisoner as a customer there; I also knew Hickey—about half-past twelve in the early morning of 22nd April I was standing outside the public-house, and saw Hickey and George Dymond leave the house; they went towards the side door of Mrs. Conrath's, the baker's shop—Hickey wished me good-night—he put his hand in his waistcoat pocket, and took out his key or something that answered to it, and opened the door with it and went in—he then seemed to turn his back to the passage, and then I saw a flash of</p>

               <p>fire, and heard the report just inside the door, and the deceased came from the passage saying, "lam shot, I am shot"—he came into the road; he did not fall to the ground—there were two constables immediately on the spot—the prisoner came from out of the door on to the footpath—he had a double-barrelled pistol in his right hand, and an open knife in his left—he was seized by the two constables—I heard him say, "I shall not try to get away; it is for love "—Constable Hamilton took the deceased into the Lord Palmerston—I followed, and remained with him until he died, about ten minutes afterwards—after that I went to the Police-station, and there saw the prisoner detained in custody—he said to me, "Hallo, George, cheer up, you do look sad; what is the matter with you? how is Jem, how is Jem?"—I said, "Poor fellow, he is dead; you have killed him "—he said, "How long was he dying after I shot him?

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe he was perfectly sober—I had seen him before, I never had the pleasure of speaking to him—I saw him on several occasions; I only knew him by sight—I had only known Hickey since he had been in London, two months—I had been very intimate with him during that time, on Saturdays and Sundays, when we had time to go about together; we drank together very little—I generally leave off work at five or half-past—I was engaged every day until this occurrence, in regular employment—on the 21st I first saw Hickey at eight in the morning, as I was standing outside the Lord Palmerston, he was outside the Palmerston; I could not say whether he had been in, he did not go in with me—I did not see him for long at that time; he went one way and I another, because I was at business—I next saw him in the evening at nine, outside the Palmerston; I could not say whether he had been in—I did not go in then, I could not say whether he did, I did not stay with him long—I had business—I met him again at eleven inside the Palmerston, and remained there till closing-time—during that time we were both taking refreshments, very small—we used to go there occasionally of an even<lb/>ing—I never saw the prisoner there, I could not say how many others were there between eleven and half-past twelve—I had no drink with Dixon the potman; I am quite sure of that, only with Hickey, nobody else—I live at 4, Duppas Road; that is in the opposite direction to Mrs. Conrath—I went across the road with Hickey, because he invited me to go over, he was going away to Liverpool the next morning, and my usual time of going to work was six, but I was not going till eight; he asked me to go to the house—there was no necessity for me to go with him to steady him in any way; being friends, of course I accepted the invitation, I did not know whether I should see him any more, as he was going to Liverpool next morning—I was on the threshold of the door when he put the key in; the door is right on the pavement; it is not a very big door—the keyhole is on the right, the door opens inwards, I was standing on Hickey's left hand—I saw him put the key in the door—he pushed it wide open, as far as it would go, and he never let go of the door—he was not right in front of me, he was half turned to me, he had his right hand on the key, and at that moment I heard the report—I was not able to see where the report came from, it all happened of a sudden.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The wound was between the fourth and fifth ribs, about half-way down the back, close to the spinal column; that would be very nearly in the middle of the back—it was a wound that would be caused by the bullet going rather sideways—it was on the left side of the spinal column; it had been turned by striking against the fourth rib—the direction it took was upwards and outwards, and, of course, forwards—it had pressed the apex of the left lung.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, carrying on business as a baker at 49, Lucy Road, Bermondsey—the prisoner was foreman baker in my service, and had been so since July, 1890—he lived in the house—I had been on intimate terms with him—the deceased, James Hickey, was my cousin; he came to stay with me about 25th February last—for a time he and the prisoner were on friendly terms—after my cousin had been in the house two or three weeks they quarrelled; it first began on Saturday night; I heard it—it was from something that the prisoner heard</p>

               <p>things would never have been so annoying, or he would not have got so excited; he said I ought to have turned my cousin out when he first came—he said, "You have yourself to blame for my leaving"—I said it was not likely I would turn my cousin out of the house for him or any<lb/>one—nothing more was said; he went away—he did not come to my room for anything except to bring up the cash-box—he wanted inter<lb/>course with me, and I would not let him; I forbade him—it was after that that he made use of the expressions I have mentioned about my cousin—he asked me if I would he friendly with him again, and I said no, not after so many insults as he had given me; for he had a great many times provoked me—I then went to bed and went to sleep—I was awoke by the report of a pistol; I instantly got up and went down into the street, and there saw the prisoner in custody—I asked him what he had done; I did not wait for an answer from him; I went across to the public-house.</p>

I keep the Commercial Coffee Tavern, Lower Tooting—at a quarter-past eleven on the night of 21st June I locked up the shop, and secured all the windows and the doors, and went to bed, taking the keys with me—about one o'clock next morning I was awakened by the inspector telling me there was a man in the house—I dressed and went down into the shop, and found the prisoner in custody of a police-sergeant—during the three weeks I have been there I have given the prisoner a small job for a meal, putting boards down in the cellar—I asked him what he was doing and how he got in, and he told me he got in through the board under the window; it had evidently not been removed for some months, because there are cobwebs on each side, and he could not have got in that way—he said he should be rather surprised if was going to charge him; he came through for a rest—there is a cupboard behind the bar—the prisoner had been in my shop from about seven to nine p.m. that evening, and was sitting on the last seat, and could see where I put my cash in the cupboard temporarily—the cupboard door was open when I got into the shop—I said, "Who has opened the door? I closed it when I went</p>
