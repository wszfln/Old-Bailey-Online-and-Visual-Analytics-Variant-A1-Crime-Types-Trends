On Sunday Morning 16th April, about 2.45, I went with Peek another constable to the garden of 431, Mile End Road, there was a man in the garden sitting on the step of the house—he was either unconscious or asleep—I shook him ank rubbed him till he came to—while rousing him the prisoner came in at the front gate, 2 or 3 others were with him—he wanted, to know the number of the house—I asked him what he wanted to know that for, he said he insisted on knowing the number I told him it was 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—seeing that he was drunk I requested him to go away and not interfere with me in the execution of my duty—I asked where he lived, he said "Here" I said "If you live here, go in and hen I shall see he the Said that he lived higher up—I said Where" he said "In Jubilee Street," I again told him to go away—he then caught told of the man we had in eustody to pull him away—Igot inside the gate when the prisoner struggled with me violently—I had my gloves on and finding I could not hold him I slipped my right hand glove off and was in</p>

               <p>the act of putting it in my pocket when the prisoner struck me two severe blows, one over the left eye and the other on the nose, rendering me insen<lb/>sible—I fell; when I got up I saw the witness Roney bleeding from the mouth, I was bleeding profusely from the nose and eye—I then saw the prisoner running away I sprang my rattle and the witness Butler ran after him and caught him—Peek also released the man he had in custody and went to Butler's assistance, and they brought the prisoner back—he struggled violently to get away, and I struck him once with my staff—I have since been attended by Mr. Morrish and have been off duty ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can't tell whether he had anything in his hand when he struck me, I saw nothing I con't say how long I was insensible—this occurred on the gravel alongside the pavement—I fell on the gravel just by the kerb—I have not been right since—I don't know what I did when I went to the station—the prisoner was drunk—I struck him with my staff because he had got away once from Butler, and he struggled so violently I thought he would have got away again—I did not hif him very hard—I did not hurt him—he never complained of it at the station, and there was no mark on him—I hit him on the head, I did not hit him as hard as he hit me by a long odds—a good many people collected about.</p>

I live at 6, Chaiinelsea Court—on the morning of 16th April I was in the Mile End Road; I saw Peek there—my attention was called to a man lying on a gentleman's doorstep—Horne came up after<lb/>wards, and he rubbed him and brought him to—he was bringing him down the garden to lock him up for being there for an unlawful purpose, the pri<lb/>soner and two others came up and asked Horne what he was going to do with him, he said to lock him up for being there for an unlawful purpose—he told Horne that he lived in that house—he said if he did why did he want to know the number (he had demanded the number)—Horne brought him up to the door and turned his bull's eye on it, and then he said "I will lock you up for interfering with me in the execution of my duty"—the prisoner then turned and knocked Horne down twice, and afterwards he knocked a woman down in the path and ran away—I made after him and caught him, he got away, I captured him again and gave him into custody to 604—Horne struck him him once with his truncheon, but not very heavily, he was very violent and used threatening language to me—he was very excited—I don't know whether he was in liquor—the blows he struckr Horne were very hard, I should not like to have as hard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Kent House, Bow—I was at the station-house when, Horne came in—he had a wound, over the left eye brow about three-quarters of an inch long—both the nasal bones on the bridge were fractured and displaced—I replaced them; there was an immense amount of swelling ou both sides the nose, which was twice its natural size, and there was a good deal of blood—he was also suffering from conoussion of the brain, he did not know what was being done to him when he came into the station—he was in most extreme danger, I have been constantly attending him ever since; he has been unable to resume duty indeed he is barely able to come here now—I don't know that he will ever be able to go back to duty—the extreme seriousness of the case other than its remark<lb/>able violence was hardly shown till twenty four hours afterwards, when he became delirious for two or three nights—since then the more urgent symptoms have subsided, but he has now all the symptoms of a severely shaken nervous system, constant headache, and he cannot rest at night and all his bodily functions are upset.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He had been unwell previous to this, and had only resumed duty about four days; he had caught a cold in the diseharge of his—duty, and that was succeeded by a cough—I should not call him a strong man by any meaus, he is not consumptive—I should doubt whether such an injury could have been inflicted with the naked fist—I have been of that opinion all along, and have said so—the man must be an exceedingly powerful man to smash the nose as he did—the prisoner is a very well-knit man, he is an engineer—the injury to the eyebrow might possibly be cansed by a fall on he gravel, but there was no gravel about the weund, and I think the man fell on the flat of his back—a man struck on the nose would be more likely to fall back than on his face—I, happened to be at the station attending to a wounded prisoner when Horne was brought in, he staggered in and had to be accommodated with a seat—his head is bound up to relieve the throbbing, not for any wound.</p>

I am a stationer and paper dealer at 115 Rodney Street, Walworth, and Fulwood's Rents, Holborn—I do not know either of the prisoners—I was in Cheapside on the night of the Prince's visit to the City—I saw the prosecutor with some rugs or cloaks beneath his arm pushing his way towards Guildhall—he turned round and said something to Preist and struck him on the nose, and Preist struck him in the eye, the prosecutor seized him by the collar with his right hand and holloaed it "Gentlemen's servants to the rescue police I will give this man in custody for assaulting me and Preist said "Let go of me" and the persons standing round said "why not let the man go you struck him?" he said "I shan't, he has assaulted me" and he kept holloaing out for gentlemen's servants to come to the rescue—he threw the cloaks on the ground—he did not fall at all, he was grasping this man all the time by the collar, the pair of them were struggling together—there was a young girl there with her father and mother, and she picked up a coat and held it till the prosecutor and a policeman came and the prosecutor snatched it from her—I only saw the coat, he had the others beneath his left arm he never let go of them—he was decidedly intoxicated—he said nothing about charging the man with robbery—I thought it was simply an assgult—I went to the station that same might but they would not listen to me they turned me out—I saw the case reported the newspaper on the Thursday, and on Friday I went to the Mansion House, the clerk directed me to Messrs.

I am a waiter in the service of Mr. Beaumout, in King Street, Long Acre—I also work at the skating rink—about 11.30 on Monday night, 24th April, I left the rink, with a friend; I parted from him at Compton Street and came on by myself to King Stree—I met the prisoner in Earl Street, I knew him—he asked how—I was getting on—I answered him And went on, and when I had got a little further he comes with some other fellows and <hi rend="italic">catches</hi> hold of me one by my neck and one from behind and unbottoned my waistcoat and took my watch and the prisoner put his hands in my trousers pocket and took my money; one of them squeezed my throat so hard that I could not call out—I went home to my masters and next day I saw the prisoner in the bar, I went out got a policeman and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>).

Mr. Bethel—our inquiries then were about a firm</p>

               <p>called Baxter and Co., who carried on business at 27, George Street, Chelsea Market—their alleged business was corn, potato, and provision dealers—in the course of that inquiry we apprehended four persons, White, the two Carruthers, and a girl called Florence Nuth—they were convicted here last May, with the exception of White (<hi rend="italic">See Vol.</hi> 82 <hi rend="italic">page</hi> 67)—I found at 27, George Street a number of bags containing sawdust in the front parlour—there was no appearance of legitimate business being carried on there—Florence Nuth lived on the premises—we could not find the person there who took the premises, but he has been found since, his name is Charles Nuth—the business was carried on in the name of T. Baxter—in the course of our inquiries we found that another business was carried" on at 6, Oxford Market? in the name of Byrne and Son, and we had many complaints in reference to that business—I know of goods beng forcibly removed from there by the police and being sent back—I was present at the May Session last year when Nuth and the Carrutbers were put on their trial, and Browning, Baxter and Renouff also; they were convicted; I heard them tried; the charge was obtaining—by false pretences and fraud—I have seen the writing in which, the conspiracy was carried on and know it as the writing of J. Baxter and Byrne and Co., and in my judgment they were the same writing—Smith and Renouff carried on business at 16, High Holborn, those were rooms—taken for the purpose of receiving letters only—they were horse dealers and general agents for the purpose of the purchase of cattle—I have sail that I have seen Browning go there, but from inquiries I have made since I I had rather withdraw that statement—the business of George Johnson was carried on at 776, Old Kent Road as corn dealers and general merchants, and another business was afterwards carried on in the name of Robinson at 21, St. John Street, Smithfield, as meat salesman, poultry dealer, and pro<lb/>vision and general merchants, and they had a room at Adelphi House, Strand to receive letters—I apprehended the prisoner Houghton on 7th March last at Buttesland Street, Hoxton, and told him he would be charged with con<lb/>spiring with J. Humphries, a prisoner in custody, and others, in defraudiug people in various parts of the country by purporting to carry on business at Chelsea Market and other places, 16, High Holborn, 6, Oxford Mar<lb/>ket, and 50, Barbican, in the name of Baxter and Co., Smith and Renouff, Byrne and Son, and J. Robinson—he said "I am very sorry, I have been led into <hi rend="italic">this by Jim Humphries and others</hi>, all I did at Chelsea Market was to fetch the letters for which I was paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week," and he said "All I did at John Street was to take the shop, for which Humphries paid me," and that he had taken goods from both places and did not know where they came from and he got very little for them, but that Humphries was the prime mover in the whole affair—he further said that he had tried to get away from this business, but that Humphries was continually persuading him to assist in carrying on these frauds—I had assisted Inspector Sayer and Ser<lb/>geant Roots in apprehending Humphries the day before, and saw some thou<lb/>sands of documents found in his lodging—he was living there in the name of C. Parry—there were a great number of newspapers, directories and other papers—I do not know by whom the shop in Oxford Market was carried on.</p>

Robinson, you said that you never heard the name, you would not get off the omnibus and I said that I would pull you off if you did not—I never threatened your wife—I had watched you at the news rooms copying advertisements largely for some time—I went into a public-house and found your wife drinking with a little ginger-whiskered chap and brought her outside—am I bound to answer these questions?—the man is not here but he is in custody in Newgate—he told me that he had been led into frauds by you, and it was only by getting you given in custody that he could escape from you—I watched him into Charles Street, Knightsbridge—he took me there in order that he might escape from you; his motive was to get you apprehended that he might escape from your toils—I had not arranged with him that your wife might be decoyed from home that I might gain possession of the papers—I told him to come to you and tell you that the detectives were after you—Ringer has not absconded from his bail, I saw him yesterday afternoon—I shall not say whether the little carrotty man was Frank Hall—I rang the bell and he opened the door—I had to pretend that I was a friend of yours before I could get the door open—I did not then rush upstairs, I spoke to him, and he at once admitted it, and said that you had let him into it—I found nothing in your possession connected with any firm, except one paying-in book of the Provident Bank—it is not possible that I wrongly heard what took place, because he repeated it several times, and sat down and cried till he was nearly broken hearted—there was a long conversation, I was there half an hour—when I had finished my evidence at Bow Street, Houghton said something, and I believe he denied what I had said—he said that you were the means of preventing his getting an honest living—I did not put Ford in the box because Mr. Vaughan stopped the case and said that his time was engaged; and it was not for me to put witnesses into the box—Mr. Wontner had charge of the case.</p>

I have been two years and a half making inquiries about other frauds in different parts of the country, and I know a great deal about them—I never saw any writing of Houghton's except in a copy book at his lodgings, in which he was learning to write—his writing is very imperfect, he is a most illiterate man—I found a lot of bill heads and memoranda and all kinds of writing, but I do not think I ever saw any of Houghton's writing—we had some conversation at the door, and I told him I must go up and search the place; he said "I am very sorry for it, my name is Houghton, I took the shop for Humphries, I was paid to do it"—he also said that he had been led into it by <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> Humphries, who was the prime mover—Houghton had been in the employment of Messrs.

               <p>that he was at Hardings', a bonnet shop, but I do not know how long—I know that Houghton and his wife kept a beer-house for several months, they left it in September—when a person goes into a beer-house, the police make enquiries as to his character—he has to give his address and a reference where he has been working, and I believe in the case of trans<lb/>ferring a license to another person the Inspector at the Sessions would make his report as to the character of the man—Houghton has lived in that district almost all his life, but I do not know how many addresses he had.</p>

I am a checker in the employ of the Great Western Railway, the line by which goods from Glamorganshire arrive in London—I know Smith well—I remember some sheep's carcases coming to the station from Mr. Vaughan of Glen Neath, in several consignments to Baxter and Co.—Smith came in a cart and took them away—he brought me a delivery order—I have not got it here, but I have got the sheet—Smith came for all that were not delivered by the railway—he has also come there on seven or eight other occasions for goods for Baxter—that was during October and November, 1874.</p>

In November, 1874, in consequence of complaints, I was set to watch these premises at Chelsea—I saw railway vans deliver carcases of sheep and pigs and other goods there—sometimes there would be two vans there in a day, and that was continually going on—the goods were taken away in a cart by the prisoner Smith—I have seen about seven people come to the premises, some of whom have been con<lb/>victed—I believe I have seen Smith there three or four times—I saw Houghton there every day, but not taking away any goods, and I have seen Humphries outside while a man, who has been convicted, was in the shop—I have seen goods in the shop while he was there and come while he was there, but not go away—I was once in the shop after the first batch of pri<lb/>soners were apprehended; the only real business I saw done there was the woman next door buying a few potatoes occasionally—on 10th November, 1874, I saw a cart there with nobody attending to it; I waited there till a man, who has been convicted, and the defendant Smith came out of the shop; I then said that I was well aware of the nature of the business car<lb/>ried on there, and that the name on the cart was illegible; Smith, to the best of my recollection, said "I get my living honestly, I am a licensed hawker," and the name of Henry Smith, 15, Ossulton Street, was given me by the other man, Alfred Carruthers, but I did not see the licence—I saw three pigs' carcases taken away in the cart that day.</p>

Robinson represented himself as a salesman in the Metro<lb/>politan Meat Market, and knowing that the gentlemen there were respect<lb/>able I thought he was an honest man.</p>

                  </hi>. On 25th April I was lodging at 57, Euston Square and sleeping on the third floor—the prisoner lodged in the house—he is, I believe, a surgeon—on 25th April, at 2.10 a.m., I was aroused by a fearful noise in the next room as if a per<lb/>son was insane, and the alarm bell was ringing; there is alarm bell in each room—I went out of my room and heard more noise—what gave me the impression that some one was insane was hearing the carpets pulled up and the china knocked about, as if a per<lb/>son was in a state of frensy, quite a maniac—I do not think the china was broken, but I heard the furniture knocked about—I heard a rush to the door and I believe Dr. Grimes opened his door and came out into the passage—I then went into my room and shut the door—he shouted for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour and made a fearful noise—I went down to my sister, who has a room on the lower floor; we went out, called the police, showed them up to the" prisoner's room, and I gave one of them an iron bar.</p>

On 25th April, about 3.30 a.m., the last witness called me to 57, Euston Square—I went with Hackett up<lb/>stairs to the third floor back room—I knocked at the door and the prisoner, I believe it was, asked who was there—I said "Police"—he said "What do you want?"—they had told me that he was a doctor, and I said "The land<lb/>lady of the house is very ill down below, she wants to speak to you;" that was done to get him to open the door—he said "I shan't come, you must get some one else"—I said "If you don't open the door I shall break it open"—he said "I shall set fire to the place and blow it up"—I then heard a rumbling noise and a cracking, and the females said "For God's sake, break the door open, he is setting fire to the place"—I swelt a fusee—they brought me an iron bar and I broke the door open—the room was all upset and I knocked my shins against a bath—the prisoner was there behind a mattrass, it was reared up on its side, and as soon as I got inside he said "Stand!"—I said "For God's sake, do not!" but he fired at me—the ball struck against an iron bar, cut a button off my coat, and glanced against the wall of the room and I found it afterwards—I went down below to get more assistance, and when I got to the first landing the prisoner came out and said "Oh, I have finished the b——"—the constable brought back Sergeant Pearson and a man named Starter—Starter went in first—they tried to paoify him by talking to him quietly and he seemed very calm then—I went behind the mattrass and behind him and seized his arms—he passed the revolver from his right hand to his left and fired four shots at random; he could not fire straight, because I was holding his arms—he said something to the sergeant about a dark man mesmerising him—the first shot, I believe, hit Sergeant Pearson, and the second as well—I cannot say as to the third and fourth, as I was struggling with him—I afterwards found two shots in the room which exactly fit the pistol, they are in copper cases before they are fired.</p>

I live at 18, Humter Street, about 4.15 on the morning of 18th April, I was called to see the prisoner and found him suffering from a slight wound on his nose—he was very much agitated, and evidently labouring under a delusion—I said "Have you been drinking?"—he said "No, I have had nothing but a bottle of Bass's ale, but I have not had any sleep lately," or "for several nights, and I took some opium last night, but it did not give me any sleep"—he was very discon<lb/>nected in what he said, and I believed he was labouring under a delusion—he said that a mesmerist was downstairs below him who was trying to throw him out at the window by force, trying experiments, and that there were wires from the room below to his room, that he was cutting those wires, and while he was cutting them he was interrupted, and that he was sorry he had shot the policemen—he said nothing about a man in black—I have seen several cases of delusion, and to the best of my judgment he was suffering under delusion at that time, he was evidently insane—if I had been examining an independant patient that was the conclusion I should have come to—I did not observe any appearance of drink—opium when it has not the affect of causing sleep is a terrible irritant, and has just the contrary effect—in my judgment appearances which at first sight might be like those of drink might be brought on by opium.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner produced a written defence, slating that on the Sunday evening preceding the occurrence he felt very unwell and went to bed earlier than usual, but failed to get any sleep and got up at 6 o'clock and took a dote of opium to see if it, would compose him, and knowing that I or 2 grains had no effect upon him he took</hi> 4 or 5, <hi rend="italic">after which lie became more restless, and during all Mon<lb/>day did not feel it safe to venture into the street, but remained at home all day and went to bed at</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">o'clock, but could not sleep, having an idea that somebody below was making him an experiment for mesmerism or electro biology; that he then felt the preliminary, symptoms of an epileptic fit and shouted out "Stop that devilry, I will have no more of it;" that he had some recollection of rushing at the bell wires under the impression that he was being influenced by them, and thought the room was filling with vapour sent through the floor, and tore up the carpet, and put the mattrass on the boards to prevent it coming through and threatened to fire through the floor; that when the door was being broken open he fired at the thick part of it above the lock to deter' the man from entering, having no idea that he was a policeman, and that the other shots were fired accidentally in the struggle, and he expressed his sorrow that he had been instru<lb/>mental in inflicting injuries upon men against whom he entertained no malice.</hi>

I was nineteen last July—I—was never connected with a transaction of this kind before,; I swear that—I was at the Standard Music Hall when a barman robbed the master—I had nothing to do with that; I was not accused of having anything to do with it—the name of the master at the music-hall was Mr. Bunt—I was not questioned a word about it—I cannot tell you, the name of the barman who was charged—it was for stealing a marked sixpence and a shilling, I believe—there was once something about a watch and chain; I was not there then—I was not accused; a man was who used to work for a fishmonger; I was not questioned about it—I believe the watch and chain were given up; I do not know who gave it up—it might be two years ago—I think the watch was stolen in the stalls—I was potman there at the time—I was once taken' to the Westminster police-court for stealing mould; never for anything else—I was never accused of stealing a watch—I remember about three months before this, when in the prosecutor's service, a box with money in it being missed by one of the barmaids—I was questioned about it—the box was afterwards found in the house, and nothing more came of it; it was found in one of the barmaids' boxes—I would have stolen. Mr. Watson's cash-box myself, but Robins stopped my doing it—I mentioned it to Robins because I wanted some money; I thought he would go shares with me—Robins cross-examined me at the police court; he asked me about the box, that is all—he did not ask me about anybody else employing me in the matter; I swear that—he said "Wasn't it you who first proposed to get the cash-box?" and I said "Yes"—he did not ask whether I proposed it to Watson—I have never been in Court before; I have never done anything like stealing a cash-box before; I never committed a theft before, only taking mould from Lady Dacre's garden; I forgot that—I have no idea bow-much there was in the cash-box—I was in the service six months—I do not know how often the money was counted; I do not know that it was counted up every night—it was not done in my presence before I went to bed—I will swear I did not see it filled every night with the takings of the day.</p>

I was sent for to the Queen's Head on Wednesday, 3rd May, at about 9.30 in the morning—I examined the premises; the tap-room is separate from the main building—it is one Story—there is an open yard outside the tap-room, and an area, and a door leading from the front of the bar into the yard—I also examined the window of the bar parlour—the bar parlour is part of the main building, divided from the public parlour where the business is carried on—my attention was directed to a white calico blind in the bar parlour which was covered with soot—I noticed the fastening of the window frame—there were small scratches between the two sashes; I should think they must have been recently done—I closed the window and operated on the outside of it, and found it could be opened very easily by the catch being slipped back with an ordinary pocket knife—a person coming from the tap room and crossing the yard could very easily enter the parlour by the window—there was a desk close to the window, which was pointed out to me as the place where the cash-box was kept—I traced soot from the bar parlour window over the wall into the next premises, and then came to a hoarding; there were still traces of soot there—I got over the hoarding, which is about 6 feet high—I examined the tap room chimney, and found soot leading from the tap room to the bar parlour window—I had had no statement made to me then of a man having concealed himself in the chimney; it was for my own satisfaction—I found a slight mark in the chimney, as if a toe had been against it, leaving a white mark behind it—there is a place 5 or 6 feet up the chimney where a person could sit back very easily—I did not get up to see—I could see the soot had evidently been disturbed—I took the charges against Watson and Humphry—Watson was taken in custody first and Humphry afterwards; on Thursday; Watson was taken about 12 o'clock in the day—I don't know what money he had on him—Watson was present when Humphry was brought in—Humphry did not make a state<lb/>ment in Watson's presence—as soon as the charge was taken and he was about to be removed to the cells, he wished to make a statement; he was brought back in consequence of that request—I have got the statement here—he signed it—there were no traces of soot except as I have described, from the tap room to the window and the window to the wall.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read: marked E</hi>, 20/2/76.—"Dear Sir, I make no question you could be of service to me, the question is, will you? The solatium I offer is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

(<hi rend="italic">The warrant was for conspiring with Vance to murder a person unknown.</hi>) The other warrant has the name of Quarll in it—I read both the warrants to her—I have three warrants, they are worded in a different way—I am not sure which of these two I read to her—after reading them she said "I have not harmed any one, and did not intend to harm or murder any person; I have been very weak and ill and I meant the drugs for myself, and I intended to have them by me in case I was ill again, but the powder I received smelt so hor<lb/>rible I could not use it, the other in the bottle I poured away, and broke the bottle. I sent the powder back the same day as I sent the post-office order, and that I intended for the trouble I had given the person who answered the advertisement I had put in the newspaper"—I am not quite sure whether she said the "Daily Tele<lb/>graph" or not—she said "I have never seen the person"—I said "I must search for letters"—she said "You will not find any, I have destroyed them all, even the blotting paper"—I saw this diary on the table—I turned to look at it, and she said "That is my diary," and she called my attention to one or two entries that she had made in it—she said that she had been very lonely after her husband left, and if it had not been for the sister-in-law who had been stopping with her she should not have known what she should have done—I do not remember which were the entries she pointed out; they did not appear to me to be of any consequence at the time—several leaves of the diary are turned down—on two of the leaves I found the impression of. the name of William Quarll, it is very plain on one; they are about the dates of 31st January and 9th February—I only see one now—I took (her to the station and she there gave the name of Ellen Snee—I produce a copy of the "Daily Tele<lb/>graph" of Friday, 18th February, also some letters which I received from the post-office authorities upon the Secretary of State's warrant—I opened them in the presence of the Solicitor to the Treasury—there are six altogether, but one envelope contains several—I also received a "Globe" newspaper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 49, Brady Street, Bethnal Green—I know the prisoner Vance—I first became acquainted with him at the latter part of August last, I engaged him to assist me as my <hi rend="italic">locum tenens</hi>, to take my practice while I was away for a few days—I understood that he had completed his curriculum and that he was preparing to go up for his M.D. examination some time early in the year—he was introduced to me through a medical agency—he acted for me very satisfactorily for ten days in August—he came to me again for a week at Christmas, he then acted as my assistant—he returned again on 22nd February for two days, on the 22nd and 23rd—I knew his address, 59, Euston Road—while he was with me he had access <hi rend="italic">to my</hi> surgery and to the drugs in it, in the ordinary way—I have frequently seen him write—to the best of my belief this envelope marked B and the letter contained in it marked A are in his handwriting—my house was formerly No. 53, Brady Street, it is no 49. (<hi rend="italic">Letter A read;</hi> "59, Euston Road, N.W., Wednesday. My dear Sir,—It occurs to me I may not have very clearly explained my suggested <hi rend="italic">modus operandi;</hi> one thinks of many things pertinent after closing the letter for post. Referring to your note of 20th, I must say there is risk of discovery with whatever mode of death; for the registrar requires notice of 'cause of death' from medical attendant. Should this be not forthcoming, an inquest, and in all cases of sudden decease, an inquest. If a person die under unnatural or suspicious conditions and the matter hushed up and no inquest, this implies the distinct connivance of friends. But you desire to have your friend or friends igno<lb/>rant of any premeditated design and no doctor called in attendance, under these circumstances there must ensue a coroner's inquiry. My plan is this: Sudden death allowed, or apparently suspicious death acknowledged, still a favourable verdict may be returned which in no way can invalidate a will made antecedent to death, probably many weeks. The peculiarity of my suggestion is that although the actual cause of death is found out, and that a narcotic, yet the verdict will be the most lenient, viz., 'By misadventure, or as it is phrased sometimes more specifically' The deceased was in the habit of taking chloral, and died from an overdose incautiously adminstered by himself.' I can arrange details to 'square' with this and submit them to you at our meeting, or on paper. If you like, chloral might be administered to a <hi rend="italic">dog or cat</hi> or you might try yourself an ordinary dose, and be thereby cognisant of <hi rend="italic">the bond fides of the agent.</hi> Upon mature consideration, I know of no more feasible method. The cases of the poisoners, Pritchard and Palmer, both doctors were ingenous, yet they were detected. They lived before these chloral times. As an anatomist and medical jurist, I altogether frown on any attempt to excite arterial rupture, &amp;c., and am willing to adduce reasons. I would desire this for several reasons (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) to get rid of the affair, have it off my mind, which is natural and necessary; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) I am expecting to be summoned to Liverpool any of these days to meet my brother-in-law, returning in a sailing vessel from San Francisco; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) a cousin of mine, <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> for Hamburg, is coming to 59, Euston Road, to stay a few days, and if I be not at Liverpool next Tuesday I want to be at his service. I write this letter at 53, Brady Street, Bethnal Green, E., where I am since yesterday doing full duty for Surgeon Mannering. We have a surgery here and I have access to the drugs, bottles, and labels, &amp;c. I return to Euston Road to-night and will have a supply of the drug. If you adopt my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187605290051"/>
               <p>theory we might arrange to meet, and then take leave of the subject. You can select your own fit time. Expecting a reply.—Believe me, Sir, in confidence, yrs., W. K. V.—M. Q." I also believe this letter of 12th April, 1876, with the initials W. K. V. to be in Vance's writing, also this letter of Thursday, 12.30 at noon, in the same envelope marked F. (<hi rend="italic">These letters were read as follows: Envelope addressed</hi>"To be called for, M. V., 149, Kentish Town Road, Post-office, N.W. April 9. Dear Sir,—I cannot thank you enough for the admirable way in which you have managed everything. My niece knows nothing of your being a medical man. I have given her to understand you are something of a virtuoso, and that the box contained impressions from antique seals, <hi rend="italic">also that I owe you a great deal of money.</hi> I am inclined to think that the chloral will be perfectly satisfac<lb/>tory. I should like to know if there is any likelihood of its strength evapo<lb/>rating, especially in the corked bottle It is possible that this may get somewhat wasted with sniffing and experimenting, and that a further supply may be necessary, but I will, try not. Supposing I do not give the dog his, a portion of it diluted would, I suppose, do for me in every sense of the term. Is a portion of it equal to six teaspoons full of the labelled bottle <hi rend="italic">quite certain</hi> in its effect? If you can assure me of this I shall not want any other me-diam, except, perhaps, a drop or two of prussic acid in a tiny phial in case of failure with the dog-; but that I can let you-know. I think I had better get a little oil of peppermint at any ordinary chemist's. Tell me what quantity will suffice. I shall be in the City early to-morrow, and will post your fee whole, after drawing it out. I do not think there is any danger, and you will want it for your holiday, perhaps. Don't forget the bill. I can trust my niece to see it paid, but you may have to wait six months after the event. This lovely weather has given me great desire to see one particular spot of country in the North for the last time. I think I shall start on Tues<lb/>day afternoon and give myself a week's holiday. This may defer the event till Easter Tuesday or Wednesday, but cannot make much difference to you. Tell me in your next if the Euston Road address is good for six months.—Yours most faithfully, Wm. Quarll. In what way is alcohol a poison? I have somewhere met with the following passage: 'Arsenic will not destroy life so quickly asalcohol, for the former has to decompose the structure of the stomach, whereas alcohol directly assails the principle of life in the nervous system." "59, Euston Road, N.W., 12/4/76. Dear Sir,—I notified to P.O., K. T. Rd. (149), that I received your letter, Monday. But I feared to reply to the old place lest you thought of changing your address. I hope this may not cause unpleasant delay. The prussie acid is quite ready for post, and as for the essence of peppermint, you will find some three or four drops suffice to flavour, and neutralise odour. Alcohol kills like chloral—both are narcotic, they in<lb/>duce sleep and simulate apoplexy. Sometimes apoplectic folks lying in the street are taken for dead drunk. My full name is William Kingston Vance. Let my address remain, 59, Euston Road, N.W. If you keep the solutions corked carefully they evaporate little. The dog's portion would do you, the full half of it is sure to be effectual. Your own share is diluted, and doubly so, for having found that the fluid rushed about in the bottle (filled more than half) and made a noise when the packet for your niece was shaken, I filled up the bottle with water. Let the label remain, but (should you use your own solution) take <hi rend="italic">two good tablespoons.</hi> It might be a good plan, having abstracted <hi rend="italic">your dose, before swallowing</hi>, to pour in some clear water, but not to <hi rend="italic">the extent of filling</hi>, for if the solution were found very strong and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187605290052"/>
               <p>undiluted, suspicion were aroused. You understand you may employ either bottle. If the smaller, abstract a full half, and then pour in a little water. If the larger, abstract two tablespoonfuls, then pour in a little water, Whichever bottle you use. throw the other away, and let the bottle you employ be left on the mantelpiece or table, not hard by the bed. Let no specimen of my writing, save that relating to debt, be found; and let all around you remain in usual condition, to imply absence of design. The entire affair is to show <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> accident." "April 13th, 1876. Dear Sir,—The vile weather on Monday, and a sharp attack of rheumatism pre<lb/>vented my visit to the City, or to K. T. until this morning. There I found your card. Please reply to, and return last letter (also this) to M. V. 149, K. T. Road. I have deferred my week's visit to my native place until the weather is more propitious. The remittance only awaits your further advice. Do you wish it sent to Euston Road? I missed your letters much, Can't you tell me about the alcohol, and draw out the bill I spoke of to you?—Yours faithfully, William Quarll." "Thursday, 12.30 o'clock, noon. Yours received. I will go with this to Kentish Town Road, 149, and drop it in <hi rend="italic">immediately.</hi> I am anxious to have remittance <hi rend="italic">to-day.</hi> Bank holiday to-morrow. Can you send by some trusty person to me at this address I You might wire if you think proper. I should so like the money directly. I shall write again and enclose bill, and send the prussic acid—Very truly, W. K, V.") This envelope marked G and the letter contained in it I also believe to be in Vance's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Will be called for." <hi rend="italic">Envelope addressed</hi> M. V, Post-office, 149, Kentish Town Road, 59.13/4/76. My dear Sir,—I had expected you would have received with the card written Monday my little letter penned last evening. This last, as the former, simply explains delay on my part. You did not renew address, so I feared to risk any more letters, left at a post-office 'to be called for,' after the his<lb/>tory of the first batch. You will agree this is a natural scruple. I thought I had given you to understand that my address remains as now. If better I can make my address, Care of Dr. Fuller, Oswestry, Co. Salop, or Dublin. For I only came to England three years ago, and only came to town six months back. If any hubbub were excited about my 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would be unpleasant if I made out a bill dated five years back, and if it turned out I but lately came to England, and that I'm so young in the profession. Why not let it stand so; the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is a loan from me to you. The sum lent, say in 1874, when I was in Oswestry, or 1875, when I was in Guernsey. You might in your will, and the body of it, direct the loan of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be returned without interest as soon as executors have paid immediate debts, or within six months. I might hold in your own writing a promissory note, and a letter alluding to the transaction, and among your papers a letter of mine might appear showing evidence of a loan. I fancy this plan is better than the bill. A 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. medical bill would imply attendance on a long and tedious illness, of which there would be no evidence, and no evidence certainly to connect me with you as attendant. I presume you mean a medical bill. If you mean a trader's account—well, I have never had any trade association. But I might appear as a private lender. Will you think over this, and say what you consider advisable. I might hold a receipt of payment of some 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the assured loan, or the loan might stand at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of which 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. have been paid, and of which the remaining 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is to be paid with all other various claims.

Indeed, I should have been off again to-day but for the delay in this matter. I returned from the Black Country on Wed<lb/>nesday morning, to be on the spot, and give the affair earnest consideration. I shall be off as soon as I again hear from you.

My dear Sir,—When you go to 149 for your letters (if you have not gone already), you Trill find I have been diligent in explanation since receiving your last, which assured me of your address. I hope you are satisfied with my reply. I trust your attack of rheumatism is fully passed over, and that you can now enjoy a holiday. I have spent only a fraction of a holiday. I had an agreeable evening in the Black Country Tuesday, but returned to town principally at the instance of our mutual affair. I could hardly enjoy a trip with this matter hanging over me. I had hoped for a letter Satur<lb/>day. I suppose there will be no delivery to-morrow (Monday) morning. But surely I shall have an answer by early Tuesday morning. I think the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note carefully addressed to 59 is quite safe, we can trust to the theory of probabilities. If you reply Tuesday early, I might get off to Wales Tuesday afternoon. I, of course, will furnish you with my address there, and be happy still to answer any letters from you. I expect to be absent six or seven days, then to return to this private hotel, where I remain. It seems to me, should you desire to change place of letter receiving, there is the poste restante General Post Office and at Charing Cross. You could have an assumed name on the envelope I send you, and on giving name and place and where from expected, you immediately are handed a letter. I have the prussic acid packet ready, and will send it immediately on. Receipt of your next. What a pleasing change the weather has assumed.—Believe me, my dear sir, very cordially, W. K. V.")

               <p>some time at the beginning of the year—I cannot remember one in particular; I sent an envelope to the Dead letter office, about the end of March—we always keep letters a month—I remember its being returned from the Dead letter office, and sent back again—after that Mrs. Snee came for a letter—I don't know whether it was that one, but it was one that had been returned to the Dead letter office—she asked if there were any more letters and a letter was given to her; I don't know which letter it was—I don't know when it was; she said something about what the initials were, but not to me; I was busy at the time—she said the letter would be addressed "M. Q," or "W. Quarll"—I remember her coming to the office on 1st April, she inquired for letters that had been returned to the General Post Office—there were none for her at that time and she left—she came on the Monday or Tuesday and asked if the letters had been returned from the General Post Office, that she had written for them—I said they had not been returned yet—she said she would come again; she came again on Wednesday, the 5th—there was one letter for her then and that was given to her—she opened and read it—she said it was from the General Post Office, and it was all right, the letters were destroyed; she said on each occasion that her letters might be addressed M. Q., or W. Quarll—that was the last time I saw her; I think a post-card was—returned with the rest of the letters to the General Post Office.</p>

                  </hi>. I practice at 50, Parliament Street, I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and Lecturer on Forensic Medicine at the Westminster Hospital—on 25th April, I received from Inspector Clarke, a quantity of drugs, amongst them a bottle of Corbyn's that has been produced—I could tell by the smell that it had contained chloral—liquid chloral, if taken in a strong dose is destructive to life—I should say a full ounce was quite certain to destroy life—this bottle would contain equivalent to I oz. of solid chloral—to the best of my judgment and knowledge the half of it would cause death—the effect of a fatal dose of chloral is that the patient passes away and leave no trace of having been poisoned, beyond the symptoms of. coma and great sleep; we should not find anything upon a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination to communicate the precise nature of the thing which had caused death, except by an analysis of the" contents of the stomach, then it would be possible, if we analysed recently, by distillation to get the volatile particles of chloral which would be the same were it, either chloral or chloroform; it is very quickly absorbed, it would be impossible to find it except upon a very complete examination,. shortly</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187605290060"/>
               <p>after death—in the box that was brought to me I found some prussic acid in these two bottles—here is 1oz. sold in a wholesale condition, and 6 drachms in an unlabelled bottle—I have tested it, this is the dilute prussic acid of the British Pharmacopoeia, from four or five minims to a drachm of that would cause death—here are 8 drachms and 6 drachms, fourteen altogether—a smaller quantity than a drachm might produce death, but a drachm might certainly—there is enough in these two bottles to kill fourteen people—I found no chloral except the empty bottle—there were 46 grains of strychnine—from half a grain to a grain of strychnine is poisonous, a grain certainly would be fatal—it would not be sold to the public in this form, the medical preparations of strychnine are made from that—I also found 2 drachms 25 grains of bi-chloride of mercury, corrosive sublimate, that is a deadly poison; from 2 or 3 to 5 grains would cause death, even less, say from 2 to 5 or 10 grains—I also found a large quantity of laudanum, a bottle of powdered opium, morphia and tincture of bella donna, those are all poisonous, more or less.</p>

I have no list of the drugs that were given to me; I have them at my house, they are ordinary common drugs, a large quantity—I picked out the poisons from a very large quantity of drugs—each of these poisons carefully and properly administered are such as medical men employ continually—there were forty or fifty different kinds of drugs in quantities, varying from a few grains to a considerable quantity—it would fill three or four sheets of foolscap to enumerate them, they were simple kinds of drugs.</p>

               <p>and he ran after me and said he would give me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he did, and I handed him the bag—he asked me questions about where I got the goods—he knew where I was employed—he used to buy goods there, and he had seen me there acting as salesman—I used to serve him with the same sort of goods as those I sold to him—I should know the price of such things—the police came to me at my master's premises and took me in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barge builder, of 273, Westferry Road, Millwall—on the morning of the 29th April I missed a stack of timber from a barge lying alongside my premises—it was safe over night—I also missed other property which was safe over night and which was worth from 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I missed the things the first thing on the Saturday</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187605290070"/>
               <p>morning, and about 2 o'clock the same day I went to the prisoner's premises in company with George Reed—I saw some planks outside the house which were mine, and inside the house I saw a quantity of paints, oils, varnish, turps, nails, felt, and such like things used in the trade, which belonged to me—the value of the property inside the house which I claim was about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said to Reed, in the prisoner's presence, "If this is my felt three pieces are perfect and one imperfect"—that was before I laid a hand on them—I also found three pieces of timber that I bad missed six weeks previous; I knew it by the initials on one piece, and the other was apiece I had cut myself—a portion of the property is here—the prisoner was present at the time I made the search with the constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate "All the planks came from Mr. Lash, he supplies many large builders"—they are ordinary planks—I said that I recognised the paint by the tins, they are Fitzgerald's tins; they are used by many large builders—I identify one of the planks by its having been lined and marked out the night before for the men's working—mine are waterside premises, and the prisoner's also—he is a publican and a barge builder.</p>

I live at 8, Albert Place, East Greenwich, and am a barge builder in the prosecutor's employ—on this Saturday morning that the things were missed I went in search of them—I found some planks at the King and Queen Stairs, in the five footway in front of the prisoner's public-house, at 8 a.m., or it might be two or three minutes past—I went into the house and had something to drink, and I saw the prisoner take a can of green paint upstairs through the bar parlour, from the pothouse or kitchen that was alongside, I recognised it as my master's property—I saw cans of oil and nails standing in the corner in the lobby or kitchen, which<lb/>ever they term it—I recognised them as the things I had missed—I have examined the things since and can speak to them as my master's property—I gave information first to the police at Rotherhithe and afterwards to my master.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This receipt was dated December</hi>, 1875.)

I live at 13, Jamaica Level, Bermondsey, and am delivery foreman at Wilson's Wbarf, Tooley Street—on the 23rd October List I delivered into the tugboat Andrew 165 ingots of tin—this ingot has the same marks upon it as they had, and our own mark; in fact, this is one of them.</p>

This is a warrant for the full complement, 165 slabs—that is a slab (<hi rend="italic">referring to the ingot</hi>)—the weight of the entire quantity was about five tons—I do not know anything about the quality of metals; it is not a part of my trade—the "mark I refer to is "Brisbane;" that is the place where it comes from-we get a good deal from there in the course of the year, not all with that mark on it; there are several brands—I don't, know what "T.M.C." means; it is generally that brand, the Brisbane brand—I think it means some mining company—there is our mark here of "283 draught;" that corresponds with the warrants—a draught represents five slabs, weighing so much—there ought to be five slabs marked "283;" the five slabs so marked would altogether make up the amount put opposite them here—when the ingot was stolen it had not that gaping hole in it; I cannot exactly say when that was. done; I think it was done for the analysis—there is a witness here to prove that I never saw or heard anything more of this metal after it was stolen from the tug boat, until five months afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am coachman to Mr. Monday, of Eastbourne—he had a quantity of hay, more than he wanted, in October last, and by his direction I advertised 40 tons for sale in the "West Sussex Gazette" with my initials—application was to be made to Messrs. Smith &amp; Son, at the Railway Station, Eastbourne—I received this letter in answer—a letter was written by my master; I saw him write it—afterwards we received this other letter in reply—in consequence we had about 180 trusses of hay cut and trussed and sent off on the 12th January, I think, to George John<lb/>stone, 776, Old Kent Road, from Berwick Station, which is about eleven miles from Eastbourne—in consequence of these documents, we sent to the same address a quantity of black oats, about 10 quarters, on the 18th Jan<lb/>uary about 150 quarters, altogether—my master had purchased them—this bill afterwards came down—my master took it to the bank—upon this I came to London, I think on the 4th February—I went to Johnstone's house, 776, Old Kent Road—I did not find him there—I called again three times, but did not find him—I then communicated with the detectives, Kimber and Fox—I afterwards went to Ringer's place about the 13th or 14th February, at Southgate Road, Hoxton—I saw some black oats there; nearly a sack: some close to the door outside; not any hay—Fox asked if he had any dealings with Johnstone, 776, Old Kent Road—Ringer said "I have had dealings with Johnstone; all the hay and corn came from Johnstone's"—I asked him if those oats outside the door came from John<lb/>stone—he said "Yes"—I said "Have you any more?" and I understood him to say he had not—I asked him to allow me to weigh the oats, and he gave me half a gallon to weigh them in—they weighed 2 lbs. and a quarter good weight—there are eight gallons to a bushel—I said there were from 371bs. to 381bs., and I believe they were the property I sent for my master—he said again they were what he had from Johntsone—I looked inside the shop and found underneath some white oats, eight or nine sacks of the same sort—I asked him about the hay, and he said he had sold it—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187605290091"/>
               <p>I said "These are more of the same oats?"—he said "Yes"—what I have stated is the nature of my interview at his house. (<hi rend="italic">Documents handed to witness.</hi>) These were received by my master—I believe them to be my master's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector M</hi>). I received information of the alleged obtaining by false pretences of this hay and corn—I saw the last witness, Baker—I obtained a warrant and went with Baker to Ringer's Place, 43, Southgate Road, Hoxton, where he carried on business—I saw Ringer in the yard adjoining his house—I went in through the gate from the street—goods can be delivered into his yard from the street without going into his house—I read the warrant to him and told him there was a man named John<lb/>stone in custody for the same offence, George Johnstone, of 776, Old Kent Road (it is the Johnstone who lived at that address and who has committed suicide or died since this charge)—Ringer said "I know Johnstone and I have had many dealings with him"—I asked did he buy any corn or hay from him lately—he said he had bought from him 6 or 7 tons of hay and 20 quarters of oats—I said "Have you any documents in your possession relat<lb/>ing to that transaction?"—he said "I have not"—I said again "Have you any bill, receipt, or invoice for the oats or hay?"—he said "I have not"—I said "Have you got it in your possession now?" the oats and hay—he said "I have sold them"—I said "Have you paid Johnstone?"—he said "I gave him a cheque on account, for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "It is some time since this trans<lb/>action took place, has that cheque been returned from your banker's?"—he said "No, it has not"—I said "This has been a large quantity, can you tell me any one to whom you sold it?"—he said "No"—after a moment or two he said "I sold some of it to a carman named Briley in Bermondscy"—I said "You acknowledge buying 20 quarters, those 20 quarters were in forty sacks, can you show me a single sack they were sent up in, belonging to Baker"—he said "No, I have not got any, they were shot in my shop when brought here"—I then made the remark that there was no space to shoot oats, not enough to shoot one, much less forty—there was no space, it was a remarkably small shop—he said "That is all I can say to you"—we did not find any of the hay upon the premises—we found nine sacks of oats—this was the 11th February—I looked round his premises and found in the shop covered carfully over with sacks, seven cases of champagne—his name was over the door and "corn dealer"—I found a chest of tea or a half chest, 50 lbs. or 52 lbs.; also several pound or half-pound packages of tea—I found in the loft over the gateway 500 sacks in bundles, there was no name upon them—I found a very large quanty of fine barley there and a large amount of corn beans—I counted twenty sacks in one place of the same quality—I found also a sack lifting machine, three or four barrels of cyder in the yard, and a very large amount of miscellaneous property belonging to a corn dealer—I asked him how these things came there and he said he knew nothing whatever of the champagne, it belonged to his son—he said "I sell tea"—we were then standing at the counter in the shop and I said "You have no weights or scales to retail or sell tea"—he said "I sell it in packages"—I said "Even packages would require weights and scales"—then he said shortly "I know nothing more about it"—I took him to the station, and he was charged—he said previously he had had many dealings with John<lb/>stone—on this occasion he said "This is the first dealing I have had with Johnstone and I am sorry for it"—he was taken before the Magistrate and remanded—I know the place of George Johnstone, 776, Old Kent Road, but 1 have never been in it—I asked for his books, the only one I found on him or on his premises I have here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) he had no day-books, cash-books, or ledgers—I could only find a cheque-book and a large number of receipts on a file, they are here—I said "For a man who carries on a large business, where are your books"—he said "That is all the books I have."</p>

There has been no charge against him for the champagne and the tea, nor the sacks—I saw the receipt produced at the police-court for the champagne—I found a great deal of corn of all descriptions, such as I should expect to find in a corn dealer's shop, who is doing a large business—the greater part of the shop was crowded with sacks—there were not nearly 5,000 sacks in the loft, but 500 in bundles—there were many hundreds—I do not know whether you would term them sea bags—they were not what was used for oats—I have got them—there was a great quantity of carrots on the premises—he may have purchased carrots when in business, to the amount of 20 tons per week—I did make inquiries, but only of one or two persons, and ascertained that he had been in business for forty years—I knew he was a salesman in Spitalfields Market for years—I was told twenty years—the yard was a large one, and there are partitions put up which form out of the large yard two smaller ones—I did not see horses there—I saw cabs and vehicles there—I re<lb/>member seeing two cabs; I knew they were Ringer's property—I found a van with his name upon it; such as a corn dealer would have to use in the ordinary course of his trade—I have ascertained that he was in the habit of keeping as many as five and six horses sometimes—I cannot say that he had four or five horses about this very time; he might have had—I have little or no doubt—Baker was with me in the yard; he did not keep close to me the whole time; in the yard he did—he would hear all the conver<lb/>sation I had with Ringer in the yard—when I read the warrant Baker was close enough to hear what he said—we all three went into the shop—I really could not say whether Baker went in first, or me—Baker said he saw a sack of his master's corn outside the door—he said "Come outside and I will show them to you"—what they said then I could not hear; there were two saoks outside the door, one of white and one of black oats—Ringer said "I think I bought those also of Johnstone"—he is a man over sixty living at the shop with his wife—he told me he paid one cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I remember Mr. Partridge asking if he could get that cheque, and on the next occasion his producing it; the cheque is dated 21st or 31st, it seems to be altered; there were two other cheques produced—I saw a receipt produced for the oats and hay before the Magistrate—there is a cheque for the 25th, and one for the 31st (<hi rend="italic">examining</hi>)—Idid not go into Johnstone's place, Kimber did—I took all these nine sacks of oats—I did not ascertain that a quantity of these very oats were sold by Johnstone to a Mr. Wood, a corn dealer—I ascertained that some were sold by Johnstone to a Mr. Clark—I should say Clark was not a respectable man—these oats were taken possession of by my directions—they have not been returned to Mr. Clark—they are stored at Mr. Wood's; I believe by Baker—I do not know Clark—there is no charge against him—he gave them up to Baker.</p>

May, baker and corn dealer, 1, Guildford Street, Portland Street.

                  </hi>. I am a carriage builder, of 7, Upper St. Martin's Lane, and have been there thirty-seven years; the whole premises are mine, neither Francis or Turner occupied any part of them to carry on the busi<lb/>ness of a wheelwright there; I have never known them as wheelwrights—Turner called on me before August 28th, we were then having in eight or ten loads of green ash plank from Luton, in Bedfordshire—he looked at it, and I said "It is of very prime quality, but it will not be useful for a couple of years"—he said that he had some fine dry planking he could sell, and asked me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per load for it—I told him that it was excessive; I made a bargain for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then went with a gentleman for five weeks through France—I came back on 1st October, and found that during my absence a quantity of timber had been delivered.</p>

I am accountant to the Birkbeck Bank, South<lb/>ampton Buildings, Chancery Lane—this cheque signed "Francis Ralph Hall" was issued from our bank—the prisoner Hall had an account there—I was present when he gave instructions about opening the account on January 17th, 1876, and also on 3rd April when he drew out the balance—20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in to open the account and about 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. since; 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether is all that has been paid in—on 8th March, when this cheque for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was pre<lb/>sented, the balance in the bank was only 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—other cheques for larger amounts were presented, between January and April, which had been drawn against his account, and they were brought to me to see that the technical answer was correct.</p>

I have known Shaw by repute for some time, but the first time I knew him as Shaw was in February last—I have seen Hall several times—on 21st February, in consequence of com<lb/>plaints, I went to 37, Charles Street, Hatton Garden, and saw a young man in the shop, who Shaw afterwards pointed out as his son—he gave me the name of Thomas Haws—we had some conversation, but nothing material—two or three days afterwards I again called, and walked straight into the back parlour, without knocking; Shaw was sitting down eating his dinner; he jumped up and said "What do you want?"—I said "Mr. Haws, I think?"—he said "Yes, that is my name"—I said "Is this your shop and business?"—he said "Yes; who are you?"—said "I will tell you presently; I want to make some inquiries about this place; I wish to know who is the prin<lb/>cipal, and what his correct name, is"—he said "It is my business, and my name is Thomas Haws"—I said "Do you know a young man of the name of Frank Hall, who is (or was) connected with this shop?"—he said" Yes, I have known him some time, but I do not know where he is now; he owed me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and handed the shop over to me in lieu of payment"—I told him who and what I was, and pointed to the young man who I had seen there previously, saying "That is your son, I think?"—he said "Yes"—I said '"'I know him as Thomas Shaw, and not as Thomas Haws"—he said "Thomas Shaw is his correct name, but I told him to answer to the name of Thomas Haws; he has lived with me at 163, Great Dover Street, Borough, but he now lives with me at 142; New Kent Road"—we then went to a. public-house to have something to drink, and I told him I was surprised to see him in a shop like that; he said "Well, the shop is not mine; I bought it for my son-in-law, whose name is Haws"—about the beginning of May I apprehended Shaw at 661, Old Kent Road, and told him that he would be</p>
