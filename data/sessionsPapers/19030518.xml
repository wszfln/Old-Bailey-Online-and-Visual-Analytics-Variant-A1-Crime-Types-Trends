                  </hi>. I am a paper seller of 94, Cromer Street—on April 27th, about 11 p.m., I was standing outside the Wellington public house, Argyle Place—I saw the prosecutor walking with a woman, and four men walking some little distance behind them—she then signalled to the men with her finger, and came back towards them, leaving the prosecutor on a step the men then came up to him and knocked him down, and tore his coat off him—I saw Sucker put his hand in the prosecutor's left pocket—I shouted "Police," and Sucker said to me "Go away you f—g—b—d"—he tried to strike me, but I got away—when the men ran away, they took the prosecutor's coat with them, and afterwards threw it down an area—I followed them, and saw them go into a restaurant—I then went back to the house where the coat was, and asked a lady to give it me, but she would not, and told me to fetch a policeman or the soldier to whom it belonged—I got a policeman, and went with him to the restaurant and identified the two prisoners.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Police Constable E.</hi>) On April 27th, about 11.30 p.m., Woods brought the prosecutor's jacket to me at Hunter Street Police Station, and in consequence of something he told me, I went to St. Pancras Station to try and find the prosecutor—I found him, and took him to the station—I then went to 25, Tunbridge Street, with Woods, and he identified the two prisoners—there were about twenty men in the place altogether—I told them I was a police officer, and should arrest them for stealing £5</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing director of J. Watson and Co., Limited, 61, Crutched Friars, tea blenders—in March, 1902, we had a man named Hooper in our employment, who worked in the warehouse under the foreman, keeping the rough warehouse books—his wages were 27s. 6d.—he was nineteen years old—we had a warehouseman named Henry in our employ—his wages were 35s. a week—he was about twenty-three years old—he had been with us two years—we took stock of our tea in February, and there was a small, deficiency unaccounted for—we again took stock on April 23rd, and found a deficiency of about 1,300 lbs., worth about £75—in consequence of that discovery I spoke to Hooper—I afterwards had an interview with him, at which he made a statement, in consequence of which he was given in custody—his statement involved Henry, who was spoken to on the matter in the presence of Hooper—in consequence of what he said he was also given into custody—they were subsequently prosecuted at the Mansion House, and committed for trial—during the proceedings at the Mansion House certain fresh facts came to my knowledge, in consequence of which I applied for a warrant against Allen—I had known him for some time—he was in the habit of coming to our premises to buy or sell empty chests, or buy old tea lead—we never sold him any tea or bought tea from him—the tea comes to us in whole chests, and we usually sell it in half chests containing 66 lbs.—the whole chests we receive contain about 100 lbs.—some of the empty chests being of no use to us are sold, and were sold to Allen among other people—as a rule we cut them down to a smaller size—the chest produced marked "198" with "A. S." in red on it we got from the Metropolitan Bonded Warehouses, Limited, of which Mr. Marzette is the managing director, on March 18th—the "A. S." in a monogram is the mark of the Ardja Sarie estates, from whence the chest came—there is also on the chest "Break No. 67"—every parcel of tea bears a consecutive break number—there is also on the empty chest, "Chest No. 24"—we have books in Court containing entries relating to it—the chests are brought in by car-men and taken in by Hooper and Henry, and an entry made in a book—</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner.</hi>) I am a warehouseman, of 43, Thorne-grove Road, Upton Park—about two years ago I went into the prosecutors' employment, who were then Hartley Bros., carrying on a tea blending business at 61, Crutched Friars—there was also a man named Hooper employed there—I have pleaded guilty to stealing this tea—I first saw Allen about March, 1902, when he came to the warehouse—we were buying some empty packages, and he asked me if I could do with some—I said I could if I could get them cheap—he came again, and I asked him if he could get me some—he said he could not, not just then—there was a stack of empty leaded half chests, which Mr. Hartley authorized me to sell, and Allen said to me, "Do you want to sell those?"—I said, "Yes"—he asked me what I wanted for them—I said, "10s. a dozen"—he would not give that price—he came again two days later and saw the half-chests still in the same place—he asked me if I had sold them—I said, "No"—he said, "Well, I will have them at 10s. a dozen; I might as well have them as anybody else"—he further said, "You can put some-thing in them if you like"—I said, "Some what?"—and he said, "Some tea"—I replied, "Are you tempting me or sent to try me?"—he said, "No, it is all right, I will give you 6d. a pound"—I told him I would see</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190305180017"/>
               <p>about it—the next day he came with a van, and I with Hooper and another man put the chests on the van—while it was being done he asked me if I had anything done up—I said, "No"—he said, "What is this?" and kicked a half-chest full of tea—on the spur of the moment I said, "Take that"—he took it—that was the first occasion on which anything was stolen—he told me to go round to his warehouse and he would pay me, which I did—he paid me 33s., being 6d. a pound for 66 lbs. of tea—I gave Hooper 11s. of the money—Allen came again about ten days later and said, "Have you got anything coming along?"—I replied, "I do not like letting any more go as I cannot make it up"—I next day agreed to send another half-chest, and I asked a Great Western Railway carman, who used to call at our warehouse for packages, to take it round to Allen, which he did—I gave him a shilling for delivering a half-chest and ls. 6d. for a full one—Allen used to come two or three times a week to Northum-berland Alley, where we then were, and I used to send round to him a half-chest and sometimes a full one, about once a month—each time I got my 6d. a pound, of which I gave Hooper 2d. a pound—since last February, when we moved to Crutched Friars, chests of tea used to go to Allen on an average once a week or once a fortnight—the last chest in the indictment was delivered to Allen on April 21st—I got the money for it—I had bought from Allen some partition for a greenhouse for 5s., a door for 2s. 6d., and three water tubs for 3s.—the three tubs was an old account—the 3s. was deducted from one of the amounts I received—the door of Allen's warehouse was usually shut and opened by a man named Strahan—from February until April 23rd I think stole about 1,300 lbs. of tea in this way—in March I and Hooper got frightened and decided to tell our governor—we did not know they were taking stock, or would have done so before—the chest produced in Court is similar to ones we have had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Cut down chests were never sold by my firm empty, always full—our trade was nearly all out of London, but not quite—Allen first wanted to sell some chests to us, what are called "Venestas"—he was a seller of one kind of empty chests and a buyer of another—I said to Hooper that Allen had asked me if we could let him have some tea—he said, "I have been straightforward up to now and honest, and I will see about it"—when he came in, we had agreed to share equally, but I only gave Hooper a third of what I received: Allen suggested to me that 1 should do so—all I have related as to the conversations is entirely from memory—I have no private business of my own nor has my wife—all the tea we Stole was delivered to Allen.</p>

F. 575" and "C. F. 576"—they were packed by Mr. Phlasterer—the skins, except three dozen inferior stock, were marked with our brand, for Barrow by the packer—I recognised the fifteen dozen I saw at Leman Street as our make, which were packed in the cases sent to Barrow.</p>

Morris and Co, Limited—I found Kleider, whom I had not seen before, at 128—I said, "Is Mr. Morris in?"—he said, "No, Mr. Morris is not here, who are you?"—I said, "We are police officers, we wish to see Mr. Morris"—he said, "I am Mr. Wright, Mr. Morris is not here, I am the manager, and I am reponsible for the business"—I said, "Have you a traveller?'—he said, "Yes"—I had heard of the name of Jacobovitch—I said, "Have you sold six dozen of box calf skins to a Mr. Miller?"—he said, "The traveller's name is Jacobovitch, he bought and sold the skins Mr. Miller had, I have not got the receipt, what has it to do with me? Jacobovitch has got the invoice, he can tell you where they came from, I do not know, I do not know where he is; he might be here about five or six o'clock, I do not know where he lives; why do you ask me?"—there was a hesitation, and then he said, "I am the person you must deal with: you be very careful, this business has been formed into a limited company; it was my wife's business; we formed it into this company"—he hesitated and then said, "I will go with you and get the receipt for the leather; my wife has got it at my private address, 30 Mile End Road; she has got it there, there is only one receipt for that leather, it is in a drawer in the front room upstairs"—then he seemed to change his demeanor and said, "I bought the stuff from a merchant I never saw before nor since; the leather was delivered in the usual way"—I said, "I will leave you here in charge of Sergeant Wensley, a police officer"—I then proceeded with Allen to 366, Mile End Road, opposite 309, where Kleider resided, I believe—entering 366 I saw Jacobovitch—I was with Allen—on the way Allen mentioned the name Kleider—I said to Jacobovitch, "We are police officers, and are making inquiries respecting</p>

I live at 4, Old Gravel Lane—I have known Kleider two years—he employed me eleven weeks for the Palace Manu<lb/>facturing Company as a laster in the Mile End Road—I fetched my work home—I took it in between two and three in the day—I knew Morris Pam for several years as a laster—I knew his daughter, who worked for Kleider—one day I saw two men in the shop—a man was standing outside—they brought in some stuff—one was Mr. Pam—I was by the wicket, which is a hole in the door where the governor takes in the work—I saw them when they were passing the door with parcels of box calf from the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 28, Nelson Street—Kleider is my brother-in-law—I was his cashier in February for the firm of H. W. Morris and Co.—I remember in February two gentlemen calling to sell some wax calf—they were strangers—I heard them addressed as Mr. Morris and Mr. Pam in conversation—they came a little before one o'clock—they brought samples—they came again after the transaction was made—I heard the bargaining—then they went away—after a while they came back with the goods; about half an hour—the goods were brought in—I was in the shop—I saw Kleider hand £60 to Morris—he paid him for the fifteen dozen which lie bought at £4 a dozen—Morris receipted the bill and handed to Kleider, who gave it to me—I mislaid it, I do not know where I put it—in addition ten dozen white box skins were left on approval—I have not seen these strangers since till I met Pam outside the Court yesterday—you called him in—I have no doubt he is the same Pam—there was a desk in the office; everybody could go to it, it was kept unlocked—about two days after the gentlemen left I kept looking for the invoice which I had mislaid, when I found this blank receipt near the doorway—not knowing what it was I put it in the desk to make inquiries, but I never heard Kleider say he missed anything, and I forgot all about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The blank receipt was under a lot of shelves, near the street door—I was at the shop when Kleider was taken by the police on March 16th, and I am there still—a young man kept the books—I used to put entries in a book—I put down the petty cash that I paid—as a rule Kleider used to pay—the money was kept in the safe—I have seen about £100 there, mostly in gold, but there were one or two small notes—I never kept the books regularly—I do not know this invoice book—I do not understand bookkeeping—I know the boy Solomon Perle's writing—this is his writing (<hi rend="italic">This was in red ink, and stated that an invoice of March</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">rd, containing three items, was lost.</hi>)—I put the blank receipt in my desk to make inquiries, and forgot it—I saw Mr. Morris sign the receipt of the money for the skins—I was the other side of the counter—it was not this receipt for £63, it was for wax calf—Pam and Morris were there—I know it was £60 Kleider took out of the safe and paid Morris, because I remember that Kleider bought fifteen dozen wax calf skins at £4 a dozen.</p>

W. Morris was a director of H. W. Morris and Company—my mother had a few shares in it—it was not my sister's business—she is Kleider's wife—Mr. H. W. Morris came to the shop now and then, but Kleider was in the shop to make all business transactions—Morris enquired how we were getting on—the Palace Shoe Manufacturing Company was still going on, and executed some of our orders at 409, Mile End Road—I do not know what became of that business.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Halcombe Street-, Hammersmith, and am a flie man at the Hammersmith Theatre of Varieties—I have been there over three years—I first went there as a stage hand at 6s. a week—I was afterwards promoted to flie man and received 10s. a week—I also did some bill-posting, for which I got 6s. a week—it is customary for the employees to receive their money in sealed envelopes, which were given out by the prisoner—I never received my money in an envelope—the prisoner was the stage manager—he left on Saturday, June 28th, 1902, and on the following Friday he came to my house about four o'clock and told me that instead of receiving 16s. I should receive £1 in future—the next evening I received £1 in an envelope marked "Hobbs"—it was given me by Mr. Marsham, the new stage manager—I afterwards had a conversation with Mr. Reeves, the general manager, and in consequence I went to see the prisoner at his house—I asked him what he intended to do, and he said, "Understand, Mr. Coe is my master, not Mr. Reeves at all; if I ever get you over here again I will kick your b----a----"; as I was going away he said, "I will tell you what you can do, you can County Court me"—Mr. Coe is the proprietor of the music hall.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been general manager of the Hammersmith Theatre of Varieties over three years—it is part of my duty to make up the salary lists—the salary that each employee is to receive is entered in the books—for the last weekin March, 1901, Hobbs is entered as receiving 19s.—on April 20th, 1901, he is entered as receiving £1—when he first started there under my management he was a stage hand at 1s. a night; after he had been there some time he was made bill man for three days a week, for which he received 10s.; that made his money 16s.; after that he was made head flie man, and given 1s. 6d. a night instead of 1s., which made his money 19s., and that seemed to me to be a funny amount, so. Read and I agreed to give him £1 a week—I made the salaries up myself,</p>

               <p>and handed the sealed envelopes with the man's name written across to Bead to distribute—on June 14th I remember a sovereign being put into Hobb's envelope—no one else was entitled to any portion of it, and if the prisoner opened the envelope and gave any portion of it to somebody else it would have been contrary to his duty—the amount of salary is not entered in the signature book, so the person signing for the money would have no opportunity of seeing whether he received the right amount or not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> "Hobbs, billing" was not written on the envelope containing Hobbs' money, only "Hobbs"—I first found out that there had been a defalcation when Hobbs spoke to me at the end of June last—Hobbs had been in the habit of signing twice for his salary—when it was raised to £1 he continued to sign twice for a short time, but afterwards he only signed once—it is untrue that I have got up this charge because of any ill feeling—Bead has a right to engage anyone for billing, but if he did so he ought to have come to me and asked me for the money, and he would have had it.</p>

Worsley came out and asked us to go into house. Mr. George then accused Mrs. W.; she did not deny anything"—I also wrote out this document about two days after the prisoner said Mrs. Worsley had made a confession—he was present when I wrote it—he dictated it to me—I gave it to him—I believe that that was the last I saw of it (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 13)—it was then entirely in my writing—there is now some of the prisoner's writing on it—he has made alterations in the times—the report reads, "When they got to the first stile they both stopped, and we're there from 10.30 p.m. until 10.45 p.m.; they committed adultery at this stile"—the last six words have been interlined and are in the prisoner's writing—at the end of the report and at the prisoner's dictation I wrote, "Neither Uncle Joe or Mrs. Worsley denied the accusation"—that was the accu<lb/>sation made in the house—I know Herbert George's writing—Exhibit 16 contains a note in his writing, and 18 is also his as far as the document in the main is concerned—I find that alterations have been made in it in the prisoner's writing—on the 18th I asked the prisoner if the case was going to be defended—he said it would be, but only to get the damages reduced—I then told him again that I was not going to support him in his story, as it was false—I told him I had a good character when I left the post office, and did not wish to lose it—many times after that the subject was mentioned again, and he told me that if I would tell this story he would give me £50 if they won the case, and Mr. John Worsley would very likely give me another £50—I told him I did not want his money, and that I would sooner leave than tell a false story in Court—he said he knew more about legal matters than I did and told me to do what he told me—he said Mr. John Worsley was a wronged man, and that I should be doing good really if I supported his story—he told me I had to forget really what had happened that night, and to stick to the tale which he had made—the subject was revived between us more than once, and as the day of the trial approached I said I would rather leave him if he was going to tell that tale—about a week or a fortnight before the trial the prisoner said to me that he had better have some notes as well, as they might have to be produced in Court—he then took a spare note book out of his drawer, and also one of these note books (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>); I do not know which it was, and he copied the times down—I believe he asked me for my note book to do so—this (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is the note he made at that time and in that way—it is not true that it contains a note made by the prisoner on the night of June" 17th of the events of Mrs. Worsley's walk when she was alone and when she was with Mr. Joseph' Worsley—I did not consent to come up to London as a witness in the trial in November—within a short time of</p>

               <p>in the old suit—he asked to see my note, and this document was written out—I had entered no times in my note after Mrs. Worsley had gone in to North Dean—I know how difficult it is to accurately put down times when you are engaged on some absorbing pursuit of watching somebody or doing anything else—this note was made next day from memory—it was dictated to me by the prisoner—nothing was said about standing against the stile for fifteen minutes—I say that that is a falsehood—it was put in either the same day or the next—it was put in because the prisoner told me that Mrs. Worsley had confessed—I am certain that it was put in to deceive the jury in the Divorce Court—I do not know why the document which contained this wicked lie about being at the stile for fifteen minutes was left at home, while the one which did not contain it was taken up to the Divorce Court—I cannot explain why neither of the documents used in the Divorce Court contained a reference to the stile—I knew that Herbert George was being brought up to the detective business—the prisoner did not say after the 18th that I and his son were to make practice reports—there was always a draft report besides the note book report—I believe there were two reports made by Herbert George—I did not make two on the 18th—after the confession the prisoner said he hesitated whether to put in about the stile or not—the times in this note were not altered because the prisoner found, when he got his own note book out of his pocket, that they did not correspond—I do not know why a reference to the adultery was not put into the report used at the trial, instead of the one which was not used—the prisoner knew the name Engine Brow—I do not know how; I think Mr. John Worsley had mentioned it to him—at the Divorce Court one of the witnesses said that she had seen two men and a boy on the road at a certain time at night, and that one of the men came up to her and asked which was Engine Brow—when we were following Mrs. John Worsley and Mr. Joseph Worsley somebody may have been behind us—we had no evidence that they had committed adultery at the stile—I told the jury before, that I had seen it at the gate, and I told Mr. Pearson so—I did" not say that Mr. Joseph Worsley had lifted Mrs. Worsley's clothes—when I left the prisoner and told him I would go to Uncle Joe, he said, "You can go to the devil."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> While I was with the prisoner I sometimes went to Mr. Pearson every week, and he came to the prisoner's office pretty often—I understood him to be the prisoner's private solicitor—the prisoner had other cases while I was with him—Mr. Pearson was connected with them—there were two divorce cases besides the Worsley case, and there were some cases in which Mr. Pearson was acting privately on behalf of the prisoner—I believe I went to Mr. Pearson's office twice in relation to my proof in the Worsley case—the prisoner went with me each time—Mr. Pearson read the prisoner's proof to me about a week or a fort<lb/>night before I came to London—he asked me if I had seen Mr. Joseph Worsley lift Mrs. Worsley's dress—I said, "No"—the prisoner and I went out of the office, and he said to me, "Mr. Pearson really wants you to say (hat you did see Mr. Worsley lift Mrs. Worsley's dress, but he does not like to say so"—I went back to the office</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190305180067"/>
               <p>again and Mr. Pearson asked me if I had seen it, and I said "No"—the money owing to me when I left the prisoner was for work done—the prisoner settled what I was to have as wages, and whether he was busy or not—there was no dispute about the amount, but the pay had got into arrears—after I left I went to Mr. Pearson to see if he thought I could get any of the wages that were owing to me—on December 22nd I saw Mr. Pearson and said that I did not know whether the prisoner had told him that the Worsley case was wrong, but that I knew it to be so—he seemed very much surprised at first—he said, "I consider that your evidence was correct, and that George's evidence was correct, I know nothing more; at the same time if you care to go to another solicitor and tell him, you can, but I prefer you not to tell me anything about it, as I have to look after Mr. John Worsley's interests"—I think the appeal for a new trial had then been entered—it was on March 17th, 1903, that I saw Mr. Camanada, and he took me to Messrs. Cobbett's—the report of June 18th, 1902, was made for Mr. John Worsley—I do not know if it was sent to him—the alterations and additions in Exhibits 13 and 18 are in the prisoner's writing—the suggested practice report is almost identical with the report sent to Mr. John Worsley.</p>

My husband died on October 16th, 1902—in June, 1902, we were living at the Railway Cottage, 86, Rake Lane, Clifton Junction—he was a platelayer—I know the neighbourhood very well, I have lived there nine years—I did not know Mr. Joseph Worsley then except by sight—I knew Mr. and Mrs. John Worsley very well—they lived about five minutes' walk from me—part of the preparation for the Coronation festivities was a bonfire, and on June 17th it was being built, and I and my husband took a walk to see it—we went up Rake Lane into Clifton—there is a stile there which leads out of the field path from Engine Brew—after we had been to Clifton we came down the Bolton Road and turned down Engine Brew—we went to the bottom, where we saw two men and a boy—we passed through the first stile, where there is a brook—the two men and the boy were two or three yards in front—we walked up the Brew to the second stile at the top: then you go on again and you come to another stile; then you turn to the right to go to Clifton Junction—I saw Mr. Joseph Worsley and Mrs. John Worsley in front of us in Rake Lane—they went up to the third stile—I had seen them in front of us all the time—they were in front of the two men and the boy—sometimes the boy was with the men and sometimes he was behind—the first time I saw Mr. Joseph Worsley and Mrs. John Worsley was when they were going through the stile into Rake Lane—we could see them a long way off, but could not tell who they were—we were then going across the field—when we first saw them we were going through the second stile—the men and boy were then a couple of yards in front of us—I did not see either of the men or the boy lying down on their stomachs at any time—we saw Mr. Joseph Worsley come into the white gate at the Occupation Road—Mrs. John Worsley had passed the stile a good way down the road—the two men and the boy went on, but did not crouch under a hedge or stand still—I and my husband followed—I saw Mr. Joseph Worsley leave the gateway—Mrs. John was waiting for him about half-way down the road—the two men and the boy went on—they did not crouch under a hedge or stand still—I and my husband followed—I saw Mr. Joseph Worsley leave the gateway—Mrs. John was waiting for him about half-way down the road—the two men and the boy went on in front of Mrs. John—when Mr. Joseph had left the gate we were two or three yards from him—there is no ditch in the roadway opposite the gate, it is a paved road—Mr. Joseph met Mrs. John, and they went right down home—he overtook her—she was walking on at the time—we did not pass them until they got to Fern Bank.</p>

Mr. Joseph Worsley turned into the gate that must be a lie—it must also be a lie if anybody said that the two men we were behind were walking as fast as they could go—Fern Bank is Mr. John Worsley's house—Mr. Joseph Worsley and Mrs. Worsley walked straight in there—if anybody says that they stood about ten minutes at the gate that is another lie—next day I saw some of Mrs. Worsley's furniture being taken from her house—I was first spoken to about giving evidence just before Christmas—I was not called at the last trial—I know Mr. Joseph Worsley just from looks—I heard about the trial before it took place, and of its taking place—I remember Mr. John Worsley coming home after the trial—there was a good deal of talk about that—a plate layer's wife spoke to me about the trial at Christmas—she told me that she had told Mr. Joseph Worsley to come to me—she had hoard it was done in the road behind us—she had read it in the papers—that was in December—the trial took place in November, and the event took place in June—I had not thought much about it between those times—I wondered why the two young men were walking so slowly, and what was their business, because they were dressed more like scamps than gentlemen—I told Mr. Joseph Worsley about our going up behind the two people.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cotton waste merchant and live at 14, Bright Street, Birmingham, and have businesses in Manchester and Liverpool—I have been married for twenty-six years—I have seven children, the oldest 25 and the youngest 12—Mr. and Mrs. John Worsley have no family—in August, 1901, I was living at North Dean Cottage, Pendlebury, with my wife and family—in that month I moved to Blackpool—my wife had gone at the beginning of the season—I had the lease of North Dean up to March, 1903, and twice a week I went and stayed there, where I reserved for my own use a sitting-room and bedroom—the remainder of the house I let to a Mr. and Mrs. Walworth—when I went to North Dean Mrs. Walworth looked after me and did my rooms—John Worsley is my nephew, and about August, 1901, he and his wife, Isabella, came to Fern Bank, Clifton Junction—from March, 1902, till June, 1903, I visited their house twice—they were married in 1893—in conjunction with my brother, the late James Worsley, a veterinary surgeon, I was trustee to a portion of the post nuptial settlement—my nephew, John Worsley, was one of the beneficiaries—my position of trustee from time to time brought me into business connection with my nephew John—I was quite friendly with him—he was a clerk to an insurance agent in Manchester—I was quite friendly with his wife—I came to Fern Bank each week because I had property there, and in June, 1902, I had no agent there, so had to collect the rents myself—my wife and myself had been appealed to by John and his wife with regard to some differences—in the beginning of June, 1903, I received a letter from Mrs. John Worsley with reference to the presence of her brother-in-law, Haydon Worsley who lodged with them—there was friction between him and Mrs. Worsley, that was one of the causes—it was partly owing to his conduct, and in the beginning of June I was told Mrs. John Worsley had come to see me at North Dean about the matter, and about Friday, June 6th, she asked if she might come and see me about 9 p.m.—I am not sure if that was the date, but it was in the beginning of June—Haydon had threatened to knock Mrs. John down—she wrote this letter to me, dated June 2nd—she and Haydon could not get on, I believe—she came to see me on three occasions, when family matters were discussed between</p>

Worsley"—Claremont referred to a letter that I had received from Mrs. John, who was evidently living there—she had made an appointment with me for the 30th, and I telegraphed to the detective not to trouble to go to Claremont—I knew Mrs. John had been turned out of her husband's house—I knew she had gone to Manchester—I was always trying to see Mrs. John—I succeeded in doing so on June 30th—I met her at a fruit stall by appointment—we walked to a museum—at first she was with her sister—she left us—I think she had to go to her situation—we then went to a cafe—I had not got then in my own handwriting a retractation of her confession—she did not sign it—I asked her if it was true that she had made this wicked confession, and she said she was sorry to say it was—I asked her why she did it; she said she did it for £100, and that the trouble would be all over in a fortnight.</p>

I told the truth in the Divorce Court, and you cannot get beyond that"—then he went on to speak of Mr. Pearson and myself always behaving to him in a gentlemanly manner, and that the prisoner had treated him most shabbily, and that if he ever had a chance to do him a <hi rend="italic">thick</hi> one he would do so—I said, "Don't talk like that; I will go and see Mr. George, and see if he will take you back."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of March, Clayton, and Pearson, solicitors, of Lloyd Street, Manchester—I was the solicitor for the petitioner in the divorce case—I gave evidence—I have been admitted a solicitor for nearly five years—my firm has been in existence, I think, since 1853—I am an M.A. of Oxford University—I was first consulted by the petitioner, I think, on the morning of June 18th, when he called with the prisoner, who made a statement as to what he had seen the previous night—Mr. John Worsley also made a statement, in consequence of which I was instructed to commence the divorce proceedings—I think the prisoner said that he had actually caught Mr. Joseph and Mrs. John at the gate, and that he felt fairly certain that something wrong had taken place at the stile; that he had not paid so much attention to the stile; but had concentrated his attention on the gate—I got the report—I am not certain when I got it—on the 18th I also had a visit from Mrs. John Worsley and her sister—I sent her away the first time because I did not think it was proper for her to make statements to me without a full consideration—I think I told her she ought to go and see the co-respondent—she came again the next day—I had the petition in rough draft before she came—I may have been preparing it when she called, I am not quite certain—I was preparing the petition on the evidence given me by the prisoner, coupled with that of the husband—when she came the first time she asked me what her husband was going to do—I said her husband was going to take divorce proceedings against her—I think I may have said, "What are you going to do?"—she said, "I do not think I am going to do anything"—I think I then told her that she ought not to make any statement to me, as I was absolutely hostile to her and if she never came to see me again I should not refer to what she had said—I told her I thought the proper course for her would be to go and seek another independent solicitor—I think I also told her she ought to see Mr. Joseph Worsley—I think she went away—she came again on the 19th—before the confession was signed I told her again that I was hostile and she ought to go to another solicitor—she said she did not want to go to one, and she did not intend to defend the case I think she said, as she had been caught—I pointed out to her it was a very serious omission, and I finally asked her if she was prepared to put it on formal record—she finally said she was—I had the draft petition before mo, and I incorporated portions of it in the confession—then I read it through to her, and when she heard me say that adultery had been com<lb/>mitted at North Dean, and out of doors, she said it was not committed</p>

               <p>at North Dean—I said, "I will cross that out"—I made it quite plain to her what the thing meant—I do not remember where I got the infor<lb/>mation about North Dean from, it was either from her husband or from the prisoner—she signed the confession in the presence of my clerk, and I was sure she fully understood the meaning of it—I think the first time she came she mentioned certain secrets and suggested that her husband might pay her something if she kept them quiet—I said, "What are they"—she said, "I will tell you"—I said, "We cannot give you any money at all"—I said it was the practice of the Divorce Courts to order alimony until she was absolutely divorced, and if she wanted to get alimony she had better apply for it in the usual way, but I did not want to retract the con<lb/>fession—I got the material for supplying the particulars for the petition from the prisoner—he gave me the times, but I cannot say now whether they were from a book or not—I asked him the time of arrival at the stile, the time of the departure from the stile, the time of arrival and departure from the gate, and so on, but I cannot swear if it was from a book—on September 26th I took his proof—my recollection is that the prisoner and Cochrane were both in the office—I called my shorthand writer in, and the prisoner gave me his account of what he had seen—I then dictated paragraph by paragraph to the shorthand writer—when I had finished the prisoner's proof I was very busy—I said to Cochrane, "You have heard what George said, do you corroborate that in every way?"—he said, "Yes, I do," and I then dictated to the shorthand writer, "Herbert Cochrane says he can corroborate George," and so on—I remember going 'through the proof with Cochrane—I think I wanted him to tell me what he had seen on the night of June 13th—I sent for him and got him to give his description of it, and while he was there I went through the prisoner's proof with him—he took exception to the part about the gateway, where the prisoner said he had seen the dress lifted up—I sent a specially amended proof to my London agents asking them to correct Cochrane's proof accordingly—some of the alterations in the report (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 4) are in my writing—I put in "one" of the back bedroom windows—I think I got the information from the prisoner—I think I did that when I took the information down—on December 22nd the prisoner came with Cochrane—he had before that complained to me about Cochrane—he said that Cochrane had been guilty of what he considered a rather serious breach of duty in the way of being late and having said that he had seen people going about when he had never been there at all—I gave Cochrane a talking to, and said it was a most serious matter—I do not remember Cochrane saying then anything about this case—he afterwards came to me and said, "Have you heard that Mr. George has discharged me"—I said, "Yes, I have, and I think he has given you every opportunity, he is quite right to discharge you"—he said, "Do you think he will take me back"—I said, "Well, I have heard something of what you said when you left him, and considering what you said then I do not think he ought to take you back; is not it a fact that you then said that you were going over to Uncle Joe?"—he said, Yes, he had—I said, "If anything you said was wrong in the Worsley case you must certainly try and put that wrong right"—I think I went</p>

               <p>on to say, "Of course, I do not want to pry into your private affairs, but do not hesitate either for regard to me or for Mr. John Worsley to put the wrong right"—I believe he had some regard for both of us—he said there was nothing wrong,—I said, "What were you going to say to Mr. John Worsley?"—he said he had something to say, but what he had said he did not mean; that the prisoner had made him do things he did not like, and that he, the prisoner, was rather fond of money—he came to me again on March 17th, 1903, and said, "Have you heard Mr. George is going to be prosecuted for perjury"—I said, "No, it is rather a surprising thing to me that it was suggested, considering that Mr. George and you were believed in the Divorce Court"—he said, "It, is so all the same"—I said, "Who has told you so"—he said, "I have been seen by someone from Mr. Joseph Worsley, and have been asked to turn King's evidence"—I said, "What do you mean by turning King's evidence, that can only be applied when a man has not been telling the truth in a case of this sort"—he said, "Well, that is just what I told the man who came to see me"—I asked him who it was who had been to see him—he said he would rather not tell me—I said, "Is it a man named Colton?"—he said, that Messrs. Cobbett were undertaking the prosecution—I reminded him that a new trial might be granted, and said, "Are you still prepared to give the same evidence"—he said, "I would rather be out of the thing altogether I do not like it, but still if it comes to a new trial I will do it"—Herbert George was not called at the first trial, because I thought it was not proper to have a boy like that in the Divorce Court; he is only fifteen years old—I knew of the lavatory incident before the first trial, but I thought it was not quite fair play to bring it in—I thought it would impress the jury rather badly—I endeavoured to get Mrs. Worsley to have independent advice, and afterwards she went fully into the matter with Mr. Lee, who had put it to me that in the Divorce Court it was the usual practice for the husband to deposit security, or to advance the costs—he put it to me that instead of going to the expense of applying for costs in London, he should send me an undertaking, and when the draft came I got Mr. John Worsley to sign it—on the day it was signed the time for Mrs. Worsley's defence had expired, when she would have had to make a special application to have a defence put in, and according to my instructions and belief, if she had defended this, I was going to say at the suggestion of Mr. Joseph Worsley, I did not think that her husband should be saddled with the costs—when the prisoner came to Manchester I found him acting for people of substance, the Dunlop Tyre Company and the Welsbach Light Company, and also I did some business for him, and I thought him, and I still think him, a man I can trust, and I lent him some money—Juby had been with us for about five years, but latterly he got a little careless and I thought he had better leave—he has now pulled himself together and got a situation in Liverpool, I believe—during the <hi rend="italic">interregnum</hi> the prisoner gave him two or three nights' work.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Robin Road, Belvedere—I am the wife of Thomas Harper, a porter at the Woolwich Arsenal Railway Station—in October, 1900, the prisoner, as William Karr, took lodgings with me—he seemed a quiet, inoffensive man for the first few weeks—he then changed—his demeanour became unaccountable, I thought he was not in his right senses—he left about the end of August or September—he had peculiar faints or fits; I could not stand it when they became so frequent—they began by his looking very white, his eyes rolling, and his clutching at things—the first fit I was not at home, I saw the second—I took him to Dr. Greenaway—in July he had five or six more fits—he looked very sadly, and would go in the garden to recover, sometimes falling in a faint—he seemed relieved after bleeding at the nose, but his dreadful laughter you have no idea of—on August Bank Holiday, 1901, he had a fit—he had been out with my daughter, and I have no reason to think he had had any drink—he said he had seen somebody who was after him—I told him it was nonsense—he said he had met an inspector in the Park Road, and asked me to let him get over the back to escape—he rushed upstairs, then I could hear the horrible laughter, and he was very bad—in consequence of that I told him to go, and that he could no longer pay attention to my daughter—he went away—he returned, in October or November, 1902—he was very much against giving my daughter up—I knew him as Henry Roberts—he handed me a razor, and, under the circumstances, I took charge of it—I told him to go—he stayed that time a month or five weeks—I think he felt very much having to give up my daughter—she is 21 this month—he told me he had been in the Army and had deserted, but I did not believe it.</p>

                  </hi>., M.D., L.R.C.P. I have been consulted by the Treasury, and have examined the prisoner in Brixton Prison—he is quite sane now—in my interview with him his manner was quite collected, his conversation rational, and there was no evidence of any delusion, but there is a want of sense of the seriousness of his crime; he has a trick of smiling frequently when speaking of it—I could not get a very clear idea of his mental state before that interview—his replies were chiefly, "I do not remember," "I do not know," "I cannot explain"—he denied that he met Croft on March 21st, or Saul or Birnie, or that he asked about volunteers, or used the expression, "That proves my argument, mate," or that he ever rushed to the back or that he said an inspector was after</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190305180099"/>
               <p>him, or that he said to Inspector Fox at Liverpool what Fox has stated—he remembered the afternoon of March 21st, that he was paid at one o'clock, that he went to Bermondsey to seek for a job, that he hired a cycle and rode to Greenwich, calling at many public houses on the way—he could not explain the purchase of the revolver, but he remembered the fact of having bought it—he denied that he had bargained for it, and I think he said "I never did that with anybody"—he remembered none of the circumstances of shooting Booker—he said he did not shoot him—his remark was, "So they say"—he said he jumped the fence into the allotments when he was running from the police, and fell down and went to sleep, he thinks for about two hours, and he said, "When I woke up it all came back to me"—the sleep was probably coma after an epileptic attack—I have read the depositions and Inspector Fox's report—I have formed the opinion that he has inherited an excitable nervous system, which accounts for his erratic, loose, and irregular life, and the number of occupations in which he has been employed, and which predisposed him to an outbreak of a mental nervous disorder—an indulgence in alcoholic liquor would decidedly promote nervous deterioration, and an attack of epilepsy—I do not think he would be conscious of the nature or quality of his act, or discover the difference between right and wrong in what he as doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe he had an epileptic attack on March 21st, at any rate that he had the mental disorder which sometimes takes the place of an epileptic attack, and would not be able to distinguish what he was doing—he would be able to go about—I have known a merchant, when the fit has come on, leave his office in the City, make calls, and not recover consciousness till in his house at Denmark Hill—I cannot recollect a similar case to this.</p>

I am medical officer in H.M. prison, Brixton—I have kept the prisoner under close observation all the time he has been there—I have made a report as to his present mental condition, and his mental condition on March 21st—I have consulted Dr, Maudslay—generally I agree in his conclusions—I saw the prisoner first on April 27th—he was nervous and agitated as to his position, but his conduct and demeanour give one the impression that he does not realise the seriousness of his position—I have also studied the evidence given before the Magistrate and the Coroner—from those and from his family history I think it is very likely that he has inherited a tendency to an excitable mind, which his rough life would aggravate—losing his situations, and the worry about his young lady, and his life generally would increase, the epileptic tendency—that again would be accelerated by indulgence in alcoholic liquor—I cannot recollect a similar case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> His period of excitement might have culminated after his getting over the fence—I have had great experience of epileptics of all sorts, and they do strange things, but I have no personal experience of a similar case—influenza would have been an additional aggravation—a large number of cases of suicide have followed influenza, but I cannot speak as to murder.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, of West Ashley, near Chichester—on May 5th I came to London from Liverpool—about 5 p.m. I was in the locality of the London Road—I was drinking with a friend in public houses—the prisoner was in a public house—I cannot swear whether he was drinking with me or my friend—my friend left about nine to catch a train—I first met a man unknown to me—that was after six—I was in his company some time—he went out of. a public house, where I was treating him, for about five minutes and brought in the prisoner—after that a third man joined us, and we were together till closing time, 12.30, when we all left together—about fifty yards from the public house I was walking along quite unconcerned, when I was pinned from behind by someone and knocked down in the road, and on getting up I recognised the prisoner as one of three men who were leaving me—he was close to me—I saw a postman across the road—I told him what had happened, and then a policeman came, and the three of us gave chase—the three men ran up a bye-street, and apparently the prisoner could not run very fast, and he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190305180101"/>
               <p>stopped and walked back as if nothing had occurred, and-we caught him a little way up the bye-street—I recognised him at once as one of the three men who took part in it, and charged him—before I was knocked down I had just changed £1, and I had spent about 9d. of that, and I had 10s. as well as the £1, and a railway ticket—all the money and the ticket were taken—the money was in my ticket pocket—the 10s. was in silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Greystoke Place, Fetter Lane, and am a printer at the "Sun" office—on May 5th I left off work at 6.45, and saw the prisoner with Hurley in Fetter Lane at 8.30—I was with them till 10.30, when I left them outside Peele's Hotel, Fleet Street—the prisoner was not drinking with anybody else during that period.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 112, Southwark Bridge Road, and am a cane sorter, employed by Mr. Skinner, 185, High Street, Shadwell—on last Friday I saw the prisoner at where the omnibuses stand at St. George's Road, and asked him how he was getting on—he said, "I am out on bail"—he called my attention to the Tuesday evening when I was with him—I had been with him in the Duke of Clarence from 11.30 to 12.30—then we crossed to the urinal, and finding it closed we went over towards Southwark Library—there we stood talking and arguing whether the electric trams would answer or not, and then I said I was going home, and bade him good night, and left him in the Borough Road by the Library—his way home would be up Borough Road towards the Circus—I should say we were together for twelve minutes after the public-houses closed, talking and arguing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know the prisoner well—I am not particularly a great friend—I have only known him a few years—I meet him frequently—I do not know his address—he had had enough to drink on this night; the same as I had had myself.</p>
