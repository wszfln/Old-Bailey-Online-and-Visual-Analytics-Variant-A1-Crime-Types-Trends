On the 9th of September, in the evening, I was in the shop, and discovered, about nine o'clock, that something had been done to the win<lb/>dow—I found it had been broken, and a piece of silk gone, and a piece of kerseymere, about four inches, out of a hole in the window; it was removed from the place where it had been in the window; but was only partly through the hole—I had seen the window at six o'clock—It was then whole, and the silk and kerseymere were in the window—It was a yard and one-eighth of silk, worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the kerseymere measured two yards and a quarter, and was worth 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

               <p>of September I was in shoreditch, on the opposite side of the way to Mr. Corss, and saw the prisoner Ward, with his left hand, deliberately working at the bottom of the window, at the third pane glass—the other prisoner was standing on his left, close to him—I then saw them go away—they came again; and the third time they came, I saw the prisoner Ward's hand the same way as before, working away with his left hand, and all in the moment I saw them both run away together across the road—I and my brother-officer crossed the road to the shop, and found a piece had been taken out of the window—I went in pursuit of the prisoners, but saw nothing of them that evening—I saw about four inches of a piece of cloth of this description sticking out of the hole of the window—I was observing them from about half-past seven o'clock until a quarter or half-past eight o'clock—next evening I was on duty again in Shoreditch, and about a quarter to seven o'clock I met them coming towards the shop together, and with the assistance of my brother-officer I took them into custody—I knew Ward before—I have a small recollection of him. but I cannot say I recollect the other before—I saw both of them so as to be quite certain of them—there are gas-lights there—I took the prisoners into Corss's shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Prior, who lives at Crickle-wood, near Kilburn, in the parish of Hendon; we keep a house there. On the night of the 26th of August, I went to bed—I was not the last person up, but I fastened the doors and windows about ten o'clock—we have a bar to the back door, and the shutters were barred and bolted—I was not disturbed in the night—I got up next morning about half-past five o'clock—I was the first person up—It was day light then—I went into the back kitchen and found the shutter taken down, and laid down in the back house, the window wide open, and the door also—the shutter had been cut, and a hand put in to remove the catch of the window, and pull it down—I found the parlour all in confusion—I missed five shirts, (two were made, and there unmade), a pair of stays, a silver spoon, a pair of woman's, and two pairs of men's shoes—I had seen all the things over<lb/>night, in the drawers, except the shirts, which were on a horse in the kitchen—I never saw the prisoner till he was at the office—I saw part of my things again at nine o'clock that morning at a public-house, in the presence of the horse-patrol—there were three pairs of shoes and three shirts—I knew them again.</p>

I lived with Mr. Bonnet, a farmer, opposite Mr. Prior's On the morning of the 27th of August I was called by master to go into the field, at about half-past eight o'clock—there is a road across the field—I saw the prisoner in the field—I came up to him, and asked him where he was going—he said, "To London"—I said, "This is not the way to London"—he said he did not know his way, and he taught there was a way there—he had got a basket—I asked him what he had got in his basket—he said, "A pair of shoes"—my master came up at the time, he said he had a pair of shoes in his basket, and he said a bundle of rags as well—he mentioned the shoes first—my master came up and pulled the basket on one side, and I could see a pair of shoes and a bundle in it—my</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">affirmed.</hi>) I am a member of the Society of Friends. On the 18th of August, about nine o'clock at night, I was in the Green Park—I had dined at the Garrick Club-house, in King-street, Covent-garden—I drank after dinner three or four glasses of claret—I had a very severe head-ache—I dined at half-past five or from that to six o'clock—I left the club-house with a friend, at about a quarter to eight o'clock, in<lb/>tending to visit the English Opera-house—I found, on getting there, that the order I anticipated taking my friend in with, was for myself only, and therefore declined going; and I went to my friend's rooms, 51, Lincoln's-inn-fields—his name is John Spedding Frowde—he is a solicitor—I went to his chambers with him—I staid there about three quarters of an hour, more or less—he left his chambers with me, and I went with him to Greek-street, Soho, to some billiard-rooms where he wished to play—I did not go into the billiard-rooms, but he did; and I went down the street leading to Cranbourne-street and Leicester-square and Piccadilly into the Green Park—I was not intoxicated in the slightest degree at any period that evening—I was perfectly sober—when I got into the part, I walked round the top of the basin, on the western side—I turned to my left when I got to the top, and walked straight across the open part of the park, in a diagonal line, till I got to the Duke of Sutherland's—I had got some way, when I turned out of the path for the purpose of making water and while I was in the act of doing so, some one came behind me, and said, "Good night"—I replied, "Good night;" and, looking over my shoulder, saw it was a person in a light dress—he immediately seized me by the skirts of my coat, throwing him<lb/>self rather upon me, saying, "This is just what I wanted, you are the sort of men that get soldiers bad names"—the horror of my situation I at once felt—I was entirely in his power, that he had the opportunity of bringing any charge against me he chose; and the horror of my situation was such, I cannot exactly bring to my recollection what happened from that time—I was so agitated I cannot remember very well what happened; but to the best if my belief, I struggles, when he said, "You had better be quier," and something about "expose"—he then pulled me on further down towards the bottom of the park, towards the palisades which separate the Green Park from St. James's more towards the palace—he then said, "What will you give me to let you go?"—I replied "I will give you all, or any thing, or every thing (I forget which term I used) that I have"—h demanded my purse—he asked me for my purse, (I forget the very words he used,) and I gave it him instantly—It contained a sovereign, a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210016"/>
               <p>half-sovereign, and some silver—I am sure of that; and a seal, and key of a desk—he took the purse, and demanded my watch—I gave it him immediately—I should know that watch again—he then said, "Are you content," or "are you satisfied?" in a loudish voice—Idid not make any reply—he went away, and so did I as fast as I could go—I think he went to the right—he struck down, I think, towards St. James's Park—my sight is not very good I did not take such an observation of bis person as to be able to swear to him—I immediately went out at the gate, by the Duke of Sutherland's, that took me to St. James-streer—I them paused to think what I should do—I afterwards went to the Garrick Club—I was calmer and cooler then than I had been—I felt exceedingly nervous—I took some refreshment—I took some porter, I belive—Idid not take anything thatcould affect my sobriety—after leaving the Garrick, I went home, and went to bed—I was then slceping at my friend, Frowde's chambers, No.43, Lincoln's-nin-fields—Mr. Frowde did not see me when I returned—n the Monday following (this was on Tusday)I mentioned what had occurred to Mr. Richards, a friend of mine, who is a law student of Lincoln's-inn—he was going to get on the coach at the time, at the Elephant and Casstle, to accompany me to my father's house at Carshalton—It is Carshalton House where my father resides—he is a gentleman of property—something had occurred that rendered it necessary I should mention it to Mr. Richards—there was a police-offcer there—he put some questions to me concerning a watch, and in consequence of that I mentioned to my friend what had occurred.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As you were going to get on the coach, a police-officer put a question regarding a watch, and then you told Mr. Richard's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you at that time in your company a younger brother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had—I did not permit to hear the disclosure I made to Mr. Richards—I attended at the police-office next morning—the pri<lb/>soner was there—my watch was produced, and I recognised it at Bow-street office—Mr. Richards attended with me—the charge was then gone into, and the prisoner was committed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you always been a member of the Society of Frinds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Always—I am a merchant, that is to say, I am at present with my brother-in-law in his counting-house, not actually in partnership with him—I am not in business on my own account—I have been there now, or before I left, eight months—I am twenty-seven years of age, and am single—my support arises partly from a sum placed by my father in my brother's business, and partly from my exertions there—my brother pays me a salary—I am tolerably well acquainted with town—I generally reside at Carshalton—I siept that night at Mr. Frowde's chambers—I had slept there one night before—on the previus night—I had dined with Mr. Frowde alone, at the Garrick—we left the Garrick together—we had an arrangement that we should both go to the English Opera-house—I had a free admission for myself, but none for a friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You wished to go to the theatre that we night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly so, and so did my friend—It occurred to me that we might both go by paying for one—we did not wish to pay—It was for my friend to choose whether he would pay or not—I waived my privilege—I couuld not offer Mr. Frowde the order, as it was not tracsferable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was the arrangement first made for Mr. Frowde to go to the billiard-rooms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We left the Garrick to go the English Opera—them went to his chambers—when I left him at the billiard-rooms, I told him I was going to take a walk—I did not tell him where, because I did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210017"/>
               <p>not know myself—I made an appointment to meet him in an hour and a half a time—I had not taken that walk before since I have in town—I have walked over the same ground before—I do not think I walked there so late in the evening—I never knew it was a dangerous place to walk in at night by myself—I had a very bad head-ache, and thought the air across the park would he more beneficial than the road—I had had the head-ache, more or less, the whole day—I complained of it in the course of the day to Mr. Frowde, and I believe I told him of it when I told him I was going to take a walk—I mentioned it to him before we proposed to go to the English Opera.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you proposed to go to the Opera instead of the park? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; my head-ache became worse afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> when did it become worse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> when I had walked out after din<lb/>ner—my friend and I had had some conversation of a nature that was not likey to make it better—It became worse in walking to the theatre, or rather it felt worse when I was walking than when I was sitting quietly—I had pledged myself to go with my friend to the theatre, and did not think my head-ache was to prevent it—It was dark when I went into the park—It does not occur to me that I met any person in the park, but I am not able to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whether you met one person or twenty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am very certain I did not meet twenty—I cannot tell whether I met any person—It was not a matter which occupied my attention—I was suffering from bodily pain, and wished to get rid of it, that was my reason for walking there—I do not remember whether I met any body—I went five or ten paces out of the regular path for the purpose I have stated—I mean steps—there are not railings on each side the path—I was on the grass when I made water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to stats distinctly, you met no person up to that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not—the person I came in contact with spoke to me before I was touched at all—I was grasped by the tails of my coat—he threw himself ratber forwards upon me, holding the tail of my coat at the same time—I affirm that I did not speak to him first—I said nothing whatever about girls—nothing more passed between us than what I have detailed—I did not any, "This is a fine place for girls"—I mean solemnly to affirm that—I did not make any such remark while I was with him—after I was adderssed, I looked round immediately—he said, "Good night, and I saw a person in a light dress—It was a soldier's dress, from the make of it, was late in the evening—I cannot say it was a light flannel jacket—I was not near encough to see—my impression at the time was, that the person addressing me was a soldier—I did not say to him, "What time have you to be in barracks?" nor any thing of the kind—or, "What time must you be home?"—he did not say to me that he must be home, or in the barracks at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If it was so dark as you have stated and you were in such confu<lb/>sion as not to recollect what took place, how can you swear it was the dress of a soldier? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said I saw a person in a light dress, and a dress fitting in that way generally belongs to a soldier—the second sentence he uttered was, "You are the kingd of parties that give soldiers bad names"—I had finished what I was about at that time—I believe I had restored my dress to its usual place, for I found my dress restored subsequiently, and imagine I did it by instinct almost 6, I may say—I looked at my dress immediatly. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean immediately after you parted from the person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210018"/>
               <p>at least my dress was then right—I did not mention this to my person till I mentioned it to Mr. Richards, after I had seen the officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any thing said between you and that person as to an appoint<lb/>ment at a future night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; but for the communication with the officer, I should very probably never have mentioned it at all—I cannot sat how far the person and I went togeether, my state of agitation was so great—I had had the watch about six months—I had bought it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any arrangement made for you to meet the person again, and to give a certain sum of money on your watch being restored to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I did not get other watch between the time of my giv<lb/>ing it up and the officer coming to me—I was without a watch all that time—my brothers were not at home, except my younger brother, and he did not inquire where it was—Mr. Frowde did not inquire—I was not in the habit of wearing a watch so that it might be seen—at times I did, and at times I did not—I struggled when this happened—I did not call out—I did not meet any one after I left the person, till I got into St. James's Park—It might be fifty or seventy yards to the gate at the corner, then I had to go into St. James's Park—I met one person, I believe, before I got to the sentinel of the palace—I believe it was a man—It was a man—I did not speak to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it not occur to you, that as you had been so ttacked by a per<lb/>son you believed to be a soldier, uit would be the best thing for you to tell the first soldier you met on duty what had occured? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did not occur to me—the person turned to the right, I believe, but I did not pay any great attention—I went away myself as fast as I could.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How near were you to the railings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say fifty yards from them, as well as I am able to speak of distance.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell me whether, when you parted, the soldier went away on the regular path, or diverted from it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He went over the grass—I went from the pathway on to the grass before he attacked me—I did not give him up all the money I had—I gave him up the purse—It did not contain all the money I had—I had some money in my trowsewrs pocket—that was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him I would give him all I had about me—I would gladly do so—I gave him what he demanded—I would have given him all had he demanded it—I did not say to him, Pray take all I have, and let me go;" nor any thing to that effect—I gave him what he de<lb/>manded, and he appeared satisfied—I have never been married—I never stated to any one that I was married—I never allowed any female to pass as my wife.</p>

On Thursday afternoon, the 20th of August, the prisoner came to my shop and produced it on the subject of ear-rings—when he proiduced the gold watch, he asked me what it was woth—It had a small seal attached to it, and I think a steel ring—I said, "It must have cost at least 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. new"—he then said it was too good for him to have knocking about—he said it was given him by a lady's maid—when I told him what it was worth, he said, "You would not think that was a present to a lady's maid, would youi?"—I said, "No I should not"—he said it was too good for him to have knocking about; that he had it in his possession for three weeks, and had not shown it to any of his comrades; and that he wished to dispose of it, because it was too good, and he would take anotherin exchange, if I would buy it, and make it worth my while—he did not say any thing about his discharge, to my recollection—I then replied to him that I did not think it had been given to a lady's maid—he then said, what he had stated was correct, and that he was always to be found, giving me his name and address, "Robert Swan, Scotch Fusileer Guards, First Bat<lb/>talion—I then asked him long he had it in his possession—he said, "Three weeks," and asked if I knew of a person who it waws likely to suit—I said I thought I had a customer it might suit, and if he would leave it I would show it to him—he hesitated, and asked me how long I should be—I said if he would allow it me two hours, and he agreed to it—I had a motive for asking him that—he went away, leaving it, and in the mean time 1 endeavoured to trace out the coat of arms on the back—I gave information at Bow-street—he returned in about two hours and a quater, and asked what I had done about the watch—I said, "Now I wish to know how you became possessed of this watch?"—Fletcher, the officer, was close at hand at the time—I think he was in my parlour—he afterwards came into the shop—he was in the shop when I said I should like to know how he came by it—the prisoner said it had been given to him by a young woman he was keeping company with—I said I could not give it up to him, unless I was satisfied he had become honestly possessed of it—he then began to say he was not going to be swindled out of it in that kind of way—a young woman was with him when he came the second time—then the officer interfered—he said the young woman had nothing to do with it—I gave the watch to the officer.</p>

I forget the answer I made—we proceeded a little further, and as I thought, turned his back to make water—I was going on, he said "Stop a bit, I am going through the Park, I will accompany you"—When he turned round again his per<lb/>son was exposed in a disgraceful manner, and he asked me what I thought of that, and I, as he says, took him into custody, and told him at the same time it was such men as them that got soldiers into bad names—he begged that I would not take him, and at the same time pulled out this watch—I took the watch, and thought at the same time as a testimony against him—we went a little further towards the bottom of the Park—he fell down upon his knees, and begged for his family's sake that I would let him go—I pitied him—after long entreating from him, I told him I would let him go on a promise that he would never insult a soldier in a like manner again—he pulled out his purse, and called me a good fellow—but it was agreed he was to meet me the next day at the bottom of the Park, and I was then to return him his watch, and he would make me a present—he asked me not to bring any one with me—I told him I would not—at twelve o'clock next day I had made up my mind to give him into custody, and had a person with me who was on duty there, but I did not communicate to him what I wanted him for—that is all I have to say—the money that I had from him was, to the best of my recol<lb/>lection, one pound ten shillings—he told me that I was to dispose of the watch as I thought proper, If he was not there the next day.—<hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT SWAN</hi>.

For my general good character, I beg to appeal to the officers of the Regiment I have served upwards of ten years. My Lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, in conclusion, I beg to state my innocence of the crime I am charged with: and, finally, to request your impartial and humane consideration of the facts; and, in throwing myself on your protection, I humbly rely on your favourable verdict, and leave my case entirely in your hands, with the full assurance that you will give me the benefit of any circumstances in my favour."</p>

I heard a description of the other prisoner given by the porter, and went in search of Perkins—I went to watch a communication with Rogan, and traced a young woman to Golden-lane—on the 2nd of September I took Perkins in Bell-alley, Golden-lane—he was not in the house when I first went, but two women, and when I heard footsteps on the stairs, one of them said, "Here comes <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>"—directly he saw me, he turned to go down again, but I secured him—he asked what I wanted him for—I said for a little job in Holborn—he said b----his eyes if he would go, and he attempted to seize the poker, but I held him; and then he called to the women to bring him a knife—before the Magis<lb/>trate the prisoner denied knowing each other at all.</p>

I have known the prisoner nearly six months—I observed him frequently idling about but never spoke to him—I stood at the door of the house, where I have lived nine years, and saw a whole lot of young fellows standing at the corner—the policeman came and sent them away, and in a few minutes the prisoner came back with one or two more—two ladies came up with reticules of a dark colour—the prisoner stood inside a place, and snatched the reticule, and ran away—I saw him do it—the lady cried, "Stop thief"—I followed the lady, and told her to go no further, or she might get hurt—I was telling somebody what I had seen, and the policeman heard me—the prisoner was not in a company with any body when he did it.</p>

I lived with him till within these two years—I have been with my son, but my husband slept at home—we have not been on very good terms for some time past—on Wednesday night, the 5th of August, my husband came home about ten minutes before eleven o'clock—my son was then out, but he came home in a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes—my husband fetched some beer—he went into the shop and got a couple of eggs, and some wood to light the fire—he beat the eggs up in a basin—he did not go out of doors for the eggs—they were in my son's shop—he did not say what he was going to fetch—he fetched the eggs and the beer without saying what he was going to do with them, but I knew when he was beating the eggs up what he wanted—I thought he wanted a little egg-hot—I thought he had a cold—I put part of the beer into a saucepan and put it on the fire—I afterwards mixed the beer and eggs together, and simmered them over the fire, and poured them out into a jug—I went into the shop then to serve a customer, leaving nobody but my husband in the room—my son had not come in then—I was absent from the room two or three minutes—when I came back the egg-hot was poured out into half-a-pint glass, and a half-pint-pot, into two separate vessels—I told him I did not want half of that—I saw it was poured out for me—he made no reply—he drank his, which was in the half-a-pint cup—he did not offer me which I would take—he never said a word; and at that time my son came to the door—I let him in and offered him some of the egg-hot—he took two sips of it, and I drunk the remainder myself, except about two table-spoonfulls, which I left at the bottom of the glass, and put the glass on the mantel-piece—after that I rinced out the glass in some water, and threw the contents out into a clean pan which was on the table—there was nothing in the pan before—It was quite clean—no one had come into the room but my son—I went to bed soon after—my husband went to bed before I drank it—I was taken ill about an hour after I was in bed—I had not been to sleep—I found myself so ill, my stomach and bowels were dreadful—I was very sick and my bowels were very bad—I had a great deal of pain in my stomach—I never had such a feeling before—I have been dreadfully ill in my bowels and stomach, but never to equal that—It was a very sharp pain, and I was all in a heat and perspiration—I continued ill</p>

I was sent for on the 6th of August, to Mrs. Banbury in the morning—I did not go until about ten o'clock—I found her labouring under vomiting and purging—after asking if she had taken any thing in the way of food to disorder her, she produced to me a brown pan, at the sides of which were sticking some white powder—I scraped it off with my nail, and took it home with me—I did not try any experiment with it, till nearly a fortnight after—I deposited it in the mean time in my desk, sealed up—I then ascertained it to be arsenic, to a certainly—I have some of the powder in my pocket now—that was about the 22nd or 23rd—After I had done that, I apprised Mrs. Banbury and her son what it was—I had not seen the prisoner then—I saw him on the evening of the day after I tested the powder, and explained to him what I discovered the powder to be, and suggested to him, that rather than let the thing come before the public, if they could come to terms, to separate—I advised him to separate—he at first rather accused me of acusing a separation between him and his wife, but then he acquiesced in it and left that night—It might be past ten o'clock—arsenic is a deadly poison in the form we have it—If it was put into liquor and drank by a per<lb/>son, it would poison them—a small quantity would produce sickness and purging, vomiting would no doubt bring up part of it—that would in a great measure prevent its deadly effect, especially if only a small quantity was taken—a few grains remaining in the stomach would be sufficient to pro<lb/>duce death—I did not take home above twelve or fifteen grains—I took home as much as would kill two people, but I did not weigh it—I tested about half of it, and have six or seven grains here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Holt, of Mabb's-place, Fetter-lane, in the parish of St. Dunstan; he is a green-grocer an fruiterer. The prisoner, Mary Starkie, came into my service the latter end of May—the other prisoner is her mother—I knew her at the time to be her mother—she came to my house once—I only saw her there once—I attend Far<lb/>ringdon-market to sell my goods, and so does my husband—at the time Mary Starrkie was with us, I had 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Which I had earned and saved up—there were two sovereigns, four half-soverigns, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sixpences, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in shil<lb/>lings—It was chiefly in silver—I kept it in a box under my bed, locked up—the prisoner left me on the 12th as I missed it on the 19th—I did not miss any thing till after she went—I went to get 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay a bill, and the money</p>

               <p>was all gone—I missed it all at once—three weeks before she came to me, the money was all safe—I did not look at it from that time till nearly a week after she left—I had no other servant while she was with me—the box was not broken—It had been opened by a false key—I had the charge of the box alone, not my husband—a brooch that was in the box was also gone—I missed six half-crowns, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in farthings and six sixpences, out of a drawer—two of them were new ones—It was all I was worth—I missed the money out of the box, on the 19th—I missed the property from the drawer, at her last examination—the money in the drawer was there three weeks after she came into my service—I missed a pillow-case about the same time as the money from the drawer—I had seen it safe when I saw the money—I had seen it safe about a month before I missed it—I missed a pair of women's boots, a silk handkerchief, a child's pina<lb/>fore and cap—I had kept them down stairs in the drawers, which were open—I had not missed any of the linen articles before I lost the money—I missed the "Pilgrim's Progress" with my children's ages in it—I saw the book and the brooch again, at the examination at Guildhall, in Au<lb/>gust—I had not seen the book for two months after she had been with me—about three weeks before she left me, she told me she had been mar<lb/>ried a month before she came to me—I did not give her warning, but she gave me a week's warning, saying her husband wanted her at home, and she went home to her mother when she left me—she was living at her mother's—I went there a week after she left me—my sister keeps the house they lived in—I was often at my sister's, but never saw the rooms they occupied—I found the book I had missed on the mother's premises—w en I missed the money on the Sunday, I went with the officer and looked about the place, and under the bed I found a handkerchief, a pillow-case, and cap, and my book—this was the Sunday after she left—I found my brooch in a little box on the table, in the front room, and the book also—the prisoners were in the Compter at that time—they had been taken up on the Wednesday—at the second hearing, when I went home, I heard something, and went over to Mrs. Graham, who gave me a key.</p>

I was applied to, to apprehend the prisoners on the 19th of August—I went and appre<lb/>hended them between mine and ten o'clock at night, at No. 1, Brackley-street, Golden-lane—the daughter was in the garret of the front room, and her sweetheart was on the bed—the mother was not at home at that time; she came home, and I took her the same night, between ten and eleven o'clock—I found the brooch on the table in the front garret, which is a sitting-room—next day I went and found the book on the same table, and the pillow-case on a pillow in the bed; and under the bed a pinafore, cap, a pair of boots, and handkerchief—they rented the front and back garrets—t e bed was in the back room—I found nothing else which has been claimed—I found a good deal of other property, five new gowns, three gown-pieces unmade, one on the premises, and two at a dressmaker's, two remnants of calico, and ten napkins—I found under the tiles, out of the window, a pillow-case marked W., four towels, a table-cloth marked F., two shawls, two children's frocks, two lengths of muslin for window cur<lb/>tains, three cotton aprons, two petticoats, five children's shirts, a length of flannel, a black veil, four lengths of lace, three handkerchiefs, several caps, a bonnet, and other things—the gowns appeared all nearly the same size, to fit the prisoner Mary—some of them appeared to fit the elder prisoner—I have had the articles I found in my possession ever since.</p>

"—I said, "I suppose so"—he went out, and returned in about an hour and a half, with two pistols—be<lb/>fore he went out there was a great coat of his, which he now has on, in the front parlour—he said to his little boy, "You go and take my great coat to William Appleby's;" and when he returned again, he had got his great-coat on—at eleven o'clock he had a green jacket on—when he re<lb/>turned at one o'clock, he was alone—his wife was down in the kitchen with me, and as he came down the kitchen stairs, he said to his daughter Jane, "Jane, will you shake hands with me?"—she said, "No, father, your cruelty is so great to my mother, I cannot be friends with you—I will decline it"—he then called to his son James, and asked him to shake hands—he pulled some silver from his pocket, and said, "Money is no object to me, here is a shilling for you, call your brother William, "who refused coming—he said, "Go and carry him a shilling"—he gave a shil<lb/>ling to the baby I had in my arms—one of his sons wanted to take it and spend it—I said, "Never mind"—the prisoner said, "Let the baby go into the street"—he turned round to my elder son, and said, "Thomas, go and get a shilling's worth of gin"—the wife said, "Do not go, we do not want gin; if he wants spirits, let his own child get him half-a-quar<lb/>tern"—she said, "Think you had better give me two shillings to buy the child a frock"—he said, "Yes, you shall have it"—he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out something—I could not see what it was, but his wife screamed out that he had pulled out a pistol—I turned round to ✗what it was, and saw him put hand into his pocket again, and pull out</p>

(his wife was with me) Are you going to hang me, or what are you going to do with me?"—we went into the room at the station-house, and did not answer him, but gave our account to the inspector, and went before the Justice the same evening, but it was postponed till next day—he has remained in custody ever since.</p>

On Monday, the 7th of September, I was in Parrot-court, and saw the girl standing against the flat corner of the wall—the prisoner was standing as if she was speaking to her—I saw the little girl run from the wall, and make three or four distinct strikes with the apron or pinafore at the prisoner—the child lost its balance in striking, and the prisoner shut her eyes, and put herself rahter forward, with her eyes partly closed, and rushed forward to catch hold of her, but the child passed under her right arm and ran up the court screaming, "She has scratched me," or "cut me," I cannot say which—she hardly touched the girl—she ender<lb/>voured to take hold of the child, but she passed under her arm and went away—I did not see her try to take hold of the cloth—It was mo<lb/>mentary—she hardly had time to lay hold of it—I recollect seeing the sis<lb/>ter standing at the window, exciting, the child to strike the woman—I did not see Deans there—I have not known the prisoner above a week—I never spoke to her but once previous to the accident.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a school master. I have known the prisoner more than twelve months—he is a stationer and coal-merchant, and lived at 84, connaught-terrace, Edgware-road—his son was apupil of mine—his name was William Henry Duncan Stanynought—he was nine years old, and would have been ten in a few days—I saw him at nine o'clock the evening before his death—he was perfectly well—on the morning of the 4th of September I was sent for—a boy came to me who was in the prisoner's employ, about half-post eleven o'clock—I went over to his house imme<lb/>diately—I live very near him—In consequence of what I heard below I went up stairs immediately—I spoke to the prisoner from the outside of his champer door, and he answered me from within—he said, "Don't come in; pray don't come in, Mr. Finch, I shall shock you"—he said that in a very agitated tone—the room door was a little open—he said those words several times—I said, "Pray let me come in; are you ill? what is the matter?"—I then went in, and found the prisoner in bed, withy his son by his side, apparently asleep—I begged of the father to tell me what was the matter—he said, "I cannot tell you; I dare not tell you"—I entreated him earnestly to tell me—when he told me had killed his poor boy, that he had wounded himself, and that he was dying—I immediately said I would fetch a medical man, and asked who I should fetch—he wished me to fetch Mr. Barker, the medical attendant of the family—before I did so he pointed to some letters lying on a chair by the bed-side, and wished me to give one to Mr. Barker, and two other letters to his wife—I took up those letters and a knife which was lying on the chair, and a razor on the drawers, and put them in my pocket—I then fetched Mr. Barker—he had pointed to the knife, and told me it was the knife he had stabbed him<lb/>self witchy—there were marks of blood on it—It was partly covered with blood—I returned with Mr. Barker—we then examined the poor boy, and found he was quite dead—Mr. Barker examined the prisoner's wound—there was a slight wound on the boy's forehead—It appeared to me to be cut with a knife—It was a very slight wound—the face was partially black, and the features distorted—we removed the body into the next room, and the prisoner then told us how he had committed the murder—before that he said he had tried to destroy himself several ways, and had burnt charcoal three or four nights with that intent, but had been unsuc<lb/>cessful, and had tried to stab himself to the heart, and that was unsuccessful—he then said the boy awoke up in the night with the smell of the charcoal, and after that he had suffocated him with the pillow—the body of the child was quite warm—Mr. Barker then left me with the prisoner, and I had some</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210094"/>
               <p>conversation with him—he was very much agitated during the time of the conversation I had with him, and appeared in very great agony—I told him the boy had been a very affectionate child to him—he said "Yes, he was an affectionate child—there was not his equal—there was not a fault in him"—"that boy(said he) has been the greatest consolation to me, when I have been in tears—he has come and consoled me"—he was a very affectionate child, and I never saw a Kinder father than the prisoner—the prisoner then la<lb/>mented what he had done—saying, "How could I do it?—how could I kill my poor boy?"—then again be would justify what he had done by saying the Almighty was not angry with him—that he had done a worthy deed—that it was a charity to kill the poor boy, for he would have been an idiot, and miserable for life, and afficted as his father, his grandfather, his great grandfather, and all his family had been—he said his father was blind at thirty—that his grandfather died in a madhouse that himself was grey, and his brothers hair was grey; and he dwelt very much on his family being afficted with this terrible malady—his great desire seemed to be for some body to destroy him—he wished for prussic acid, and was in very great agony—I had frequent opportunities of witnessing his conduct to his son, and I never observed a more kind and affectionate father.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARKER</hi>. I went immediately with Mr. Finch, and found Mr. Stanynought in bed, with his shirt smeared with blood, which had issued from a wound on the left side of him body, which he told me he had in<lb/>flicted on himself; and the dead body of the child lay by his side—having ascertained that the wound had ceased to bleed, and was not of an immedi<lb/>ate dangerous nature, I inquired into the cause of it—he told me he had plunged a knife into his side, and that he had destroyed his own child—that he had meditated doing so for a length of time, and had been most miscrable for many years—that he had brought the child from Gravesend on purpose to accomplish it—that he had burnt charcoal for several suc<lb/>cessive nights for that purpose, and that on the night in question, failing to accomplish it by that means, he struck the boy with a boot—jack on the forehead, placed a pillow on his head, and amothered him by that means—I examined the body of the child which was lying on its right side, with the face towards the bed—It was livid, and the face somewhat swollen—the mouth open, the tongue protruded, and there was a cut in the centre of the forehead—I ascertained that the wound had divided the integuments only down to the bone, and had done no injury—I have no doubt, from the ap<lb/>pearances, that the child had been suffocated—the prisoner's own wound was an incised wound on the left side of his body, in the chest, and had penetrated several inches—It was a very narrow escape of life—It was doubtful at the time, what would be the result—I left him in the care of Mr. Finch, and called some of his friends, who applied to a Magistrate—a police officer was sent to take care of him—I had another conversation with him, in the presence of another medical man, who I sent for—he had stated at the previous conversation, that he had alluded to some peculiar weaknesses—he said he had no objection to mention them to a medical man, they were of a private nature he said he had had them for many years—they had been sources of peculiar distress to him; particularly a weakness of the genital or<lb/>gan, as he expressed it, and his son inherited weaknesses of the same nature, and they had been sources of deep misery to him—he rather recapitulated what has been stated by Mr. Finch—I remember his saying he was now most happy, and was more quiet and tranquil, at that period than he had been for some months—from all that I observed, I have not the slightest doubt, but he was in an unsound state of mind at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FINCH</hi>. This is the letter he gave me for his wife—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"My dearest Lucy,—In my last moments I have to beg of you not to give way to despondency; this is the happiest moment I have long known. My poor little boy was doomed to suffer all his poor father, grandfather, great grandfather, and great—great—grandfather suffered before him; this has been the chief cause of my misery. I could not endure the thought; I never knew what it was to be happy, but have been acquainted always with desponding misery; my nerves unfit me for this world; to see my son nervous beyond any other child I have ever known, distracted me beyond redemption, and I inwardly feel that I am accomplishing the only action of my life for which I entertain any regard. Adieu, adieu, my blessed wife, may you never know the hundredth part of my sufferings. Kiss my two dear children.—H. <hi rend="smallCaps">STANYNOUGHT</hi>."</p>

I was out on the morning in question in the Back-lane, East Smithfield—I saw Lewis there at two o'clock—he had got hold of these two girls arm-in-arm, one on each side—I did not take notice whether they had hold of him or he of them—they were walking together—I then saw the three male prisoners about five minutes' walk from the prosecutor—they came up and knocked him down—I said, "For God's sake if you rob him, don't murder him"—with that the girls took his hat and went up Anthony-street—the male prisoners are the three sweeps—I had not seen them standing with the girls before—Connell said he would serve me the same if I did not go away—I saw one of them kick the sailor in the side at the time Connell knocked him down.</p>

I was four yards from St. Martin's-le-Grand, and saw the cab coming from Cheapside—It did not come down St. Martin's-le-Grand it—the driver was coming along at a fast trotting pace, what I should call <hi rend="italic">swinging</hi> round the bend of Cheapside—I saw an elderly gentleman cross<lb/>ing the road, and saw him knocked down by the horse—he went under the horse, which must have trampled on him—he then went under the off-wheel, the mud being slippery—he drew himself up from one wheel, and got under the other—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> kept going on—the gentleman was pushed by the wheels, and at length the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went over him—I called out loudly to the driver, directly I saw the gentleman against the horse's head—I said, "Halloo, for God's sake, stop, for you are running over some<lb/>body"—I was then within a yard of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he did not take the least notice, but kept striking the horse with the whip after I used that expres<lb/>sion—a gentleman was sitting in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the time, who did not attempt to get out—I went round the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and took the name and number, while it was going on—It had just passed over the body—I did not see him stopped, for my attention was directed to the gentleman, whom I assisted to life up—he walked two or three paces—he said, he had just left some friends at the Bull-and-Mouth inn—he had no sooner spoken, than he suddenly dropped, and I did not hear him speak a work afterwards—he was taken into Mr. Peppercorn's, in Newgate-street, and examined—I kept hallooing to the driver to stop, while the gentleman was in contact of the wheel—the whip was used after I called out, and before the wheels went over the body.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Titterton Terrace, Islington. I was in New<lb/>gate street, against the second house from St. Martin's-le-Grand, on the north side of the street, within one door of the corner, standing on the curb with my face towards the road, and saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming from the East—I cannot say whether from Cheapside or St. Martin's-le-Grand—It was going at the rate they usually go at when they have got a fare—I should think from seven to nine miles an hour—I saw a man in the road in very immi<lb/>nent danger, in consequence of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> horse being so close to him—I thought it impossible he could get out of the way—I called immediately to the driver—I stood abreast of the driver at the time, and called out to him to stop—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was about the middle of the road—the road is about wide enough for three carriages to go abreast—the driver was directly facing me, on my side—the horse was close to the gentleman when I first saw it, but it had not touched him—I called out "Stop," loud enough for the driver to hear me—I should consider he might have heard me at three times that distance—the instant I called out, the man was stopped by the near shoulder of the home—the gentleman's face was rather obliquely towards Paternoster-row—he was knocked down—I saw him under the wheels a foot or two before the wheel came on his body—I never ceased calling out till I seized the horse by the reins—the driver used his whip and shook the reins to urge the horse on after I had called out, and other persons had called out—I ob<lb/>served the wheel go over the gentleman—It brought the horse rather to a stand still—the man being so bulky—the driver was not allowed to proceed further, in consequence of my seizing the horse—the constable No. 99 came and took him—when I stopped the horse, I said, "You d----rascal, why did you not stop, you have run over the man"—he made no answer—he appeared quite stupid—I do not think he was drunk—he appears a very heavy stupid man—he said, "Take my number," or "You have got my number," and wanted to go away—If he had stopped when I first called to him the accident would have been prevented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you hear any one besides yourself call out "Stop" before the accident happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—the horse was brought nearly to a stand still by the accident, and at that time he struck the horse with the whip—the near wheel came against the body, and at that time he whipped the horse—the gentleman was close to the horse when I called "Stop"—he was struck and staggered several paces, and the near wheel came against his side—he was struck almost at the same time as I called—the cabman could not have prevented the first blow being struck, I think, as he was too near the man—I have not driven lately myself—I have driven a chaise—he was going at a quick pace—I cannot exactly say the number of miles an hourhe had all the road to himself—there was no other carriage—"I</p>

               <p>think it was impossible for the gentleman to avoid the horse—he was on the near side shoulder of the horse—pulling the right rein would have prevented the accident—I think the gentleman was aware of his danger—the gentleman's face was in an oblique direction towards St. Paul's—I had not seen him before he got close on the carriage—I saw a gentleman in the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and spoke to him in the prisoner's presence, when the policeman came up—I think the prisoner said he did not know that he had done wrong—t e gentleman in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> told the prisoner where he lived.</p>

I was one door from the corner of Panyer-alley—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> appeared to me to come from the corner of Cheapside—It did not appear to me to be going at an unusual pace—It was trotting—I observed the gentleman cross—he had a green shade over one eye; I believe the left—the head of the horse was at least four yards from the gentleman when I first saw him—the gentleman was about half-way across—I saw nothing to prevent the driver seeing him—It was the calling out which attracted my attention—several persons shouted before the horse came to him, and if the driver had stopped then, no accident would have occurred—I observed the horse strike the gentleman, and was so shocked as it forced him down, that I put my head to my eyes, and did not see the wheel go over him—I saw him afterwards at the hospital dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Ireland, but I have been stopping in Drury-lane On the 26th of August I was on my way down Fleet-street, about half-past twelve o'clock, going home—I lodged at that time at Mr. Dray's—I returned home from seeing a few friends, and as I came down Fleet-street the female prisoner came out of Chancery-lane—she took hold of me—I was walking very quick at the time, being in a hurry—I thought to get from her, and said, "My dear, you had better let me go"—she pulled me up the street a little, put her hand to my smallclothes, gave it a pull, and worked the watch out, and ran—I went to button my smallclothes and missed the watch—I ran after her, and when I got within a few yards of her she gave the watch to a man in a sailor's blue jacket—he ran with the watch—she took hold of my coat behind to prevent my following, and the watchman came up—the male prisoner was the man she gave it to—he was not above half-a-dozen yards from the spot—I could see the watch handed from her to him—I dare say he was eight, or ten, or twelve yards off—I cannot form a judgment whether he was aware what she was about—these was light—I think he was near enough to see her take it—he was near enough to see me and her—I had nothing whatever to do with the female, and had no intention—I saws her hand the watch to Palmer, and he ran away with it—I was not two yards from him when I saw it in his hand—I could almost have laid my hand on him, only she caught me by my coat to prevent my following him—I remained in that way till the watchman came up—the man was taken about a fortnight afterwards I believe—I have never seen my watch again.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-shop in High-street, Islington. On the night of the 17th of September, there was an alarm of a coat being lost—I heard the door shut, ran out, and saw the prisoner six or eight doors off with the coat, which he dropped, after running six or eight doors further—I lost sight of him, but to the best of my knowledge he is the man—he also threw away a pair of my shoes, which I had placed at the foot of the stairs about two or three o'clock that afternoon—the prisoner had been taking coffee in the house, and paid for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am store—keeper at Buckingham Palace. The pri<lb/>soner Nicholls was employed there as a labourer, and I placed confidence in him—there was a box containing lace in one of the top rooms—Nicholls had access to it—It was old silver-gilt lace, and of a particular pattern—the box was nailed and screwed—I did not see the lace put in, but I opened the box, I think in November last; I saw the lace safe then—then box was full—It was again fastened down in the same manner, with screws and nails—I opened it again on the day after the prisoners were taken—I believe it was the 1st of September—I found it had been opened, as the screws were so very slack and the nails had been forced—I opened it in the presence of a witness, and a quantity of the lace was missing—I cut a piece of the lace off, and gave it to the officer—It was His Majesty's property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Smart, a refiner, in Princes-street. I do all the-work in the back shop, where lace is burned—I remember the prisoner Shadford coming to my master's on the 8th of June—he brought a quantity of silver-gift gimp lace, which had been used—I burnt it for him—It came to rather better than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not make any inquiry of him them—he came again the same afternoon, and brought some more lace, unburned—I asked him where it came from—he said it came off some coats; that he was a tailor by trade, and he had taken it in exchange—I told him I never saw such lace come off coats—he said that was very likely, as they were foreign—he told me some name which I do not recollect, and said his address was No. 55, St. Martin's-lane—I burnt that lace, and he went into the shop and received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. some odd silver for that—he then continued to come to our place once or twice in a fortnight, and brought burnt lace, which appeared to me the same as the first he brought, as far as I could judge, but the burning would a little alter its appearance—a person would lose by burning the lace himself, as he does not understand it—on the 22nd of August he brought two parcels of lace, which had been burnt—I observed to him that the lace had not been properly cleaned, and he gave it me to clean for him—I said, "This is some of the same sort of lace I have done for you before?"—he said, "Yes, it is; I had it from the same man, and the same place"—we bought that lace of him; it came to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he had a quantity more at home, and I said he had better bring it, and let me burn it, as he would receive more for it, as he must lose by doing it himself—he came again that day week the 29th, and brought a small piece of lace, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—It was about seven o'clock in the evening, and he asked me if it was too late to burn it—Mr. Smart was then in the way—the prisoner came again on the 31st about eleven o'clock—he asked me if I wanted a Job—I asked him if he had any thing to burn—he said, he had—I told him he must wait a few minutes till I made another fire, as I had a pot of gold on the fire—Mr. Smart then came into the shop—when I told the prisoner I was ready—he put out this piece of lace—Mr. Smart then told him that before he burnt that lace he must se the coats it cam off from—the pri<lb/>soner said, "Oh, no it did not come off coats, it came off bed furniture"—that he bought it, and gave 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, but he did not know the man he bought it of—I told him it was no use, he must know him—as he said he bought it all from one man, he must know him—he then said he would tell the truth, that he had exchanged some clothes for it—that exchange was no robbery, and therefore it was no use to make a bother about it—I asked him if he could not find the man, and said if he could not he must stand in that man's shoes—he then said he could not find him, as he might be a hun<lb/>dred miles off—he then said he thought he could find him if any body would go with him—by Mr. Smart's direction I fetched the policeman, but previ<lb/>ous to that the prisoner was asked his name and address—he did not state his name, but said he lived at No. 4, Catherine-street, Pimlico—when I</p>

               <p>came back with the officer, I found the prisoner just inside the door, and Mr. Smart had him by the collar—he was then given in charge of the officer, to go in search of the man, whom he said he could find—he has received about 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to my knowledge, for the lace he brought at different times.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you know about burning lace? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing, till I was sent to a place in Jewin-street to learn to do it; any labouring man might do it—I told the prisoner he had better bring it to me to burn, because I wanted him to bring it in its original state, that I might see if it was the same—I suspected him from the first day; but after that he never brought any bit what he had burned, but not sufficiently—I was obliged to burn it again—I went to No. 55, St. Martin's-lane—I saw the name of "Day" on the door—there is no one here, that I know of, who ever saw the prisoner at my master's, though sometimes, when he was there, the shop was full of people—my master knows that I am come here to day.</p>

On the 19th of September the prisoner came and said he had come from his father for a second-hand single gun, which was for his uncle—I said, I had no single gun, but a double one—he said, it would make no difference, as his uncle had plenty of money; and as I was cleaning it, he said, "I want a pair of pistols, for an officer of the Osborne-street Court. whose life has been threatened"—I showed him a pair of the case—he said they were just the thing, and he should see the officer on Sunday—I had cleaned the gun—he requested me to make a memorandum of the gun—I said, "In what name?" he said his father's name—the price was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I said, "What name shall I put the pistols in? he said, "The same"—and after doing so, he took the pistols off the counter, and I gave him the gun—he said he would return in two hours, and bring back the gun or the money—I believed all he said—he said he would go home, and that his father and uncle were waiting at Redford-place—I trusted him on his father's account, supposing the father could pay me—I did not sti<lb/>pulate that it should be returned in two hours—he proposed it himself—If he had said three or four hours, I should have been satisfied—the mo<lb/>ney for the pistols was to have been brought on Monday—If the things were not approved of, I expected they would be sent back—after the pro<lb/>perty</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Algar-place, Essex-street, and am an unfortunate girl. I knew the prisoner, Henry Priest, for about a fortnight before the robbery—one morning in August, about eight o'clock, he came to my room—I do not know what day—I have since heard of Dr. Bell's robbery—It was the same morning; he brought a morning-gown, a black silk dress. and a white handkerchief, in a basket—Rosetta Brown saw these things—he asked her to pawn the morning-gown—she went to pawn it—he left about six or seven o'clock in the evening—he mentioned the rob<lb/>bery in Rosetta Brown's presence—next morning he came again, and brought some clothes in a round basket, and a microscope—he went out and took the things away—I do not know where he took them to—I saw a work-box in his possession—(I have seen it since at the police-office,) and a morning-gown, and a box of letters for children—I gave that to Elizabeth Mullany—he told me there had been a robbery committed in his mother's yard, and that he did it—that it was a gentleman and lady going into the country that had been robbed, and that there were some portmanteaus—he asked me to fetch his mother, and meet him at a public-house in Montague-street—I went to his mother's, and asked for her; she came to me—I saw her at her own house, the first house in the yard—when we were going along, she told me she had not time to put the things away before the officers came quick upon her; and when she could not pot them away, she burnt them—I am sure she said that—she mentioned some lace which she burnt—this is the work-box,</p>

She came to my house on the morning of the robbery, and asked for Harriet Priest—I said she was not at home, what did she want—she said Mrs. Priest—I then said, what did she want—she said had I a son named Henry—I said yes, I had—she said I must be very particular, was he at home last night? I SAID, "NO"—she said he was at her place, would I go with her—she took me to a street near where I saw "Rose-lane" written up—she said if I would wait there, she would go and fetch him—I staid about ten minutes, and saw her com<lb/>ing with my son, and another young man—I said to my son, "Henry, where have you been?" and the young man who was with her said, 'Do not stand here, we will go to a public-house, and have a pint of porter"—I then said to my son, "What have you done?"—he said Mr. Bell's place had been broken open—that he did not do it, but he knew those who did do it, and he wished me to get him a shirt, as he was determined to go into the country.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of John Williams, of the Norfolk Arms strand. On the 18th of September, about half-past nine o'clock at night I was at the first-floor window and saw three men standing round the prosecutors's windows, which is opposite—one of them appeared boring something, as if to break the glass—they stood at the left hand corner of the shop window quite close together—I saw one of them put his hand in the window where the glass was broken—I did not hear it breaking—Watford is the one who was boring—he stood on the right-hand side, and was twirling his hands as if he was breaking the glass, for about five mi<lb/>nutes—I then went down stairs, crossed the road, and informed Mr. Simp<lb/>son what was going on—they not see me, as they were looking into the window—they were gone form the window then—they left just before I quitted the window—I then returned to master's window, stopped there a minute or two, and saw Watford walking to and for, as if looking out for a chance to get something out of the window—I went and pointed him out to Mr. Simpson, who took him—I know nothing of the other prisoner—I am sure Watford is the man who was whirling his arm, bor<lb/>ing at the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an hosier and glover, and live at No. 178, Strand. Goatley came to me on Friday night, the 18th, between nine and ten o'clock—he came over first, about half-past nine o'clock, and gave me some information, and in consequence of that, I went and examined my window, and found it was perfectly secure—he came over very shortly afterwards—I then went out and examined my window, and found a pane of glass broken or cut, and a piece out of it large, enough to admit a person's hand—this piece of glass fell inside, on a piece of handker<lb/>chief—It appears as if it had been cut completely out—It was perfectly smooth, and the rest of the pane remained—the piece taken out was as oval cut from corner—that was done between the first and second time of his coming over—the remainder of the pane was perfectly smooth—there were some pieces of silk handkerchief in that pane of glass—the hole was cut about three inches above the silk-handkerchiefs, and was large enough to admit a person's hand, and a piece of silk to be drawn through, for I tried it—I took Watford into custody about two minutes after I saw the hole—I was talking to Duke at my door, and he pointed out Watford—that was after I had discovered the hole—I seized him—he asked what I took him for—I said he knew as well as I did—he said I had no business to pull him about—a policeman then came up and took him—I do not think there was any body in the shop at the time Duke gave the information the first time—I did not leave the shop, but the noise is so great in the street that a whole pane of glass might he broken and I not hear it—I must have been in the shop at the time it was done—I can only see the top of the window in the shop, for the goods in the window concealed the corner in which this happened—It is impossible for me to see it—I do not think my boy was in the shop at the time—I think he was getting his supper—some braces were hung over where the aperture was made, and some were lying on the silk handkerchiefs—I think they had been pulled out of their place or they might have got there by accident or my boy might have displaced them; with that exception I do not think any think had been displaced.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the night in question about half-past nine o'clock and saw the two prisoners standing at the corner of a court, nearly opposite the prosecutor's premises—I should think about thirty yards distance—I observed them several times between half-past nine and ten o'clock, when I passed backwards and forwards on my best—they sometimes separated; Barrett went up the court leading to Holywell-street whenever he saw me coming, and Watford invariably went up or down the Strand—this happened about three times—they were standing still, with their heads protruding out of the court, and as I came up one went up the court, and the other up or down the Strand—I am certain they are the men—I had notseen them before that night, but I have some slight notion of Barrett—after observing them three time, I heard a cry of "Stop thief," from the premise of Simpson—I was then farther down the Strand, the saw Barrett running towards me from Mr. Simpson's—he was running as fast as he could—I ran after him—he turned down Arundel-street, and I followed him—I was never nearer to him than thirty or forty yards—I called "Stop thief"—I did not see him stopped, but came up just at the time—I found a man had got him by the collar—I am sure he is the man I had seen three times with Watford, and whom I saw running—I took him from the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of the prosecutor. On the night in question, I stood at the door when master went out—I could see into the street—that was after Duke had given the information—as I stood at the door, I saw Barrett and Watford over the way, on the op<lb/>posite side of the street—Watford was standing with his back towards Barrett, and looking towards the public-house; and Barrett was looking towards our shop—Duke came over to master, and told him that was the person over the way in the brown coat—I did not hear him give infor<lb/>mation about Warford—he pointed to the one in the brown coat—I be<lb/>lieve it was Barrett—I did not give any name to the Magistrate; I said, he pointed to the one in the brown coat—Duke pointed with his finger towards his master's house, where they were standing, and said, "That is one in the brown coat"—Mr. Simpson immediately ran over, and laid hold of the one in the brown coat—the other did not observe it, as he was looking in at the public-house—his back was towards him—when the prisoner turned round, and observed Mr. Simpson, he got hold of the other one's collar, he immediately ran—that was the one (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Watford</hi>) that was taken on the spot—he had a brown coat on at the time—the other immediately ran away down Arundel-street, and turned down Water-street</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210154"/>
               <p>and I after him—I laid hold of his collar, and had not time to say any thing, before he struck me—there was a cry of "Stop thief"—I am sure the man who struck me, was the man who had been standing with the man in the brown coat—I never lost sight of him till after he struck me; he then got out of my sight, and the policeman took him—I was on the ground, and when I got up, the policeman had got him—I am sure Barrett is the one who ran away—he knocked me down on my knees, and said, "You b----y young b----r if you don't let go, I will knock your brains out"—he struck me on the left ear, and knocked me on the knees.</p>

I live in Southampton-street, in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-fields. the prisoner was in any service—on the 11th of September, about three o'clock, I saw my silver tea-pot and basin and ewer safe, in a chest of drawers in my bed-room—I left town that even<lb/>ing, returned on the 15th—when I came home the prisoner was there, and remained about three hours—she then went on an errand, which need not have taken her three minutes, and she did not return for an hour and a half—I felt exceedingly angry, and she then went away—I did not miss this property till last Tuersday evening—this is it—It is worth about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am labourer in trust at Greenwich Hospital. On Monday, the 7th of September, I was at the infirmary of the Hospital, at noon—there was some alteration being made in the roof at the time—there were three plumbers and three labourers employed in stripping the copper; Marshall, Marriot, and Emmet were the plumbers, and the three laboureres I saw go away at noon—they appeared very bulky—I thought there was something under their jackets, and followed them into No. 4, Thames-street—I saw them go into the side door—I waited about two minutes, and saw Williams the labourer come out—I did not see how the door was opened—I was the others come out afterwards, and speak to Wil<lb/>liams—I afterwards saw the three plumbers come out; Emmett came out first—I saw Marriot counting money as he came out—I immediately went in by the side of them, before the door closed; when I got inside, I saw Mrs. Ingram standing at her inner door—I asked her to let me look inside—she asked what my business was—I said I wanted to look inside—she said she could not, as her husband was not at home—I said if I could not look in by fair means, I must by foul—she stood with her back to the door—she appeared alarmed, and allowed me to look inside, which I did, and saw six pieces of sheet copper lying on the floor; I asked her how she came by it—she said these four men had brought it in, and left it—I asked if she weighed it—she said, "No"—I asked if she had paid any money for it—she said not—I weighed it, and it was 105lbs. I sent for Mr. Lee, the clerk of the works—I remained in possession of the premises till he arrived—he looked at the copper, and fetched two policemen, who came and took charge of it, and took Mrs. Ingram into custody—I afterwards compared the copper with the copper on the premises—It corre<lb/>sponded on every respect with the place it was taken from—It corresponded with the copper which was taken off the infirmary roof, in quality, colour, and thickness, and several marks in it show where it had laid upon the</p>

In con<lb/>sequence of information, I went to Ingram's house, on Tuesday, the 8th of September, after the copper had been removed—the house is at the corner of a road, leading to the water side, called Bishop's-place—the shop is being fitted up for a plumber and glazier—there was a quantity of glass and things in the front shop—there is a door in Thames-street, in the usual way—I went down Bishop's-place, and found a side entrance—that is a very wide door, large enough to admit a cart—when you look at the door, at first it appears to be all one door; but on examining the side of the posts, I discovered a bit of brass, and on pressing my foot on that I found part of the door flew open, so as to admit a man—without that there did not appear a small door in the large one—on going in at that door, I found myself under a shed, with earth for the floor—I afterwards searched under the earth—I went into the workshops adjoining the shed, and removed a box or drawer which stood there with heavy tools in it, and found there was a trap-door—It is in the room adjoining the shed—the trap-door slanted down to a brick vault under the shed, woth boards at the top, and earth over the boards—there is no means of getting to that vault, but through the shoot I have described—the shoot is in the workshop behind the front shop—there was a furnace in the shop—I searched all over the premises, and found property whitch forms the subject of another indict<lb/>ment—the maleprisoner gave himself into my custody on Sunday week last, at Deptford—he said he had had the advice of his solicitor, who ad<lb/>vised him to surrender, and his doing so he hoped would be the means of saving his wife, as she was perfectly innocent.</p>

On the 8th of Septemper, I went to No. 4, Thames-street, Greenwich—I entered at the front door—I did not see either of the prisoners there—there is a gate at the side of the house, large enough for a cart and gig to go under—on going it at that gate, I found a shed with an earth floor—on examining the door, I found a piece of brass at the side, and a write attached to it at one end, and the other end attached to the latch—on pressing my foot against this brass, part of the door flew open, large enough to admit a man—I turned into the middle shop, and on examing the floor, discovered a trap-door which led into a vault under the shed—the trap was made in a slanting position, so that a man might slide down on his back; and in the vault I found a large quantity of sheet copper—on weighing it, I found one ton eleven hundredweight and a half of copper, and three ton three hundred weight of sheet lead, and this flanch—all these were in the vault—I after<lb/>wards went up stairs, and in a small chest of drawers found a quantity of Writing-paper—the drawer was not locked—there was a shop in front of the premises, being fitted up as a plumper and glazier's—I did not perceive any name written up in front.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker. On the 25th of August, about a quarter to ten o'clock at night I was at the prisoner's house—he is a publican—I called for a pot of half-and-half, which he brought, and did not leave it with me, because he asked for the money before he would de<lb/>liver it—he took it back immediately—I had no quarrel with him about that—I called for it again—he brought it, and said the same again—I showed him sixpence and threepence, and said if he would give it to me I would pay him for it directly—he took it back again—he came into the tap-room after, without the beer—I said to the waiter, "<hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, bring me the pot of half-and-half"—he did so—I drank it—the prisoner made no objection to it—that was almost directly after—It was the same pot that the prisoner had brought—he left it standing on the bar—I was in t he tap-room, close against the bar—I asked the prisoner to drink, and he would not—I asked him again, two or three times—I then told him if he did not drink, I would throw some of it over him, and I did so—there was not much left at that time—four of us had drank—I do not think there was half a pint left—he was standing close by me at the time, against the tap-room door, about half a yard from me—I threw it over him, in to his face, and he directly stabbed me with a knife—he did it the instant I threw it over him—he stabbed me with his right hand directly—I did not see where he got the knife—he did not fetch it from any where—there was no time for that—It was done at the instant—the wust have had the knife in his hand—I was stabbed on the side of the nose—the knife remained in my nose—after he stabbed me I turned round—he had run at me, and caught hold of me by the face—there was a bit of a seullle—I directly turned round and said to Harris, "See what the raseal has done—he has stabbed me"—Harris tried to pull</p>

               <p>the knife out of my face, and then I tried, and pulled the handle off, but the blade remained in my face—I directly ran to Mr. Watts the chymist—It was there pulled out with a pair of pincers—after he stabbed me, he had ran and caught hold of my face—I tried to get from him, and struck him in the face, to get away from him—we had no scuflle before I was stabbed, but what I have mentioned—I had known him for about two years, but never had a quarrel with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the prisoner's house on the night in question, near Floyd, in the tap-room—he called for a pot of half-and-half, which the prisoner brought and put down—Floyd asked him to trust him—he said he would not, and took it back—Floyd called for it again—he brought it and took it back again—the waiter came in, and Floyd got it from him—we all four drank round—I was sitting with him—the prisoner saw me drinking—Floyd asked the prisoner to drink, but he would not—he asked him a second time—he would not, and then Floyd threw the remainder over him—he had said, if he would not drink, he would do so—the prisoner was very close to him indeed at that time, and as the prosecutor threw the beer in his face, the pot went within nine or ten inches of his face—they then immediatly both closed in a fighting kisd of manner, in a kind of rally—I saw Floyd throw the prisoner on the seat, and stike him several times in the face while he was down on the seat; and all on a sudden, Floyd jumped back and said, "Look here, look here"—I had seen no sign of stabbing until that time—I was quite close to him—when he turned back and said, "Look here, "the knife was in h is face—I did not see it until after the scuffle.</p>

On the morning of the 25th of August, I saw Hadland and Grout come down St. George's market, near tge Elephant and Castle, with this mare—Gront was riding it, and Hadland walking alongside of it—as they came down the market they saw me—Hadland called me by my name, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Tommy,</hi> will you buy the pony?"—I knew him before very well—I said, "No; the pony will not suit me"—It was a very small pony, about the size of a donkey—I said, "No; it will not suit me; it is blind, and such an object I will not have it"—I called Mr. Bennett, My master, and said, "Here is a pony perhaps will suit one of your little boys"—my master truned round and saw it, and asked if I knew the two men—I said, "Yes; I know them both"—master bid 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and Grout took it—I saw him paid—my master gave them a bit of steak, and they went over the way and had sixpenny worth of gin—the pony was claimed the next day, and master gave it up to Price.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the Thames police. I was with the last witness on the occasion—I went first to a house nearly opposite the prisoner's and I saw from the first floor landing window, the prisoner, John Jones, come to the window with his coat off, his shirt sleeves tucked up, and hold<lb/>ing in his right hand, something white, which I believe to be a mould—he went away for a few moments, and returned again, holding something in his hand, which I believe to be a whole mould—he was looking towards the end of it, the top—the female prisoner was in the room at the same time, sitting in the window, doing something by the motion of her hand, but what I cannot say, as a curtain went across the window; she was without her gown—this was between eleven and twelve o'clock—and between twelve and one o'clock the same day I saw John Jones come out of the house—he was gone about ten minutes, and then returned with the pri<lb/>soner Gladwin, they both went into the house; stopped in ten or fifteen minutes, and came out again—Gladwin, John Jones, and an old woman, a child, and the female prisoner all came out—Jones and Gladwin came out first, and the others followed and shut the door—I came out of the house where I was, and saw them part—Gladwin went up a street, and John Jones went a-head, and his wife followed him—this was all on Tuesday the 8th, between eleven and one o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> State what happened on the 11th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the Friday following, I went with Fogg, Mitchell, and the other officer—I got over some palings, about half-past four in the afternoon, and went to the back door of the house with Fogg and another officer—Fogg stopped at the door a few moments, with his finger on the latch, and when he heard a knock at the front door—he opended the door—I followed and went through the room to the door—I unbolted the front door, which was bolted at the top, and let Mitchell in, and went into the room again with him—I have heard what Fogg has said, and agree with it, as far as I was present after the prisoners were secured, on the table next to where John Jones sat, I found a small file, and in a cupboard next to where he sat, on the lower shelf, I found two paper bags, containing, I believe plaster of Paris, and a small paper of what I call fine sand, (but I believe it turns out to be linseed meal, the female prisoner calls it linseed-meal,) and something else with it; and I found in the same cupboard two tin bands.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames police-constable. I was with the party—Isbester was acting under my orders on the 8th—on the 11th I went to the front door—Isbester let me in—I saw the two prisoners Jones and Gladwin—Fogg had got hold of Jones's hand, and he handed me some counterfiet half-crowns, which I produce—after the prisoners were secured I went to the fire, took off a tea-kettle, and saw some parts of a mould on the fire—one of them lying at the back part, and the half of a mould with the reverse side of a half-crown impressed on it—before I disturbed it, I called Fogg to look at it—as I took it out of the fire, it broke, and with the tongs and my fingers I took all I could see out of the fire and placed it on the hob—my fingers were burnt; and while</p>

               <p>I was blowing my fingers, John Jones came behind me—he made either a kick or a bolw with his foot on the hob, and smashed the pieces of the mould more than they were before—I afterwards received from Fogg six crowns and eight half-crowns in a stocking, they are counterfeit—I searched the ashes, and found an iron ladle, with the appearance of white lead in it—on the top of a cupboard or dresser I found the half of half-a-crown, and one metal spoon—on the table by Jones I found five other white spoons—I asked Jones who the house belonged to—he said "I took it;" and pointed to Gladwin, he said, "That old man has nothing to do with it—he knows nothing of my business, or what I do"—I afterwards took the moulds to Mr. Powell, the solocitor, and in my presence they put them together as they are now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Mint, and have been so nearly twenty years—I have examined all the nineteen half-crown pro<lb/>duced by Fogg, they are all counterfeit—those nineteen produced by Mitchell are all counterfeit—and the six crowns produced by Mitchell are all counter<lb/>feit—the half-crowns are from two different moulds, of the date of 1821 and 1825, in the reigb of George the Fourth—here are eight more half-crowns, and a plaster of Paris mould; on one side of which here is part of the impres<lb/>sion of the obverse side of a half-crown, and on the other, a very small portion of the reverse; of the reign of George the Fourth, 1825, which is the date of some of the half-crowns—this mould does not appear to me to have been used for castint—here is another plaster of Paris mould for half-crowns—that is broken also but there are portions of the impres<lb/>sions of the obverse and reverse sides of a half-crown of 1825; it has nearly the entire impression of the reverse side, this appears to have been used considerably, and I believe some of the half-crowns produced have been cast on this mould, for I find some corresponding indentures in the plaster which correspond with some of the half-crowns—here is another mouls for half-crowns also, which appears to be of the date of 1821, the figures are not complete, but here is the 2 and 1 and a portion of the 8, and the type corresponds with the impression of that year—here are two tin bands, such as are usually made use of for forming plaster of Paris moulds, and I believe these moulds have been formed in these bands—these white metal spoons are similar metal to the half-crowns, and that is the usual way coiners provide metal—here is plaster of Paris in powder, in the bag; and a file which is necessary to round off the edge of the coin—I do not know what this sand is used for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse-dealer, and live in Red-lion-yard, Hol<lb/>born. On the 8th of June I started two omnibuses, to run from Paddington, in Middlesex, to the Bank—I took out two licenses, Nos. 348 and 349—they ran from Paddington along Oxford-street and Holborn—at that time, Thomas Bolton, James Bardell, Joseph Bardell, Richard Bird, Thomas Bird, Richard Carpenter, William Cowderoy, James Hill, Joseph Johnson,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210198"/>
               <p>John Newell, Samuel Pearce, Josiah Parkes, philip sellick, and Robert Trevett had omnibuses on that road—my omnibuses started between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, from Paddington—on the first day, I was watching to see my omnibuses come down Holborn, and there were two or three omnibuses with each, hunting them, and driving them on as fast as they could; Trevett's and Bolton's omnibuses in particular, and Mr. Bird's also—I believe there was no other that day—I watched them several other days, and saw them drive close up to he pavement, and drive their poles close up to my omnibns, so that no passenger could get in—on those other days I saw the omnibuses belonging to the other defendants I have named doing so—I do not know that there was one who has not done so—the whole of them have been a continual annoyance—on the 15th, I lengthened one of my omnibuses to Maida—hill, still continuing on the same line of road, through Paddington—on that day, a new omnibus, called "The Emperor," No. 352, with the name of "Edmund Sylvester" on it, started against the one of mine, which ran to Maida—hill; and another, called "The Albion," No. 177, with the name of "Thomas Corbett" on it, started in opposition to the one of mine, which went to Paddington—John Sylvester drove the "Emperor, "and John Smith was the conductor; but whether they did so the first day it started, I cannot tell—Gough drove the "Albion," and one of the Trevett's, (Thomas, I think,) was the conductor—I had observed Cow<lb/>deroy driving his omnibus the first week, which he every now and then does drive—he was one who ran his pole up against me, and put me on one side, and was annoying me—I saw the other defendants in the first week; and omnibuses would come down from Paddington to where I set out, wait till I came out of my yard, follow my omnibuses up to Paddington, wait till they turned round to go, and then immediately gallop close before them—one day, one of my horses came home with the wheel run over his foot—sometimes there was a pannel broken—I saw Sylvester's omnibus run against my pannel one day in Oxford-street—I have seen them come fol<lb/>lowing my <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> home, without plying for hire; and they would stop for an hour, to see whether we attempted to go out again—this was done frequently, every day almost—about three weeks after we started, there came a very rainy day—one of my <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> let water—we took the passengers out, and put them in another <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—I got into the bus that let water, and made them drive it down to the maker's in Whitechapel; and the "Emperor" followed me all the way, and stopped there four hours—John Sylvester drove the "Emperor" there, and John Smith was the conductor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever meet any of the defendants any where? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Yes; the first I saw of them was Josiah Parkes—I forget when it was but it was near the beginning of my starting—I found him in my yard in Holborn, when I got there, we went into the public-house, and had a glass of brandy-and-water—he told me I was a madman to start if I did not buy times—that the "Pad<lb/>dington committee" would run me off the road, and ruin me—I said no, I should try—I alterwards saw Trevett, Hill, and Cowderoy, all three together, I think it was on the 4th of July—I had just come home from the bazaar, and got out of the <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> when Robert Trevett came, laid hold of my coat, and said I should go and have something to drink—I said I had not had my dinner, and I seldom took any thing before dinner—he said, would I come back—I said I would—I went back, and Trevett, Hill, and Cowderoy were there, drinking—they asked me whether I meant to do what was rights—I said I meant to stop if I could, and keep on my omnibus they said it</p>

               <p>was no use, for their committee was so strong it was no use for one to op<lb/>pose them—It would cost them about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week each man, and it would cost me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to oppose them, and if I could afford to stand the loss of that I had better stop—I said, "Never mind that, I shall stop as long as I can"—Cowderoy said, "Why don't you buy times, and belong to us?"—I said I never would belong to any committee of that kind while I lived—I would stop, if I could, and Cowderoy said, "Ah, do, old one, start half a dozen, that will soon end it"—they got drinking very hard, and got warm with liquor, but nothing more passed about the omnibuses, except that I should be sure to be ruined; and Hill said, "He is an old one, and has been amongst us many years; we must let him in some how or another"—Cowde<lb/>roy said, "Why don't you sell him your times?" and Hill said, "I will take five hundred guineas for them"—my son was there at that time—I left them to go home—Hill ran over the road, caught hold of me, and said they had been standing treat to me, and I must to them—I said I wanted no more, but I would give him a glass of brandy-and-water—we went, and Joseph Bardell came to the door—we went out, and spoke to him in the street—he said, "It is of no use your going against this committee; they will ruin you as sure as you are born; go and buy somebody's time"—he said they were such b----y <hi rend="italic">out-and-outers,</hi> they would beat anybody, and even if Mr. Horne, or the greatest stage—master in London were to start against the Paddington committee, they would be sure to be beaten—he said, "Hill, why don't you sell him your times?"—Hill said, "I did offer them to him a little while age at five hundred guineas, but I won't take six hundred for them now"—my son was not present at that time—I had no further conversation with Bardell and Hill that night, but I have seen Bardell frequently—he told me they would be sure to best me—they would have nobody there but what belonged to the committee, and bought times—he said he belonged to the committee, but did not often go—Robert Trevett has called upon me three or four times—he has told me it was no use my running, they would suffer no one on the road except they pur<lb/>chased times—he said I had better purchase times, or I should be ruined—they had ruined several, and they would ruin me—Bolton has called upon me three or four times, and had the same conversation, but he ad<lb/>vised me at one time to go to Kentish—town—I made a reply that I did not like Kentish—town, as the turnpikes were heavy—he said the turn-pikes should not cost me much, as he was proprietor of the gates—he said it was no use my attempting to go against so many of them, that they paid but a trific a week in, and there was such a body of them it was foolish of any one individual going against so many of them—I do not recollect having any conversation with any of the other defendants—I run on and was losing a great deal of money, till I called a sale at Mr. Allen's, in St. Martin's, on Wednesday, the 29th of July—my omnibuses stopped for that sale on Sunday night the 26th—the other omnibuses continued with me—they came dowm on Saturday morning, the 25th, and followed me all day long—they seldom came on a Sunday—I did not see them on the Monday—my sale took place on Wednesday—I sold five horses—my omnibuses were only on bire—on the Thursday my Paddington one went out again—the de<lb/>fendants' omnibuses were out that day, but I did not see them—on the Friday I saw the "Emperor" and the "Albion" follow my one <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—they <hi rend="italic">tuco'd</hi> him, as they call it, all day, one before and the other behind—selveaterdrove the "Emperor," and I believe Gough drove the "Albion"—I started my other omnibus on the 2nd of August—the other omnibus still</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210200"/>
               <p>continued to pursue me in the same way as before, or rather worse, as they supposed I was beaten, and they set too with more vengeance against me—one of my omnibuses is on still—the other ceased running on the 30th of August—the whole of this book is not in my handwriting, but I see it every day of my life, either night or morning—It contains the earnings of each bus—I have seen John Sylvester up at Paddington two or three times—he has said, "It is a pity you should go on so; why don't you come and buy time? they will never let you have any time without you come and buy time"—Smith joined in the same conversation—neither of them told me who employed them, but I have seen the same horses working in the "Emperor," and then in Mr. Bolton's omnibuses—and the horses worked in the Albion" in Mr. Trevett's—I have been a horse-dealer thirty-six or thirty-seven years, and have been unfortunate twice.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever tell Lee or Mann to stick close to Trevett's omnibus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never in my life to stick close to any omnibus—I do not know Mr. Carr, a hatter, who keeps a shop opposite Day and Martin's—I do not re<lb/>collect being at a hatter's shop opposite Day and martin's, on White<lb/>Tuesday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever use this expression, that you had begun the opposition, and you would stick close to the old thief, Trevett, and take a little of the <hi rend="italic">bounce</hi> out of him, let it cost what it would? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never in my life—I know budd, the timekeeper at the Bank—I never said in his presence that I would ran against the old cobler and melt his wax—Trevett taxed me with that—he said he had heard from his nepher that I had said those</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long is it since your first bankruptcy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About seven years—I was then a horse-dealer, and in the same yard which I now keep—I purchased the premises about three months afterwards—they took bills for them at different dates—my first divident was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; there was another about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and there will be ano<lb/>ther—I will swear that more than 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has been paid—my second bank<lb/>ruptey was at the latter end of 1834—there has been no dividend declared on that as yet—It is in the hands of Mr. Green—I cannot tell what my cre<lb/>ditors will get—Hill asked me to give 500 guineas to buy time—I dare say he knew I was a bankrupt—when a man is unfortunate it is generally known—I hava had conversation with a person of the name of Bardell, the brother of the two Bardells who are indicated—he is a vetrinary surgeon, and a very respectable man—he asked me how I came to indict them—I said it was my attorney's advice, and I could not go from it—my attorney is Mr. Norton—he advised me to indict the Bardells—I went with Mr. Bardell to Mr. Norton's, and there was a conversation about their putting in bail. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now Mr. Bardell is alive, and is here; do you remember his asking Mr. Norton why he advised you to put his two brothers into the indict<lb/>ment, when they were innocent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect it—Mr. Norton might have dropped such an expression as, That he was determined they should not be witness for the other defendants—It was not in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that such a villanous expression might be used, and you forget it; such an infamous expression? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Norton's answer was, "we have no occasion to press the indictment against your brothers"—Mr. Bardell went on to say something about the bail, and Mr. Norton said, "The indictment has no occassion to be pressed against your brothers; they have not much to fear; but you must put in bail"—he said that after advising me to include them in the indictment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any thing said about a hundred pounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never to me, or to Mr. Bardell in my presence, upon my oath; nor did Mr. Norton say that he put the Bardells into the indictment that they should not be wit<lb/>nesses, nor anything to that effect—Mr. Norton did not tell me why he put the Bardells in the indictment—I went to him to indict the Paddington committee, and he indicted whom he pleased—I appointed with Mr. Bar<lb/>dell to meet him at Mr. Norton's—I went there to meet him—he got there first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Norton say that their names must remain in the indict<lb/>ment; his object was to prevent their being witnesses; because, if they were ommitted, the paddington proprietors would subpœna them against Bray? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, sir; nor that their evidence would be of importance, I having commissioned Joseph Bardell to raise 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take my omni<lb/>buses iff the road, and discontinue further opposition; and if he could not get 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to take 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they to take my stock at a valuation—there was not a word said about it—we were there half an hour, talking about the indictment a little, but the most was about putting in bail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath. was not the appointment to go to Norton with Bar<lb/>dell to try to get his brothers out of the indictment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the agree<lb/>ment was for Mr. Norton not to oppose the bail, but take them on Mon<lb/>day—there was nothing said about getting his brothers out of the indict<lb/>ment—I never in any way wanted money to settle this business.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Nonton say in Mr. Bardell's presence, that if the proprietors did not consent to your proposition, he would ruin Bolton, Pearee, Bird, and Trevett, or he would have his heart out and his limbs broken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No: Bardell was not desired to ask his brothers if the proprietors would come to terms—I saw Mann this morning—I do not know whether he is a wit<lb/>ness for me—he is one of the persons who complained that he was hunted—I never gave Mann directions to drive against Bolton—not any person—I do not know this man (<hi rend="italic">looking at a man named Archer</hi>)—I never saw him before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say to your conductor, in Archer's presence, "Go on wwith that omnibus (<hi rend="italic">pointing to one</hi>), and stick to him; I will have the shirt off his back before I have done with him?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never in my life—I know Parish, the policeman, No. 45—I never had any conversation with him about this—I do not know that ever he was obliged to lead my omni<lb/>bus out of the way—I know No. 7 has—I never spoke to him in the Poultry about my opposition, to my knowledge—I know a person named Alexander—I have no recollection of mentioning the name of Alexander to Parish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect his saying that you could not expect the people would let you take the bread out of their months withour giving you some trouble? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I think I have heard such words, but I think it was from No. 7, not from Parish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say, "I should have been very well off, if Alexander had not put me in the hold?" A. I said I should have been better off if Alexander had come out with me, as he promised—I possibly might say we should have made the Paddington masters look about them—I have been summoned two or three times by the police for causing an obstruction—I have heard of the names of Colson and Wilson as time-keepers—I have seen Colson, and spoken to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever said this in his presence, That unless you could receive 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the proprietors, you would indict them all fro a conspi<lb/>racy, and ruin them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never in my life to any soul—I remember two of Trevett's mem being taken into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember using this expression, in the presence of Colson, that you had been as good as your word; it was not the men you wished to hurt, as you could get nothing out of them, but their masters, and that the law must take its course, unless you were paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take your omnibus off?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, to any man upon earth—I have spoken to Bates, the policeman, No. 7—he has summoned my driver two or three times fro obstructing the road and he summoned me twice, once was for taking time at the Bank—he said I should not take time—my man got off by paying 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was summoned to Marlborough-street—one of Mr. Bol<lb/>ton's omnibuses ran against mine—my son got into a gallop, and they were both <hi rend="italic">had up</hi>—It is the men that are summoned, but the master always at<lb/>tends, and if they are fined he pays it—I know Bates has often told me of my men doing wrong—I said, "Then summons them, I have nothing to do with it; I have spoken to my men about it, and they said they did no such thing"—I cannot tell whether Mann is here—I have not subpœnaed him—I was not afraid that he would tell the jury that I ordered him to drive against Bolton—I never said so—nor about getting 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know the policeman, No. 13—I do not know his name—I recollect his having two persons in custody one night at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. On the 8th of June, my father commenced running two omnibuses, Nos. 348 and 349—I have been coachman to both of them—I began about three weeks after they started, but I was repeatedly with them before—I rode on horseback with them—the drivers of the other omnibuses tried to oppose us and to injure us, by pulling up against us—they would cross us and go before our <hi rend="italic">buses,</hi> and their conductors would jump down, if passengers bailed us, to get them away from our <hi rend="italic">buses</hi>—the names of the present defendants were on those omnibuses—Bolton had five on the stones, Bardells, 1 think, had four, Richard Bird had two, Thomas Bird had two, Carpenter had two, Cowderoy had sometimes five sometimes six, Hill had two, I believe—John<lb/>son,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210205"/>
               <p>I think, had three, Newell had three, Pearce had three, Parkes had three or four, Sellick had three, and Trevett two—they were all run<lb/>ning on the road before the 15th of June, and it was them which so annoyed us—on the 15th of June, the "Albion" and the "Emperor," op<lb/>position omnibuses, were put on—I cannot exactly remember who was the coachman of the "Albion," but John Gulliver drove it, and when he did not, some odd man did; George Dodd was the conductor; John Gough has driven it, and Trevent been the conductor—I do not know his christian name—I believe it is Robert—the name on the "Albion" was Thomas Corbett, No. 177, and on the "Emperor" was the name of Edmund Syl<lb/>vester—It was No. 352—the driver of that was John Sylvester, and the conductor John Smith—these two followed us every where we went, and the other omnibuses still pursued the same line of conduct as they had before—when we stopped, the opposition omnibuses stopped also—I saw that done on the 15th—about three weeks after that I began driving—I think No. 348 was the first I drove—I cannot tell which of the opposition omnibuses accompained that—I think it was the "Emperor"—but one of them did, and sometimes both of them—we started from the Wheatsheaf, at Paiddington, and went to the Bank, and the opposition omnibuses accom<lb/>pained us, if we stopped they stopped also—If we turned round, they would turn and follow us up the by-streets and any where else—If I met any of the other omnibuses they would stop with me also, so that I had always two with me.</p>

               <p>they should be sure to ruin us—he said they were ordered to follow us wherever we went, and to stop out till ten o'clock at night—(they very often wished me to go to Edgeware, and dared me to go forty or fifty miles into the country, and they would follow)—he has also said it was not use to run in opposition against the Paddington committee, they were so strong—I have not heard Smith say as much as that—he has said, when he has met Mr. Bolton, "That is our governor," or, "Do you see our governor?"—our conductor was Joseph Raines—we stopped on the 26th of July—they had continued to follow us till that day—I think that day they stopped at Paddington—my father came out again on the 29th, and I went out on the 30th with No. 348—the "Emperor" accomopained me then—my omnibus broke down; and when I drove the other <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> the four o'clock journey, they both accompained me—If a passenger tried to get in, they would jump down, and try to persuade him to get into their <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>

                  </hi>. I am son of the defendant, Robert Trevett. He has some omnibuses which run from Paddington to the Bank—I remember Mr. Bray starting two omnibuses—I do not remember the day of the month, but I saw them at the Wheatsheaf on Whit-Monday—John Lee was the driver of one of them, and I believe h is conductor was <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Raines—the driver of the other was Henry Mann, better known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Cuddy</hi> Mann, and James Trevett, who is a cousin of mine, was the conductor—he had once been in my father's employment some time ago—Lee had been in my father's service, but had left, and Mann had been employed to do odde work when other men were away, or ill—the first I saw of Brau's <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> was at the Wheatsheaf, and when one of my father's <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> started from the Wheatsheaf, one of Bray's started with it—I think Lee drove that—my father's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> started at its regular time—my father has has omnibuses on that road about five years, I should think—when Shillibeer started in Sep<lb/>tember, he started the first omnibus about January—on the day Bray's omnibuses appeared, my father's omnibus went down to the Bank, I sup<lb/>pose—Robert Willis drove it—I cannot recollect who was the conductor—I did not see Bray in the course of that day—I saw my father's omnibus, shout five o'clock that day, come down to the stable, in Market-street, Paddington, and Bray's omnibus followed my father's down to the stable, and passed by—that was out of the regular line of road—my father's omni<lb/>bus stood outside the horses went into the stable, and staid there about forty minutes—It was tea-time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the conductor or driver of Bray's omnibus say any thing while they were following your father's to the stable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; as they passed they said, "We will break the b----y cobler; we will melt his b----y wax"—that was either the driver or the conductor—I believe it wa <hi rend="italic">Cuddy</hi> Mann—my father is a bot and shoemaker, and lives in Finasbury—I re<lb/>member my father's omnibus starting again that eventing—while we had been waiting, Bray's <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> were at the Fountain Abbey, the public-house at the corner—our <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> always go roung that corner, and as soon as our buses turned that corner, I saw Bray's men get up in haste and follow them our—two <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> went from the yard together, and both Bray's followed them—they started from the Wheatsheaf, at Paddington, which is about half a mile from the Fountain Abbey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever observed your omnibuses and Bray's on the line of road? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Yes; I think on Whit-Tuesday, the 9th of June, I saw Bray's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> and my father's in Regent-circus, Oxfort-street—that is the place they generally call at—the Magistrates will not let them stand there, so they trail gently bu; but they were thenstanding at the corner of Ox<lb/>ford-street—I saw a gentleman passenger in the act of getting into my father's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, and Lee, who was then conductor to Bray's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, went to my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210220"/>
               <p>father's <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> and pulled the passenger away, and put him into Bray's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he put his hands round the gentleman, and pulled him right away—I was not near enough to hear any thing said—Lee and the conductor of my father's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> got fighting through it—the fight did not last above a mi<lb/>nute—some one parted them—the omnibises then went off together—I believe ours was a little first—they were very nearly abreast—the "Al<lb/>bion, "No. 177, was my father's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he has no partner in any way—I have seen Bray's and my father's racing together since the time I spoke of, but not to notice any particular circumstance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know there is a Paddington committee? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not—there is what is erronecously called a committee, a meeting of the proprie<lb/>tors of that road—they meet on Thursday nights at the White Lion—I have been at the meeting—It is held in the first floor front room—any one may walk in—there has been no secrecy when I was present—there is very seldom any thing done there at all—sometimes some of the pre<lb/>prietors would come and tell another that his men had been kincking up a disturbance on the road—It was always settled between the person who made the complaint, and the person whose servants were complained of—I have known of drivers being discharged by the proprietors on account of—their misconduct—I cannot say who it was—the subscription that was paid was half-a-crown a week for each member—It was to pay the time-keepers—there is no other subscription among the proprietors that I know of—the half-crown was not paid there in general—one of the conductors pays for his three omnibuses down Oxford-street—there are several time-keepers—one is deputed to receive the subscriptions, and pay the others—I never knew of any subscrition between my father and the other pro<lb/>prietors, to support any opposition while Mr. Bray was running his omni<lb/>buses—I have the sole management of my father's omnibus business, and had it at that time—If there had been any subscription made to oppose Bray, it must have come under my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERGEANT BUMPUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This which is "er<lb/>roneously called a committee" meets at the White Lion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know that I have ever omitted going for the last four months—some<lb/>times there are only two or three of the proprietors there—It is called the Paddington Committee—I do not know of any jurisdiction that it has—the proprietors who formerly fixed the times go to that meeting—they all go occasionally there—I never knew of any secretary—my father has had an omnibus, called the "Tally Ho," on that road for some time—that was put on against a man's omnibus of the name of Lewis, and run him down last autumn—I know the name of George Craig—I never knew he was a pro<lb/>prietor—I know Shillibeer personally—I do not remember his being run against—not for six months, I do not—I remember an omnibius with the name of Newman on it; that was run against, and run off, and he sold it to Bolton, I believe—Bolton set up an opposition against him, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not Bolton's always follow Newman's wherever it went? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen it before it, and behind, and on the same line of road—It was one of Bolton's <hi rend="italic">buses</hi>—I do not remember the name of it, or who was the driver on conductor—Mrs. Turnbull was a proprictor up to the last nine months—I never remember seeing her name on a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>. nor her attending the commit<lb/>tee—I did nto attend them rugularly till the last Christmas—I have bees there before—I do not remember seeing her there—I do not remember her having an omnibus run against her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you whether the very same omnibus that ran against Newman was not put on against Mrs. Turnbull? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, to my knowledge—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210221"/>
               <p>never was present where Mrs. Turnbull was, nor when any thing was said about a demand of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon her, or any other sum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the expense of running an omnibus from Paddington if you get no customers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week; it depends on the number of journeys it runs, and whether a man is fortunate in his cattle; that is for one <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> five journeys a-day—I do not know how many proprietors there are—I never reckoned them up—I know Thomas Evans and George Bingham.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As far as I understand, your being at Regent-street was a mere ac<lb/>cident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was there for the purpose of watching—I think it was after dinner—I thought I woulde take a walk down the the road, to see in what manner Bray worked his <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> against my father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that you believe the number of your father's omnibus was 177: just recollect, was not the No. 177 upon the "Albion" that was put against Bray on the 15th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear to that being the number on that day—theree is more than one bus of my father's on the road—when a new license is taken, there is not always a new number—Thomas Corbett is a boot-clicker—he is foreman to my father in his shop—I remember the time when it was thoought that Bray was off the road, when his horses went for sale—I do not know that the "Albion" had the horses arrayed in blue ribbons—I supped that night with the people at the White Lion—my fa<lb/>ther was present—I did not see Bolton there, nor Cowderoy—he might have been there without my seeing him—there were a great number of persons—the room was full—they were the coachmen and the conductors of any om<lb/>nibuses, I believe—I do not know who paid—I never saw my father pay any thing—I do not believe he did pay any thing—I do not think he could pay without my knowing it—I sat close to him—I did not pay any thing,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell me somebody that was there beside your father—was Gough there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he was—I did not see Sullivan there—I do not know Smith—I did not see either of the Bardells, nor Carpenter, nor either of the Birds—I do not know that Johnson was there, nor Hill, nor Pearce—he might be there—Thomas Evans was there, to the best of my knowledge—the room was full of a number of people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand that you do not recollect any person but Gough, your father, and Evans? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear to any other person being there—I was there, I should think, an hour and a half—I had a glass of gin and water after supper—there was nobody in the chair that I know of, or at the head of the room; it was all confusion, sometimes one sat at my right hand, and sometimes another—my father sat next to me on my left hand, part of the time—I cannot tell who sat at my other hand any part of the time—I do not know who paid—I understood that Evans and Cowderou's omnibuses had had a quarrel, and had been racing together for a few days, and had settled their difference, and they had a supper over it—I did not see blue ribbons on the horses in the "Albion. "</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not individually give a sum of money towards that supper in the morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not see my fathe give any thing—he goes down in the City in the morning, and from time to time he goes with the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—I cannot tell whether Cowderoy does—I have seen him on <hi rend="italic">buses,</hi> driving—my father's first time in the morning, is about twenty minutes after nine o'clock, and he has three times—his next journey is about twelve o'clock, or a few minutesw after, and his next time about a quarter before three o'clock—the "Albion," which runs against Bray, came to my father's yard every night.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210222"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does he continue from that time up to this to have the same three times? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has three omnibuses running down Oxford-street—one does not run with the other two the whole day, two follow cach other every time—the first of all that he has starts before twenty minutes after Bine o'clock, about a quarter of an hour or twenty minntes before it—I do not know the precise time that the <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> start, I trust that to the men—the second <hi rend="italic">bus;</hi> is about twenty minntes after nine o'clock, and the third twenty—three minutes after—we have the same times now for two of them, but one was shifted about a fornight ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What I want to know is this., whether you have continued these three first omnibuses at these times, up to within a fortnight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we have—my father has always run an omnibus at those times—It has not always run in his name—one has been running latterly with Corbett's name on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whenever Bray set out, at whatever time, nice, ten, or eleven o'clock, did not that omnibus with Corbett's name on it set out, whenever Bray's. out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And did it not confine itself to those times? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At first it did—our "Albion" time changed after Bray's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERGEANT BOMPAS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your omnibus always went with one of his? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Bray's went with one or other of our omnibuses—both Bray's went with one of ours from Whit—Monday to about Wednesday, with the exception of one journey—after that there was only one of Brav's with ours—the first day his started with the second omnibus we had that morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you say that Bray ran with one of your omnibuses, when<lb/>ever it went, was not that the one that had Corbett's name on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Corbett's name was put on about a week after Whit—Monday—Bray's con<lb/>tinued to run against one of my father's which had not Corbett's name on—I have seen it at different times of the day—one day at one time—some times at another—sometimes he stopped at the same time we did, and some<lb/>time he went on, just as it suited his own fancy—he did that from the very beginning—those which I term the regular <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> kept on at the regular time—the others stopped with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever send your horses down to H olborn, to change the horses in that one that ran against Bray's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, occasionally; only to that one, that was the "Albion, "No. 117, I believe, but we have two or three "Albions"—I do not know that that "Albion" ever stopped for Bray's omnibus, when it was in Bray's yard—I have not the slightest no<lb/>tion that our omnibus ever stopped in Holbom or Southampton-street, while Bray's was in the yary—It was sent to Holborn, because Bray's men said they would not give them time to change, they would make that pair of horses work all day long, when Bray's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> was working against our regu<lb/>lar one—If they saw the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> he but on to protect our regular once, they would turn down some of the back streets, and if we stopped he would pop out of some of the streets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did they do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They turned down the streets to lose the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> we put on to protect our regular ones, and would wait, and watch till they saw our regular <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> coming, and then go on in front of them, to pick up the passengers which they would have, and we had nothing to protect ourselves with, if this other <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> had not kept with them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210223"/>
               <p>gave the coachman directions, "if Bray's omnibus runs against ours, you run against his—If he don't interfere with us, you come home again, and don't interfere with him"—that was on the Monday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing Bray had not opposed any of your omnibuses in the way you have stated, should you have put on an extra omnibus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; if he had not run agiust our omnibuses, we should not have put the extra one on against his.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the effect of Bray's omnibuses trying to pull in upon the other omnibuses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It caused a great deal of confusion—by direction of the Bank there are three allowed to stand on the stand at one time, and only two during the payment of dividends; consequently, if there are more than three coms on, we order the last one off—Bray's happened to be the last on several occasions, and we ordered him off.</p>

I am a chemist, and live at No, 26, Oxford-street, I have had opportunities of observing the conduct of the omnibuses—I have seen Bray's drive as rapid a pace as the others—If one of the others stopped, Bray's would stop also—I have seen that more than once or twice, and I have seen them run the pole very near the other people's door—he has not stopped for a passenger—I have not had that idea—I have not seen any passengers—when the others went on, Bray did so also, and followed them up or down the street, keeping very near indeed to them, as near as they could—I observed that in the first month—I should say Bray's was the aggressor.</p>

I have had opportunities of observing the omnibuses that drive up and down from paddington to the Bank for the last five years—those with "Aaron Bray" on them have been conducted in the most did orderly way imaginable—previous to the omnibuses of Aaron Bray coming on the road, they were conducted as orderly as it was possible for vehicles of that description to be; so much so, that I allowed them, two years ago, to change horses at my house—since Aaron Bray began running up the street, to my coat, I have found that the disorder has been so great that ladies could not come in their carriages to my shop—they were afraid—I have seen the other omnibuses stop to take up passengers on several occasions—I have seen Bray's omnibuses pull up with the pole against the door of the other omni<lb/>buses, to prevent a passenger from getting in, in more instances than one—from what I have seen, Bray was decidedly the aggressor, because I con<lb/>sidered he was in opposition to the others—before Bray came, the road was orderly—they were going quitely about their business.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he inquire for any body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He came into the shop, and asked if Bonill lodged there: I said, "Yes, he does: but I believe he is not within"—he replied, "Yes, he is; for I saw him at the window"—he walked through the shop, the passage door being open: I saw him go up as far as the turn of the stairs; he turned back momentarily, went down, and opened the private door, and the other prisoner, pratt, came in—Pratt went up stairs—Smith shut the door, and followed him up into Bonills room—I heard them shut the door, but did not see them go in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In consequence of suspicions which you entertained, what did you do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went out to the back premises of my place—tgere is a loft over a stable right opposite Bonill's window—I moved a tile, and had a very good sight of his room.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you see? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw Bonill sitting on one side of the window and Smith on the other, looking out of window and talking together—after a few minutes I saw Pratt come and put himself down on Bonill's knee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Sitting on his knee? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes: it was but a short time—he taken rose up, as if pushed by Smith, and placed himself on Smith's knee: and there I saw him for five or six minutes—I then shifted myself, as I was rather cramped, and when I turned my head, Pratt was away—I saw Bonill and Smith sitting at the window—they seemed to be laughing together and in conversation—I then went in doors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say something to your wife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; and then went into our back room to my tea.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In consequence of that, did you go up stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I looked</p>

            <p>through the key-hole of the door, and I saw Pratt laying on his back with his trowsers below his knees, and with his body curled up—his knees were up—Smith was upon him—Pratt's knees were nearly up to Smith's shoulders—Smith's clothes were below his knees—I put my shoulder against the door and burst it open.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well, you saw Pratt on his back, Smith lying on him, and both their trowsers down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see any motion take place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the motion of the body, and a great deal of fondness and kissing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What kind of motion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The motion we might make—</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing it had been connexion between man and woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, equally the same—I put my shoulder against the door, and burst the catch of the latch from the door, opened it, and saw Pratt and Smith—pratt said, "Oh, my God, we are caught," or, "caught at last," I will not sawer which.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did they change their position? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They did, as quick as possible—Smith got upon his knees—I saw his private parts as he was getting up</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what state were thy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say, but I saw them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the moment of your bursting the door, was Smith laying on Pratt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the posture you have described? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when Smith got off his knees, Pratt turned himself round on his right side, and I did not see his person—both their trowsers were down then—as soon as Pratt got up as quick as they could, and both fell on their knees, and offered me their purses, and begged hard for me to let them go—Benill was not in the room at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he return to the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes: three or four minutes after I burst the door open, Bonill returned to the room with a jug of ale.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had bonill been away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see him go out myself, but I suppose a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What more passed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Bonill came into the room—he seemed surprised at seeing me there, and asked what was the matter—I called him an old villain, and said, "You know what is the matter; you have been practising this in my place for some time past"—he said, "I know nothing of what is done in my place, I have been absent"—he asked me to drink; I said, no, I would not drink in any such society—a lodger came in—I left them in charge of my lodger, and went to the station-house for a policeman myself.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How wide is the room there, do you think? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suppose ten feet square, if it had been square, but the fire-place takes the square off—they were rather nearer the door, than the middle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then they would not be six feet from the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot po<lb/>sitively say—I rather think they were nearer the door than the middle.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You could not see the floor close to the door, through the key<lb/>hole? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Within a foot or two, I could—there was a bedstead, some tables, and a chair or two, in the room.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any furniture between the door and the place you saw them in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, only the carpet—It is a turn-up bedstead, and their heads were up against it—they were on the floor.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You burst the door—did you find it fastened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not try that—I drew the staple of the spring-latch.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ascertain, on looking afterwards, that it was not fastened, and you might have opened it without bursting it open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was it fastened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With a spring-latch, which is separated from the lock—the lock was not locked—the key was not it the door.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there a handle to the latch outside the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I be<lb/>lieve so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By removing the fastening of the latch, by your force you opened the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I drew the staple of the latch—at that moment I was not aware whether the door was locked or not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you afterwards find it was not locked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I did, but it was the next day.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you ascertain that you might have opened the latch with the handle outside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I could.</p>
