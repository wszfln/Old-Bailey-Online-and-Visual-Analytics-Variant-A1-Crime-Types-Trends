The prisoner was in my service for six months, and quitted about five weeks ago—he was fully acquainted with the interior of my house—since he left he has sometimes called to see Rabjohn, my shopman—on Tuesday night, 27th Nov., I was in my shop about half-past eight o'clock; I heard a loud screaming, which induced me to run to the passage door—Rabjohn was there, close to the street door—my servant maid ran to me from the interior of the house; and from what she told me, I ran towards the parlour at the back of the shop, and saw the prisoner just inside the parlour coming through the door—he had no hat on, that was only a few seconds after I beard the screams—I then ran to the street door, Rabjohn and the girl were near the street door—I closed it, and ordered it not to be opened—I then went to the third-floor front, which is my bed-room—I had a secretaire there—the prisoner knew I was in habit of keeping my money there—I found it half open and a small inner drawer also, from which I missed 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, which I had seen safe about eleven in the forenoon—I came down</p>

               <p>stairs and found a policeman, and searched about the house with him—there is a back door; I turned the key of that door before I went up-stairs, so that nobody could have come in from the back door, after I heard the screams—it leads into a yard, which is surrounded by a high wall and some buildings—it the time I first saw the prisoner I had no suspicion of him, but when I came down I had, and I asked how he came through the parlour at that time—he said he was standing near the Angel at Islington, and hearing screams he ran down a private passage and through the parlour, where I met him—he was only two feet from the foot of the stairs; I had seen him at my house that evening—my house is three houses and a half from the Angel, the half is over a gateway—my passage-door has no spring to it, it will not shut of itself if it is opened—I opened it—when I went up-stairs the windows were all shut, and everything secure.</p>

After the prisoner left, he was in the habit of calling to see me—on Tuesday evening, 27th Nov., he came about half-past seven o'clock—he walked into the shop as usual, and we had a little conversation—about five minutes to eight I went to the street-door, and stood there, having the care of some goods out in the street, and left the prisoner in the middle of the shop—he came up to me, and said, "Master says you may take the chairs in"—I said, "Very well," and walked back to move a couch; the prisoner stepped out, and brought in an arm-chair and sat down in it close by my side—after some time he said, "You do not want me any longer, I will bid you good night"—I was then about fifteen feet within the shop; he went out, the shop door adjoins the street door—whether he went away or went into the passage I cannot tell—I placed the arm-chair in the room, and immediately went to the door, looked both ways, and could not see him—I stood on the threshold about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I could see the Angel from there—if the prisoner had been standing there, I think I should have seen him—I then heard a cry of "Murder!" and women's screams from up-stairs—I immediately turned round, and Mr. Phillips came up—if the prisoner had come into the house after I heard the screams I must have seen him—I am positive he did not—Mr. Phillips had the girl in his arms—I took her from him, and he ran down the shop to get a light—he then came back and bolted the street door, and said to me, "Do not let anybody in or out"—I drew the servant twenty-nine inches from one door to the other, and when I turned round the prisoner was close to my elbow, without a hat, and his hair very much rumpled, and he was very much confused—he smoothed down his hair; he came from the direction of the back parlour—it would have been impossible for any one to have come in from the time I heard the scream till I saw the prisoner in the shop, without my seeing them—I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, how did you come in the house when you bid me good-night a quarter of an hour ago?"—he made no reply—the girl was still screaming—a knock came to the door, it was the policeman—the prisoner said, "Hold the girl fast, and do not let her go out; I will go for a policeman"—he unbolted the door and ran out, as two policemen came in—I fastened the door afterwards; in about a quarter of an hour the prisoner came back and brought some policemen with him, four or five came in altogether—during the twenty minutes I was standing at the door the prisoner had time to go up-stairs and get the money, and he bad time enough to get rid of it afterwards—when he was given in</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the evening of 27th Nov., I was on the second-floor of the house—in consequence of what the girl said to me, I went up after her to my bed-room on the third-floor—she raised the valens of the bed, and said there was somebody under it—as she left, I saw a person in the act of crawling from under the bed—the person turned his face towards me—it was the prisoner—I opened the window, and screamed out—I had been in the room about a quarter of an hour before—the secretaire was then safe, and shut.</p>

I heard the screaming, went to the house, and went up-stairs with the prosecutor—I found no person in the house but the prisoner, or any trace of any—there was no appearance of any-person having escaped—the doors and windows were all shut and fastened—when we came down stairs, the prosecutor said to the prisoner, "We believe, Alfred, you know all about it; it will be best for you to tell the truth"—I stopped him and said, "You must not say anything of that, if you are going to give him in custody"—I took him in custody, searched him, and found a knife in his coat-pocket—I asked how he accounted for having it in his pos<lb/>session—he said, "I am not bound to answer you any question; you can do nothing with me; you found no money on me"—he had heard Mr. Phillips say what he had lost—he afterwards said that when he went out he went to the Angel, and stopped there rather longer than he usually did; that be heard the screaming, and ran in—I afterwards examined the secretaire—it appeared to have been opened with a knife, or some such instrument—I afterwards locked it, applied this knife, and it opened it, and the marks cor<lb/>responded.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I cannot say in what state the roan was when he left University Hospital—when I received him he was in a very debilitated state from loss of blood—he rallied after being under treatment-the first symptoms of the abscess on the lungs was shivering and general fever; that came on on 2d July—I saw nothing that could have brought that on but the wound—the original wound had healed when he came in, and he said he felt all right, but weak—it was on 6th Aug. that the wound re-opened, and discharged an immense quantity of blood—that would be the effect of the abscess—pus always finds its way externally, and would take the weakest point—I have no reason to think that the abscess was forming before the wound was inflicted; I should say not from the appearance of the man—an abscess would not form immediately from a wound; it is the result of inflammation; it would take time—I do not think any inflammation existed when he arrived at the depot—I dare say the loss of blood had kept it down—I do not think he was discharged from the hospital too soon—I think he was in a convalescent state when he came—he was put into the hospital of the depot immediately—I took him under my charge on 27th July—that was the first time I saw him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>, I saw him when he was brought in, on 6th June—he left on the 22nd, he was then convalescent, and in a fit state to be discharged had he not been going to another hospital—I can imagine no other cause of the abscess but the wound—he had severe inflammation immediately after his admission, and by very severe means that was overcome—he was left in a state of great debility, and at the time of his dismissal there might have been chronic inflammation of the lung, which probably gave rise to the abscess.</p>

I am a partner in the firm of Dodd, Grueber and Rowsell, solicitors, of 5, Billiter-street—we are the lessees of the house, and underlet the ground-floor to the London General Pension Society—we occupy the first floor, part of the second, and an office at the back of the house. The prisoner Cooper was formerly in our service; I think he came in 1842, and was discharged about twelve months ago—I did not sleep in the house-Mr. Mence, to whom we let the upper part, does—the house is in the parish of St. Catherine Cree—on Thursday, 6th Dec, I left the office about half-past two o'clock—I went again about ten next morning, and was then told that the prisoners were in custody—I examined the premises, and found the door into the clerk's office had been broken open—in the second desk in that office, belonging to one of our confidential clerks, was kept the key of the iron safe and cash-box—the cash-box was kept in the safe-Cooper would know that—I saw marks on the desk which corresponded with <hi rend="italic">a jemmy</hi> that was shown me by the police—the other desk was not tried at all—I examined a closet under the stairs, and found a quantity of torn enve<lb/>lopes and papers there—the cupboard was large enough to hold two persons, if they wanted to conceal themselves—there was a little bit of string inside, apparently made from a piece of cocoa-nut matting, so that they could open or close the cupboard-door from the inside—I examined the staircase, and found that the persons got into the cupboard by putting their feet on a leaden water-pipe which runs along there.</p>

The Pennion Society occupies the ground-floor, and I occupy a part of the second, and the whole of the upper part On 6th Dec. I went to bed at twenty minutes to one o'clock in the morning—the house was then quite safe—the inner office door was closed—about half-past two in the morning, I was awoke by a loud noise which appeared to come from the first floor—I lighted a candle, and went out to the landing, and called to my servants; I thought the noise came from them—I called out very loud; I awoke them; they answered so as to convince me that they were not the cause of the noise—I then called out, "Take care; there are persons in the house who ought not to be," and I called out very loud indeed twice, "I am coming down; I am coming down"—I then ran to the bed-room window in front of the house, and shouted "Police!" as loud as I could—I then heard what appeared to me to be the street door open, and I saw two men run from it towards the top of the street; one appeared to run from the house, and the other to run under the eave of the house—I was only able to see them, not to identify them—I observed the one who ran on the other side had a lighter coat than the other—when I went down stairs I found the front room first floor door lock forcibly broken—that was the door I had seen safe at half-past twelve—part of the wood was splintered, and the bolt of the lock remained as if locked—when I went round the house, the cupboard was shut, and after the alarm it was open—when I went down, I let in the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> am assistant to Messrs. Lewis and Allenby, silk-mercers, of Regent-street. On Saturday evening, 8th Dec, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in Hyde-park, returning home from Knightsbridge—I stopped at a public watering-place—the prisoner was there—he said, "It is a very fine night"—I said, "Yes," or nodded assent; nothing more—I left the place immediately and went straight in the direction of Stanhope-gate, which is my straight road home—I found the prisoner following me, and walked very fast, and turned a different way to what he was going, but still saw him following me—I then abruptly crossed the road in a dirty part, to get rid of him, but perceived him still near me—he made two or three remarks as to the closing of the park and the state of the weather—I did not answer him—I had intended crossing Hyde-park, but being dark I did not—I was inside the park, but kept along the light side where the lamps are—I found him still close to me pressing his remarks, I turned suddenly round—he then firmly laid hold of me in the most indecent manner, and said, "I can see you are a gentleman; you must give me some money; you must give me two sovereigns, or I will make a charge against you"—my flap was buttoned up—he said I must pawn my watch—being naturally timid, I became very much alarmed, and having heard of several persons being stopped, I ran across the road, the prisoner still retaining his hold—I then shouted out "Police!" and had hardly done so the third time before two policemen came, and I gave him in charge—I did not lay hold of him, except to keep him off—he could not have seen that I had a watch, unless it was when I was in the place.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 247). On Thursday night, 4th Oct. in consequence of a complaint made to me, I went to the Bell, at Ealing, and found the prisoner there—I think I got there at near twelve o'clock—found him in a room on the left hand—I do not know whether it was the parlour or not—he was walking up and down the room—I think there was another person there—I do not know who he was—I asked the prisoner if his name was Monkhouse—he said it was not—I then said, "I suspect you are the man I want; I shall take you to the station"—he asked me what I wanted of him—I again asked him if his name was Monkhouse—he said, "No," and I took him to the station—as I was going out of the door I met another constable, and we led him between us, walking, to the station, which was about fifty yards—he had been drinking a great deal—when we got to the station we searched him, and found this pistol, which was unscrewed, and one barrel in his coat-pocket; and these bullets I found in his waistcoat-pocket, and a small quantity of powder, and a dozen and a half of copper caps in his breast-pocket—I tried the bullets to the pistol, and they fitted—on Sunday, the 7th, from information, I went to Ealing, and received this other pistol, and this powder and flask, from Mr. Williams, the landlord of the Bell—I think the two pistols are fellows—they are both percussion—the barrel I found on him appeared as if it had been recently discharged—when I searched him I found some papers belonging to some vessel, with his name on them, and I then said, "I see your name is Monkhouse; I shall take you now to Hammersmith Police-court;" and I took him there—while this was going on at the station, he said if he had a brace of loaded pistols he would blow his own brains out.</p>

I know the prisoner by seeing him, but am not acquainted with him—on 4th Oct. he came to my house, about eleven o'clock at night, and went into the kitchen where I was—no one came with him—he said nothing, but pulled two pistols from his pocket, and a small portion of powder, and laid them on the table—I took I them, and put them into the drawer—I said nothing, nor did he—after that I was called to the bar, and when I returned he had one of the pistols in his I hand—I said, "Fray do not get those things out in a room like this, fork I is very improper for you to be handling them about," not knowing what I state he might be in—I was then called out again, and met Reason—he went into the room where the prisoner was—I afterwards went in again, and I Reason then had him in custody—I afterwards gave Reason the pistol that I was in the drawer, and the powder which the prisoner had brought—the I prisoner did not sit down at all—he appeared to be very much excited.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, residing at Hammersmith. On 4th Oct., about half-past ten at night, I was called I to Mr. Monkhouse—I saw him immediately—he lives a very short distance I from my house—I found him in a state that a person suffering under a gun<lb/>shot</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184912170029"/>
               <p>wound generally is; faint and trembling—I expected he would die in a few minutes—he was standing in an upright posture, supported by Mrs. Monkhouse and the servant, who was holding a bason to his mouth, out of which issued a great deal of blood—I undid the collar of his shirt, and there found a gun-shot wound with a very large blackened surface—he was cough<lb/>ing and vomiting blood at the same time—the ball appeared to have entered at the front of the neck, passed through the handkerchief which I produce, and which has a horse-hair pad to it, which no doubt deadened the action of the ball in the first instance; it would probably have perforated the trachea, but the stiffening of the stock appeared to have turned it on one side, and it went upwards—it appeared to have been fired at a considerable altitude, at an angle I should say of forty degrees at least, and after striking on the trachea, it went through the membraneous portion of the aesophagus into the cavity of the throat, at the back of the mouth; it must have struck against the basis of the skull or the cervical vertebrae, because it went in at an elevation, but came out downwards—it bad met with some considerable obstruction—it went in directly in front of the neck and upwards—what obstruction it met with I do not know, but it came out on the collar-bone—it must have passed between the carotid internal and external, because it did not cut either, or else he would have bled to death—it met with some resistance, which in my judgment altered its course—there was a distance of five inches between the two openings—it was a dangerous wound, I did not expect he would have lived the night out—I got his clothes off, and found the bullet, which I produce, at the posterior open<lb/>ing—from the blackening round the neck, I conclude it had been burnt by the explosion of a pistol or gun—I should say the weapon could not have been more than two feet from him, at the time it was fired—I am not the regular medical attendant of the family.</p>

I cannot say whether I saw him on 3d Oct.—I saw him on the 4th, about three o'clock in the afternoon—I went with him to a fishmonger's, and he had some oysters, and bread and butter—we stayed there I should say half an hour, during that time he was most curious in his manners—he attended to every customer that came—he made observa<lb/>tions at the people that were passing, and stopped at the shop—we went from thence to many public-houses—he had brandy to drink the whole time—I should say he had at least twelve or fourteen glasses—he bad no water to it—I tried to restrain him, that was why I went with him from house to house—he appeared quite intoxicated—he went up to a man who was eating something in the street, and offered to give him something to drink—this continued until about five or half-past—I recommended him to take some tea to counteract the effects of the liquor, and we went into a coffee-house for that purpose—while it was getting ready he put his hand to his head, and complained severely of feeling a great swimming, and he fell imme<lb/>diately</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, F</hi> 11). On 4th Dec, about six o'clock in the evening, in consequence of information, I stationed myself on the roof of the Model Lodging-house, Charles-street, Drury-lane, from whence I had a view of the front room of No. 48, on the other side of the street—there was a candle on the table—I saw the prisoner blowing the fire—I went again next evening, and saw the prisoner sitting at the side of the table with something like a mould in her hand—she took something like a small bowl from the fire, and poured something like metal into the mould in two places—she held it in her hand a few seconds, opened the mould, and turned out on the table what appeared to me to be two shillings—I saw her do that perhaps a dozen times, or more—two men and another woman, in a cloak and bonnet, were in the room—one man took something, and appeared to scour it, and then sent it across the table to another man, who appeared to file it, by the movements of his arm—one of the men then went to this pot (<hi rend="italic">a galvanic battery</hi>)—when they had done a certain quantity, and counted them over one man, who was without his coat, gave the other, who wore a cap, some money, two pieces, or more—he handed them over to the woman in the bonnet, who put them into a basket, I believe; I could not exactly see, but she had a basket—the man without the coat turned the money over, and put it into his left-hand trowsers'-pocket—he appeared to me as if he had</p>

               <p>purchased them—the woman in the bonnet and shawl, and the man in the cap, left the room—the prisoner stayed, still going on with the same process—in a few minutes the man without the coat turned down his shirt-sleeves, buttoned up his clothes, and went out of the room—he returned in a very few minutes, pulled off his coat, and sat down by the side of the table, and commenced rubbing some of the coin—I then left the parapet—I was gone about ten or twelve minutes, and returned with several officers and a ladder, which I rose to the window I had been watching—I went up first with a crow-bar—the prisoner was sitting at the side of the table with something in her hand like a mould—I forced open the window, and sprung into the room—she jumped up, threw down this mould (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with a piece of cloth round it, and two sixpences in it, and screamed out—the man was not there—she came towards me to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> me, I suppose, but I got into the room, and was followed by Sergeants West and Dunston—I dragged her from the fire<lb/>place to the table, and gave her into Dunston's custody—there was a bright fire, on which was this spoon, with white metal in it, in a fluid state—on the hob I found two moulds, one with two impressions of shillings, and one for half-crowns—on the table were twenty-three sixpences, and two in the mould she threw down; also this electrotype-battery, this spoon, and part of another spoon, this acid in a bottle, these thin pieces of silver, a piece of glass, which has the appearance of a mould of two sixpences having been made on it, and these six pieces of timber, which screw together over the door, and it was <hi rend="italic">shored</hi> up at the bottom; it would be impossible to get in; it was not screwed then—it is a frame made the exact height of the room, and pieces to go across (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked her where the <hi rend="italic">Doctor</hi> was—she said she knew nothing about any doctor; no one lived there but her—one of the men I had seen in the room goes by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Doctor</hi>—I knew him before.</p>

I accompanied sergeant Thompson and Dunston—we waited in Park-street—Thompson joined us, and we went to 48, Charles-street, and raised the ladder—I followed Thompson in at the second-floor window—Dunston was behind me—Thompson took the prisoner and delivered her to Dunston—I found this saucepan with white metal in it, cold—it had been melted—these five or six files were on the table—two of them have white metal on the teeth—I found some whitening on the mantle<lb/>shelf, in a piece of paper, with a tooth-brush without a handle, in it.</p>

I have been a draper at Bristol and Bath, but was unfortunate—I have been in the habit of selling drapery goods for Swan, at my rooms—I first began to sell them about twelve months before the bankruptcy—sometimes I received an account with them, and sometimes not; it would be kept till entered in a printed catalogue and made waste paper—as soon as the sale was settled I rendered an account of the amount they fetched, and the expenses to him, and paid him over the balance—the year before his bankruptcy I sold for him, I should think, to the amount of 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid him the money—I sold goods for him in March, 1849, I think about three times, the 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, 8th, and 24th, to the amount of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the three together came to a little under 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I furnished him an account with each, the proceeds, the expenses, and the balance—I sell for what they fetch, not with a reserve price—I keep no account or particulars of the goods after a sale is over.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the indictment could not be sustained, inasmuch as it was framed upon</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> 6 <hi rend="italic">Vic, c.</hi> 122, <hi rend="italic">which was repealed by</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> 13 <hi rend="italic">Vic, c.</hi> 92, <hi rend="italic">that the offence in question could not come within the latter Act, as it was not in force at the period the offence was alleged to have been committed, and that the extent of the repeal applied to the whole of the former statute, with certain exceptions, which were pointed out in the schedule, which schedule did not mention the offence in question.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">also urged that the</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> 6 <hi rend="italic">Vic. was entirely repealed, without any reservation as to this or any criminal offence, except as to the recovery of certain penalties incurred before the Act came into operation; the word "penalty" so used, could not apply to punishment for any criminal offence, but only to fines in civil matters</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. C'LARKSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the</hi> 12 &amp; 13 <hi rend="italic">Vic. must be taken to keep alive the punishment awarded by</hi> 5 &amp; 6 <hi rend="italic">Vic, otherwise there would be impunity to wrong doers in the interval between the llth Oct., when the former Act was repealed; and </hi>1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">also contended that the use of the word "fiat" in the introduction of the repealing Statute which abolished fiats altogether, rendered it clear that the offences included in the 5 &amp; 6 Vic were intended to be preserved, and that the word "penalty" meant punishment was clear, from the</hi> 254 <hi rend="italic">sec. of 12 &amp;</hi> 13 <hi rend="italic">Vic, where it was expressly stated that a person giving false evidence should be liable to the penalties of perjury</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JAMES</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">in reply, did not mean to suggest that the Legislature had an object in providing any impunity for this offence, but the question was whether or not it was a casus omissus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE COLERIDGE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was clearly rf opinion that the indictment could not be sustained; if it was to be sustained at all, it must be on 5 &amp;6 Vic, because the offence charged was committed prior to the passing of</hi> 12 &amp; 13 <hi rend="italic">Vic, and there were no retrospective words in the penal clauses of that Statute, The question then was, whether the 5 &amp; 6 Vic, was so entirely repealed as not to enable recourse to he had to it? The first section stated, that from and after the commencement of the Act, the several acts set forth in the schedule were repealed: and then in the schedule the prior act was slated to be wholly repealed with certain exceptions, which it was admitted did not bear upon the present question. Therefore, if it stood simply on the words in the schedule, the ques<lb/>tion was at an end; but it was said, that there were other parts of the Act which had a saving effect; those parts, in his opinion, referred to proceedings in bankruptcy and not to criminal offences—the inference attempted to be drawn from the</hi> 254<hi rend="italic">th section, as to the word "penalty," entirely failed. It was said further, that the</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th and</hi> 253<hi rend="italic">rd sections showed that there was an intention to keep alive proceedings of this nature, Now, supposing the Court were satisfied, as it was, that the Legislature never intended that which must result from this omission, yet the Court could not create or punish crimes except upon the clear legal words of the Legislature; but they were not driven to that argument, because it seemed to him that the inferences, attempted to be drawn from the last-named sections could not stand: it could not he said that a criminal proceeding, such as this, was a remedy for a party injured by a bank<lb/>rupt and as to the words of the</hi> 153<hi rend="italic">rd section, they might reasonably apply to the case of a fiat, which had issued immediately before the Act's coming into operation.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">entirely concurred in this opinion; it was a perfectly acknowledged rule of law that when a Statute was repealed, you could not proceed against a party for anything done under that Statute; and in the numerous Acts passed on Her Majesty's accession, repealing a vast number of former Acts, an exception was made as to offences committed in the interval, which offences were to be dealt with and punished as if the Statute had not passed, At the passing of</hi> 6 <hi rend="italic">George IV the then Bankrupt Act, exactly the same thing happened as that which now occurred; there the former Acts were repealed without any reservation, and the same argument was used, that the Legislature could not have meant to make a sort of hiatus; the answer was, if they did not, it was a misfortune that they did not provide for it, but they very positively repealed everything that had passed before. It was safer to know nothing of what the Legislature intended, except from what they said; they certainly had not said that any of these provisions should be retained, and therefore they were no longer in force.

                  </hi>. I am a policeman in the Post-office. I was on duty there on 5th Dec.—I saw the prisoner there sorting letters in the Inland<lb/>office—some communication was made to me, and I asked him where he lived—he said at 19, George's-terrace, St. Peter's-road, Islington—Mr. Boyd, the inspector, went with me there—I saw the person who keeps the house; he pointed out a bed-room to me—I searched there, and found these pieces of letters, which I have put together, in the grate, and a good deal of other paper, and amongst them were fragments of letters addressed to the prisoner—I searched a drawer in the room, and found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-worth of postage-stamps, and these four stamps, in a square together—I have looked through all the papers; they are principally fragments of letters—I found no letter addressed to any person in the house but the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Inland-office in the Post-office. Supposing letters for Norwich to be posted in the Fulham-road at three o'clock in the afternoon, they would, in the course of business, arrive at the General Post-office that evening—they would have to be sorted and sent by the mail that night—I can see the stamp of the Inland-office on this envelope of the evening of 24th Oct.—the postage-stamp is obliterated—here is the figure 7, which signifies the Inland-office—it came safely to the Post<lb/>office that evening—the prisoner was a sorter there—here is the evening sorter's-book, in which the sorters sign their names—on the evening of 24th Oct here is an entry of the prisoner in his own writing, which signifies he was on duty in the Inland-office that evening—Nicholson was not employed on 24th Oct. in that office—no person is permitted to be employed in that office without signing his name in this book—this letter is addressed <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Norwich, and had a double stamp on it—supposing it contained half-a-crown, and had a double stamp, it would probably go in with the packets which are sorted separately; it would be the prisoner's duty to sort a letter of that kind—this would be assigned to the Eastern Counties' division—the prisoner was employed at that division that evening—the letter-bag for Norwich would be made up in the Eastern Counties' division.</p>

               <p>short of provisions up to that time; the men had their full allowance—the captain knew what was in the ship—we got a barrel of beef at St. Helena—we had not been served short—I do not know what was in the hold; the captain takes the account of it—the prisoner had not been quite well before—he had had medicine two or three times, and several of the others too—I cannot swear whether he had any the day before—I do not know that the medicine was stopped—he asked me for his medicine at the windlass a short time before we got under weigh, and I said, "You had better wait, but if you want it now you may go <hi rend="italic">for'ard</hi> and get it"—I did not refuse to give it him—that was the only time he applied for it—I believe he had a sore toe, at least he said so—I have nothing to do with the medicines; the captain serves them out himself—the prisoner had not complained of his toe; he had merely said so among the men—I do not recollect the words I used to him—I said I would <hi rend="italic">"stop his wind"</hi>—I did not say "d----d <hi rend="italic">wind"</hi>—I wil not swear that—I might have sworn at him; I do not think I did—I struck him in the head after he ran at me—I did not strike him before he ran at me—I did not know at first that I was cut—the wound was very slight, but it went through my trowsers—it was not deep, but it might have been serious—I was not away from duty—my hand was disabled for three weeks—I and the captain had hold of him, not the second mate, I sent him and the carpenter away when the prisoner called to the crew—I did not hear the prisoner call "Murder!"—I will not swear he did not—I pinioned him round the arms until I got about halfway <hi rend="italic">aft</hi>, and the captain, carpenter, and second mate then came to my assistance—the captain held him by the shoulder, and lent a hand to drag him <hi rend="italic">aft</hi>—I do not think he held him by the collar—he was immediately put in irons, and brought home so, and was so until he was given into custody—the vessel is 349 tons—there are sixteen hands, with the captain, carpenter, two mates and steward—I believe we had the full complement—if the men had worked properly the ship would have worked like a top—some ships <hi rend="italic">go</hi> with much fewer hands—the men complained of the ship being short handed, because we had an old cook, and an old steward, and two boys, of no use—they did not grumble about the quantity, but the quality—if they had worked their best it would have been amply manned.</p>

               <p>then tried to carry the prisoner <hi rend="italic">aft</hi>—Potter had his arms round the prisoner who was off his legs—when we got him down to the break of the fore deck Potter laid, "Take care of yourself, Sir—he is using his knife"—I immediately had a cut on my cheek, and also on my thigh and stomach, an upward wound—I found myself saturated with blood—he was let go by us both, and escaped round the other side, and when I got round, Potter had again seemed him—I then called on the crew to help—several of them did so, and the prisoner was secured—I have been upwards of twenty years in the merchant service, and have been ten years a master—I cannot say whether the mate was behaving temperately—I heard the scuffle, and <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out to the mate to bring him <hi rend="italic">aft</hi>—the mate merely acted under my orders.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl, and live at Woolwich. On the night of 6th Dec. I went to bed with Jennings—the prisoner was in a bed in my room—Jennings had made him a bed in her room, and he would not lie there, be would insist on being in my room—I made him a bed on the floor—he awoke Jennings up between one and two o'clock, and asked for a light to go away—he went away—I had had in the pocket of my gown, behind the door, a purse containing five sixpences and some halfpence—I saw them safe when I got into bed, about twelve—I got up at five, found my gown on the floor, and my purse and money gone—no one else had been in the room—Jennings locked the door after the prisoner went—this is my purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman on the South Western Railway, at the Nine Elms station—the prisoner was in the employ of Mr. Sayers, the railway carrier—on 4th Dec, between eight and nine o'clock in evening, I saw the prisoner and another man with a horse and cart at the station—they unloaded it, and the other man, Pigden, drove it away out of the warehouse—the prisoner walked by the side of it, and I saw the prisoner come from the corner of the warehouse with a box which he put in the cart; it was nearly dark—I saw him come from where the boxes are kept—he got in the cart when it was going on, and proceeded on his way home—I followed him to the outer gate—no one can pass without a pass, which they get in the warehouse—I saw the prisoner deliver the pass—Pigden was in the cart and another young man, who had got in after the boxes were put in—I after<lb/>wards saw the pass, and I have it here—it is a pass for Sayers' van, empty; but the man who wrote the pass, has put "van" instead of "cart"—I followed the cart into the road, and said to the prisoner, "Cherry, you haw a pass for an empty cart"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You have a box in it"—he said he knew that, it was all right—I do not believe the persons at the gate could see the box, I could hardly see it myself, it was placed under the seat—Cherry said the box belonged to them, and he would go</p>

               <p>and get a pass for it, and he got out of the cart—I afterwards looked at the address on the box, and I said to him, "You know Cherry this box does not belong to you"—he said, "It does not, but do not say anything about it, I do not mind what I give you to let me go"—I took him to the superin<lb/>tendent, and he said I had better see the day superintendent—there was a card on the box—I took it off and gave it to Mr. Newman, the day super<lb/>intendent of the goods department—I have known the prisoner there more than two years—he would know the rules and regulations there, one of which is, that a person must not take anything out without a pass, and they must not take it without a porter gives it to them—there was no porter where the prisoner took this box—there were two boxes, one inside the other.</p>

I took Collins; I found a key on her, which fitted the house, 2, Sussex-place.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Dix's-buildings, George-street, Borough, below the Bricklayers' Arms. I am M'Donald's mother—I recollect Wednesday, 28th Nov.—my son was taken into custody on the Thursday—on the Wednesday night he came home about a quarter or half. past eleven o'clock; he then had his supper, and went to bed; I am certain he went to bed; he put off his clothes in my kitchen—he took the candle and called me to take the light—I took up his coat, and put it on the bed—he left his shoes, and could not find them, for I put them in a cupboard till I came down next morning—at half-past six the next morning a person came with a double knock at the door, and asked if my son was at home—I said "Yes," asked him in, and called my son—I saw the party, and heard the voice—I cannot say whether I have heard the voice since—I could not swear whether any of the parties at the bar look like that party—I asked my son if he should be in to breakfast—he said he would—I came down and gave him his shoes, and he took his coat and handkerchief, and went out—it was not light enough for me to distinguish the party who came for him—my son had a situation in the Bricklayers' Arms—he has been usually em<lb/>ployed there.</p>
