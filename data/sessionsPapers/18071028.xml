I asked him how he came by the clock, he said his wife's father gave it her twelve years ago; I told him it was a long way to bring this clock for a guinea and a half; he did not know the value of it; he persisted that it was his, and he wanted the clock back; I told him I should not part with him nor the clock unless he could refer me to some respectable person in town. I asked him whether he knew the name on the clock, he said no, he knew the number. The name on the clock is Bellamy. He told me the number was 185; it is 183. I took him to Marlborough-street office, and have kept the clock ever since.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 15th of October the last witness brought the prisoner and the clock to the office; I went to Mr. Bellamy in Pall Mall, I found it belonged to Mr. Casanager; the prisoner said it was his for the last twelve years, and it had been in his family for thirty years. The prisoner confessed to Mr. Casanager that he got in at the window on the night of the 14th of October, and took out the clock.</p>

               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen them in your pocket book. - A I had seen them there in the course of the day, when I had last seen my pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon missing them what did you do. - A. I returned and went after the prisoner; I saw her in the company of two other young women and three dragoons. I saw the patrol, and I gave charge of the prisoner; she was taken to Knightsbridge watchhouse and there searched; no property was found on her. Being persuaded that I had had the property, and that she had taken it, I told her if she would give me the property, I would proceed no further with her; but she took a solemn oath at the time that she had not seen nor touched a pocket book, and the pocket book not being found on the prisoner, I dismissed the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you met the prisoner had you felt the pocket book in your pocket. - A. I had not felt it for some hours before that. I left my address in the watchhouse I heard in the morning that the runners had got the prisoner, and had found the money in her possession.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not near any of the other women, was you, so that any of them could take it and hand it to her. - A. I was at the first, about a minute, when I met them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know whether you might or might not have lost the pocket book at that period when these three women were about you. - A. I might have lost it at that period.</p>

            . I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street office. On the 3d of October, about a quarter past twelve o'clock, I was returning home, I met Summers with the patrol; the patrol told me what had passed, and understanding that three men of the twelfth light dragoons, and three women were together, I followed the party that he described; I found them going into Duck-lane, Westminster. I followed the prisoner and one soldier into her apartment; the moment I entered her room she threw down five pound five in silver and in gold.</p>

               <p>Q. Then one of the notes had been changed. - A. Yes; she tucked a one pound note under the bed. I searched the soldier that was in company with her; I found on him a one pound note and twenty shillings in silver; she declared that she had only robbed the gentleman of ten pounds; the next morning she acknowledged to the gentleman that she had taken twenty three pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the pocket book. - A. No, that was burnt with a candle.</p>

I went with him, and he took me to one of my own fields, where I found three sheep skins, three heads with the wool on, three plucks, and the whole of the entrails but the cawls, and two sets of ribs of two sheep; they had the meat off all except three of the ribs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the sheep been kept in that field. - A. No, they had not; they only came to my house the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the night before put into that field. - A. They were not; they were in a field that joins the bridge that goes over to Paddington canal; it was close to the other; nothing but the hedge and ditch parted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in the field where they had been kept, to see whether there was any blood in that field. A. No; they were killed in that field; there were three places in that field where I found the remains.</p>

            . On Monday the 28th of September, on going out of my dwelling house. I saw that my ducks and geese were not out; upon opening the door where the ducks were I missed four out of eight, and turning to the other door where the geese were, I missed eight out of twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock was it. - A. About six in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them the night before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not heard of any being missing the night before. - A. No: on the next day I came to London; I met Blackman and Crocker; they asked me if I had lost any geese or ducks, I said I had; they informed me they took two men on suspicion, and had found some ducks and geese upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of these ducks and geese upon seeing them again. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They shewed you some ducks and geese, did not they. - A. Yes; they requested my attendance at Bow-street; these four geese and three ducks were produced at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon their being produced did you know any of them to be yours. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them. - A. One goose in particular, which had a dark wing and a light one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing so particular in the darkness of one wing and the lightness of the other, that enabled you to know it, or was there any other circumstance. - A. Yes, I know it both from the size and the colour; I believe it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides the colour you believed it to be yours. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Tibble with you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on one of the ducks was there any thing particular about that. - A. He had put a mark on that. I knew there was a lame duck, I did not know which; one goose was the smallest of the flock, it was lame, and upon that account it was smaller than the rest; I recollected that goose; I had no doubt of these two geese being my property.</p>

I communicated by suspicion to Blackman, and while we were looking at them Gadsby heaved the sack up on his shoulder; there was a feather came out; we concluded then they had got some poultry; we followed them and took them in custody; on

Montague said he bought them of a man at Bushy; Gadsby said before that he bought his of a man in London in the street. Blackman and I the next day went towards Bushy.</p>
               <p>Q. Do these men live at Bushy. - A. Near it. We happened to enquire of the prosecutor's servant as he was driving his master's team if he knew of any person that had lost any poultry; he told us his master had on Sunday night, he told us where his master lived, he told us that his master was behind him in a one horse cart<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280007"/>We were at the Red Lion at Edgware when the master came up; I asked him if he had lost any ducks or geese, he said he had lost nine geese and four ducks; he came on the Thursday following to Bow-street, when the men were re-examined; these are the two wings that we cut off the goose, one is brown and the other is white.

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. About four o'clock on the afternoon of the 28th of September, I was with Crocker in Broad-street, St. Giles's; Crocker said there is something going along. I think it is poultry; the men were at the corner of Dyot-street, they walked a little further; Gadsby hoisted up this bag on his shoulder, there was a feather flew out, Crocker said it was poultry; we followed them out of Broad-street into High Holborn; I said I will walk them home, we were right opposite the watchhouse; I shoved them into a public house and searched them; in Gadsby's bag there was three ducks. Out of his pocket I took thirteen snares used for catching of hares.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the manner in which they were killed. - A. Yes; they were taken up by the head and swung round, and broke the middle of the neck, the necks were broke of every one; they were killed that way because they do not make any noise. Montague said he bought them at Bushy; Crocker examined Gadsby in another room; he said he bought them in town.</p>

               <p>Q. Is your dwelling house on the premises. - A. Yes; I occupy it alone. The front of the house opens into the street, and the back of the house opens into the brewery yard; the yard is enclosed three parts out of four by a wall, and the fourth part by four dwelling houses, one of which I occupy; there is a wall and a small yard to each house, independent of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any wall between your house and the yard. - A. None; my house opens into the brewery yard, and the store house is in the yard. The prisoner Pollard was my <rs id="t18071028-9-deflabel41" type="occupation">watchman</rs>

On Monday the 21st of September, a few minutes before twelve o'clock at night, the drayman Jones rung the bell; I was watching; I had placed myself near the mill wheel, underneath the stage; I heard the bell ring, Pollard went and opened the gate, he did not know I was there; Jones came in, they went on the stage together; I went through my own dwelling house into the street, I rang the bell and Pollard let me in; I asked him some questions about the brewery, as if I had just come home. I desired him to give me a light and I went into my own dwelling house; he said good night, but said nothing of Jones being there.</p>
               <p>Q. Jones had no business there then. - A.None whatever. I went through a small yard which joins the brewhouse yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Of your house. - A. Yes; I got over the wall, and got into the brewery.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasion had you to do that I understood your back door opened into the brewery. - A. It does, but Pollard would have heard me if I had come out at that door; I had got over another part, and went to my old place underneath the stage. I heard Pollard say, we are safe, he is gone to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Pollard's voice. - A. I did; they were on the stage direct above me; they both came down the steps of the stage together, Pollard and Jones did; it was dark, but we had a lamp burning on the stage, two or three yards off, where they came from; Pollard had a lanthorn in his hand, they both went towards the storehouse, and Pollard gave 
               <persName id="t18071028-9-person124">Jones</persName>
             the light out of the lanthorn; I could see nothing but that till I went to the store house door, I there saw Jones in the storehouse, he had a candle with him; I saw Pollard standing four or five yards from me; I said what do you do here; before I collared him I saw Jones through the folding doors of the store house; in the middle it does not meet; he was drawing beer from a cask in that store house. The moment I collared Pollard Jones put the light out; I said Jones you may come out, I know you, it is vain to make any resistance. He got out underneath the tiles, they had moved a lath.</p>
               <p>Q. When that lath was removed you do not know. - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is this place. - A. It is perhaps five feet from the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the door. - A. It was locked; I had the key; that was the door I looked through.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the moving of that lath make room for a person to come through. - A. Yes, it is a sloping place. I desired them to come along with me into the brewery yard, I desired them to call Thomas, my servant, that lived on the premises; my servant got up and called two watchmen. Pollard was taken to the watchhouse; Jones in the act of going through a small door in the gate got away from the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. When was Jones taken. - A. The same night. When I went to the watchhouse there was an officer of Hatton Garden, he went back with me to the brew-house, with a constable: I gave him the keys of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280008"/>store house to examine the premises; I went in with him; they had bored a hole in the head of one of the casks; before that when I looked through the crivice of the door, I saw the beer running.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what it was running into. - A. I did not. The beer was all run out of the ask or nearly. That cask with others were put in about six weeks before as full casks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any vessel to receive the beer. - A. There was a two quart pot three parts full of beer; it was standing near to the cask, and the candle laying by it on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any vessel for carrying away the beer but the two quart pot. - A. No, but there were about five or six barrels of beer deficient in the store house, within about five or six weeks; that had been bored in a similar way.</p>
               <p>Q. Who that was done by you cannot say. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time had Jones done his work that night. - A. At six o'clock; he had no more business there till six the next morning.</p>

I went back along with the police officer to Mr. Bennet's, we saw the place where they took the beer, and the place where they broke in the store cellar.

            . I am an officer. I know nothing more than apprehending Jones in his lodgings, and seeing the beer that had run on the floor.</p>
               <p>Pollard's Defence. My lord, between eleven and twelve o'clock my fellow servant, Jones, rung at the bell at the gate. I opened the wicket, he came in; he told me he was too late for his lodgings, he wished to sleep in the stable, or hay loft, which I could not think of refusing him, on principles of humanity. We had been brewing that day, consequently there remained a little fire under the copper; I took a little of this fire out in a shovel, put it down on the bricks in the stokehole, put down the gridiron, and broiled me a rasher of bacon for my supper, and was drinking some table beer with it. I went, after letting Jones in into the stoke hole, and he followed me, and we thought of drinking a draft of ale; we went down to the store house, as Mr. Bennet has related, and he went in to draw a little ale in the common drinking pot; he entered this hole, which to my knowledge he never broke; I had noticed it for more than nine months; I had been more than ten months in the house at the time; I had never entered but once myself, when fatigued in working over the stoke hole, as I did not think it an eligible way; Mr. Bennet came in, the consequence was, he gave charge of us; as to the barrels of beer I know nothing of, nor had I any concerns in the place but once, which I have mentioned; other servants were in the house. I do not mean to impeach any. I am not partial to ale, consequently I did not look after it.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. It was late at night, and I had been drinking with a fellow servant. On my going home to my lodgings, I found they were gone to bed, I did not like to call them up; I came back and rang at the bell, the watchman let me in. I intended to lay in the stable, as I had done once or twice before, when I had been locked out, not thinking this would happen; I was very much in liquor; I got in at the hole which was there before; I got a little beer in the two quart pot, on purpose to drink.</p>

               <p>Jones called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             about the beginning of August came to me, saying her husband had left her, and she was in a deal of distress.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose the money. - A. On Wednesday, the 9th of September; she left me to go to look after a place, she told me that she had seen lady Shepheard, No. 31, Half Moon-street, she was to engage her for a house maid; she asked for the key of my bed room, to go up and get her clothes; I gave her the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her clothes there. - A. Yes; she had slept in my bed during the time she was in my house; she brought this shawl down, she said she should take the liberty of borrowing of it for the last time; I took the pattens off my feet and lent her; she promised she would return to engage a child of mine to go as a nursery maid; she did not return at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your money. - A. I missed it that evening; I went to put my clothes in the drawer, and in the box where I had eight pound fourteen and sixpence, there was only three pound nineteen shillings and six pence left; I found this pocket book was opened. I have a son on board a man of war, I receive his half pay. I missed thirteen half guineas out of this paper. My son-in-law allows me it monthly for my own use. I was laying it up in case he should come home distressed.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen this money. - A. Tuesday night after dark, I counted it. The drawer was locked: it had been opened by a key and locked again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had access to this, had your husband. - A. No. I have been separated from my lawfull husband fourteen years. He is in Hoxton workhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Another person who lives with you as a husband had access to it. - A. Yes. I have been fourteen years with him. I pay the rent and taxes for the house in my own name.</p>
               <p>- I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner and searched her; I found on her one shilling, one penny piece, and a halfpenny, and a small key. I asked her how she could behave so to her friend;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280009"/>when her friend had behaved so well to her; she acknowledged it was wrong in her doing so, but she did not think it was so much money as they represented it to be; she said the drawers were open, and she took it out of the drawers, and she had been to Portsmouth to find her husband if she could; she had staid there till she had spent all the money except enough to take a coach and bring her back to town.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to tell you all this. - A. I asked her, and she told me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never had the money; the constable promised getting me through the piece if I would acknowledge, and that my mother would forgive me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you related to this woman. - A. I always counted her a mother in law; she is not married to the man that she lives with; I called her mother in law; the man that she lives with was the father of the son that I lived with.</p>

               <p>Q. What place had you come from. - A. From the county of Durham.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you went there was there another person in the coach. - A. Mr. Watt was there when I came in the coach; no other gentleman then; the other side of York we took in the prisoner and captain Chulmley of the light dragoons.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280010"/>Q. Did the prisoner come all the way to London with you. - A. All the way.</p>

             left us at Grantham, and I am certain I saw the parcel between Newark and Grantham. There were two parcels in the pocket of the coach, one addressed to Messrs. Rhodes. Red-lion-square, and the other addressed to Messrs. Kensington; I took it out of the pocket, and seeing the shape and size of it, I made that observation, that it contained money; and it seemed to me to be a careless manner of conveying a parcel of so much value.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the coach was the prisoner sitting in. - A. He was sitting facing of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that he observed you take the parcel. - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to London there was Mr. Watt, you, and the prisoner. - A. No more than us three; captain Chulmney left us at Grantham; we all got out at the post office, Lombard-street. Mr. Watt and I, each got a porter to carry our luggage, he did not appear to have much luggage; he had a pair of small saddle bags, he took them under his arm and walked away, and I believe Mr. Watt accompained him; he said he was going to the west end of the town. Mr. Watt was going to the London coffee house.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you hear of the loss of this parcel. - A. About three weeks afterwards. I think within a week after that I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe at that time you did not know the name of the prisoner. - A. Oh no. When I met the prisoner, he was walking between the turnpike-gate at Battle bridge and Charles-street; I rode up to him, I asked him if he recollected me making the observation respecting the parcel I have stated; he said he did; I told him the parcel was lost, and that it contained money and bills to a large amount; that I had been called upon by Mr. Kensington, and I had given him what information I could upon it; I said if he would take the trouble the first time he went into the city to call upon them they would be obliged to him, and I should the same; he told me he should make it his business to call; I told him I had met Mr. Watt a few days before, Mr. Watt perfectly recollected the parcel; when I met him he promised also to call at Messrs. Kensington.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, sir, you did not see the prisoner again till you saw him in custody. - A No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You then recollected that he had been a travellar in the coach. - A. Perfectly I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. If I understand you distinctly, there were five passengers altogether in the coach. - A. No, not more than four at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then altogether there were five. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Chulmney left you, you never saw the parcel at all. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is is not usual to change the coach. - A. Not between York and London.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you came to London, can you undertake to say the prisoner was left alone for a single moment. - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot undertake to say that at any given time the prisoner was alone. - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You cannot say whether the prisoner was left alone, in the course of the night you went to sleep - A. Of course if we can.</p>

               <p>Court (to Mr. Rangham.) I suppose you went out of the coach a number of times in theniously stealing on th. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Now the objection arises. - You do not prove in the city of London the possession of a parcel that this man stole, because he is found in possession of part of the produce in the county of Kent; there is no evidence of the possession of the property in the city of London, though the prisoner will not go from the bar without strong suspicion. We are not to convict men of offences with our suspicions only; it is much better a guilty man to escape punishment than an innocent man to be found guilty. Gentlemen, this is a very suspicious case certainly, and whatever you and I in our private opinions may think of the prisoner, we cannot upon this evidence convict him. Where the life or the liberty of the subject is concerned, it is necessary the offence should be committed in the county. Property stolen in any any distant county being brought into another county, the felony continues with him; but here is no evidence at all of the property being seen in London; it is not seen by Mr. Rangham but in the country; the produce is not found in the possession of the prisoner in London. The property is stolen on the 13th of March, and negotiated on the 20th of March in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280012"/>Derbyshire. There is strong suspicion against the prisoner, but this suspicion may be against an innocent person. There is no evidence that he had possession of it in this county.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. Last Wednesday, about a quarter past two in the afternoon I was passing Well's house; I saw the prisoner stoop and reach within the shop, and take something from a case within the shop; I at first thought from the unconcerned manner he did it that he belonged to the shop; I saw him reach the piece to a young man, who appeared a companion; the young man declined taking it, as it appeared they were observed, and he went off. Directly I see the prisoner with the piece under his arm going up the market; I immediately pursued him and cried out stop thief; there were several persons in pursuit. As soon as the cry was raised, he threw the piece down among some fish guts in the fish market; I did not pick up the piece, but followed the prisoner. Going up the side of the market an elderly man attempted to stop him, the prisoner struck him and knocked him down; in his falling the prisoner stumbled against his feet, which gave me an opportunity of laying hold of him. An officer came up and I gave him in charge to the officer immediately; I never lost sight of him; he was taken within two hundred yards of the place where the robbery was commited.</p>

            , which offence it is stated he had done in China.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the circumstances which I have to state to you will be short. The prisoner was serving as a mariner on board an East India ship called the Alnwick Castle - that vessel arrived at China, and was a considerable way up the river; the prisoner, with many of the crew were on shore, and while they were on shore a quarrel and squabble took place among them. I cannot state to you the origin, because I have no witnesses here that were present at it; but I have a person of the name of Burford, who was acting as steward for the captain; he went down among them with

               <p>Gentlemen. Burford and the deceased were desirous of taking the knife from him; and Bourne the deceased went up to him for the purpose of taking the knife from him, and after trying to take the knife from him, he stabbed at him; the decease made a second attempt to take the knife; he did not succeed; and while they were closed in the scuffle, he gave him another blow with the knife, of which he died.</p>

VIII. cap. 33. Before that act passed no jurisdiction in this kingdom could take cognizance of what took place in a foreign country; by that act his Majesty was authorised to try persons for offences, whether committed within or without the kingdom. - Gentlemen, I shall call the witnesses to prove the facts.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the deceased Bourne one of the crew of the ship. - A. Yes, he was an Englishman; the prisoner was an Spaniard. Bourne and me were together at the affray.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there only foreign sailors in this party. - A. Foreigners and Englishmen too; when I went to them I found the prisoner in the ring, among the people, with his knife drawn, attempting to stab several of the crew; I immediately went into the ring and desired the prisoner to come to the factory. As soon as the prisoner saw me he came up with the knife and attempted to stab me; I immediately put out my stick to keep him from me; as soon as he came close enough to me he let his arm fall. The deceased Bourne came to me, and said, do not go near him, he has got a knife in his hand; I made answer I see it, and I intend to take it from him; the deceased then said I will take it from him. He then went up to the prisoner and attempted to lay hold of him; he got hold of his left arm, the knife was in the prisoner's right hand; he pushed the prisoner against the rails with some violence; that moment Depardo made a thrust at Bourne, and slightly wounded him somewhere about the belly near the navel. The deceased Bourne then attempted to lay hold of his hand a second time; he again missed it; Depardo then gave him the second thrust very violently, he thrust him in the belly. Bourne then immediately fell from the prisoner and said that he was stabbed. The prisoner then threw his knife over his head over the rails that were behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the knife taken from the place where it fell. - A. No. I took the prisoner; I saw Bourne in half an hour afterwards, he was laying on his back about an hundred yards from where he received the wound, with part of his entrails out.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did Bourne die. - A. I cannot say; I was with him the whole night; as soon as day light came he was taken down to the doctor of the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him last he was a dying. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not see him after day light. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Depardo in the ring first was the knife drawn. - A. Yes; he was attempting to stab some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of them doing any thing. - A. Yes, all of them had their sticks up trying to strike them.</p>
               <p>[The prisoner was allowed by the Court an interpreter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280014"/>who was directed to repeat the whole of the evidence to the prisoner.]</p>
               <p>Interpreter. The prisoner says he was on board as a prisoner of war: he says he was told by the officers it was necessary they should navigate merchant's ships, and he agreed to do it; he does not remember seeing the witness at the time of the affray.</p>
               <p>Court. Ask the prisoner whether he would put any questions to the witness Burford. - A. He begs the witness may be asked whether the crew did not wound the prisoner in three places in the head.</p>
               <p>Q. to Burford. Do you know whether the people wounded him in three parts of the head, or any where. A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he was wounded. - A. Very likely he might.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner might be wounded, but you did not see it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Int. The prisoner wishes to ask whether the deceased did not sally forth from the street where he was with a stick to strike him. - A. Burford. He had no stick, he had no intention of striking him.</p>
               <p>Int. The prisoner asks the witness whether after the deceased fell the other sailors about him struck him. - A. Burford. I believe they did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see them strike the prisoner with their sticks before he struck the deceased. - A. I did not see them strike him.</p>
               <p>Q. You said they had their sticks as if they were attempting to strike him - A. Yes, I think they were engaged in an affray, they attempted to strike him with their sticks, and he was menacing to keep them off.</p>

               <p>Mr. Att. General to Hall. Were you present when Depardo entered on board. - A. Yes, he was a prisoner of war on board the Blenheim; he came aboard of us from the Blenheim as a volunteer.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he received the bounty. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not serving as a prisoner of war. - A. Yes; he had entered as one of our crew.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that wound the occasion of his death. - A. It was; I opened his body; he died on board the Alnwick Castle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (by the interpreter). My lord - he says, my lord, that the declaration of some of the witnesses, that he wounded the man, is false - that the man came towards him in a fit of drunkenness, that he had a stick in his hand, with which he hit him on his head and cut his head; there is a scar now upon his head; that after hitting him over the head with the stick, the deceased drew back, and upon the deceased withdrawing himself, another sailor of the party came up, and also struck him with a stick behind his head; he fell down with the blow that he received; that when he recovered himself and got upon his legs, he perceived that his knife had fallen on the ground; he picked the knife up; they did not give him time to put the knife in the scabbard, which was by his side; it not being a clasp knife he wore it in the scabbard by his side. As soon as he was upon his feet, he having the knife in his hand, the deceased and another came upon him with sticks; that he being in such a ground, he could not retreat, being close up to the wall of the factory. He endeavoured to defend himself with his left arm up, and received the blows from the stick with his left arm; that the deceased coming upon him to make a blow, he missed his aim, his foot slipped, he fell forward upon him, the prisoner, or against him. In consequence of his having the knife projected the deceased fell upon the knife, or against it. He says that had it been his inclination of killing any body, he had the opportunity of killing three or four that pressed upon him; that he wished to avoid any quarrel with them; that before this he hid himself behind a door of the factory to avoid being in the affray, that it was about half past nine at night; that after he had hid himself behind the door, a seaman of the party dragged him out by the hair of his head. At that time he wore long hair. The sailors then said, come, let us kill him, there will be one less of the enemy; that they said to each other, or that the men said, there is no crime in it, we shall not be hurt in killing him, there was no justice for him. They then dragged him forward; he was then against the wall, where the deceased met with the wound. There were four witnesses, which he wished to be called, but the captain did not notice it, he says, as I know well. At the first examination there was one attended, his name was Tores.</p>

               <p>Court. Is he here. - A. I believe not. (The witness called, but did not appear.)</p>
               <p>MR. READ. - Mr. Att. General. You examined Tores the prisoner's witness. - A. I did. I took Tores' examination; it was read over to the prisoner; there was nothing in his examination favourable to the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280015"/>and the prisoner, when he heard the examination, thought it was not material that he should be kept; he agreed for him to be set at liberty. Tores said he stood at a distance all the while.</p>
               <p>Int. He says that another evidence would be material to him, John Baptisto, but the captain did not take the measure to bring him forward.</p>
               <p>Mr. Read. There was every means used for to find Baptisto; the men were hunting after him for a fortnight; he could not be found.</p>
               <p>Int. The prisoner says that must be the fault of the captain.</p>
               <p>Court to Burford. The prisoner has said that he was defending himself against a stick with which the deceased was striking him; he says the deceased slipped or fell forward, and fell upon the knife - is that true. - A. No, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true that the deceased ever gave him any blows. - A. No, not while I was there, and the deceased was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Int. The prisoner begs leave to say, that it will not appear probable, that a man would come out in such a situation in his shirt, without he had been in liquor.</p>

               <p>Burford. The deceased was in bed, he was called up by some of them to quell the Spaniards.</p>
               <p>Jury. Some of the jury wish to know whether the prisoner understood the English language.</p>
               <p>Court to Burford. Do you know whether the prisoner understood the English, language. - A. I believe he does; Mr. Stary can inform you better,</p>
               <p>Mr. Stary. He has spoken English as a sort of interpreter, for men who were sick under my care.</p>
               <p>COURT. Gentlemen, the prisoner stands indicted before you, upon an indictment found under a special commission, which is issued by his Majesty, under certain powers granted in the 33rd Hen. VIII. which enables courts of judicature in this kingdom, to try persons for offences of this description, that are committed beyond the seas: namely, for murder; and by a subsequent statute, the 43rd, of 
               <persName id="t18071028-14-person216">George</persName>
             the Third, the former statute was extended to manslaughter. - This indictment is for manslaughter only; and the only question for your consideration will be, whether the facts that are disclosed in evidence on the part of the prosecution, whether they amount to manslaughter, or whether it amounts to killing in his own defence. If you should be of opinion that it is killing in a common affray, in the heat of blood, you will find him guilty of manslaughter. The bill not being framed for murder, it is no question for your consideration: - [The court went through the evidence of Burford, and the other witnesses most minutely.] - Gentlemen, he, the prisoner, according to Burford's evidence, after he had given the second thrust to the deceased, the deceased fell from the prisoner, and said he was stabbed; he, the prisoner, threw his knife away.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it should seem that was the moment he should have kept his knife, unless he was conscious that he had in the heat of blood, done a great injury to another; which under the provacation of the moment he had been subject to, and fearful that on some other provacation it might be done again. He threw the knife away; that shews it was done in great heat of blood, and not with self defence; because then it would have been most natural for him to have heid the knife. The question will be, whether you believe the evidence given by Burford, or whether you believe the account of the prisoner; whether you can come to think the account the prisoner gives sufficient to explain the transaction, so as to give it a more lenient construction; with respect to what the prisoner said in his defence, I called Burford again, and Burford says it is not true that the deceased slipped, and fell forward against the prisoner, and fell upon the knife; nor is it true that the deceased gave the prisoner any blows in his presence but that the deceased met with his death from the knife that was in the prisoner's hand, under the circumstances already stated by him; therefore the only question is, whether it was done in the heat of blood, or whether it was a killing on his own defence: Therefore I have detailed to you what the prisoner said in his own defence, though not on oath, because, in many cases, what the prisoner says, though not on oath, gives it another colour. You are to examine the evidence with the aid of his own defence, and whether it appears credible to you, the story that he tells of the man falling up- upon the knife; I think that is not very probable, and their dragging him out by the hair of his head; there would be no harm in killing him; there would be one enemy the less; you will judge whether that is probable: If it appears to you to be committed in the heat of blood, in mutual conflict of all the parties, it will amount to manslaughter; but if it appears to you, he is surrounded by a multitude, and in danger of his life, that he drew out a weapon against the threatened violence, and in defence of himself, death ensued that would be self defence, he would then be entitled to an acquittal; still more entitled to an acquittal if the deceased fell upon the knife.</p>

I went in the morning, he said he believed it to be No. 823, I went to the yard, it was not the man. On the 24th of September, my fellow servant saw him in the Strand, he knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things. - A. No, none of them. He was a short man, and pock fretted; he drove 594.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is the coachman that drove that coach. - A. That is the coachman. (pointing to the prisoner).</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you help to take the things out. - A. Yes; at the time I was gone in the back shop with some of the things from the inside of the coach, master paid the coachman his fare; as soon as he got his fare the coachman drove off; when I came back, master asked me if there was not a cask in the boot, I said there was; he said the coachman was drove off.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was not only a box in this boot, but a cask. - A. Yes, a four gallon cask of ale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. How long after you had rode from Brompton to London was it that you saw the coachman. - A. It was the 4th of September, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. That was better than a fortnight, you then said you was positive he is the man. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it you left Brompton. - A. Between five and six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. It was then getting towards dusk, it was dark when you arrived in the Strand. - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say you was not certain that he was the man that drove the coach. - A. No; I always said that I was certain that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say to Mr. Burgess, that you believed he was not the man. - A. I never said so in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him in custody when you saw him in the Strand. - A. No, I went and informed my fellow servant; 945 was the number.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite correct in every thing you state, you are sure it was not 594. - A. It was 594.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Now you say 594 was the number, because I said so.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the 26th of September I apprehended the prisoner in company with Renny, and the last witness: Reeves gave me the number of the coach 594, we found the coach put up in Greville mews, Guildford-street; we met the prisoner in the street. Reeves said there is the man coming; I asked him if he was sure of the man, he said he was positive of it; when he came up to us, I asked him what he had done with the box and the barrel of ale, that was left in the boot of his coach; he said he had no recollection of ever having such a thing; I asked him if he remembered bringing a fare from Brompton, with a child's cradle tied behind his coach, I was given to understand that was the case; he said he carried so many faces he could not remember any thing about it; I told him I was an officer, I should take him in custody; Reeves being positive of his person, I searched his master's place, and his lodgings; I found nothing.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the day on which this man was hired at Sloane-street. - A. I do not; that young woman came to me on the 17th of August, near eight o'clock in the evening, she asked me if I could tell her where the coach that came to Brompton was; I told her I could not, I could recollect her beckoning the coach; I said should you know the coach and the coachman again; she said it was a dark green coach, with coronets.</p>

On Sunday night the 27th of September, about eight o'clock, I was coming from Mill Hill, coming through the Hale to Edgware; I called at the Green Man at the Hule, and the prisoner was there and another man in company with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before. - A. Yes, many years. I did not know the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. But you said another man was in his company at the Green Man. - A. I did not notice that then; there was another man with him when I was knocked down. The prisoner saw me pull out my money to pay the reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any talk with him while you were with him. - A. Very little talk, I was there only a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you liquor there at the Green Man. - A. I had part of two pots of beer amongst two or three, that is all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one that drank with you. - A. He did drink out of the pot.</p>
               <p>Q. What liquor had you had before you came to the Green Man. - A. I left the public house at Mill Hill at two o'clock. I had a little beer there, nothing to hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in your opinion - what quantity of ale may you have drank there. - A. I cannot rightly tell, I was not disguised in liquor but what I knew the person that knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you left the Green Man. - A. Near eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when this happened to you. - A. At a place called the <placeName id="t18071028-16-crimeloc78">Gravel Path field, between the Hale and Edgware</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you see him before he knocked you down. - A. No, I did not see him till I was knocked down; there was another man with him, I did not know him.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see the person that struck you till you were knocked down. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done to you when you were knocked down. - A. The prisoner bound my arms down while the other picked my pocket while I was on the ground. They never spoke; they took three pounds fifteen shillings out of my pocket; I had taken the money not all of one man, but at different places; I had two one pound notes, three seven shilling pieces, four half crowns, and four shillings; I had not long taken it that day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were so robbed what became of the men. - A. The prisoner ran away back the same way he came; I saw him run; the other ran behind me; I screamed out murder, I was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did the other man go. - A. I never saw the other man go away; he was behind; I never saw him go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure your money was in your purse when you left the public house. - A. The notes were loose in my pocket, and the money in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the gold and silver were in one pocket, and the notes in the other. - A. There was one seven shilling piece wrapped up in a one pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you found yourself robbed. - A. I went home directly to Edgware.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not turn back after the prisoner. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the Hale at this time, from where you were robbed. - A. I do not think it was half a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go back after the prisoner when it was so nigh. - A. I was so nigh home as I was to the Hale; he lived at the Hale, he was a farming man. The next morning I gave information to the patrol; I went to the justice at Edgware the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that you knew the man that had robbed you. - A. I did, the same night; I knew his name and his person.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner again. - A. When I took him. The patrol and I took him on the same spot where he did the robbery; he was coming through the same field.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched when he was apprehended. - A. He was searched in the Crane at Edgware; a half crown and some halfpence was only found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you knew nothing of that money. - A. No; the notes were not found nor the gold.</p>
               <p>Q. This you say was about eight o'clock at night - what sort of a night was it. - A. It was a kind of star light night, not moon light; I could see his face so as to be sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the blow that knocked you down stunned you. - A. No, I was not stunned.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you was quite sober when this happened. - A. I was a little fresh, I was not drunk; I am quite sure he is the man that knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. When you went from the Green Man you acknowledged you was a little fresh. - A. Yes; I was not drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. When he met you coming across the field, did not he tell you that he heard you had accused him of the robbery, and he was coming to you. - A. He said he heard that I had swore the robbery against him, and I had not; I told him he was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect telling him this - No, Davey it is not you; I thought so last night, but now I know it is not. - A. I said no such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a man of the name of Budge with him. - A. No; there was a man of the name of Blake going by.</p>
               <p>Q. The patrol was with you, was he not. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect telling him that the ostler at Mill Hill was the person that robbed you. - A. I did not say no such thing; there was another man brought up; I told them to let him go, I had no suspicions of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect saying that a man of the name of Hurst robbed you. - A. No; they brought that person up; I saw Hurst at the Plough; I told them to let him go, he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you said any thing relating to Hurst that had caused the suspicion of his being one of the men. - A. I had mentioned it by his colouring so at the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before he was brought to you. A. Yes, I saw him at the Three Hammers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. You know there is a share of forty pounds if this man be convicted. - A. I do not know any thing of that.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking in the public house with these men, at the sign of the Green Man; there were four men drinking with me before the prosecutor came in with another man; they called for a pot of beer, they asked me to drink out of it; I did; the prosecutor pulled out sixpence and paid for it; when the pot was out he called for another and paid for that; before the pot was out the company all went away but one man that lodges in the house; after they were gone I drank once out of that pot, and then I went home to my father, who has been bad this half year; I carried him to bed and sat down by the fire till near nine o'clock. When I came out of the public house, I left the prosecutor in the public house; the landlady and he was having some words. As I was setting by my mother's fire she asked me to fetch her some beer; I fetched a pint and a half from the Green Man; the prosecutor was gone, I did not see him any more then On the next morning going to my work I met a man of the name of Budge, he said I was the man he wanted to see; he said Fenn was robbed last night, he had been to the justice last night, and said it was me; I said I was innocent. I immediately strikes off to Edgware to meet the prosecutor; I met him and the patrol together, and a man of the name of Lake; I said Mr. Fenn I hear you charge me with robbing of you last night, he replied he thought it was me, but he knowed it was not now, but he could swear to the ostler at the Kings head, by his leading him down the lane, to shew him the footpath to his home; after meeting of them in the fields. we went to the Green Man we had two pots of beer; there was a man of the name of Hiams there. We were telling him of the circumstance; Hiams asked him whether I was the man, I immediately told him he had charged me with the robberry; Fenn heard me; he told me to say no more about it, I was not the man. We went to Mill Hill to the man as he said, led him down the the lane to shew him the path, and that had robbed him; we called in at the Three Hammers. Hurst was in the Hammers eating his breakfast; when we went into the house, the prosecutor says, I think Hurst is one by his countenance; he did not say any thing to Hurst then, but went to Mill Hill and enquired for the man that took him down the lane. When we came to the King's Head the man was not at home; he then said that Hurst must be the man. Hurst was brought to the Plough, the landlady of the Plough at Mill Hill said Hurst was not out of the house from seven o'clock till ten. They brought me from the Plough to the Crane at Edgware, where they searched me; they found but two shillings and sixpence in my pocket, and a shilling of that I had borrowed of my sister; the patrol knowed that.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did any body shew you the foot path leading to your home. - A. The prisoner did; he came down the lane with me, he said keep along the foot path, that will take you to Edgware; I said, I know that.</p>

On the 5th of October I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280020"/>to the prisoner's lodgings, No. 3, Southampton-street, Tottenham-court-road. Mrs. Clark brought her to the office in a coach. When I got into the coach she told me her lodgings was there; she gave me the keys; I found when I opened the box a bunch of keys, a lace frill; in one of the boxes I found a one pound note, Mrs. Clark said it was her servant's keys; the prisoner did not deny it. The prisoner said it was her note. I produce the keys, the frill and the one pound note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That one pound note was in my pocket, it was not in the box.</p>
               <p>Blackman. I took it out of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Creswell. Look at these keys. - A. This one undoes one of my boxes. The ring without doubt is mine. The frill is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you tried that key. - A. No, not since.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing you can know your note by. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The money belongs to me, it is mine; I picked up the frill when I was making the bed, and the keys, I did know I had got them; I intended to take the keys back again, when I went to ask for my character.</p>

               <p>Q. Before she went did you miss any of these articles. - A. No, not one, nor had no suspicion of her. On the 5th of October, I found the prisoner in St Martin's-lane, I had received information that she was there to see her mantua maker.</p>
               <p>Q. You found her in St. Martin's lane. - A. Yes; I told her that her fellow servant had got robbed, I asked her if she had any objection to walk with me home; she did very freely. When she was in the room, I asked her if she knew any thing of a cap that I missed before she came back with me that morning; she said she did not; I asked her if she knew the cap I spoke of, telling her it was a new one; she said she knew it very well, but she had not seen it; I asked her if she knew any thing of a lace frill that hung on the glass, she denied that also; I believed it was true; but I turned round and pulled the lace she was wearing instead of a cap; it was a piece of lace that I have got; I asked her if she had got any thing more, she said she had got nothing else than a necklace; I wanted her to tell where she lodged, that I might go and see whether she had any of my property; I took a coach, she did not chuse to tell; I told the coachman to drive to Bow-street; I got a Bow-street officer, Blackman, and then she told where her lodgings was; her pockets were searched in the coach, and several pieces of money were found.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing of the money you can speak to. - A. Yes, a crown piece, I can swear to. When we came into her lodgings, the keys were found upon her; upon searching her box the articles were found in her box, that are now produced.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 19th of September, I was officer of the night at Coleman-street watchhouse; I was sent for about half past twelve at night, to Swan-alley, there Mr. Morgan said he had been robbed, he gave charge of Mrs. Thomas; there was a man in bed, I supposed it was her husband. I asked him if he would give me leave to search the room, he said, by all means; on looking under the bed, I found a sack, I laid the contents on the floor; I asked Mr. Morgan if any thing there was his: he said, I want my coat, waistcoat and breeches; I searched the room, I could not find any thing of the kind; I put the things in the sack under the bedstead, where I found them. I took the prisoner to the Compter. On Sunday morning, about nine o'clock, Morgan came to me; he said he understood there was some of his property in the room, what I had pulled out of the sack. About eleven o'clock on Sunday I found Thomas at home; I laid the contents of the sack on the floor again, and Mrs. Morgan said they were all her property, she would swear to it. On Monday morning we went to Mr. Smith's in Wood-street, we found part of the property, which Mr. Morgan said he would swear to be his property. The pawnbroker resigned the property up to me; I told him he must come up to the mansion house. I have got the whole of the property here that I took, and some of the burnt things.</p>

            , she is a widow. The prisoner at the bar had been in my service about three years; he left my service about June last.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to his leaving your service, had you missed a great deal of your property. - A. We repeatedly missed property, but never could trace it; and it was frequently made up by him from other goods in the house. When we missed property, I have said to him, there is some of the lot lost; he said, perhaps I have laid it some were, else he would look and make it up; and others were never replaced.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he left you in June, how soon afterwards did you receive any information respecting your property. - A. On the 23rd of September. On the 24th I got a constable, and took him up; I went to a public house near St. Martin's-le-grand, we found him there drinking; he asked us what our business was, the constable told him he came to take him for stealing his master's property; the constable took him to Giltspur-street Compter; and then he went and searched his lodgings, No. 30, Angel-street, St. Martin's-le-grand; I went with him, Mrs. Roberts took us into a room, she said the prisoner lodged there; on searching a box, we found a number of duplicates in a pocket book, some of the duplicates were for boot legs; I found several papers; I did not attend to them, they were kept by the constable till the next day. In consequence of these duplicates, we went to four different pawnbrokers; we found articles that we had been robbed of at three of the pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Mrs. Thompson is your partner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any other private partner. - A. None whatever.</p>

Yes, I asked him if he knew me, he said he knew nobody; he made a bit of resistance; I throwed him on the floor and handcuffed him; I told him for what I took him, he said he knew nothing about it; I took him to Giltspur-street Compter; I afterwards went to Angel-street.</p>

On the 28th of September I missed them; on the 26th she came to ask me to buy a duplicate of a gown pledged at Mr. Morriss's in the Minories, I refused it, I did not like to do it; she said she had lately buried a child of five months old, and her husband was on board a ship, she was in great distress, she begged hard of me to let her have sixpence, she said she had not broke her fast that day; I gave her sixpence; she left me the duplicate. On the 28th she called, she asked me if I had been to take out the gown in pledge I told her I had not, I was very busy a sewing; I asked to stop a bit and help me to sew, which she did; I gave her tea and sixpence for helping me to sew from three o'clock till eight; after tea I went to put my children to bed and left her behind; while I was putting the children to bed she came up stairs to me and she brought up the quilt, which I set her to mend, and bid me good night; I did not follow her down stairs immediately; about a quarter of an hour after she was gone, another person came in with some work; with that I looked for a little coat and waistcoat that I had made to shew to the person, and then I missed it; as soon as the person went out, I made a search but could not find it; I missed my own articles as well. I went to two pawnbrokers the same night, she had not been there; they advised me to go early into the Minories, where the gown was pledged, that she brought me the duplicate of; when I went to the shop, she had not been there; then I was gone to another pawnbrokers a few doors of, in the mean time she came to Mr. Morriss's in the Minories; they stopped her and came to me at the next shop, as they knew I was gone there, when I came to Mr. Morriss's shop, she had got my things tied up in a large handkerchief, and the shawl on her neck; she was taken in custody; on the 29th the coat and waistcoat were found at another pawnbrokers.</p>

            . I live at No. 64, John-street, Surry side of Blackfriar's-bridge. I lost these things on Saturday night last, about eight o'clock; my cart was standing at Bridewel-gate, New Bridge-street, Blackfriar's; while I went to Water-lane, to fetch this parcel; I brought the parcel, and placed it in the tail of the cart; I then said to my boy, push on, we shall be late home; I then got into the cart, and at the corner of <placeName id="t18071028-23-crimeloc118">Bride-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. The person was gone - A. Yes, I saw him take it out; he made down Bride-lane. I halloaed stop thief, no person attempted to stop him; I pursued him, till he came to the corner by the hair dresser's; he then returned upon me at the corner, I did not observe the bundle all the way he ran; when he returned I caught him fast by the collar, I said, you are the man who took my basket out of my cart, and while I said these words, I saw the basket standing about a yard from him, under the hair dresser's window. I took my basket up in my right hand, and held him fast with my left hand, and took him to St. Bride's watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. What time of the night was this. - A. About eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find some difficulty in getting out of your cart. - A. No, if I had broke my neck, I should not have thought any thing of it at the moment.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope your neck will not be broke, nor his upon this occasion; could you pretend to say he was the man that ran away from you when you met him. - A. I am positive; I was so close upon him, he turned that corner and set the basket down, I suppose, and returned.</p>
               <p>Q. I know it is all supposition - what distance were you from from the corner, at the time the man ran away from you. - A. I was close to him almost, there was no soul in the lane but a boy; I believe he saw me take him.</p>

               <p>WALTER M'DONALD. I am constable at St. Bride's parish; I attended; and the last witness has related to your lordship every thing he told me then, the prisoner denied having any concern in the robbery.</p>

            . I was close to this gentleman's cart, a man came behind it I stopped looking at him; a man tapped me on the shoulder and asked me the way to Cornhill; I told him to go along Cheapside; he says, cannot I go over London bridge; I says, yes, you can, it is the furthest way; just as I said them words, the cart was stopped; I run down Bride's-passage, and when I run down Bride's-passage, I saw not a soul coming up nor down the lane; I returned back, I found the prosecutor and the prisoner coming up the lane.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the man take the things out of the cart. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Because the other man was asking you the way to Cornhill. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was taken to the watchhouse, Mr. Wanger would not take upon him to say I took the things out of the cart, nor that I was the man that dropped the parcel.</p>

            . ESQ. - Mr. Reynolds. I believe you are a captain of the royal navy. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did you go to Mr. Hatchett's house. - A. On the 11th of September; I slept there that night in the room No. 53.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you bring with you. - A. I brought a writing desk, containing two five pound notes, several one pound notes, and six guineas in gold; they were in different pieces; a vast number of letters and other papers, they were all in the writing desk.</p>
               <p>Q. What else had you. - A. A trunk containing linen of all kinds, shirts, stockings, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. On the following morning what time did you get up. - A. About eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up and dressed, was your property all there. - A. That I cannot swear to. I had seen the desk and opened it the day before, and rather think if it had not been there I should have noticed that. I went down stairs about eight o'clock, and went up again about half past nine.</p>
               <p>Court. Your desk you said you opened it the day before, did you leave it open. - A. No, I locked it, and left it locked. When I went up at half after nine, I went on purpose for my writing desk, I found it missing; I mentioned it to Mrs. Hatchet; I came back immediately and looked at the trunk, and the trunk was broken open; it was still locked, but the has was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. What things were in the trunk missing - A. Every thing except a book of letters.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you saw some of this property afterwards. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Captain Chetham, have you seen the trunk that you lost since. - A. I have it in my possession now.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you confident that it is your trunk that you had in your possession. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Court. What trunk.</p>
               <p>Captain Chetham. I fancy he means the writing desk, the trunk was never gone. I have the key of the writing desk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Will you open it. - A. That key will not open it, the lock has been taken off and another put on.</p>
               <p>Court. Now prisoner be upon your guard, you may ask questions that will do you essential harm, you have no counsel, it becomes me to caution you to be careful of the questions you put.</p>
               <p>SARAH BISHOP. - Mr. Reynolds. Were you chambermaid in September last. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember captain Chetham coming to your master. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did he sleep in. - A. No. 53.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, do you know him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Where does No. 53 stand, with reference to No. 45. - A.53 is lower down, on the one pair stair case.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it direct under it. - A. It is not quite under it; 53 is under 45.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Persons coming down from No. 45, do they pass 53. - A. They pass near it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man at your house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the prisoner at the bar, are you sure that he is the same person. - A. Yes, he came on the 10th, and on the 11th, and went away on the morning of the 12th; he slept two nights there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. When he came what did he bring with him. - A. He brought a portmanteau and a trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they put. - A. They were brought down stairs from his room No. 45.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did he go to - A. No. 45.</p>
               <p>Court. Then they were carried up stairs. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went away they were brought down from this room where they were carried to, trunk and portmanteau. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. He went away on the morning of the 12th. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the following day did you see any thing outside of the window. - A. On the day after I saw outside of the room, No. 45, I found eight bricks, they were wrapped up in paper, and a piece of old carpet over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else slept in that room. - A. No, nobody after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you looked out of the window on the 12th when he went away. - A. Not that morning; I had looked out of the window into the parapet the day before the prisoner came.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this parcel of bricks there then. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was not. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I think when he went away, his trunk and his portmanteau was taken away. - A. Yes, his trunk was on the landing place of 53, and his portmanteau in his own room; the porter brought down the trunk, and the prisoner brought down the portmanteau.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock in the morning was it. - A. A little after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he go away. - A. The porter brought his trunk down stairs, and the prisoner brought his portmanteau, and they took them to the corner of Bond-street; the prisoner himself carried the portmanteau to the corner of Bond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the porter carry the trunk to the corner of Bond-street. - A. The porter followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the porter's name. - A.

               <p>Trott. I have got the duplicates of the whole that is produced; I produce them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask the witness if he does positively recollect that it was I that pledged that coat and parcel. - A.(Moxem) I will not undertake<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280027"/>to swear it was him that pledged them; the pantaloons and waistcoat, that was pledged with other things that captain Chetham owned, I perfectly well remember he pledged them; they were naval pantaloons, white kerseymere, with new buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. The parcel that you describe that there were razors with it, was it I that pledged that parcel. - A. It appears in your name; I remember they were pledged the second time in the same name, with other articles; I remember his pledging them first, and taking them out.</p>

               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Captain Chetham, look at that desk - is that your desk. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the desk you had at Hatchett's hotel, which you found you had lost on the morning of the 12th. - A. It is; I know it by being in the habit of using it frequently; I have had it seven years; here is Johnson's dictionary in the form of a pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the desk the last time you saw it. - A. It was; and this picture, I stuck that on it, and that almanac is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the picture. - A. Of Time; the pantaloons I very much believe them to be mine, but the buttons have been changed.</p>
               <p>Q. What buttons had yours on that you lost. - A. Anchor naval buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the stockings and shirts. - A. These stockings are mine, and the shirts are mine; this epaulet is mine; they are not always made in this manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the two five pound notes being in your desk. - A. I can; it was on last Friday morning; I opened it.</p>
               <p>Court. Does the lock appear to be changed on looking at it. - A. It is changed; it is new; and the key was new, and this catch is new.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, the indulgence I received from this court yesterday did not avail me; I had a witness to bring forward, but it has been counteracted, in consequence of my being immediately called back to be arrainged for a crime in the city; on that account, my witness has not come forward, even to prove a thing that is a fact, that my wife and I have dealt in purchasing second hand wearing apparel for many years; and indeed the number of things that have been accumulated, they have been honestly purchased by her; and if I ever was guilty of crimes, she never knew nothing of it. My lord, I stand in this court, in a most awful situation - a situation that harrows me up to the soul, to think that ever I should come in this disgraceful way; having lived twenty years in Westminster a respectable housekeeper; it grieves me to my very soul; and I earnestly intreat your lordship to shew mercy to one whose crimes have been, indeed, but very few. I am deprived of the means of that defence, that I could wish to make before your lordship. I have been confined three weeks in Cold Bath-fields, I had not an opportunity for it; I was only last Friday evening sent to Newgate; it has not been in my power even to get friends to my character. I have been anxiously hoking round the court, I see one face, I will call him to speak what he knows of me; I therefore implore your lordship, on account of my children, on account of my family, that you will have the kindness to extend that mercy that your judgment thinks my present situation requires.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him on the morning of the 5th. - A. I do; he breakfasted in the coffee room aabout a quarter before nine, I took him his breakfast myself. After breakfast he went up stairs into his bedroom; he remained up stairs twenty minutes or half an hour; he came down again with his trunk and portmanteau; he came along the passage into the kitchen, and paid for his breakfast and went away, calling the porter to take his things; he gave the porter his trunk; he carried the portmanteau out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Soon after he was gone did you go up stairs. - A. I did not go up myself; the boy that is here went up and discovered the robbery. I went up in about an hour afterwards, in consequence of the boy telling me so.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up did you perceive that you yourself had lost any thing. - A. I lost every thing that I had, in fact, that was in the trunk, that was in a small bed room No. 39.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that on the same floor with the prisoner's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280028"/>room. - A.

               <p>Q. Was your trunk broke open. - A. It was not; I left it open, I never do lock it.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen these things safe. - A. An hour and a half from the time I came down stairs till I went up again; I got up about half past eight, and about nine o'clock he went up.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask him a question or two; I am confident that I am perfectly correct, although my life is forfeited - Is the witness certain that he lost four one pound notes. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am certain and positive that he never lost them by me; he says that I come and said my servant should bring some luggage to the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. No, he said you said the luggage should be brought.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I came in a hackney coach; the porter brought the luggage from the coach; I went away from the door in the same coach.</p>
               <p>Wharton. I never saw any coach at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He says he left his luggage there at the first time he called at the house, did the luggage come the first time he came. - A. I did not see it. I saw it in an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the chimney of the chamber after he was gone. - A. I did not; there were some bricks found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them found. - A. I saw them found. Mr. Holmes found them; I was in the room the moment afterwards.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I will take the liberty of addressing you, if you please; I am a man now forty six years of age, my life was forfeited yesterday upon a trial of this description; I have been twenty two years a housekeeper of respectability, I have a large family, and if the earl of Bedford was alive he could tell you who I am. Misfortunes has induced me to commit crimes which I shudder at; my family is large, they depended upon me for bread. When I was last in Ireland with lord Cornwallis I fought for my king and country, I was afterwards fired at twice, where Mr. Hemmit was detected and afterwards brought to justice; I have been a good and loyal subject. I have been in his Majesty's army, I have had two commissions; one I had about six years ago when I went to America, in consequence of my ability in military affairs. I am now situated in such a disgraceful way that never belonged to me nor any one belonging to me; the stain that I have thrown on my children is more to me than life; I throw myself on your lordship's mercy. I emplore mercy not for myself; I ask nothing for myself, but for the sake of my family; I have as good a wife as ever existed. The property that the officer took she purchased articles in her way, she is a mantua maker and she makes up millinery, and serves families: and I have been in the habit of purchasing such things, and when we have got a purchase that we could get something from; we have been under the necessity of pledging; the consequence was a number of duplicates was found. This is the first time in my life that I have been guilty of crimes, every thing that I had in the world has been put under the same situation, and it has been taken from me, and I have been deprived of it; I am deprived of my life; it is forfeited. My lord, I look to you for mercy. I earnestly entreat and emplore that mercy may be extended to a subject who has been true and loyal, and an honest man, who has paid his way honest for twenty two years.</p>

On the 29th of September, about eleven in the morning, the prisoner came to my shed, he enquired after my husband, he asked me where he worked, I told him in the Borough; he took a chair and sat down in the parlour; the parlour is behind the shed. I had occasion to go into the shed to serve a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been in the parlour before you went into the shed. - A. About half an hour. I shut the door of the parlour when I went to serve the customer; I staid about two or three minutes in the shed, then when I returned again into the parlour I met the prisoner coming out of the parlour door, he said, good morning Mrs. Stently, give my best respects to your husband, and he went out. About an hour after he was gone I went to wind up the watch; I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had that watch been. - A. It hung up by the side of the mantle piece in the parlour; I had seen it about half past ten; I asked the time of the day, the prisoner looked up at the watch and told me, as I was on the other side of the fire place.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he came in about eleven in the morning, he told you it was half past ten then he was there then. - A. Yes.</p>

I went to the George public house in Monmouth-street, I had seen the prisoner go in there, he was sitting in the tap-room drinking a pint of beer. I asked him for my husband's watch that he had stole, he denied having the watch, and got up and said he would go home with me; he came out with me but he would not come with me home; I asked a man going past to assist me, that occasioned a mob, and there were some people amongst them I knew; they assisted in taking him to Bow-street. Before we came to Bow-street he said Mrs. Sently, I want to speak to you, come into a public house, I will tell you; I said whatever you have got to say, say it now; then he told me he had stole the watch and pawned it for eighteen shillings; he would give me the ticket and the change to take it out. I would not take it; when we came to the top of Bow-street, we met the officer who took him in custody. On searching him at the

               <p>Q. What pawnbrokers did that ticket lead you to. - A. Mr. Hinckesman.</p>
               <p>Q. When he offered you the ticket did he offer you any money besides. - A. Eight shillings. Mr. Hinckesman produced the watch at the office. I know the watch, we had it a couple of years.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

In the next place I do not deny the crime; the prosecutrix is wrong in saying that I walked in and sat down; she asked me, I had no intention of doing it. I had been drinking a little the day before.</p>

            . What do you know of this transaction. - A. If you will give me leave, I will relate the circumstance as it was at this time. I am a carpenter; I was sent to No. 2, Duchess-street, next door to Mr. Magarth's, on Friday the 16th of the present month; I was putting up a bed furniture; not being used to work in that end of the town, it caused my eye several times to see casual carriages; the window was up, and I was looking at the window. A few minutes before twelve, I perceived the prisoner at the bar standing on Mr. Magarth's steps, together with a tall man very much of my own make, a slim made character. The door was opened, and the tall one entered; after he had entered I proceeded on with my work for a minute and a half or two minutes, then I heard a bustle at the next door and a woman's voice, the words she said were - you villain, you have stole the glass; the tall man came out of the house and made off; then I looked the second time out of the window; I then perceived the top of a glass; I saw the men come from the step of the door; the prisoner made his way towards Duke-street with this present glass. I saw the prisoner receiving it, I could not see both their two arms; the other man went to the right, the prisoner went to the left, and

               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person that you saw receive the glass from the house. - A. Yes; the window was so situated I saw the step of the door, and he received it; had he been off the step of the door I should have seen who gave it him. I am sure he is the man, and this is the glass.</p>

            . On the 9th of October a labouring man came to me, between the hours of eight and nine in the morning, and asked me if I had lost any wether sheep, he said if I would go with him, he would shew me the remains of several being killed; I went with him, and it appeared to be in one of my fields where I saw three sheep skins, three heads with the wool on; their plucks were on their heads, and all their entrails and the cauls.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing about the skins and the heads that you knew them to be yours. - A. Only the marks that were on the fellow skins, to these being the same, is all I know them by.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what is there that you know them by. - A. There were one hundred and thirty four in the whole and there is only one hundred and thirty one remaining.</p>
               <p>Q. It is only by the numbers you know them by. - A. It is by the marks on the skins, being the same as the others are, a reddle mark on the loins, with a round pitch mark across that, and another mark down the side; and that was the mark that was common to them in the one hundred and thirty one that remained. It was under an oak tree where they had been killed, in the same field, I suppose, where I found the remains of them. There, beside what I have mentioned, two sets of ribs of two of the sheep, they had the meat all off, except three of the ribs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the rest of them. - A. At Queen-square office on the next morning; the officer had them in his custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as to what you saw, you were clear that it was the remains of the sheep that were yours, and the marks of the skins tallied with these remaining, and what you saw at the office, and these you had seen in the field, made up three whole sheep. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told us before, they had been put in another field. - A. Yes, they were put before in the field on the other side, where I found they had been killed. There is a hedge and ditch parts the two fields.</p>
               <p>Q. They were left in one field and killed in another. A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. When did you see these men with the sheep. - A. On Thursday night the 8th of the present October, about half past eleven at night; I was going through Westminster with a billet of patrols on duty; I met the prisoner Brown first, Jessop was a little behind; when I saw Brown he had got this bag on his arm, that struck my suspicion; Jessop ran from the serjeant who was on patrol with me; he ran after Jessop. We conveyed them both to the watchhouse, there I searched them both. In Brown's pocket I found this knife, which had been recently used, there were grease and blood upon it, it appeared that they had been cut with this knife, there was meat sticking upon it. In this bag he had a shoulder of multon, with the ribs sticking to it; it had been tore away, and these three rib bones exactly fitted what the prosecutor brought up. In this knapsack there were three hind quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. You are still speaking of Brown, are you. - A. Yes; there were three hind quarters and two shoulders, and parts of the breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Without going through particulars with the parts produced by Watkins, and what was taken from the prisoners there were three whole sheep. - A. Exactly, excepting one foot.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I searched for it about three days afterwards. I found that foot in the pond.</p>
               <p>Gillmore. Upon Jessop I found this whetstone; they had each of them equal share of meat. We sent for Mr. Smith, a master betcher, he compared the meat; he is here.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (read.) My lord, and gentlemen of the jury. in the unfortunate situation we now stand before you, and the distress of our wives and children are great; and being unable to see counsel to prove our innocence, of the serious charge exhibited against us, we trust this, our defence, will be taken into consideration. On the 8th of October instant, as we were returning from Kennington, we got in conversation with a drover; he said he had three sheep that were quite exhausted with travelling, they would not go any further; he asked us thirty-six shillings each sheep; we purchased the three sheep for thirty six shillings each, being assured by him they were his own property. As we were going home at night, we were apprehended on the charge now against us. We humbly lay our case to your lordship, and the gentlemen of the jury. Our situation in life being low, though honourable; we both belong to the Coldstream guards; but in the private line of life, we are both married, and have children; which from our inability to support them at this time, are necessitated to suffer the severest hardships; we therefore bow to your lordship for mercy, and if we should find it contrary to our expectation, we trust we shall find mercy with justice.</p>

            . Q. What are you. - A. I live at Harefield, I am a farmer and wheelwright; the prisoner lived in our neighbourhood. On the 4th of October, about eleven o'clock at night the prisoner was going by my gate with a hive of bees tied up in a cloth I asked him what he had got, he would not speak. I said, I insisted of knowing, it was of no use for him to run away; then he threw the hive of bees down; I did not pursue him. I examined the hive of bees, they were not my property; Mr. Weedon came and looked at them and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner again that night. - A. No, not till Monday morning; then we waited till he came home; and then the constable and me, and two more men, took him. We found another hive upon the premises; after some discourse with him, he said he was brought into it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Barry. You said it would be the better for him to tell the truth - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. What became of the hive. - A. Mr. Weedon took it home; he has had it ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect being fetched by the last witness on the night of the 4th of October. - A. Yes, he shewed me a hive of bees that were mine. It corresponded in all its parts with mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. What is the character of the prisoner. - A. I never before knew nothing against him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             came in first, the other came in about five minutes afterwards; Burke asked me to let her look at some ribbons, I shewed her several; in the mean time Neale came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear as if they were acquainted. - A. No; Neale asked for some watch ribbons; a young man came in with her and stood rather behind her I took a watch ribbon out of the drawer and showed it her; she showed it to the young man that came in with her, he objected to it; they wished to see some more. I had no more of the same in the drawer, and Burke at the same time hurried me to shew her some more ribbons; I then suspected they came in with intention to steal. Burke did not make choice of any ribbon nor Neale, I therefore put the drawer back and took some watch ribbons that were tied up in the window for show and shewed them to Neale; they did not approve of them; they offered me less money than I chose to take.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Burke appear to meddle at all with the watch ribbon. - A. No, they both left the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Neale and Burke and the young man leave the shop at the same time. - A Nearly; I did not see when the young man went away. Neale and Burke went out close together.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after they left the shop did you perceive that you had lost any thing. - A. Directly almost. After they left the shop I missed the piece of ribbon I put into Neale's hand. Upon missing what I had showed to Neale, I rung a bell for a gentleman to come down; he went for a constable. I should have told you in the manner I stopped them, Burke came back for a basket she had left behind her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before you sent the gentleman for the constable. - A. Yes. Neale came in directly after almost.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Neale from Burke at the time she came in. - A. It did not appear to me that she was many yards. I never saw the young man any more.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Neale say. - A. She did not say any thing. When Burke came in for the basket I stopped her; Neale came in directly upon it. I told Neale that I had given a piece of ribbon into her hand, I had missed it, I should detain them both. They denied it; they said I might search them. Neale pulled off her coat, the constable came, he searched them. On Neale he found a piece of watch ribbon, which I had given into her hands. Upon Burke was found a roll of blue ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed it before that time. - A. No. I looked in the drawer; I knew I had such a piece; I found it gone. I had seen that piece of blue ribbon when the drawer was before her.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see Neale take this watch ribbon did you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the two rolls of ribbon. - A. I cannot say exactly unless they were measured, I think eight shillings.</p>

            . I am a constable of Clerkenwell. On Tuesday evening, about five o'clock, I was sent for to take charge of these two women; Mrs. Tanner said she had missed some ribbon, she thought the prisoners had got it.

               <p>Court. On that day. - A. I cannot say the day. I will state the circumstance why this must be the letter. I had been ordered to horse exercise; I took the letter to the post office with particular care. I perfectly remember looking at my book; I found that no other inventory was made by me within the time.</p>

               <p>Q. That is the argument; all that you know is that you put some letter in the post office. - A. Yes. I saw a man standing by, I remember throwing it some way in so as to be out of danger.</p>

The last thing that we do is to take the account of the paid letters, and to sign the account, which is the last thing we do; that makes me to say it was done, and they were made up in the usual manner on the 5th of August, and dispatched to the post office. I sealed it and delivered it to the messenger that comes from the post office.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the habit of taking out all the letters from the box and putting them in with your own hands. A. No, I have assistance to do that.</p>

Yes; I found there a piece of fine black cloth, a piece of worsted cord, and another kerseymere for breeches, and three pieces of quilting for waistcoats; I saw this or similar. I did not take them at that time. I afterwards took them away from his brother at a grocer's in Holborn, on the 15th. They have been in my possession ever since.

These printed quiltings are the patterns that I sold to the prisoner. I believe them to be the pieces, they correspond in pattern and size; the cord I cannot say. The first time he came to my shop he purchased a piece of drab woollen cord, that corresponds in size. but there are various colours in drab.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose an axe, a square, a box pin, and a brush - A. Yes, on the 25th of September; I lost them all at one time, out of a shed in Mr. Whitehead's fields; I had put them in the shed on the over night at a quarter after six; I went to my work; I missed them, I saw them about nine o'clock at Mr. Clarke's; the prisoner was in the watchhouse; I knew they were my tools.</p>

Then he said he would tell me the truth, and shew me the place where he took the things from, which he did.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Now attend to me; I suppose the boy that died was an acquaintance of yours, you had been often playing together. - A. No, only once before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. On this ground where you had been playing were there not a quantity of bricks piled up, which had been pulled out of the old buildings. - A. Yes, there were bricks piled up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the boys on that occasion, when this unfortunate accident happened, and on former occasions, pulled down these bricks. - A. No, they never touched these bricks.</p>

               <p>Q. The man at the bar had been put on the premises for the purpose of taking care of the property. - A. I did not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. He lived in a little house that was inclosed by a wall. - A. Yes; there were all bricks piled up about the house; there were two doors to this house.</p>

               <p>Q. Then when you come to the other door from which he fired the gun, would be upon his left hand. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After the brick bat was thrown, and before the gun was fired, did not the boys run about from one door of the house to another door. - A. No; as soon as he throwed the brick we ran a distance off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not some of these boys climb up these bricks and stones that were piled up at his house, and pelt his house with brick bats and stones, and threw them in at his windows. - A. No, there were none of the boys did that.</p>

When the prisoner throwed the brick bat the deceased run a little way and stopped to see where the brick came from, he saw the prisoner come out of his back door; he then run a little way, and then the prisoner fired.</p>

I immediately put my hand down by the back part of his head, I found a hole, I saw he was shot; I took his coat off, and found a hole in his neck, and a hole in his coat and waistcoat; then with assistance I took him home to his aunt's in Bell-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How old was this boy. - A. Between thirteen and fourteen, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it immediately after you heard the piece fire that you got out of the cart and fell over him. - A. Not directly; I waited two or three minutes after hearing the report.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that at the time you saw and heard the piece go off, and the time you fell over the deceased, that only one piece went off. - A. Yes. After I had taken the boy home, I went and shewed the people where the prisoner lived; I opened his private door, the front door, and he was washing his hands; and I shewed them his back door where he let off the piece. On seeing him washing his hands, I said this is the man that let off the piece, I knew him before; they said go and fetch an officer. In the mean time I was gone they took him in custody.</p>

               <p>Q. So light that you were able to distinguish a stone from a brick bat. - A. Yes; I picked up the brick bat afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet not light enough to distinguish whether it was a gun or a blunderbuss. - A. Because as soon as he pulled the trigger, he let it off and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it about that you fell over this boy, as it was so light - A. As I turned the corner I happened to slip over him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember when these old houses were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280041"/>pulling down in this yard. - A. No, I do not keep an almanack in my head.</p>
               <p>Q. I only ask you whether you remember their being pulled down; I will bring it to your memory most distinctly presently - do you remember the prisoner stopping you carrying away a joist, do not you know what a joist is. - A. No, I am no builder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man at the bar, against whom you said you had no ill will, did not he within ten days before this commenced, detect and stop you carrying away a piece of timber. - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. That is as true as all you have said; now in charity let me ask you, upon your oath, did not that man while these buildings were pulling down, stop you with a piece of timber on your back, which you had taken out of that house. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember at any time when Mr. White was attending with the prisoner at the bar, and another man, the prisoner having said to Mr. White you was the man that was stopped when you was carrying away the timber that was stole from the house. - A. I will tell you he was such a kind of a man, he would stop a man for carrying away a brick.</p>
               <p>Q. I will put the question again to you - did you not hear that man tell Mr. White, when another man was standing with him, that you was the man that on the Sunday previous had taken a piece of timber. - A. I did not hear him say any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in Strype's-yard with a child in your arms on the afternoon when this happened. - A. Yes; it was between five and six o'clock; I was two or three yards from Houghton's house; I saw Houghton come out of his own door with a gun in his hand; there was some boys playing at hoop among themselves; they were not doing any thing as I could see.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the deceased

            . - A. Only by sight; he was one of the boys that were playing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing with the gun. - A. He pointed it at the boys and directly let it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of the boys before that done any thing to him. - A. Not while I was there. I did not see the boy fall among so many; directly almost he had let the gun off, he went in doors; as he was going in doors he said these words to himself, d - n your eyes, you young rascals, I think I have shot some of them into you. I saw no more; I was there about two or three minutes before this accident happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the gun was fired. - A. Yes; I was almost fronting of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You say the first thing you observed was the man coming out and firing the gun - how near was he to his door when he fired. - A. About two or three yards from his own door.</p>
               <p>Q. Your expression now is that he pointed the gun at the boys. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said that the gun was not pointed to any one. - A. I never said any such thing, nor any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was it from the place where the man stood to where the boys stood, was it the distance from one end of this room to the other. - A. It might be about that length; the boys stood right front of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great quantity of bricks on this ground. - A. There were a great many, but they had not been touching them.</p>
               <p>Q. The pile of bricks were higher in some places than in others. - A. I cannot tell, they were very high.</p>
               <p>Q. If the boy was standing in the front of that man's house, must not the pile of bricks be direct between the man and the boy that was killed. - A. No; the man came past one pile of bricks; he stood at the side of the last pile. I was standing two or three yards from the door that he came out off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pass by you. - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280042"/>Q. Then he could not come further out than two or three yards from the door. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the boys were all quiet, and had not been doing any thing at the time of the firing. - A. They was not.</p>
               <p>Q. He came out in that wicked way and fired at them and they were doing nothing at all to him. - A. They did not at that time, I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not shortly before seen them throwing of bricks about. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. You had just come down, you saw the thing done and then went up stairs. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Had you ever been on that ground before. - A. Never but once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mistresses house is but a short way from the place. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You know where Mr. Joseph lives, who has been a witness. - A, Yes, I do; he lives in a building facing my mistress's house.</p>
               <p>Q. He comes to your mistresses' house now and then as he is a neighbour. - A. No, he never came up in our house.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been in company with Joseph since the boy has been killed. - A. I never was in company with him only in coming up with him and the rest of the witnesses to the magistrate, and to day.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been to Joseph's house. - A. I was never at the place where he lives.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never seen a man hanged, I hope. - A. I would not wish to see such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never said you would like to see the prisoner hanged. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care, and remember you are upon your oath, be cautious in the answers you give me - have you never said you should like to see the prisoner hanged. - A. No, I never have.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that induced you to ask Joseph what day the man would be hanged. - A. I did not say such a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Remember, Joseph has been examined, therefore attend to the question I ask you - whether you did not enquire of Joseph at what time the prisoner at the bar would be hanged. - A. No, sir, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember returning home with him from the coroner's inquest. - A. We all come home together from every place were we have been; I had no conversation with Joseph, I walked next to my master.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say one word to him coming from the coroners. - A. No sir; what should I trouble my head with the man, he did not trouble me.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not the curiosity to enquire of him what time the man would be hanged. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a servant, and in the same place now as you were then. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether your mistress has ever been asked whether she would give you a holiday. - A. She has never been asked.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell me that Joseph never told you he would ask your mistress to give you a holiday to see the prisoner at the bar hanged. - A. No, he never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have the opportunity now to be cautious, and to take care to speak nothing but the truth - then Joseph never said any thing of that sort to you. - A. He never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. White. - A. Yes, I have seen him on the premises.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you never said to Mr. White, that you would do all you could for the purpose of hanging the prisoner. - A. No sir; I never did.</p>

             - a crime above all others that is punished with immediate death - that punishment the laws of the country has inflicted upon all those that transgress them. I can assure you the death of the youth arose from accident; and were I guilty of the charge, I should tremble at this bar, and yield up my life as an atonement to his injured relatives; but conscious that I am not guilty of the charge, I will relate the following circumstances to you, in order that you may come to a proper conclusion on the subject upon which you are to pronounce your verdict. - I was brought up a carpenter. In 1804, 5, 6, I worked at the new brewery in Golden-lane, where I had the misfortune to fall from the premises and break my leg, and one leg being shorter than the other, I was unable to follow my business, and seven weeks before this melancholy accident happened, I was employed by the proprietors to superintend the works going on there. In consequence of several robberies having been committed on the premises, one of the proprietors gave me a musket, some powder, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280043"/>small shot, to repel any attempt that might be made to rob the premises; notwithstanding I was in the habit of firing the powder off every night, yet frequent robberies were committed on the premises, as will appear by Mr. White, who is one of the proprietors. On Saturday afternoon, and the whole of the Sunday, I was generally annoyed by boys and men, who were on these days employed in tossing up, and who when requested by me to desist from these proceedings, have assailed me with brick bats and stones. I have frequently fired over them with powder only. On Sunday the 7th of October, hearing a great noise in one of the houses, I went and desired these persons to depart; I was then under the necessity of running away; I threatened to fire at them, they said fire and be damned; and after having fired, the door was pelted with bricks and stones. On the afternoon the accident happened, several boys and men began to assemble in Strype's yard; they threw bricks one after another. I repeatedly requested them to desist; instead of desisting, they continued till they pulled down the lining of a large stack of bricks, by which a great many were scattered about. About half after five, two persons of the name of Bottle and Martin, who had contracted to take down, clean, and stack the bricks at a certain sum per thousand, when they had done work I discharged them, for which purpose I went into the house; I was occupied in washing my hands, when I heard a great noise in the yard; I went out immediately, I was assailed with stones and brick bats, when I begged them to desist. I went into the house and got the gun, and fired it off, thinking it was loaded with powder only, and when in the act of letting it off, standing on some bricks, I fell down. After the gun had been fired, my next step was to enquire for a peace officer, that the offending parties might be secured. - You will find by the evidence of a person who will be produced before you, that I went in company with him to the office in Worship-street for assistance. - I now have communicated to you the pure, simple, and unadorned truth, attending this melancholy event. - Permit me to ask you, from these facts, whether the crime of murder can be alledged against me. It is alledged that I knew the unfortunate youth - can it be said that I did it to obtain his property - certainly not; was there any other end that could be answered by his death - no, there was not. - I appeal to that God who gave us all life, whether the death that has happened has been occasioned by any wilful act of mine, or whether it has not arisen merely by accident. - Gentlemen, it may be asked, why do not I bring some person to prove what I have asserted, who were there present at the time; I will tell you - this happened at a time when all the workmen were gone from their work, and not an individual remained, unless those that were engaged more or less in the affray. I shall supply that defect by bringing forward a witness, who will prove what was the conduct of the persons then assembled, and when I was with them; I will produce witnesses that have known me many years, who will prove to you that I am not possessed of a vicious or a bad mind. You are now engaged to try a man for the murder of one whom, from his situation in life, he could never be benefited by his death, and who had no object in view in the destruction of a fellow creature - who has been instrumental in bringing one child into the world. - May that God that rules all your minds overrule mine, and if it be your verdict this day that I am doomed to suffer the awful sentence of the law - conscious of my own innocence, I shall resign my soul into the hands of that God who gave it, and though my body may be destroyed on earth, my soul shall arise triumphant in glory, and see the face of God, in whose presence there is fullness of joy, and at whose right hand there are pleasures for ever more.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of you and some others purchasing these premises, did you employ the prisoner to take care of these premises. - A. I recommended the prisoner, and he was so employed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you assigned him a house on the premises for his abode. - A. Yes, while he was in our service. And three or four days after he was put on the premises, he applied to me in consequence of some depredations that had been committed on the property; I furnished him with a gun, some powder, and shot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in point of fact know that depredations had been committed on the property. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The house that he inhabited, is there a wall in the front. - A. There is a yard, and a wall round it; there are two doors, one to the right, and the other to the left.</p>

            . - A. I have, On the Monday morning before the coroner's jury sat, I was on the premises in Strype's yard, near the pump, giving directions to the men to secure all the avenues leading into it, by a fence, and the evidence Terry was close to me where I was speaking to the men; she said she would hang the man; my reply to her was, you little puss, do you know any thing about this concern; she said it did not signify, he should be hung on that ground.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you the character of this man. - A. I have known him this three years, I have employed him in my own house for some time; I found him to be a sober, honest, and industrious young man; on that account I recommended him to this concern. The property that he was entrusted with was between two and three thousand pounds. He had applied to me for some assistance to protect him; I ordered him to engage a watchman, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told me that the property had been considerably plundered. - A. I am clearly convinced of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280044"/>that, because I know the articles that were plundered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I observed you said there was a clamp of bricks at some distance from the door. - A. Yes, towards Bell-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. They are of different heights all along the clamp, one of six foot, another of four, and another of two foot, just by the door. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What height - was it three yards from the door towards the pump. - A. It may be four foot, running down to one.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you were to take three yards on the side of the door, and then towards the pump, was it not less than four feet there. - A. Most assuredly, it was as low as one foot at the end of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us of some expression used by the girl Terry - had you any conversation with her previous to the expression that she made use of. - A. She spoke to me before I opened my lips to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend before the magistrate. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to mention these expressions before the magistrate, - A. I did not, because the magistrate said I had no right to say any thing without the prisoner was there.</p>

               <p>Q. I observe you said you employed this person, and you gave this person directions to fire with powder at night - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give him any directions to fire with shot. - A. Not without he was beset at night; I told him to protect himself, not when I gave him the gun, but in a week afterwards I did, and so did sir

One of the women came up to me and took the money out of my breeches pocket; as soon as she took it she gave it to the other; it was dark; I cannot say which of the women took it.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have prevented the woman from taking it out of your pocket. - A. No, not at first I could not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you retire to any place with her. - A. No; this took place within the court.</p>
               <p>Q. When she said are you good natured, will you give me some gin; did you try to rush by her. - A. No.</p>

No. The women called out, one was standing up and the other was sitting, they gave me charge of him for knocking them down; then he gave me charge of them for picking his pocket.

             pledged a black silk handkerchief on the 28th of September; I am sure she is the woman, I took in the article myself; she sold two other handkerchiefs at our shop on the same day. There were two waistcoat pieces of toilenett pledged at our shop, I do not know who they were pawned by, I did not take them in.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took up Cooper at the corner of Maiden-lane, were he was painting a room, on the 7th of October; he told me his name and residence. I searched him, I found nothing; I went to his lodgings. No. 3, Stuart's rents, in the back parlour; I searched the woman, they pass as man and wife; I said to the woman I suppose you are not married; no, she said she was not. I found this duplicate in her pocket of a black silk handkerchief, pawned on the 6th of October, for two shillings by Williams, I believe; there are four duplicates of one silk handkerchief, that had been pledged and redeemed. I told Mr. Hinkesman to bring the things forward, and the next time they brought these things forward to the prosecutor, Cooper was present. When I found this duplicate, the woman said first of all that she bought this ticket of the handkerchief of a sailor, he took a fancy to a yellow silk handkerchief and she changed it for a black one.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bates. Is that the duplicate that you gave her for the black silk handkerchiefs. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to buy these things. - A. The silver the prisoner Cooper offered to sell in our shop; Mrs. Hinckesman was in the shop at the same time, about three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Cooper brought the silver breast plate and offered it for sale in your shop, how much was given for it. - A. Three shillings; it was doubled up so that we could not distinguish what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was doubled up or not, you could tell by the weight that it was a great deal more. - A. The shop was being repaired; the things were put of one side; the scales were not handy.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner was the man who brought it, and to whom the money was paid. - A I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Hinckesman here. - A. No, it was not Mr. Hinckesman that bought them, but Mrs. Hinckesman; she offered three shillings for the silver as he was going out of the shop; he returned, and it was bought for three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not he order the person here that bought them. - A. He was not ordered by the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever see me bring a thing of this kind. - A. Yes, the silver was brought by you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There is every thing that is possible that that person is saying is quite false. I deny that the breast plate ever came from Mr. Pulsford.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of that breast plate. - A. I am charged thirty five shillings for it, with the engraving the silver thirty shillings; the silk handkerchiefs cost me three shillings and six pence each by the dozen.</p>
               <p>Cooper's Defence. I never took any act or part in taking of any thing away during the time I was at work at Mr. Pulsford's house.</p>
               <p>Williams was not put upon her defence.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the value of the six gowns. - A. I cannot say, I think two pounds; the petticoats are worth four shillings, the shifts three shillings, a pair of stockings a shilling, the habit shirt and the half shawl are worth sixpence each; I saw two gowns and a bed gown the same night.</p>

I know the prisoners are the two persons that came to pawn the gown on the 27th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening; they both came and brought this gown; I lent them seven shillings on it, it was Riley that gave me the gown; I gave her the seven shillings; I perceived the gown was too wide for her, I asked her whose gown it was, she said it was her sister's, and she had sent her with it. The young woman came to enquire, and left a pattern; when I came home I found the gown. Going along Drury-lane I saw Townshend, I acquainted him with it; they were apprehended the next day, and I appeared against them at Bow-street. I produce the gown.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Hinckesman, Broad-street, St. Giles's: on the 27th of October, about seven o'clock, the prisoner pledged a bed gown at our shop, I gave nine pence for it. When the prisoner came again to our shop, I told Mr. Hinckesman the circumstance as Townsend the officer had been to our shop. Mr. Hinckesman stopped them, and I went for an officer. They had pledged the shawl with us for sixpence.</p>
               <p>- PICKERING. I am a patrol of Bow-street; I was fetched by the last witness; I took the prisoner in custody at Mr. Hinckesman's shop and searched them. I found the duplicate of a half shawl upon Chapman. I asked them what they had done with the things; they said they knew nothing about it.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you sober. - A. I was sober enough. I was fatigued, I come from Leeds, I had no sleep for four nights.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave your friend. - A. The house was shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you set off from Hermitage to see your friend. - A. In the afternoon, about seven or eight o'clock, I am quite lame; I had been in two public houses.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Drury-lane does your friend live in. A. The Marquis of Granby, his name is Mr. Welch; the house was shut up; I did not call, as the house was shut up; I called there the next morning after this woman took the money away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night did you call to see whether your friend was there. - A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loiter all that time, from seven o'clock till half after eleven, till you got to Drury-lane. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I should not suppose you were sober. - A I was sober enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep your money and your pocket book. - A. In an inside jacket pocket. I met the woman between eleven and twelve o'clock in Drury-lane; I am sure this is the woman that I met, she cannot deny it; I asked her where I could get a bed, I said I was tired; she said she would get me a good bed; she took me to 35, Dyot-street; I counted my money before her, and I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock, in this room she took me to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other woman with her. - A. Yes; she went down stairs, and left me and the prisoner in the room all night, I counted my money after the other woman went down stairs; I awoke between four and five in the morning; the prisoner had absconded.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given her any money before you went to bed. - A. I gave her four shillings, and eighteen pence I paid for the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put the pocket book after you had counted your money. - A. In my inside jacket pocket<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280048"/>and I put that under my pillow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your jacket gone as well as your pocket book. - A. I found all my clothes safe; I lost all the pocket book, the ring, the money and the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that you were sober enough to say you had the money at 35, in Dyot-street. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never got any of your money or your notes. - A No.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a great deal of money for a poor man like you to have; how long had you had it. - A. This money was wages that I had from a ship at Peru; about nine weeks back I received fifty pounds, and this was the remainder of it. I had Scotch notes; I changed them for bank notes at Edinburgh.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met this man in Drury-lane, he was very much intoxicated in liquor; he asked me to go into a public house to take something to drink; being a cold night I accepted, and the young woman together; we went to this room, he wanted two of us to sleep in the bed with him; I thought it an imprudent thing; I left him; the door having no lock or bolt on. I went to Charles-street Drury-lane, where I lived. I never saw a farthing of his money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses to her character, who said at a prior time she bore a good character, but had known little or nothing of her lately.</p>

On the 18th of September last, on returning home between eleven and twelve o'clock, from information I went up stairs, I missed my two regimental jackets. The prisoner lodged in my house in a back room, and the room adjoining his, had been broken, the staple of the padlock was drawn. I went in pursuit of the prisoner, I found him within an hour and a half; when I took him home, he gave me this duplicate of a blue jacket; he said he had sold the red jacket for one shilling, to a man at Blackwall. The officer took the wings of my jacket from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this man. - A. He is a seafaring man; I received four pound of him, and I have a receipt that I paid it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can the prisoner speak English. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I ask you whether there were any other lodger in the house. - A. I had none other.</p>

               <p>Q. That does not make a pied bald mare. - A. It was not a pied bald mare; that was the marks of her. I killed her; she was only fit for dogs meat; she was lame of the near leg behind. Mr. Sims enquired if I had any such mare; I told him I had; here is the tail, it is mixed black and white. I have seen many horses tails like it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280049"/>is a swish tail.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not a long tail. - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. You never saw your mare afterwards. - A. No, only the tail.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burrows. I wanted Mr. Sims to go to the tanner's to look at the hide; he would not, he said the tail was sufficient.</p>
               <p>Court. I think he would have been a much better judge by the hide. - A. I told him so then.</p>

            . On the 13th of August the prisoner came to see me, she had been down to Chesnut to see her children in the poor house; I went up stairs, and when I came down the prisoner and the watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the watch. - A. It hung upon a nail in the shop. About five weeks after that she came and confessed it; she said if I would come with her she would give me the watch again. I found the watch at Mr. Hogg's in Kingsland Road.</p>
               <p>- MILLER. I am a chimney sweeper. When I was at Mr. Hogg's, a person came in and said that there was a person in distress for ten shillings, to relieve a person out of prison; I gave ten shillings for the ticket, as it was to get a person out of prison. The watch was in pledge at Islington.</p>
               <p>MR. HOGG. The prisoner came to my house and asked if I would buy a watch; she said it was for a person in distress. Mr. Miller bought the watch for nine shillings; he shoved the watch ticket across the table; I gave him a shilling for it. The prosecutrix told me she did not mean to hurt the prisoner, if she could get the watch. I got the watch and sent her word.</p>

               <p>Q. How was Mr. Dawkins' health about October last. - A. He had been confined to his room from the latter end of September. In the beginning of October Feltham managed his business.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing that you informed your master, were you directed to apply to his attorney Mr. Fielder. - A. I went with Mr. Fielder to get a warrant from Marlborough-street; I searched the prisoner Shipman's apartment, No. 13, Carrington-street, Shepherd's market. We made search in a cellar in front of the street, the officer found six candle boxes; these three boxes had my master's name, J. Dawkins, burnt in them, No. 2, 4, and 5; they had store and mould candles. We found a box, with two pair of boots and a pair of shoes, with my master's name in them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Curwood. Had you at any time seen these boxes and these boots and shoes in your master's possession. - A. I had; I missed them boxes from the store room; I informed my master of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Does not every tallow chandler send out his candles in boxes with the name burnt on it. - A. He does, every box has my master's name on it, but I described them boxes as having seen them in my master's possession shortly before.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you live then. - A. In Margaret-street, Hackney-fields. On Sunday the 27th of September, about seven in the morning as I was taking the shutters down, I saw Mr. Green looking out of his window, he desired me to stop the man with the bag; I ran down the street after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner running. - A. No, he was then walking. When I had gone some way down the street, whether he saw me I do not know, but when I got within ten or a dozen yards of him, he set off running and turned a corner; when I came in sight of him he stood by a ditch full of water, I saw the corner of a bag a little way out of the water, I laid hold of it and pulled it out; then the prisoner ran away, I ran after him, caught him, and gave him up to Mr. Green. I then took the bag from the side of the ditch and carried the harness to the door, and there left it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. I understood you to say when you came up to him, he had nothing in his possession belonging to the prosecutor. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You called after him, he is deaf; you did not expect a deaf man to hear. - A. So, I since understand.</p>

On Sunday morning I was going to see my brother, he belonged to the Tower hamlets; I crossed Hackney road to this street that leads to the Shoulder of Mutton and Cat fields; that gentleman says he called out to me, I turned round, I thought he was calling to somebody else; I crossed over a ditch; that gentleman followed me, he said, halloo my friend, you have got something that does not belong to you. I had a small basket on my shoulder with a bunch of grapes in it; I never had a bag, nor had I any harness.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am a gardener. On Sunday the 27th of September, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was going out of my own ground, across Bow-lane; I saw a labourer take a hod of bricks from Mr. Lee's building, I watched to see where he took these bricks to; presently after I saw a wheelbarrow loaded with bricks, so hard the labourer could hardly wheel it; when he came to a bank the prisoner laid hold it, and he and the other man got it over; they took them to the same place were they took the hod to, into Bow-lane; the prisoner was building a chimney there.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Could you swear to the loss of the bricks. - A. I have missed a heavy load of bricks and mortar.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280051"/>Prisoner's Defence. I had been at work at Mr. Lee's building; I was a plaisterer in Mile End-road. As I was coming across I fell in with Mr. Lee, he said you are the man I was looking for, he says do you want a building job; I said yes. I worked half a day for Mr. Lee on the Saturday, he gave me half a crown at the public house. The next Saturday when I went to the pay table, the foreman came out and said my master could not pay me; I told him I had a job to do for a poor man that kept a cook's shop, and I meaned to get up early and get the job done; I said I have no money to buy stuff, I will take some stuff and settle for it with Mr. Lee. On Monday morning, when they came down to me, I was talking to a young woman; I said to them I shall go and settle with Mr. Lee for the stuff I had taken, and the remainder he might pay me the next Saturday night; I said to Mr. Lee, you owe me money and I will pay for the stuff.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Part of his story is all very well; I agreed with him to build these two houses for me. I found after he had been to work two days, he had done about fifteen shillings worth of work; we were obliged to take it down; I discharged him, I told him he would not suit me; I never gave him, nor any man leave to take any stuff.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose these handkerchiefs. - A. On the 6th of October. I heard an outcry of Stop thief, I ran across the field that adjoins the garden; as soon as I got over the hedge I saw him in a garden adjoining my garden; I got up to him and collared him, I brought him back; he dropped the property before I got up to him, finding he was so closely pursued; I did not see him drop them, he dropped them before he got over the hedge. These are the handkerchiefs (producing them), two silk handkerchiefs and six cotton ones; they were not quite dry, they were hanging in the garden to dry. He said he was very sorry, he knew he had done wrong.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. He told you he had done wrong - so he had, he had no right to walk across this garden. - A. No, he wished to make it up with me, but the constable would not.</p>

When he came out I asked him again what it was, he said it was brandy with laudanum; I said I know it is not, I had seen what it was, it is cherries with brandy in it; he then said he had it of a young woman in the shop, he gave her a shilling for it; I asked him why he did not have it of his master, he had a deal more than the value he gave for it; he said he did not know the value, I told him he had better take it back again, he said he would; I left him and went to another place. I asked him on the Saturday if he had brought it home, he said yes, he had given it to the young woman.

            . In consequence of suspicion I went to Marlborough-street, I got an officer, and the officer searched him and found a watch upon him. From that we thought he was the person that had got the spoons that we missed in August.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the spoons. - A. He owned to the officer that he took the spoons; we found the spoons at Mr. Harrison's, a pawnbroker. The officer said, have you got the spoons, he replied no; he said you had better own to it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I cannot hear what he said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. When did the prisoner come into your service. - A. July the 3d.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost it in August. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a girl lived with you at that time. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you suspect her. - A. I never suspected any one; she went away near upon the begining of August.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, journeyman to Mr. Harrison, No. 5, Tottenham Court road. On the 17th of August the prisoner came to our shop, he asked us if we bought old silver; I said we did; I weighed the spoons, and they weighed four ounces; I gave five and six pence an ounce. One pound two I gave for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the spoons that you received from the prisoner. - A. Yes, I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Have you always said that. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said before that a girl bought them. - A. Yes, it was all through the foreman; at the time I bought them he was present.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is, whether you have not said before, that the woman brought them. - A. I said so at Hickes's hall, before the grand jury; never being there before, it was fright and flurry.</p>
               <p>Q. So fright and flurry made you charge another person with pawning it - which is the truth. - A. The prisoner brought it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280053"/>Court. How was the transaction. - A. The prisoner came in our shop and sold the spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body with him. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you before to say that they were brought by a girl, was it upon your oath. - A. Yes. When the officer came to our shop, he said I have come about two spoons that have been stolen; I took him down in our kitchen, I spoke to our foreman, he said I do recollect buying two spoons of a woman; that made me say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it you bought them of. - A. The prisoner at the bar. I cannot say whether there was any body with him or not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called no witnesses to character.</p>

            . On Friday the 23rd of October, between the hours of five and six, I discovered from our back room window (our house is No. 17,) three men in a lurking disposition, as I thought' in the field; they were below our house considerably, I very soon lost sight of them. I then went into our garden and raised myself above our fence; I then discovered that they had changed their position, and had gone immediately under a garden wall, where there were clothes hanging; I went into the house and asked for a stick; I then went into a neighbours below our house; I enquired if there were any gentlemen in the house, the servant told me there were several; I begged her to inform one of them I wanted to speak to him; when he came, I told him there were several ill disposed persons in the field. We went to the field where I had seen these men; looking up the hill, the field goes with an ascent all the way, we discovered objects moving, as I come up to Mr. Rowe's; I there saw one man on the terrace of the garden throwing clothes over the wall; I saw another man on the right take these clothes, and at the same instant I came up, there was a man that I had not observed till then, he was within a yard of me, and seeing the situation that my friend was in, at that time, I formed a resolution of securing him; I therefore gave him two violent blows on the head or neck; thinking that he was stunned, I mentioned to my friend to take him in charge, while I pursued the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he one of the men in company with the others. - A. I have do doubt of it, he was close under the wall; the man that sprang from the wall took a left hand direction, the other took a right; I followed him till he dropped the bundle, and soon after that I gave the pursuit up; we brought up the clothes; this man was very quiet. I believe he was sufficiently stunned. I took him as an accomplice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask why he was taken. - A. No, he said he knew nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you overtook and knocked him down, was he under the wall of this place. - A. I do not believe he was a yard from the summer house; he was immediately under the wall from where the linen was thrown out.</p>
               <p>Q. You at first saw three, and he was one of them when the other made his escape from the wall. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not possessed himself of any article of this linen had he. - A. He had not.</p>
               <p>MR. HALL. Were you desired by Mr. Abbot to assist in taking some suspicious people. - A. I was; when we got into the field, I thought we observed something; we went to Mr. Row's, a few yards before we came to the prisoner; I observed the man get over the wall, with something under his arm.</p>

               <p>Q. How near was the man that was getting over the wall to the prisoner. - A. Not more than three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280055"/>yards, if so much as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give any alarm at that time. - A. None in the least. I found the linen close down by him that Mr. Abbot pursued.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any linen throwed over the wall. A. The man that got over the wall had linen between the prisoner and the man that run away, whom Mr. Abbot pursued; I secured the prisoner, he said he only came there to ease himself, he did not know any thing of the man that was not secured. I picked up the linen.</p>
               <p>Q. It was getting dusk at this time, was it not. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person near him. - A. Not as I saw.</p>
               <p>- PECKHALL. I am a constable. This man and the linen were delivered into my charge on the 23d of October, between five and six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was delivered over into your hands, did he say any thing about it. - A. He said that he knew nothing of the two men that were with him.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was out of work three weeks; I used to work at Mr. Smith's, Battle Bridge, I went to see if I could get work again about there. When it was dusk I went into the field to ease myself, and before I stooped the things were thrown over a little distance from me. I stood on my feet and looked at them for the space of a minute, and just as these two gentlemen were coming up, the two men that were over the wall got over back again and ran away; one of them struck me and called me a d - d villain. I asked him what it was for, he said he would tell me.</p>

I told her I did not mean to keep her in the house, and for her to give up those things that she had in her care, and let me see that it was all right. She paused for a moment, she said she hoped I would not be angry with her, she had made away with some of my things; I asked her what she had done that for, as she wanted for nothing in my house, and I had let her have twenty shillings advance in wages; she had only been with me five weeks and a few days. She said that she had pledged them at Mr. Collins's and Messrs. Lea and Barnet. Mr. Blackman the officer searched her and found six duplicates on her; we went to the shop of Lea and Barnet and Mr. Collins; I saw the things produced, they are my own.</p>

            . I am a constable at Hatton Garden. On the 21st of September this boy was brought to Hatton Garden office; after having his hearing he confessed that he stole the watch and pawned it in the Strand, and he gave the duplicate to a jew boy; I went with him and he shewed me the shop, Mr. Essex in the Strand. When I came there the watch had been taken out two days; he then shewed me where the jew boy lived; I took the jew boy in custody; he had pawned the watch at another shop in the Borough.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose seven yards of linen, and the other articles mentioned in the indictment. - A. Yes; they were missed on the 30th of September; the linen was missed first; there were thirteen yards missed, seven yards I found upon the prisoner; the others were found, in consequence of her being taken up on the 10th of October; the prisoner had chaired for me for several months. When I first missed this, my suspicion tell on the the prisoner. On the 30th of September the prisoner was in the house; I thought there was something about her, that shewed guilt. On the Saturday following she sent word that she was ill and could not come to work; between that and the next Saturday my servant went into the back place and discovered a pair of breeches concealed between two casks; I ordered her to put them there again. On the Friday I sent to the prisoner to know if she could come to work on the Saturday; on the Saturday evening, about the time of her going away, the apprentice was put down in the kitchen, and was desired to dissemble as if he was asleep, while I and the man was in the parlour; the boy immediately upon her quitting my house, went into the kitchen to see if the breeches were gone, they were gone; he informed me; I sent my foreman after her, she came back; I was sitting in my parlour, she asked me if I wanted her; I at that same moment saw her throw something on the stairs, out of her hand; I asked her what she had throwed on the stairs, she said it was only her dirty apron; I looked at it, and shook this pair of breeches out of it; she said she did not know they were breeches, she thought it some dirty rag, she had swept up in the kitchen; I asked her where the linen was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her it would be better for her to tell where the linen was. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must not tell what she said. - A. She was then taken by the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. This linen was taken at a different time from the breeches. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Confine yourself to those pair of breeches, do you know them to be yours. - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. On the day this woman was taken up, did you see these breeches that have been produced; where was they before this woman came into the house. - A. They were between two barrels, against the wall, I had seen them there in the middle of the week, that she was taken on the Saturday. After she left the house, I went to the casks and found they were gone; I told my master of it; he had her brought back; I saw her drop them from her apron; I picked them up.</p>

I sent for an officer, and I produced this linen before him; I said John, do you recollect this, he went down upon his knees and begged my pardon; he said his mother had given him an order to lay by a remnant or two; I had frequently observed him bulky, which led me to suspect he was not the lad he ought to be.

               <p>Q. Did you lose a duck at any time. - A Yes. On the 28th of October our poultry was laying on the window, and the window up; about two o'clock the prisoner came in for a quarter of a pound of butter; another woman came up to the window and asked the price of the duck, I told her half a crown, she said it was too dear; I kept looking at the window, I rather mistrusted the other woman, I did not mistrust the prisoner; I walked out and missed the duck from where I had seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the other woman gone before you missed the duck. - A. It was all within two minutes; I pursued the prisoner, she said she had not got a duck of mine, I said she had; I took hold of her apron and she had the duck in her apron; she then said the other woman gave it her.</p>
               <p>- BLIGH. I took this woman in custody; the duck was delivered to me; I asked the prisoner how she came by it, she said the other woman gave it her to put into her lap; she appeared to be very much in liquor at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gave her the duck, and I went down upon my knees; I begged her a thousand pardons; I told her the other woman gave it to me. I did not know but the woman had paid for it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

             went up the yard, and was speaking to one of the lodgers; a little while after that I went and put my hand upon the shoulder of Mills, and I immediately felt the shot all about my face and breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the report of any thing at the time that you felt the shot - A. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner. - A. Yes; and I knew his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before you felt the shot. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were stunned by this. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fall down. - A. I do not know, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. After your recovery did you see the prisoner. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to state whether Mills received any injury or not. - A. Yes, he was shot in the eye.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Where you with

             the whole of the day. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of you had been firing at the sparrows in the walnut tree. - A. Mills fired once at the sparrows in the walnut tree, in the yard of the prisoner's house; it was at the back of the prisoner's window, about thirty or forty feet from it. I have a shot in my pocket which I took out of my head with a comb; here is the hat I had on at the time (produced the hat).</p>
               <p>Court to jury. You see there are some shot holes in the front.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did this happen. - A. Between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you received the shot was it that you had been firing in the yard. - A. He shot the sparrows about one or two o'clock.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH GIBSON. - Mr. Knapp. You live at Poplar. - A. Yes, in the adjoining room to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house was it that the prisoner shot out of, as it is supposed. - A. Out of the one pair of stairs, and I live in the one pair of stairs, the rooms join, there is only lath and plaster between them; they both look into this yard, and they are both on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you looking out of the window in the course of that afternoon. - A. Yes, just at the moment of time Mills and Ive were shot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the bar before you heard any thing. - A. I never saw him; I had not been to the window five minutes before I saw Mills and Ive standing with their backs to the privy, and their faces towards my window, in their own yard, talking to a woman in a room immediately over me in the same house; I did not hear what they said; I heard the report of a gun, and the smoke came out of a window adjoining mine. I saw the boys drop their heads.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean that you saw the smoke come out of the room that the prisoner inhabited. - A. Yes, apparently so; it exactly came in that direction. I could not see the prisoner, nor the window of that house, for the projection of the house that I live in,</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You saw the boys drop their heads immediately upon the report of the gun. - A. Yes; and in the course of a minute, when they held up their heads, I saw their faces covered with blood, and I heard them cry out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they drop or fall with it. - A. I cannot exactly say, they were in their master's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard the prisoner say any thing to the boys, or the boys to the prisoner. - A. I heard the prisoner swearing in his own apartment; it was a man's voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you particularly familiar with the prisoner's voice, so as to say it was his voice. - A. Yes, I have heard him swearing several nights, and cursing several nights since I have been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this man much before. - A. No, I am a total stranger to him; I have not been long in the place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. How near does that walnut tree grow to the prisoner's window. - A. It was pretty nigh the privy where the boys were; the branches overshadow the privy, it is twenty feet off the prisoner's window.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the boys directing any discourse to the prisoner. - A. No, they were merely in conversation with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280060"/>the woman above me. Some minutes after the accident I heard the prisoner say he would blow their brains out, but who he said so of I do not know.</p>

On the day this accident happened, I saw Mills and Ives in Mr. Rice's yard; hearing a swearing caused me to look out at the window; I could not see the prisoner's window.

            . Q. What are you. - A. I am a waterman and lighterman. On the day this accident happened coming along I saw a number of people around this butcher's shop, I asked what had happened: they said two boys had been shot by the man next door; in consequence of that I went into the house where the prisoner lived. There was a door in the passage at the bottom of the stairs, that was fastened; I broke it open; I called out before I broke it open; there was no answer given. After I broke it open I went up stairs, I found the door of the prisoner's room was locked, I desired it to be opened, it was by the prisoner's wife. I then saw the prisoner standing by the bed side, he had a flannel waistcoat in his hand, and only a coat and waistcoat on; I asked him how he came to be guilty of such a rash action as to shoot the two boys; he blasted and swore at me, and asked me what authority I had to come there and take him; I told him that did not signify, he must go along with me; he said he would if I would let him put his clothes on. In fact I put his clothes on. A young man came in after me; he handed the gun over the bed to me, calling me by name, he said here is the gun that he shot him with, I suppose; the prisoner said, damn you, that is the gun, and he would shoot them again, or any one belonging to them. He wanted the gun from me, saying it was his property; he said frequently to the same purpose, that he would shoot them again, he did not care for any judge or justice; I believe he was very much in liquor. I took him before the magistrate, and here is the gun; it was quite damp with the sulphur, at the time I put the ramrod in the inside; it came out quite foul.</p>
               <p>Q. You were accidently passing at this time. - A. Yes, I do not know that ever I saw him before this time.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FLETCHER. - Mr. Knapp. You are an assistant to Mr. Smith, a surgeon. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you called to the assistance of these boys that had received this injury. - A. Yes, the boys appeared to be very much wounded about the head and face, with a number of small shot; Ives had one of his teeth broken; Mills had received a shot in the center of the right eye, which has deprived him of the sight entirely, it never can be restored; there was one or two in the neck, and one in the breast of Ives. Mills is in danger now, in consequence of the wound; there is an abscess in the back part of the eye.</p>

He had an accident in the year seventy-seven, a second accident; I was present at this accident. I will relate how it happened. In order to drive an old cog out of a wheel, some come out at one blow, and sometimes they require three or four; the cog flies fast when it is drove out, and it met Rigby upon his head; it was a severe blow, we thought he was killed.</p>
               <p>Q. After that time did he appear to you that he was hurt in his intellects. - A. Yes, he fell short in his intellects within a twelve month after that, so far as disabled him from going through his business as he used to do, he was not so sharp as he used to be; before this any difficult job, he was the man that was picked out to do it. After this accident he was able to do a easy job, but not a difficult one.</p>

Yes, I live at Poplar, within a door or two of the prisoner; I have known him twelve or fourteen years; I always took him to be deranged and insane, not like another man; he is more so at some times than at other times. I have seen him outrageous when he has been at his own house, and swearing and tearing and going on in an irregular way, to what a man ought to in his senses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Was he a sober man - A. Sometimes he was sober and sometimes not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have described him as raving and swearing when he was outrageous, was that when he was sober. - A. I took upon it that happened when he was in liquor; I never saw him in his house. I did not know he was in possession of a gun.</p>
               <p>Court. What part of the house have you seen him outrageous. - A. In the one pair of stairs. I could see him from my garden; he has been swearing at the window as if at somebody in the yard when there was nobody in the yard; it occurred very often years past down to the present time; he was directing all these oaths to a creature of his own imagination.</p>

I have seen him when sober take up a tea kettle and knock his wife down without any provocation; he has talked all night when a-bed, he has come up into the garret when I have been a-bed; I have been so frightened at him, I have gone out of doors from him; he is worse when he gets a little liquor, he is so when he is sober and he is so when he is drunk. I have seen the gun hang up in his room; I am frequent in the habit of seeing him, and it has remained so on him down to the present time.</p>

            . You are the wife of the last witness - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband being out at work you saw more of the prisoner than he did. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From all you saw of his conduct, did you think him to be a man in his senses. - A. I always took him to be a man ramping mad. Early in the morning when my husband has gone out to work, I have been obliged to get out of my bed and fasten the door for fear of his coming into the room, not that he ever hurt me. I have seen him beat his wife without any quarrel at all; I have taken her away When he has been by himself he has been ramping and making a noise, I have thought there had been plenty of people with him when there has been no one; I thought him a deranged man; for that reason I kept my door fastened.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEWIS. Q. I believe you are a mill wright. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner come to you sometimes. - A. Yes, twice, when he had no business with us; he would set down upon the frame I was working upon, he would run on what he did when a boy, he would sit about ten minutes; we took no notice of him; then he would go away; he talked like a man out of his senses.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately was that - A. About a year ago.</p>
               <p>NORRIS SULLIVAN. I believe you are the landlord of the house the prisoner lived in. - A. Yes, he has lived there nigh twenty four years; I never thought him a in his senses from a little while after he come into the house. I never liked him to come in the shop when I was shaving; if he was at all contradicted he was like a man up set. I have been obliged to go out of the house many times when I have contradicted him; he has got a long staff and pursued me.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you observed this strange conduct increase of late years, or has it been much so the whole time. - A. More so lately than it was before.</p>
               <p>MR. TUCKER. I believe you are the prisoner's son-in-law. - A. I am, I have known him thirty years; he has conducted himself in every respect like a man out of his mind. I recollect a circumstance, I believe it to be twenty five or twenty six years ago, I lived three or four doors from Mr. Rigby at that time, I saw the prisoner coming down the lane with a stove and a fire in the grate, he threw it all in the ditch; I have lived in the house with him fourteen months, and during the time I have been with him he has been sitting by the fire in the arm chair, I have seen him snatch the kettle off the fire, take hold of the tea things and chuck the first thing he could take up at any body; and when he is in liquor he is generally full of talk. When I have thought him most in his senses, I have begged him not to come near me.</p>
               <p>Q. Your reason for that was you were afraid of his insanity. - A. Entirely. When you converse with him a little time he is quite up and out of his senses.</p>
               <p>NOT GUILTY.</p>

I only came out of the public house, he called and spoke to me, and when I went in my own house, I found he had robbed me of my watch; I had my watch when I was at the public house I was tipsey.</p>

After I got in doors I missed my watch; I went out of doors in about two or three minutes to try to overtake the man; I found the outside case where we were standing; the outside case was loose. Before the next morning I sent to the prisoner to ask him if he knew any thing about my watch; he said he would go the next Sunday and swear to the clergyman that he knew nothing about my watch, but he did not go.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your watch again. - A. Yes, I saw it at the pawnbrokers, a great while after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know your watch again when you saw it. - A. Yes, if I do not know that watch among a hundred watches, I will take all the blame to myself and stand in his shoes. I sold the outside case.</p>

I knew that he kept his purse in his pantaloons; the purse was gone; then I challenged the nurse, the house-maid, and the prisoner they all denied it; I sent for an officer; when the prisoner saw the officer at the door, he pulled the purse out of his pocket, the prisoner said here it is, and I shall take care of it; he said the captain owed him two pound for his sister's washing, he would take it to pay his sister.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. I believe there where other people to whom the captain owed money. - A. Yes, he owes me a good deal of money myself; he had been at my house upwards of six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Kelly of Jermyn-street. - A. I have heard of captain Fitzmorris going there sometimes; Mr. Kelly sent by the prisoner a one pound note to captain Fitzmorris.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the room when the captain died. - A. No, he was out about a quarter of an hour, and he returned in about three minutes after the captain's death.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course he might have disposed of it. - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no conversation about what the purse contained before the officer came in. - A. Yes, when the officer was in the passage, he told me what the purse contained.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know in point of fact whether his sister washed for the captain. - A. She did wash for the captain; she denied being his sister; she claimed one pound seventeen shillings, or two pounds.</p>
               <p>MRS. MUNRO. Q. You nursed the deceased. - A. Yes, I came on the Saturday evening as he died on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that he had a purse in his pantaloons on the Sunday morning. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this woman whom the prisoner calls his sister. - A. Yes, she said the captain owed her one pound seventeen shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Name the officers that were with you, it is not necessary that you should mention any body else. - A. There were Gosling, Cambridge, and several others.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been waiting before you heard any thing that attracted your notice. - A. I suppose an hour; we went out about eight or nine, I heard several carts come in the road, where I was to intercept them. I left the other officers about a mile from where I was; upon hearing the carts coming on the road, I went to the other officers to come to my assistance; the other officers were waiting in another direction in case they should take another road. They came with me. I and the other officers followed the carts.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you come up to them. - A. I suppose it might be half an hour or more. There might be ten or a dozen carts, I did not count them; they were loaded with tubs, they appeared like half anchors, just such as smuggled goods are carried about in the country; and there were several persons on foot, and seven or eight persons on horseback; I thought there might be a score or more; upon our coming up to them Mr. Gosling, the excise officer, stopped the first cart, and I stopped against the second cart: I told the man with the second cart if he attempted to take the goods, I would shoot him; he immediately jumped on the cart, and told me I might fire and be d - d, for we should not have the goods. We were immediately surrounded by a number of horsemen, that attended the carts, they began to flourish their bludgeons over our heads, and told us we should have nothing; we told them we would have the goods, or otherwise we would shoot them.

               <p>Q. Was he the man that you described to have got up in the cart. - A. No, he was one of the horsemen. The carts turned back, and the horsemen collected together to fill up the road, they all of them turned round; the carts were behind the horsemen; the horsemen crossed the road to prevent us from following of them; they formed a line with their heads towards our heads.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on horseback or on foot. - A. On horseback.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of your party on horseback. - A. Four, three officers and another person; we immediately opposed the horsemen, and told them we would not be stopped, we broke through their ranks. They headed us again, after we had broke through the ranks.</p>
               <p>Q. They turned upon you and past between you and the carts. - A. They did; I ordered every man on my side to cock their pistols. I was determined to have the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that order loud enough for the smugglers to hear you. - A. Yes, they then filled up the road again, they had faced about, they told us we should not go any further; I told

             I would shoot him if he did not let me go forward, I pointed my pistol to Abel's breast; at that time another horseman had a stick over my arm; Abel flourished his stick over my head; he ordered the footmen to come forward, the footmen called out unhorse them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had the footmen been at the time they turned about. - A. When the carts turned round they went with the carts, they were in the rear of the horsemen; they came forward, we told them we were determined to fire; some of the horsemen ordered the blunderbuss to be brought forward, they called out bring forward the blunderbuss, put in an additional ball; we advanced and they attempted to fire upon us; I immediately pointed my pistol to the breast of Abel, and told him I was determined to shoot him; he then dared me to shoot him; I asked him if he had no person that wanted him, if he had not a wife and family that wanted him; he then damned me, and told me to come there with him. I followed him into a turnip field, he asked me what I wanted, there was ten pound for me, which I immediately accepted, and rode to the officers, and told them that he had bribed me; some of the horsemen came into the turnip field, and some stopped out; the horses and carts went forward. Jeremiah Abel came back after he went to the men, and told them what he had done; I saw him go away, and come back from the other men to me, and the other officers, and he said, I see you all know it, you are all satisfied; we immediately went to Casson-Wood-Row-house, and signed the notes; the carts went on.</p>
               <p>Q. You marked the notes and afterwards left them at the house of the supervisor. - A. Yes, immediately; I left them with the supervisor's wife. It was impossible for us to make a seizure, by being opposed by the horsemen.</p>
               <p>Q. The supervisors house was a considerable distance from you. - A. About as far as nine mile to the supervisor's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it not been but for the great resistance, of a great number of persons, and their threats that they used should you have seized these things for the King. - A. Yes, we went out for that purpose.</p>

               <p>Mr. Att. General. Could you have seized these goods. - A. No we were prevented by number, both horse and foot; we should certainly have seized them, if it had not been for that resistance, and the number.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the value of these goods that they had; were they worth two or three hundred pound or more. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were small casks, such as smugglers carry spirits in. - A. Yes, they were slung; there were twelve or thirteen carts.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after this transaction did you see the prisoner. - A. Not till Mr. Ailsbrook went into the turnip field.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not asking of that night, how long after that night was it that you saw him again. - A. Upon Gee's hearing, to the best of my recollection, on the 28th of November,</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him on Gee's hearing at East Dereham, did it occur to you that he was one of the smugglers on that night. - A. The moment I saw him I recollected the situation he was in according to my own idea.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation did he remain in while Ailsbrook and Abel went into the turnip field. - A. He remained in the road at the time I went up to him.</p>

No, I remained on horseback in the road; I went immediately with them to the supervisor's house, and left them notes with the wife, and related to her the circumstance under which they had been received.</p>
