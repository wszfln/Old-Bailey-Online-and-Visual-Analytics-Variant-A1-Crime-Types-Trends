                  </hi>. I ammanager of Richards and Co., coal merchants and colliery colliery proprietors, having offices at 1, Fenchurch Street, City, and they have a colliery in South Wales—the certificate of the registration of the Company is in Court—early in February we were in want of a depot at Faddington—the defendant called on me on the 6th, and told me he had his coal depot to sell and plant belonging to it, at Mileage Station of the Great Western Railway—he gave me some particulars of the extent of the business, and finally told me that 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the price of it—I said that, judging from what he had said of the business, 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. seemed a great deal too much, but I would mention the matter to the directors—I did so, and on 10th February I went with Mr. Shirley, one of the directors, to see the premises; we saw the defendant there, he showed us some rough books—Mr. Shirley left before me: after he had left the defendant told me that he had been offered 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that morning for the depot, and the plant as it stood, from a person in the South of London—I said that was more, than I could recommend the directors to give, and I left—on 23rd February he came to our office in Fenchurch Street—Mr. Philpot and Mr. Shirley, two of the directors, were present, the matter was again dis<lb/>cussed, and he agreed to take 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be paid at the rate of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton on bouse coal, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton on steam coal, sold to his customers—Mr. Philpot asked him if he had the authority of the Great Western Rail<lb/>way Company to make the assignment of the premises to the Company—he said "I have seen Mr. Morgan of the estate office and he has consented to the assignment "Mr. Philpot asked him to get a note from Mr. Morgan and he said he would—it was then arranged that he should attend on the 25th to sign the agreement—he came on the 26th—at that time I had she agreement drawn out by our solicitor—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produeed</hi>)—I took him to</p>

               <p>the board room to see Mr. Philpot—Mr. Philpot asked him if he had brought he letter from Mr. Morgan—he said he had not been able to meet with him he had been waiting but could not see him—he said he wanted the matter settled on that day, as he had taken a public-house called the De Berg Arms, at West Drayton—I think Mr. Philpot asked him if the matter could not be deferred—he said the money was required that day, and finally Mr. Philpot agreed to give it him; he asked him first if he would like it is a cheque or how—he said he would like it in cash—Mr. Philpot also asked him if he had given any bill of sale, or if his property was encumbered in any way—he said "No"—Mr. Philpot said "Would you have any objection to sign a note to that effect?"—he said "No" and he did sign this note (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—I had the cheque ready drawn out—I sent a clerk to cash it and handed the money to the defendant, upon the representations he made—I went and took possession of the premises—it was at his offices at Paddington that I handed him the money—I subsequently received a com<lb/>munication from a gentleman named Holland of the firm of Reed and Holland, and also from Mr. Duncan, and Mr. Minshall, in consequence of which I went to the defendant and said that I had heard that he had been pressed by creditors, and that there were judgments against him—I said I had heard from Mr. Holland that an execution had been issued some days before for about 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that it was not true—I then said that I had heard he had given a bill of sale—he said that had been satisfied—I said that Forder and Co. and Duncan had told me that he owed him this money, and that Duncan had issued an execution against him—at first he said It was not true, afterwards he admitted it—I then asked him for the letter he had promised me from Mr. Morgan—he said at first he would get it—I saw him again, and he then told me that Mr. Wilkinson of the Great Western Railway had declined to make the assignment—I went that day and saw Mr. Wilkinson, he showed me a letter, and in consequence of that and the communication I had with Mr. Morgan I placed the matter in our solicitor's hands—the Board had a meeting, and I afterwards saw the defendant again—I said "I have seen Mr. Wilkinson, and he has shown me a letter applying for the premises, and he told me that the Great Western Railway Company had refused the assignment as they had already promised it to William Whiteley"—he was very much confused—I don't remember what he said—he said the gentleman from the North of London who had offered him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was Mr. Thomas—at one of the interviews I recommended him to return the money—I don't know what he siad, he not returned it—tins is the receipt he gave for the money.</p>

               <p>agreement is prepared"—a Mr. Watson came with Macartney the first day I saw him, he is a house and estate agent—I think he came twice—Macartney brought me his agreements with the Great Western on the morning of the 26th, and I handed them to Mr. Philpot—Mr. Philpot was a solicitor, he has retired—I was only once at the premises before the matter was concluded—Mr. Philpot did not go with me, Mr. Shirley did once—Macartney did not tell me that he was doing all he could with Mr. Morgan—when he came on the 26th he said he had not got the note—I did not say no doubt it would be all right; I expected that it would, as he said so distinctly, and I went to the place and took possession—we have since then carried on business at the office at the pleasure of the Great Western Company, but the wharf was taken away from us by the Com<lb/>pany—Bellus has been representing us at the office at 8, Westbourne Park Road, but we only occupy it at the Company's pleasure—we also have an office at Lord Hill Bridge, we have a lad there, but that again is only at the Company's pleasure—we hope to retain them, but do not expect to succeed, they have refused both to us—there is no condition with regard to the past—we did owe the Great Western 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was previous to the suspension of our Company—since then it has been reconstructed with fresh capital, and is entirely a new concern—it had been in liquidation—Macartney suggested that there might be an objection—he said it was our own fault, that they never would refuse a substantial firm, and that the real source of the objection was the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that after I had dis<lb/>covered about the bill of sale—the Great Western Company have taken possession of the stock—no one has claimed under the bill of sale—Macartney said at last that the person who held the bill of sale had agreed to take another security and release that—I have very great reason to doubt all he said—I did not believe it, and I do not believe it now—Mr. McColl held the bill of sale—I have seen him here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a director of "Richards and Co., Limited"—the Company at one time went into liquidation in consequence of the failure of a Scotch bank—it is now in a large business—on 23rd February I saw the defendant with Mr. Coles—he said that he held these premises at "Mileage annually, from the Great Western Railway Company—I asked him if he had the permission of the Company to assign them or to dispose of them—he said he had, that Mr. Morgan, the estate agent of the Com<lb/>pany, had given him permission to dispose of them—I told him he must bring a letter from Mr. Morgan to that effect; he said he would—when he came on the 26th, the first question I asked him was, "Have you got the letter from Mr. Morgan as you promised"—he said he had not, that he had been there two or three times, but had not been able to see him, but he would get the letter in the course of the afternoon—before he signed the agreement I read it over to him—I first asked him if he was being sued by anybody—he said he was not—I then asked if he had given a bill of sale to any one—he said he had not—I then asked if he had committed any act of bankruptcy—he said he had not—I then said, "As you have answered my</p>

               <p>questions, you will have no objection of course to sign a paper which I shall draw out"—I then drew out this paper, which he signed—we were to pay him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, and there was another sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or more to be paid by commission, and I asked him how he would have it, whether by cheque or cash—he said he should like cash, and I sent one of the clerks for the cash, which was given to him by Mr. Coles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think I first saw his three agreements on the 26th—I did not see Mr. Bellus—I heard afterwards that he had called—no attempt has been made by any creditor of the defendant to prevent our enjoyment of the premises, only by the Great Western Hallway Company, because we were trespassers there—they made no reference to the debt due from the late firm of Richards and Co., because they had accepted payment of the instalment of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound on the composition; there was no debt due to them—I applied to the Great Western Railway for a licence—there is still an application before them—I hope to get it—they have already turned us out from the wharf, which was the important part we wanted, but negotiations are pending under which we hope to get from them as an act of grace one of the offices lately held by the defendant—I have not seen the defendant to speak to him since the negotiation with Mr. Wilkinson. Thomas Morgan. I am agent to the Great Western Railway Company—on behalf of the Company I entered into these three agreements with the defendant; they refer to two offices and a wharf at Paddington—they con<lb/>tain a covenant binding him not to underlet without the consent or licence in writing of the Company—I never gave any such consent—I never pro<lb/>mised to do so—he asked me to transfer the tenancy to Messrs. Richards and Co., and 2 told him I had no authority to do so without the sanction of the traffic department—I recommended him to go and see Mr. Wilkin<lb/>son, and he would no doubt assist him to do what was necessary.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not speak discouragingly to him—supposing the party introduced by him was substantial, I did not see any difficulty in getting the transfer; but that was not my business—these three agreements were prepared by me—the defendant has been a tenant of the Company for 15 years—we have known him for 20 years—he has always paid hi rent and the money I had to collect from him—I considered he was in a prosperous state of business—I know that lately he has been in rather embarrassed circumstances through some building speculation—he does not owe us a farthing—he is our tenant now, at the De Berg Hotel at West Drayton, under a seven years' lease—he is a man who has risen by his own exertions—he was for 14 years a non-commissioned officer in the Horse Guards Blue—he afterwards became one of the Queen's guards on the railway; he saved money and got into business under the Railway Company—I am not aware that he has done anything to forfeit that character.</p>

I went with Godden to Burton's house—after he had taken' her, I asked her if she would like to remain in the house as I was going upstairs to search the place, or would she prefer going to the station?—she asked me to allow her to remain, which I did—I made a search in her presence—I went upstairs to the back bedroom, first floor, and there saw a large quantity of wearing apparel—amongst other things I found these two sealskin jackets under a lot of coats, waistcoats, and trousers, all new, on a chest of drawers—I pulled them out, they were nearly at the bottom crumpled up—I said, "Here are two sealskin jackets, Mrs. Burton"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "How do you account for having these in your possession?—she said, "This one I bought of a woman who I don't know, and I bought that some six or seven months ago"—I said, "Have you any books?"—she said, "No, I have not a buying in book"—on looking under the bed I found a sack—I pulled it out—it contained 20 pairs of boots all new, men's, women's and children's—I asked how she accounted for them—she said, "I bought them of different people"—I have shown this sealskin jacket to Mrs. Adams, and a pair of the boots to Mr. Turner—I saw the things found by Lucas, and took away a large quantity to the station.</p>

I went with Lewis to Burton's house—I went to the coal cellar with a candle, and there found a twig basket apparently filled with rags on the top—I put my hand in and felt some<lb/>thing very weighty—I emptied the things on to the table—it consisted of a large quantity of new plated articles wrapped up in tissue paper, 15 dozen knives and forks, and about 80 duplicates relating to different property; silk jackets, shawls, sealskin jackets, and different articles of wearing apparel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brushmaker and a maker of satin store decorations, of 22, Great Russell Street—the prisoner was in my employ<lb/>ment for about two months up to the Saturday when he left of his own accord—this fire occurred on the Tuesday following his leaving on the previous Saturday—the front basement is used by me as a workshop—it contained dyes and cutting machines—I and my wife were at the premises up to 8.30 on the night of the fourth—we went through the premises from top to bottom and the last thing we turned off the gas, and it was perfectly safe—we left no light in the kitchen—the grating in the pavement was not left open as it was fastened with a ring and a long chain that goes through a staple underneath into the front vault, and there it was fastened with a cord twice over—it could not be opened from the outside without con<lb/>siderable force—it was fastened that night—there were shavings and cutt<lb/>ings in a bag and some about the floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman in charge of the Holborn Station—I went to these premises about 25 minutes past 1 on the morning of the 5th—the fire was not out when I arrived—I found in the workshop a large bag of paper cuttings on fire at the back part of the front basement, used as</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188005240033"/>
               <p>a workshop—I afterwards examined the place—the fire had no doubt broken out either in the bag of shavings, or close outside it by the bench—the fire was what I called darkened down when I got there—the constables had been putting 60 or 70 pails of water previous to my arriving.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate.</hi> "I was going down Great Russell Street about a quarter to 1; I saw the area of 22 wide open, and seeing a light there I went on my hands and knees and halloaed down; receiving no reply, and hearing a crackling of wood, I jumped down the area and pushed open the glass door. I saw a lot of shavings on the floor all alight. I jumped up again as fast as I could, and my hat fell off into the area. I jumped up into the area with the intention of running for a fire engine. I was stopped by a gentleman getting out of a cab, and Police Constable 45 came and charged me. I know nothing about how it came alight".</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> What I said in my statement is perfectly true—I was perfectly dumb at seeing the fire—I went down seeing the light; I was certainly unlawfully on the premises at the time, but I don't see why I should be found guilty of setting fire to it—the shavings might have been kindling there for hours, and there might have been a gust of wind did it—it is rather an awkward position to be placed in—the policeman was 150 yards from me when I came up: I did not see him—it was not him that caught me, but the gentleman—the policeman said the gentleman would have to come up in the morning, and what I said was "I dare say you will make up a nice case for me in the morning;" that was all I said.</p>

I live at 43, Craven Street, Strand—I am employed there—it is nearly opposite No. 3—on the afternoon of Friday the 19th March, I was looking out of the third-floor window at 4.45; I saw a pony and trap at No. 3, a man was sitting in it—I then saw Foghill, with the assistance of Hudson, bring out a packing-case; it was put into the trap, and the man in the trap drove away at a walking pace towards the Embank<lb/>ment—I have seen Foghill go in at No. 3—I am sure he was one of the men—the prisoners were dressed in the ordinary way—Foghill walked in an opposite direction to what the trap was going—Hudson seemed to be getting into the trap, but I could not say he got it—I know what a deed-box is—it was not a deed-box—I could see that the packing-case must be resting on something in the trap, but what it was I do not know—I called it a red horse; the trap was polished, not painted—it was a small trap, a kind of dog trap—the case was</p>

The trap was in my sight about three minutes—the box I saw removed was a dirty white deal box—I had never been into the offices at No. 3—I did not say, "There is no man among then I know," nor words to that effect—I said, pointing to Hudson, "This is the man who resembles the man that assisted Foghill more than any man, but I cannot swear to him"—the positions of the men were altered, and thet were ordered to take off their hats, but I was still in doubt—Hudson was discharged—I was more positive when I saw him on the Good Friday-Fuller and a messenger identified him; I do not know the messenger's name—I had not seen Hudson before he assisted Foghill—I only saw one box brought out.</p>

I am a licensed messenger—I live at No. 3, Clare Court—on Friday, 19th March, I was in Craven Street, Strand, between 5.30 and 6 p.m.—I was close against the vehicle—it was a sort of chaise or dog<lb/>cart—it was opposite No. 3; I saw it drive up—three people were in it—I next saw Foghill go into the house and bring out two portmanteaus—one of the men went with him, and one remained in the trap—the man also helped him out with a packing-case—Foghill put the portmanteaus in the trap-some one helped Foghill put the packing-case in the trap—Foghill threw the portmanteaus over the side—the packing-case was put in at the tail—pony was in the dog-cart—it drove off—Foghill and another man was in it—I only recognised Foghill—I do not know which way the man went who remained—when they came I thought I heard the clock strike half-past fire—I knew Foghill by sight from his going into No. 3—I had seen him do so several times—I have no doubt he is the man—I did not recognise Hudson—I heard of the loss the same night—I saw Foghill the next morn<lb/>ing at the police-station.</p>

On Saturday, 20th March, I went to No. 3, Craven Street, between 10 and 11 a.m—on the second floor I saw Foghill in his office—I said, "Is your name Foghill?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "Were you here yesterday afternoon 1"—he said "Yes"—that would be on Friday—he said, "I was here with my friend, a gentleman named Hudson; why do you ask these questions?"—I said, "I am a detective sergeant; I shall apprehend you for stealing two portmanteaus and a box</p>

               <p>prisoner; he was standing with Mr. Coleman, who was smoking a pipe, but I did not know who he was—at the time of my arrest I was not aware that the order of committal of 21st January, 1879, had been made—I was never served with any document by the prisoner—I paid the money and was released from custody—it is absolutely false that I was served person<lb/>ally on 8th December, 1879, with a copy of this judgment summons—I was not in the Temple at all on that day, I was in bed at my private residence, 9, West Kensington Gardens, having broken my left thigh—I first got out of bed on 1st January, six weeks and two days after the accident, and I was confined to the house till 31st January—Dr. Trevor set my leg, and Dr. Steele attended me—my clerk came to see me on the morning my leg was set, and I was in a very dangerous condition—I first heard of the judgment summons of 1st December some time in January—I think Mr. Coleman wrote—I knew I had not been served in a former instance, and then, know<lb/>ing that I had not been served again, I suspected some foul play, and gave directions to my solicitor, and a summons was taken out before Justice Hawkins to set aside Mr. Justice Denman's order—that was heard on 23rd March, and I gave evidence, and Dr. Steele and my clerk—I have heard Sir. Jones's statement; it is substantially correct—I have been upwards of 20 years at the bar, and am perfectly well known in the Temple.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Crow-examined.</hi> This paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my clerk's writing—having read it, I still say that I never was served with any document by the prisoner, nor was I served with the judgment summons on which I was subsequently arrested—I was served with a judgment summons by Mr. Coleman himself, and I arranged to go before one of the Masters—I asked him to adjourn it for a week, and then he took out an attachment in the Queen's Bench, and I attended and explained how absurd it was—I was arrested afterwards, and I paid the money—I am an Irish gentleman, whether I am the brother of the very eminent Irish Judge has nothing to do with this—none of my relatives are engaged in mercantile pursuits—I have not a brother in the wool trade—I never had any relation in trade—one brother is a Magistrate, and another in the Army—one of them lives in this country—neither of them came over to visit me about Christmas—my brother, the Major, was in London about 8th December—he does not resemble me in the slightest—there are two races in the family, utterly un<lb/>like; one follows the father, and one the mother; I follow my mother—my brother has never had a letter directed to my chambers—I received a letter from Mr. Coleman dated 23rd December, but not at the time—my clerk did not deliver my letter then as I was very ill—when I got the letter I handed it to my solicitor—it was giving me notice that this order had been obtained—I do not say for a moment that I was not informed of the service of the 8th, that was what made me go about it—I am not in the least offended at your asking me if I am a brother of the Judge; you are a gentleman of such perfect culture that I cannot be offended with you.</p>

I was two or three minutes away at the tobacconist's—I said "a minute and a half" at the police-court—I have not been talking to Carlton about it—I could only guess at the time—I do not recollect saying I was accused of taking money—I was accused twice; once was because oysters were not accounted for, but they were afterwards found to be bad—we were pretty busy on the Saturday; sometimes there were eight</p>

The drawer was accessible to any one in the shop. I had not the key. Six or seven hours elapsed before Mr. Ullman came to look after the money. In intro<lb/>ducing a system of bookkeeping to Mr. Ullman's business my life was made a perfect misery to me by his brothers. My system was too strict for those who had to contend with it, and Mr. Ullman abused me in my bedroom between 3 and 4 in the morning. I am innocent; if guilty I should not have stayed in the neighbourhood where my duties took me, and I was taken into custody within 100 yards of one of Mr. Ullman's shops. I left because I was thoroughly worn out with annoyance and anxiety. He claims 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me, and that nearly tallies with the amount I am charged with stealing. I have borne an honest character, and the testimony brought against me is not sufficient to chastise a child upon.</p>

Goddard says:</hi> "On Sunday, the 9th, I was drinking in Mr. Rogers's public-house at the corner of Steward Street along with my wife, my sister, and my mother-in-law and a nephew, John Anderson, from 8 till about 11. I came at once to see if I could borrow twopence off my brother. I went down Artillery Lane about a quarter to ten, and met Mr. Johnson's son, and he saw me at that time. At 11 o'clock I goes home with my wife, and at 10 past 11 her little brother comes home and tells me a robbery has been committed in Steward Street, and the name of Anderson was mentioned in the robbery. On Monday morning, about half-past 10, I goes up to Mr. Marter and I says to him 'I hear there's been a robbery here, and my name was mentioned in it' He says he does not know; he was not in, and he was about four miles away, but a man upstairs name of Brazier says it was you, and he knows you. I says 'I wish to see the man,' and he says 'He's not in; come up in an hour's time.' I comes up and he was not in, and he says 'Call up about 3.' I comes up about 3 and the detective was there, and I did not see Brazier till I got to the station, and he says it was me, and I says 'You have made a mistake.' Faley says: "I had a row with witness Collins the other day in Brushfield Street, and that is why he has come up against me. He is a false swearer, and he said to the people around, 'I'll have my own back again,' and he heard of this case and he went and gave my name in." Jennings says: "On Sunday, the 9th, at 7 o'clock, I went home and had a lay down, and at a quarter to 9 I came out again and I went in the Gun public-house in the middle bar and had a half-pint, and I sat by myself. In about a quarter of an hour's time I saw a lot over in the private box. There was James Collins and his wife, and his cousin's wife, and John Faley and William Neal, and a few more I did not properly know, and I went over with them and drank with them till 11, when Mr. Fisher ordered us out, and we went out, and I bid them all good-night and I went home. There has been a rare lot of thieving at Fisher's, and he has blamed it all on to us. It happens to be that James Collins, the witness, did it."</p>

               <p>look after the place. Between 1 and 2 I heard the old man come in door. I heard the footsteps of a man coming along the passage. I heard prisoner's voice say 'Are you drank to-night again; Pre a good mind to choke you.'I heard the old man being dragged along the passage towards the outer door. He was saying 'For God's sake don't choke me.' Prisoner was not saying anything. When he got to the door prisoner said 'I am, chuck him out into the gutter and leave him there.'I got out of bed and went to the door and saw Jim Driscoll, prisoner, and two policement, and the old man standing at the door. I told Rose to come in and go to bed He came to the door and said 'Old man, I don't deserve it.' I said 'ne more you didn't I saw blood and cuts on his face. Prisoner did not ay anything about it then or at any time. I heard of the inquest. Prisons went away on 9th April; he did not tell me he was going. The not morning after this I said 'You ought to be ashamed of yourself to serve the old man as you did.' Prisoner said 'If you've got much more to say I'll serve you the same.' The "old man was drunk at the time; he was drunk nearly every night Prisoner had no instructions from me as to ad<lb/>mitting drunken people. This old man had been 18 months lodging at say place, paying nightly, and was mostly drunk when he came home. I gave prisoner no instructions as to not admitting him.</p>

He said, "No, I have not got my money." I left him leaning against the wall. Driscoll called me up and said, "Rose is lying on the pavement, why not pick him up?" I said, "No, leave him there, he has no money." McGrath come by, and shortly after the prosecutor come and said, "Why don't you let him go to bed?" I said, "He has no money I did not strike him, and I did not have a broom in my hand; it is not till after the house is closed and the lights put out that I want to use one.

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">A prisoner</hi>). I have come from Pentonville Prison, where I am undergoing sentence—I know the prisoners—my acquaintance with them commenced about last October—I think I first saw Noble at the Alexandra Park with Maxwell—Maxwell proposed to me, in Noble's presence, to go down into the country and represent myself as a cattle dealer, and to send up meat to different salesmen—this took place at the Star and Garter in Poland Street—they told me to get cheques from different people and bring them to them, and they would alter them into a larger amount—at that time I was living at 70, Margaret Street, Clerkenwell—Maxwell was living in Crownfield Street, Leytonstone Road, Stratford, and Noble at 18, Poland Street, Oxford Street, within a few yards of the Star and Garter—I was out of employment at the time—I never knew the prisoners to do anything—Maxwell told me, in Noble's presence, to go down to Watford, that being a market town, and send up things from there, and to go and stay at St. Albans and buy things there—I did so, in the name of Ellis, and sent up meat to Dean and Hatton, and Lee and Cowall, and Thomas Wylde and Sons—in return for that meat I received crossed cheques—I gave them to the prisoners, they were both together at the Star and Garter; they said they would have to get a banking account—the cheques were shown to Noble—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them, it is made out in the name of Ellis—I gave the cheques to Maxwell and he took them away—I saw him fill this one in afterwards—they were trying for some time to find a place to open a banking account—on the Monday I and Maxwell went down into the City together and he went to Barnett, Hoare, and Co.—Maxwell ascertained from a book he had that they had country agents—Noble was there at the time, in the parlour at the Star and Garter—I don't know whether Noble was there while he was looking at the book; he knew we were going to Barnett's—Maxwell was going there to send some money from there down to Messrs. Stevens and Blandy's bank, at Heading—I went there with him—we left Noble in Poland Street—at first Maxwell was going to send me in, and then he went in himself and did it—when he came out he made a communication to me—I went down to Beading that day with Maxwell—he was looking about for a place that would do for an office—we returned to town and saw Noble that evening in Poland Street—I think that was on 22nd December—I know it was on a Monday—we told him we had been down to Beading, and that 2001. had been sent down there in the name of Hunt, and I was to go down there and represent myself as Hunt—Noble joined in the con<lb/>versation, and we made arrangements that me and Maxwell were to go down to Reading next day to see if we could find a place either for apart<lb/>ments or offices—we did go, and engaged apartments at 42, Zinzan Street, in the name of Edward Hunt—I paid"half a sovereign in advance for a week's rent—Maxwell gave me the money to pay—we returned to town and told Noble we had been down and engaged apartments there in the name of Hunt—Maxwell told me to get some bill heads printed and appear to set up in business as a cattle dealer—he said, in Noble's presence, that he should send a letter to me at the place where I had engaged apart<lb/>ments, as if it came from a Mr. Soames, the man that had sent the money, stating that he was glad to hear I had set up in business there, and I was to take that letter to the bank to show my authority for drawing this money out—I went to Reading and there received the letter—an arrange<lb/>ment</p>

               <p>was made as to references; Maxwell said he would send some some letters—I don't know whether Noble was present at that time, but he knew what he was going to do—on 3rd January I went down to Reading with the letter that Maxwell had written—I think that letter has ben destroyed—I went to the bank and showed it—to the clerk and drew out 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a cheque which the clerk wrote out and I signed—I had a cheque book—I then returned to town and went to the Star and Garter between 1 and 2 o'clock—I waited till 5 or 6, and then Maxwell and Noble come in together—I told them what I had done, and showed them the pass-book and cheque-book, and I gave Maxwell the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 5th January Maxwell gave me a letter to go down to Greenwich with some foreign money in it, and a day or two afterwards I called there and received a reply to it containing a cheque of Venables and Co., of King William Street, for 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the proceeds of the foreign money—I paid that in to my account at Heading, after Maxwell had endorsed it, and I endorsed it as well—I received it at the Greyhound Inn, at Greenwich, in the name of Carter—I saw Noble that same night—I showed him the cheque I had got from Venables—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at this time an arrangement was made about the engagement of a clerk—Noble said that he knew of a young man that would do; he was going to put an advertisement in the paper, and I was to answer it—the advertisement was put in and I answered it and engaged a person named Wordley, who came down to me at Reading on Saturday, 10th—I think I first saw Wordley at Paddington; I had seen him before, I don't know where, in company with both the prisoners—I was told by Maxwell, but Noble was present at the time, to buy dead meat and send up to the people I had got the cheques from—on Monday, the 12th January, I purchased some pigs from Charles Lampe, to the amount of about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and consigned them to Dean and Hatton, Central Meat Market, Smithfield, and in return, on 15th September, I received this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) by post for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took it up to London and gave it to Maxwell at the Star and Garter on the Friday evening—Noble was there at the time—Maxwell said he would take it home and alter it—that was in Noble's presence—I don't know whether he made any remark about it, but he stopped there—I stopped there with him—on the Saturday Maxwell brought the cheque down to me at Reading; it was then altered to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I endorsed it in the name of Edward Hunt, and, sent it by Wordley to the bank—I had taken Wordley with me to the bank and told them that any cheque I sent signed "Self" that were to pay him; I don't know on what day that was, it was Tuesday or Wednesday, before the cheque was paid in—I came back to town on Sunday, the day after paying in the cheque—Maxwell came back on the Saturday—on Sunday morning, the 18th, I received this cheque from Lee and Cowell; it was then for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on coming to town on that Sunday I went to my mother's house, 70, Margaret Street; I brought up the cheque with me; Maxwell met me at my mother's, and I gave him the cheque—I had drawn out 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by cheque on the Saturday, the 17th, at Beading, and I gave 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it to Noble at his own house in Poland Street—I told him that I had paid in the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—I saw Noble again on the Monday evening, the 19th, in Poland Street—Maxwell said in his presence that he was going to alter the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque and what amount he was going to alter it to—on Tuesday, the 20th, about 10 a.m., I met Wordley</p>

               <p>at Paddington Station—lie had come up from Reading with a letter con<lb/>cerning this cheque from Thomas Wylde for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in payment of something I had sent—he also brought the pass-book in which credit was given me for the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then went back to the Star and Garter and saw Noble and Maxwell together there—I gave Maxwell the cheque, and showed them the pass-book—they both said that would be all right—an arrangement was then made to meet Maxwell at Paddington Station next morning, between 8 and 9; Noble was to go down to Beading with me and stop outside the bank—after making that arrangement, I went into the city with Noble; we went into the European, and he gave me the four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Beading notes to change at Barnett Hoare's; they were the notes I had given him on the Sunday night—I got them changed into gold at Barnett's—Noble said he did not want to be seen about there—he went on, and I was to meet him at a hairdresser's shop in Bishopsgate Street—I went there and gave him the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I remained in town that night—I was with Noble up to 5 or 6 in the evening—next morning, Wednesday, the 21st, I met Noble, Maxwell, and Garrett at the Underground Railway at Praed Street, and I and Noble and Garrett went to Beading—Maxwell gave me these two cheques, Lee and Co well's and Thomas Wylde's; they then represented 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 890l—I had the pass-book and the cheque-book—we conversed on the way down; they said what they were going to do—Noble was present when these altered cheques were given to me—Noble said when we got to Beading that I was to go on and not take any notice, and they were to see if any one was looking out—I was to stay some distance away from the bank, and Noble and Garrett were to go and stand near the bank to see if Wordley-got the money—I was to write out two cheques, one for 230?., and send in, and if we got that I was to write another for a smaller amount and send in and pay the other two cheques in—that arrangement was made in Noble's presence before we went down, and it was referred to by him on the way down—when we got to Beading I saw Wordley outside the station—I went straight on down the road alone some distance from the station—I went into a little public-house on the road on the way to the barracks—Noble and Garrett were following on behind—Noble went into the public house with me—we had something to drink, and Noble borrowed a pen and ink of the landlord when he came in to serve us, and I wrote out the two cheques, one for 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I endorsed the other two—that was in Noble's presence—I gave them all to Noble, but he gave them back to me, except the one for 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave that to Wordley, who was outside in the main road with Garrett—this was about half-past 10 in the morning—Wordley then went on to the bank, Noble and Garrett followed; they told me to stop behind—I remained some distance behind—Noble said I was to wait there and they were to come back after getting the money for the 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—I retained the altered cheques and the pass-book—as they were rather a long while gone I went to see where they were, and met Wordley coming back in custody of Detective Randall—I then threw away the cheques and pass-book in a timber yard, and I went to some other station and got back to town—I saw Noble about 7 or 8 that evening in Poland Street—I and Maxwell met him—he said he had had a narrow escape, he had been very nearly taken, he had to run for it; he said that he had walked some distance, he did not know where, but he got in at some different station</p>

               <p>and got back to London—he said that Garrett and Wordley were taken—he asked me what had become of the cheques and the pass-book—I told him I had thrown them away—they were very much put out about that and said I ought to have destroyed them—I said I did not know what to do with them; I wanted to get rid of them—they said I had better get away for some time—I said I had nowhere to go and had no money to go away with—they said did not I know of any place where I could go and stay—I said I could only go to my sister's—they said I had better go there for a time, and they would come and see me and let me know how things were going on—my sister lives at Myrtle Cottage, Cdbbold Road, Starch Green, Shep<lb/>herd's Bush—they said they did not want to get away then because they had not been seen in it—I continued at my mother's for a week or two after this—I saw Noble and Maxwell very frequently, always together, in Poland Street, and Finsbury Park, and Wood Green—I eventually went to my sister's at Myrtle Cottage; that was before Garrett and Wordley were tried—Noble said I had better keep quiet down there; that was after I had got there; his wife came down there—on the Sunday after I had been there he met me by his wife's appointment in the New Road, Hammersmith, outside the Railway Tavern, near the station—he came again with Maxwell one Sunday afternoon—they said it was very warm for me; Noble said I had better go away from there, hut Maxwell advised me to stop there; he said it would be all right if I kept quiet—he said "It is very warm for you; they only seem to want you n—Noble said he was going to Italy; would 1 go with him and do something there; he said he could get some money, and he could take me with him, and that would be out of the way—Max<lb/>well said he thought of going to Liverpool; they had got something to do there—he said he knew of something there; that he could get a cheque and alter—it there—I knew Noble by the name of Dan, Dan Noble, and Maxwell by the name of Jim, Jim Maxwell—I also knew Noble by the name of Dyson; he used that as a surname, but I believe it is his Christian name; he was sometimes called Mr. Dyson; I saw him twice while I was at Shep-herd's Bush, and his wife twice—I remained indoors most of the time there—I was apprehended there on 10th March—I had a letter from one of them, I don't know which, on the Saturday after I was there, telling me to keep quiet—I did not see either of them after 10th March—I was committed for trial and pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 15 years' penal servitude—the day after I communicated with the authorities of the Bank of England—I gained nothing at all by participating in this fraud; in fact 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I have lived there six months—my brother was very seldom at home when I went to see my mother—he is a barman—the last place I saw him in was at King's Cross—I do not know how long he had been out of employ when we came from Brighton—we were there six months—I did not inquire what he meant by coming to live with me; it was not the first time—he came down to Brighton, and stopped a week or two—I cannot remember whether he has had any employment since Midsummer, 1879—he was always at home with mother when he had no employment—I saw him once when he was charged at the Mansion House—I did not talk to him about it being an advantage to the Bank of England to convict somebody else; I told him to speak the truth, and he would be the better off for it—he said that he should see—Noble and Maxwell's names had not been mentioned to me up to that time—Noble introduced his wife when they came down, but I hare not seen her since—I think that was the Sunday before Garrett and Wordley were convicted—the names of Noble and Maxwell were never mentioned.</p>

               <p>May, about 12.40, I flaw that the stack was on fire; it was a small flare—I went towards it in a minute and saw the three prisoners at the end of the stack—they were not all three together—Algar came as if he had come in from behind me; which way he came I could not tell, it was so very quick—the other two were close against the burning stack—they each had a bit of stick in their hand—the fire had caught the straw and they were trying to put it out as it lay under their feet, but the fire came round so quick that we all had to get out of the way—that was the first thing I saw—they were not stamping on the straw, they were hitting it with the pieces of wood—I had looked at the stack about five minutes before—it was all right then—there was not a soul near it, I could not see any one, if then was they were behind me or between the hedge and the rick—I saw no one but the three prisoners when I first went across—I told them to be off, they had no business there—there is no path there, the stack was on the other side of the hedge, about 100 yards from my door—the road is between it and my house; the stack might be about half way, about 50 yards from the road—the prisoners had no business there—they did not go away when I told them to be off—I did not see them go—the foreman of the farm. and some men came soon after—the fire burnt right out—there was do means of putting it out—I should think it had been on fire two or three minutes when I first saw it—neither of the prisoners made any observation to me when I spoke to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a flyman at the White Hart—the deceased was employed there as a stableman—he was not a regular man—he worked for the prisoner sometimes, to help him do his work—sometimes he worked in the yard—he was not at work for any one on the 28th—sometimes we never saw him for a week—between 1 and 2 on Thursday, the 29th, I and the deceased and some others were drinking at the White Hart—the prisoner was there drinking with us—there was some rather rough hone-play, and they blacked the deceased's face with soot—I did not see the prisoner take any part in that; I did—we went from there to the Bull's Head—the prisoner went with us—the deceased had something more to drink there—I don't think I had anything—we remained there about 10 minutes and then came back to the White Hart—that was about 2.45—I can't say whether the prisoner was there then, I believe he was; I have no doubt about it—the deceased was then drunk, but not so very drunk—he was put into the taproom—we were not drinking there when we came back from the Bull's Head—I left the deceased there and went to my work—we left him in the corner, just inside the door, on a form—about 5.30 I went again into the taproom, and the deceased was sitting in the same place—there was a table there—he was awake and quite quiet—he did not appear so very drunk—I heard no more of him till I heard that his leg was broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—I live at Redhill—I get my living by selling oranges and nuts about Reigate and other places—between 6 and 7 on the evening of 29th April I went to the White Hart tap for a rest, and called for half a pint of beer—I knew a man called Bunkum for some years—I saw him there sitting on a form and laying his head on the table fast asleep—the prisoner was there; he had just cleaned two of the tables down, and he wanted to clean the other table down where the poor deceased was lying, likewise the stool, and he said, "Out you come, Bunkum, if you don't I shall pull you out," and he caught hold of his coat sleeve and palled him down with great violence, which I might call with vengeance—he did nothing more to him—he said, "Out you go; I am going to drag you out and put you outside in the yard, or else in the stable"—he tried to drag him out—the landlady came in and said, "Wash his face and set him up, and let him have his sleep out"—when the prisoner pulled him down the deceased said, "Tom, you have owed me this spite a long time, and now you have done it for me"—there were several people there then—I saw blood on the ground after he had been thrown down; it came out of the lacing of his boots.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a B.M. and a M.R.C.S.—I am also the medical official at the Reigate and Redhill Cottage Hospital—on the evening of 29th April, a little before 7 o'clock, I was called to the tap-room of the White Hart to see the deceased—I found that he was very much in<lb/>toxicated, and unable to give an intelligent account of himself or how the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188005240090"/>
               <p>accident happened—he was suffering from a very severe compound fracture of the left leg, just above the ankle—the bone was protruding through the skin, and the large bone of the leg was splintered into several pieces—it was not broken directly across, but splintered-clothing was covered with dirt, and his face and hands were smutty—there was a considerable amount of bleeding—he had been seen before my assistant, who had endeavoured to stop the bleeding—there was a pool of blood on the floor—I dressed the wound, and he was subsequently remove to the Union infirmary, where he was under the care of Mr. Kelsey, the sur<lb/>geon to the infirmary—I saw him the following Sunday with Mr. Kelsey and several other surgeons—he was then in a very exhausted condition; leg, in fact, had become gangrenous or mortified, and this mortification was extending upwards towards the body, so that it became absolutely necessary to cut the leg off; that was the only chance of saving his life—I assisted Mr. Kelsey in that operation—he was then under Mr. Kelsey's care—he rallied fairly well from the immediate effects of the operation, and was removed to his bed—I did not again see him alive—he was almost unconscious when I saw him on the Sunday—a severe shock, such as the fracture of a leg, would be likely to bring on delirium tremens in a subject who had a tendency to it—the death was undoubtedly caused by exhaustion consequent upon the injuries he had received, and the delirium tremens from which he had suffered—I am of opinion that con. siderable violence must have been used to cause a fracture of that kind—I do not think that falling on the leg or being thrown on it would cause a fracture of that character—the only plausible explanation I can give of the occurrence of the fracture is that his leg must have caught under the table or in the trestle of the table as he was sitting on the form, and if he was thrown backwards with some violence the leverage of his body would cause a fracture of that description—I assisted in making a post-mortem examination by order of the Coroner—the liver was in an advanced state of fatty degeneration, and all the tissues of the body were more or less infiltrated with fat—there was no other disease—there was no disease sufficient to cause death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He died from exhaustion brought on by the injuries he received—the degeneration undoubtedly followed upon the injury—that form of degeneration would only occur in a man of intemperate habits—the post-mortem confirmed my opinion that he was a man of intemperate habits—the fracture was of such a character that con<lb/>siderable violence must have been used—I think a simple fall would hardly account for it—if he was pushed with some violence I think that would account for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith and live at Hungary Hill, Faraham, Surrey—I went into the Wellington public-house on the 26th April, about 8 o'clock p.m.—the two prisoners came in about 20 minutes after<lb/>wards—they called for some beer and I joined them in drinking it—we then tossed up to see who was to pay—there was another man, Cole, who tossed as well—while the beer was being drunk I had occasion to go into the taproom, and while I was there the prisoner Henry Barnett came in and brought some boots in—I identify these boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as those he brought in—he asked me if I wanted to buy a pair of boots—I said "No," but afterwards I agreed to give him is. for them, and for the purpose of paying him I changed a sovereign with the landlady—I tied tied aces together and put the boots over my shoulder and kept them there till I left the house—when I had drunk some beer I paid for the boots with three shillings and two sixpences—I left the house about 9.58, and walked across the road by myself—I subsequently saw the prisoners standing 6 or 7 yards from me, and we all went up Alma Lane together from the house—that is in the direction of my home, but not in the direction of the home of Henry Barnett—when we had got about 250 yards Henry Barnett Struck me a blow on the right side of my</p>

On Friday, 27th April, about 10 a.m., the prosecutor came and made a communication to me at my house—I went with him to the Wellington beerhouse, and found Job Barnett sitting behind the door of the bar—the prosecutor and I went into the back room together—about 10 minutes afterwards we came back to the front of the bar, and the prosecutor and John Barnett began talking to one another—I called them into the tap-room, as the conversation was running high; John Barnett had a billycock hat over his eyes then, but when we went in it was in its proper position—he was not charged, but when the prosecutor questioned him he was all of a tremble and shake—I asked the prosecutor whether that was the man—he said "I am almost sure, I am almost certain"—that was in John Barnett's hearing, who replied "I was not there, I was tossing here with you last night"—I afterwards went to some work in Martin Webb and Co.'s brick-fields, and found 400 or 500 men working there—I went to the part where he was working, and when I was about 200 or 300 yards in front of the prosecutor he said "Hold hard, Bowyer, here is the man, stop," and he pointed out Henry Barnett—I saw one of the firm, who sent for Barnett, and when he came up he said "What do you want Bowyer?"—I said "I have come about those boots"—he said "What boots?"—I said "I suppose you know nothing about them," and I said to Blake "Is that the man that assaulted you last night?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Are you sure?"—he said "I am perfectly certain he is the man"-Barnett said "I bought a pair of boots at <hi rend="italic">Ned</hi> Stranger's last night and they are at borne now"—the prosecutor said "That is the man I bought the boots of"—Henry Barnett said "What boots? I bought a pair at Ned Stranger's last night and they are at home now, but I never sold them to you"—I took Henry Barnett in custody, and searched him and found these three separate shillings, about threepence in new coppers, and this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with three other pocket-handkerchiefs—I accompanied the prosecutor to Henry Barnett's lodging about 6,30, and he identified the boots—they were not actually handed to me, but he said "Those are the boots" Cross-examined by Henry Barnett.

I had a glass of ale with them. I never tee Mr. Blake that night at the bar. I stopped there till 25 minutes to 9, and never took the boots out of my pocket. I got sixpennyworth of eggs and was down at the canal at 6 minutes to 9. I got up next morning and went to my work. As to seeing John Barnett that night I did not. I was about seven yards from this man; he passed me and said nothing. They went to the foreman, and he said "You are wanted." He said "Did not you buy a pair of boots yesterday?" I said "Yes, two pair; one pair are on my feet and one pair are at home." Mr. Bowyer said "You will have to go to the police-station with me." I said "very well." They searched me, and I had three handkerchiefs on me. Mr. Blake took up the white one and said that he could not swear to it.</p>

He said "No." He went away for half an hour and came back with another policeman, called me into the taproom, and he said again "I cannot swear to him." On Wednesday evening at 11 o'clock I was at the police-station after all the public-houses were shut up, and they came and swore to me and said I was the man. I can swear I was at home at 5 minutes to 10 on 26th April, and as for seeing Henry Barnett I did not see him from 8 o'clock on Sunday evening.</p>

I hare been 2 years buyer in the fancy department of the Bon Marche at Brixton—I gave orders to the prisons to write tickets, which he did at home—this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of 29th December represents a genuine transaction—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the invoice for one gross of blue and gold tickets delivered before 29th December, 1879—on his presenting it I initialled it and wrote "twenty-five shillings" in words, which is my usual practice, and I then handed it back to Shien I—I have nothing to do with paying the money—I ordered no gross of blue and gold tickets after the 29th, nor did I ever get such a supply—these are the initials of my name on the order for 12 dozen blue and gold tickets, 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on 14th February, but they are not written by me or by my authority, and I never had the goods, or authorised Childs to present this for payment—I had not a gross of blue and gold tickets on 9th March—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my order, nor is this of February 5th for six dozen at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these initials are not written or authorised by me, nor did I order or receive the goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are fifteen departments and seven or eight assis<lb/>tants in each—I do not know whether Shiers wrote tickets for other departments—I know that other ticket-writers were employed—he did the greater part of the work—the system was the same with regard to the other departments—I was occasionally in the City making pur<lb/>chases—if the prisoner brought in his tickets in my absence I gave authority to the shop-walker or to the first man in the department to receive them, but he would not deliver them in my absence without a receipt—the person I left to act for me would sign them—I had about fifteen assistants in my department, but they had no authority to receive tickets in my absence; it has never been done to my knowledge—when sgned it was an authority to Shiers to take it to the cashier and recero the money—I have no record in any book of the tickets for which I gave orders—T gave him the orders by word of mouth, and sometimes on paper—we ticket a great many articles, but not all—I did not order 1 gross of tickets between 29th December and 14th February—I succeeded Mr. Tarbett; he gave the order of 29th December and I accepted it—I did not always write the amount of money that was to be paid scroti the tickets—Mr. Young is the buyer for four departments—I do not know of a dispute with him, or of his. saying that he had not received some tickets and it being found out subsequently that he had—when I signed the ticket on 29th December I told Shiers that the expenses in that department were so heavy for tickets that I would discontinue having an; written—he did not tell me that there were some further orders to come in—no complaint was made by my master to me that too many tickets had been ordered; I have heard nothing about it—I have given Mr. Redgrave authority to sign for tickets in my absence—I am also the head of two other departments—I have fifteen assistants in the three depart<lb/>ments—since December 9th I have ordered about two dozen tickets up to this date from Shiers for the three departments—I am away about three</p>

               <p>days a week, and then I gave Mr. Redgrave authority to sign for tickets if any were on order—other persons may have ordered tickets at Christ<lb/>mas time—I have personally ordered about fourteen dozen of tickets from all parties since 28th December up to the time the prisoner ceased to work—I speak from memory only—there is no date upon the invoices when they are initialled; the date is furnished by the prisoner's receipt—after he ceased to work for us I saw him in Brixton Road—his ¦father has a toy-shop next door to us—we do not "cut" one against the ¦other—I have not given orders in public-houses, or initialed them there. Re-examined. Mr. Sackey was called by the prisoner at the police-court as his witness—I said to the prisoner "As it was ordered it is only just to you that the tickets should be received, so bring them, and I will sign for them," and he brought in a gross of tickets—he did not say that there was an order outstanding then—when the order was given the department I was mentioned—I did not order more than 18 tickets of Shiers from 29th December up to the time of his ceasing to be ticket-writer—we discovered the forced signature on 10th March; I was not there on the 9th—I never received 288 tickets from him in the fancy department—Redgrave is shop—I walker; he is in a different grade from the other assistants—when my I assistants sign in my absence the tickets are sent back for me to counter—I aim—I was not there to see whether the money was parted with—Mr. Abdy was an assistant on 1st January; he has initialled 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the I ticket—I no not know whether the shopwalker's signature is sufficient for I the cashier without my countersigning—I never saw 28 dozen blue and I gold tickets delivered in the fancy department after 12th December, and they could not have been there without my knowing it—there is no rivalry between our establishment and the next shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAI</hi>. I did not tell the prisoner after this matter cropped up that I had found two or three gross of tickets I knew nothing about—I swear that a number of tickets were not found which the heads of the depart<lb/>ment knew nothing about—there is no foundation for the suggestion. John Davidson. I am a cashier at the Bon Marche; my office is on the ground-floor—it was the ordinary course for Shiers to bring me his account, and receive the money when it was signed by the buyer—I was not the cashier on 29th December, but I have the entry of 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid to Lawrence who acted up to February 28th—I saw this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the police-court—the other part of it has been lost—it has Shires's signature; he presented it, and I paid him 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believed that these were Mr. Marney's initials—I should have paid without the initials if it was signed by someone in the department—I should not have paid unless I had believed that these were Marney's genuine initials—I should expect the person signing to put his true initials and not Marney's—these initials are an imitation of Marney's—I allowed Marney the initials the next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Marney used not to come to me when he was going oat, and tell me to whom he had delegated his authority, but I knew who would take the responsibility in his absence—in all the departments if the head did not sign it the next would, and I should pay—he came with a voucher; he did not let them accumulate, and present two or three at once; I have only paid him three times, and he only presented one ticket at a time—the prisoner has been writing for the department ever since it was opened—Mr. Young is the head of my department—the prisoner did not apply to me for payment of some tickets delivered to Youngs—I am not</p>

               <p>aware of any particular Toucher from Mr. Young's department—I sent for Mr. Young to see if there were any tickets without his initials, and he said that these initials were not his, but he did not deny receiving I goods—I did not find out afterwards that Mr. Young was mistaken, and that he had received some tickets which he said that he had not received—I simply sent for the buyers as I suspected the whole thing was wrong and we went through all the vouchers for the last 12 months—I do not know that initialled pieces of paper were repeatedly sent back by the cashier because they were so illegible and so hurriedly initialled—I have never done it—we get a vast number of these in a year from ticket-writen—we file them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There are two persons in the fancy department whose initials I should countenance, Mr. Marney and Mr. Redgrave—we do not allow the office boy to initial—I only pay three times a week—I paid the prisoner on 8th March 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the fancy department, and I do not see any other entry in March up to the time of the forgery—I paid for ticket for the other departments.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief ledger-clerk at the Bon Marche—I acted as cashier till Davidson took my place—on 29th December Shires presented to me this genuine receipt and order, and I paid him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 14th February he presented me this order for 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and signed the receipt—it purports to be initialled by Marney—this order of 1st January, 1879, which is meant for 1880, is signed by Abdy, and counter-signed by Marney—I refused to accept Abdy'a signature, and required Marney's, but I should have accepted Mr. Redgrave's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been cashier about 10 months—it was my duty to pay the prisoner whenever he presented these pieces of paper—he had no particular day for coming, he was paid when the goods wen delivered—I do not know that the goods were sometimes delivered ween before he presented the tickets—I say that simply because the goods wen always paid for on delivery—if he handed me half a dozen tickets 1 should assume that all the goods were, delivered that day—I do not knot that it was his habit to keep a number of tickets and then present them—he had not an account with the firm, he was paid on delivery—he was a customer of ours, and had an account in our books—there are two counting-houses, one for paying and one for receiving, and had a notice been given to me I should have set off tickets, but I never did so—Mr. Marney has the habit of writing the amount in words, but I cannot say that the others have—I have paid a great many of Mr. Marney's tickets, but not always to Shiers—Shiers has also received money from a cashier named France in my absence—France would have the signature of the buyers.</p>

A. Hughes, upon it—I loaded it; with potatoes, which were on board the steamship—I left the barge at 6.30 and went to the wharf for orders—I returned to the barge and covered up the potatoes with tarpaulin—there were then 168 sacks in it I left it safe at 7.50—when I returned to the Plover next morning; between 7 and 8 o'clock the barge and contents were gone, and I gave information—the potatoes were in sacks similar to this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) they were marked with a star and. a C.</p>

I am one of the firm of Pettit and Co., wine and spirit merchants, 71, High Street, Borough—the business was purchased about five years ago—the prisoner has been in our employment since that time—for the last 18 months he has been in a higher capacity than previously—his duties were to call on customers to solicit orders, to collect account, to pay the money or cheque to the cashier next morning after he has received it—he had never been authorised to sign the name of our firm on Friday, 7th May, my cashier pointed out to me several over due accounts—one was that of Mr. Downton—the prisoner was present—the cashier said, "Mr. Downton has lost a deal of money lately"—the prisoner said, "Brock's, the firework people, owe him a deal of money, but the account will be paid almost immediately"—I called at Downton'i that same evening; I had a conversation with him—on the Saturday I went to my place of business about 5 o'clock—the prisoner was standing at the door—he asked to speak to me—he said, "I understand you hart been to Mr. Downton's; I hope you will have mercy on me," and he confessed to having taken several sums; he gave me a list—I never received this cheque from the prisoner—I never authorised him to sign the endorsement.
