               <p>' An unhappy gentlewoman, whose husband being ' under unavoidable misfortunes, was necessitated ' to be continually on the foot amongst ' her friends endeavouring to extricate him, was ' way-laid by a base and notorious villain, who, ' under pretence of assisting her husband, inveigled ' her into his power, and cruelly used and ravished ' her, for which he stands indicted these seven ' months past, ever since which he has absconded. ' But upon hearing that he was to be out-lawed, ' and that the poor woman was dangerously ill (as ' she has been for four months since this unhappy ' affair) he put the unhappy sufferers to great expences ' in attending several notices of his surrender ' to trial (at times that he was well assured ' that the poor woman was not able to fit up in her ' bed, much less to appear in court to try him) ' which expence, her sickness, and the loss of her ' husband's time, has rendered them objects of ' unutterable compassion. They therefore are indispensibly ' obliged thus most humbly to call upon ' the truly charitable and humane. to enable ' them to bring this vile offender to justice, who. ' from the strength of mercy, and the powerful ' friends that he (vile as he is) has to stand by ' him, boasts, that he'll get over this prosecution, ' which so loudly calls for the assistance of every ' virtuous lady, tender husband, and truly affectionate ' parent. This (now) unhappy couple, ' having nothing to back them in this melancholy ' prosecution, but the justness of their resentment, ' fear, that it is absolutely necessary for them to ' have proper council at the trial, to minutely examine ' his witnesses (as they are told he has a ' great many prepared) have it not in their present ' abilities to see council (as he too well knows and ' boasts of) unless charitably aided. as above requested; ' upon the strength of which, he proposes ' taking his trial next sessions at the Old ' Bailey which begins on Wednesday next, and ' has given notice to the prosecutor, that he will ' surrender in court that day.'</p>

               <p>And the preparing and printing the said advertisements relating to a prosecution for felony depending before this court, and endeavouring under the same to obtain donations for carrying on such prosecution, being a contempt of this court, and having a manifest tendency to the perversion of publick justice, it is therefore ordered by this court, that the printer of the said papers do personally attend this court to-morrow morning at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200004"/> ten o'clock, to shew cause why he should not be proceeded against for the aforesaid contempt and misdemeanor.</p>

             being sworn deposed, That on the 10th of June in the year 1756, she had been to Clifford-street, to wait upon a very good friend of her husband's and hers, to solicit his favour on her husband's behalf, where she met with great disappointment, and in coming back from thence she sat herself down as much distressed, in one of the chairs in the Green park, to rest herself. Mr. Morris the prisoner came up to her there, and asked her leave to sit down by her, and then said, Madam you seem to be greatly in trouble, and look to be more overwhelmed than a person of your years usually is, and I have often observed you as you have passed and repassed this way, that you always look'd melancholy; to which she answer'd, God help me, young as I am I have met with a large share of trouble, which is needless to acquaint you of who are a stranger to me; and then he asked her if she was married, and she said yes. Then he asked her if she had a bad husband, and she said she had as good a one as any woman had; he then entreated her to let him know the nature of her affairs, and told her he had a wife for whose misconduct he was obliged to part with her, after having had nineteen children by her, that he was then in morning for a relation or friend that had left his two daughters five thousand pounds each, and that he had an income of his own of five thousand pounds a year, and that as his inclinations were always exerted to relieve the unhappy, he beg'd of her to let him know her misfortunes;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200005"/> whereupon she told him that her husband had met with great misfortunes in life, and had been ruin'd by those he took to be his friends; and seeing Mr. Morris to be a grave man, and thinking him to be a person that heaven had sent to relieve her, she acquainted him with the slate of her husband's affairs, to which he said that he knew several people that she had mention'd, and the man that she charg'd as the occasion of her husband's misfortunes had drawn him (Mr. Morris) in for 100 l. and then he bid her be comforted, and that he would reward her expectations in every thing, and he then put his hand into his pocket and took thereout a moidore, which he gave her, and said, he was sorry he had no more money about him, but that as she often came backwards and forwards through the park, he should have an opportunity at noon or evening to see her again soon, and that she had set him upon a work that was a heaven upon earth to him. Soon after she parted from him, and went several times afterwards as her occasions called her that way, but did not see Mr. Morris again until she met him by chance passing along in Albemarle Meuse the 15th day of June, 1790, when he told her he was going to wait upon the lords of the admiralty and could not stay then, but desired her to meet him in the Green park at five that evening, when he would talk farther to her on the subject she had before spoke to him; that she went at five that evening into the Green-park, where she met Mr. Morris, and he then told her he had inquired into her husband's affairs, and found he was upon the duke of Grafton's lift, to be one of his majesty's messengers, and that he Mr. Morris had a great deal to say to her, and the Park not being a proper place to talk in, he desired she would go to a tavern with him, which she objected against; on which Mr. Morris said to her, do you think I would desire you to do an improper thing; no, I have children of my own, and if she thought a tavern an improper place to go to, he would go a little way in a coach with her out of town, and she unhappily consenting thereto, he ordered the coachman to drive to Marybone, in the way to which place she told him as high as she could what valuable things of her husband's were pledged and parted with, and he said he would take an account of them in writing, when they came to Marybone; and afterwards the coach stopped at the garden house tavern <placeName id="t17570420-1-crimeloc5">Marybone</placeName>

On which she told him she would perish by inches first, and thereupon he said the finest ladies in the land will do it, and that adultery was no sin in the eyes of the Almighty, it was only call'd so by the vulgar; that he pull'd her and teaz'd her all the time, and at last by force threw her on the carpet which was in the room, from which she got up again upon her knees, and beg'd and intreated him to let her go home, and that she would never mention the offence he had attempted to be guilty of, but would bear it in her own breast; then she got up and went to the door, which she found fasten'd, on which she went to the window in hopes to see somebody; that he then seized on her behind, and threw her on some chairs, and struck her head against some part of a chair, which stunn'd her, and then he committed the vile fact on her by force and against her will. As soon as she could get from him she told him she would bring him to justice, notwithstanding the distressed circumstances her husband was in. On which he said, have patience and compose yourself, and not go to expose yourself, as it would only gain her husband's displeasure; and that as no body was high or by to prove the fact, she would only ruin herself, and render him incapable of doing what he had promised on her husband's behalf: and he said he would do every thing according to his promise for her and her husband, and ten thousand times more, if she would but behave with discretion. To which she gave him no answer, but beg'd he would send her home; and as she said she was unable to pay for a coach, he carried her back along with him in a coach, and in the coach he repeated his promise over and over, and said he would make it ten thousand times more if she would keep what had happened to herself. That when she got home she told her husband she had seen the gentleman she had before told him of, and what he had said to her; and her husband very chearfully wrote out the list of his effects pawned. And as for several days after that she never heard from Mr. Morris, her husband said, as you do not hear from this gentleman, according to the promise you told me he had made, I'd have you write to him, which she accordingly did, and thereupon he promised to meet her, but did not; then she wrote a second time, but he did not meet her; but she afterwards seeing him he did her be easy for a few days, and afterwards again meeting with her he desired her to walk through the narrow passage into St. James's street with him, which she did, and when he got her into the passage being a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200006"/> lonely place, he there attempted to do what he had done at Marybone, but she got from him, and immediately went home and told her husband of all that happened.</p>



               <p>Q. Did you write those letters yourself?</p>

               <p>Answer. I wrote them from copies my husband first wrote.</p>

               <p>Q. Give an account of the contents of the first letter?</p>

               <p>Answer. I did not take a copy of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know it again when you see it?</p>

               <p>Answer. If I see the letter I can swear to my own hand.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the substance of the first letter?</p>

               <p>Answer. To appoint a time for Mr. Morris to meet me.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was this after you had been with him to Marybone?</p>

               <p>Answer. I can't tell to a day.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you to four or five ?</p>

               <p>Answer. No,</p>

               <p>Q. Can you tell when you sent the second letter?</p>

               <p>Answer. Not to a day.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you to four or five?</p>

               <p>Answer. No, it was but a few days distance.</p>

               <p>Court. It will be necessary for you in point of law to be a little more particular as to the assault on you by Mr. Morris, and what he did afterwards to you.</p>

               <p>Answer. I will answer any question.</p>

               <p>Court. She shall be asked in her cross examination.</p>

               <p>Council for Prisoner. We make no doubt of what an answer she will make.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before he came to you in the Green-park?</p>

               <p>Answer. As I have gone to Bond street I remember such a gentleman, but no farther, and I have met him in the Park with a couple of dogs.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your husband's employ?</p>

               <p>Answer. He did belong to the machine at Westminster Bridge, but does not now.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him you had been abused by Mr. Morris, in the way you have mention'd, when you came home from being at Marybone with Mr. Morris?</p>

               <p>Answer. No, Mr. Morris told me the great things he would do for my husband, and no body being near, high or by, when he did the act, I thought if I told my husband of it, it would ruin me for ever, and I chose rather to pine my life away, than to let my husband know of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Morris, the prisoner, tell you his name?</p>

               <p>Answer. He did, I did not know it before.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say his name was?</p>

               <p>Answer. He said he was colonel Morris; he told me also where he liv'd, and that he had an income of five thousand pounds a year, but from what I have heard since, it is not so.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you his christian name?</p>

               <p>Answer. No, he did not, he said he was a colonel in the guards, and by the directions he gave me I found him out.</p>

               <p>Q. On which letter did he meet you?</p>

               <p>Answer. The second, and bid me be easy for a few days.</p>

               <p>Q. from prisoner (he shews two letters and a cover) Are these your hand writing?</p>

               <p>Answer. These are my hand writing, and this is the cover, taking them into her hand.</p>

               <p>Then the prisoner shew'd her a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth, a seventh, an eighth, a ninth, all which she own'd to be her own hand-writing, and sent by her to the prisoner. They were read in court, and are as follows.</p>

               <p>When I had the favour of seeing you, you promised to see me the day following, and as I have not had that favour ever since, I am afraid you, good Sir, are displeased with me in some shape, which heaven forbid.

I am and shall be quite unhappy till I have the favour to speak to you, which I beg, for God's sake, you will let me have this morning; I shall<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200008"/> wait at the usual place, from the time this letter is left till 10 o'clock; my dear Sir, don't let me wait in vain.</p>

               <p>Answer. Upon my word I can't positively say how many times. I saw him two or three times.</p>

               <p>It was three times, and he proposed every time what he would do, and beg'd that I would not divulge any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. What were the favours he had done you?</p>

               <p>Answer. He gave me a moidore, and likewise went to the duke of Grafton to speak in the behalf of my husband, as he told me, and found my husband upon the list for a messenger, and recommended him also to the duke.</p>

            , being sworn sai d, That all the nine letters, as were produced, were every one of them originally wrote by him before he knew any thing of the fact, with which the prisoner now stands charged; that witness's wife told him how the prisoner had proposed to be a very good friend to witness, who thereupon said to his wife, take care my dear, and be upon your guard: As I was at that time confined at home, under the most unhappy circumstances in the world, and could not go out myself, my wife told me he (the prisoner) desired me to send him a list of what cloaths I had in pawn, which I did, and not hearing from him I said to her, I am surprised I don't hear from the gentleman, as you said he appeared to be a man of fortune.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever ask any body else about him?</p>

               <p>Answer. Not as I can recollect.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was this correspondence continued for it certainly must be between the 15th of June and the 13th of September, when the bill was found. When was the last letter wrote?</p>

               <p>Answer. They were all wrote near one another.</p>

               <p>Q. When did your wife make this discovery to you?</p>

               <p>Answer. I can't tell the day, but at that time I ran out and found him in the Park; I observed her in tears in bed before that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she go to see the prisoner with your consent?</p>

               <p>Answer. She did, and as soon as she came home she burst out into tears; I said, what is the matter? She said, '' Why will you send me to look like '' an object of charity, sitting in the Park.'' Upon my hearing this I went to the Park, and ran myself quite out of breath (I did not stay to hear whether he really had committed the fact) and by the description she had given me of the prisoner I found him.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever been with her in the Park?</p>

               <p>Answer. Yes, I had often; I said to the prisoner is your name Morris? yes, said he; I said my name is Shortney. He said I'll certainly do for you; you, you villain, said I, you do for me? you have ruined and undone me. What is the matter said he; on which I said, have not you ruined my wife? I desire no satisfaction of you, you have ruined and undone me; will you fight me?</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>

               <p>Answer. This was the very morning just after she told me what had happened.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was it?</p>

               <p>Answer. Upon my word I can't tell when it was.</p>

               <p>Q. How long might it be before the bill of indictment was found?</p>

               <p>Answer. I believe it might be about a month before, or something thereabouts.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you get a warrant before the bill of indictment was found?</p>

               <p>Answer. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did not you get the warrant first?</p>

               <p>Answer. I did not know what to do, I had no friend to apply to. I went to one Mr. Lee, and told him the affair. He said, he knew the man extremely well, he is a man of a bad character.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200010"/> Mr. Lee came to our house, and my wife told him every thing that passed. He call'd upon me one Sunday, and desired me to go as far as Marybone with him, which I did. He examined the servant of the house. The girl said she remembered the prisoner being there. Mr. Lee said, if he found it as she said, he would undertake it. He can swear what the girl said, for we suspect he'll deny being there; for he said to me, when I went to him, '' Upon '' my honour I never was in company with her '' in my life. No! not at Marybone said I; no, never in my life said he.</p>

               <p>Q. How many times after the 15th of June did your wife meet him with your privity ?</p>

               <p>Answer. Upon my word I cannot tell. I believe it may be fifteen times; very frequently.</p>



               <p>Q. from prisoner. Look at this letter, is the same, and the name your writing?</p>

               <p>Q. from prisoner. Here is another letter, pray look at that.</p>

               <p>Answer. (He takes it in his hand.) This is my hand-writing. Then the letters were read, and are as follow:</p>

               <p>LETTER I.</p>

               <p>SIR,</p>

               <p>I humbly hope, as you in your great goodness have been pleased, from the melancholy account you have given my wife leave to relate to you of our distresses, to aid us in the kind and charitable manner you have done, and have promised us your future aid (unheard of goodness and charity! to a degree that wants a name) that you will please to pardon my taking this unseemly liberty, for which I blush; but my wife has sent me word, that you are going out of town for some time, which indeed is the principal cause of my presuming this liberty. That the great God may pour down a succession of blessings on you, shall be my constant prayer whilst I breathe. At least this I am confident of, that your benevolence will not be unrewarded, and I am pleased with thinking that the providence of the Almighty has sufficient blessings in store for such unutterable goodness, and will discharge the obligation certainly, though it might not be pleasing to his Divine Will to make me the happy instrument in doing it. However, nothing in my power shall be wanting to shew my gratitude; I shall make it the business of my life to thank you, and to deserve your kind favour. As I have not the honour to be known to you, shall not presume to say farther of myself than this, that if I could be enabled to wait on you, and that you would be pleased to give me leave to do so, I flatter myself, you, good Sir, will find me deserving of bread, as indeed, Sir, there is nothing in my abilities, becoming a man, that I would not chearfully do for honest bread. Be pleased to believe me, that I am not an idle nor an indolent man, though I am, God help me, so much distressed, I have been living, or rather starving on promises, till I have been necessitated, to keep life and soul together, to leave myself destitute of even such apparel as entitles me to look after any sort of bread, and must now, with my poor wife, inevitably perish, unless immediately relieved; in short, words cannot tell our deplorable situation at this present juncture; upon the whole, as you, good Sir, in your wonted goodness have been pleased to give me such strong instances that you are a truly charitable and humane gentleman, I humbly make bold to lay our melancholy case before you, in hopes that you, in your great goodness, will be pleased to enable me to recover as much of my cloaths, as will enable me decently to go out of doors in, which indeed, good Sir, will prevent the immediate ruin of the most abject, the most grateful young couple under the canopy of heaven. I shall hope your kind answer, and am with all deference and respect,</p>

               <p>SIR,</p>

               <p>Your most obedient and most humble servant, T. SHORTNEY,</p>

               <p>Chapple-street, Westminster, opposite the Bluecoat-school, July 13, 1756.</p>

               <p>LETTER II.</p>

               <p>SIR,</p>

               <p>When I spoke to you Friday noon on the immediate knowledge of the cruel injury you have done me, under the pretended sanction of friendship, I then (God help me) could not talk coolly to you, as indeed how could I; O misery, misery, what have you exposed me to? Or can you ever expect to look your Maker in the face? - Without saying more, for I cannot now dwell upon the unhappy subject, if you will immediately enable me to dispose of what was most dear to me, that you cruel man have vilely forced from my arms, so that she may not become an open shame, and enable me to wast myself to some foreign isle, where I may struggle through the remainder of my life with some peace, for here I can never have any, I shall be satisfied to let the unhappy matter be buried in oblivion (this you know you ought in conscience to do, even if the law would not touch you, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200011"/> you will find it can, and that severely too) but if you will not, and that immediately on the receipt of this, I do assure you, you shall be prosecuted to the utmost rigour of the law, and a true state of the case made public, as the injury done me of course must be; don't feed yourself with fancies that you may laugh at the poor injured man because of his distresses in life, that you have so vilely taken advantage of; no, believe me, you shan't, you will find I shall have powerful friends to stand by me if necessary, to prosecute so unheard of piece of villainy. Be disposed to expend what what you will in law, you will find that the justness of my cause will weigh you down and expose your infamy, and the world will pity me.</p>

               <p>I have not open'd the matter to any one as yet, my lawyer will be in town this evening, till which time I shall be at home, and if you have a mind to accommodate the matter privately; I will see you calmly, provided you act with any necessary prudence; but, by all that is heavenly, if you suffer me to stir at all, nothing can or shall prevent my going to the utmost length to do myself justice. I will admit of no solicitor but yourself; I value my character, though in distressed circumstances, as much as any man under heaven, so that if this matter is the least exposed, which it will be tomorrow (unless you prevent it this day) I will never drop it till I have the satisfaction the law allows me; this you will find to be orthodox, and if you chuse to find it necessary to absent yourself, you will find it will stick to you as close as wax; notwithstanding, I tell you once more, Sir, that I will give you but this day to consider, and that I shall be at home till evening.</p>

               <p>The injured T. SHORTNEY.</p>

               <p>Monday Morn.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not your wife very frequently in the Park, soliciting alms?</p>

               <p>Answer. No, never; our circumstances were very poor, I very frequently sent her out, in order to get my cloaths out of pawn, and to get money from her friends, because I was in such unhappy circumstances.</p>

               <p>Q. from prisoner. What was you bred to?</p>

               <p>Answer. I serv'd my apprenticeship to a merchant.</p>

               <p>Q. from prisoner. How long have you been from Dublin?</p>

               <p>Answer. I believe about four years.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been married?</p>

               <p>Answer. Upwards of three years.</p>

               <p>Q. from prisoner. What do you mean by the machine at the New-bridge?</p>

               <p>Answer. I was concerned in the Dover and Canterbury machines, that came there about two years and a half ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you write the printed case produced in court?</p>

               <p>Answer. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you fix the precise number of times you understood your wife had met Mr. Morris ?</p>

               <p>Answer. It might be fifteen or twenty, or it might be a great many more.</p>

               <p>Q. How long after the 13th of July was the second letter wrote by you?</p>

               <p>Answer. It was a great distance of time after the first. I thought him my friend when I wrote the first; it was a day or two after I charg'd him with the fact in the Park.</p>

               <p>There being no other evidence against the prisoner, the court and the jury thought it needless for him to call witnesses to his character, and the jury without going out of court gave their verdict that the prisoner was <rs id="t17570420-1-verdict6" type="verdictDescription">
                     <interp inst="t17570420-1-verdict6" type="verdictCategory" value="notGuilty"/>
               not guilty
            </rs>; and after the finding the aforesaid verdict, the foreman of the jury told the court, that the jury apprehended the prosecution to be very iniquitous, and that the said 
               <persName id="t17570420-1-person44">

             had prostituted his wife to set up the said prosecution, and to try to get a sum of money, for the benefit of himself and her from the prisoner, and that the jury thought the said

            . I have known the prisoner about four or five months. I lost five gowns out of my shop on the 21st of March. I suspected him, he having been there between seven and eight o'clock that same day. I took him up on the Saturday following on suspicion, and charged him with taking them. He own'd he took them, and told me also where he had pawn'd them; and he went with me to the pawnbroker's, where we found them. This was on the 28th of March.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did they lie in your shop?</p>

               <p>Marr. On a shelf, about seven feet high. He shew'd us how he got at them, by laying his knee on the counter, and then reach'd them down.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he a servant in your house?</p>

               <p>Marr. No, he was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose property were they?</p>

               <p>Marr. One was mine; the silk one and linen one belong to

Then he told me he would let me have them if I would let him go; I promised him I'd be favourable. Then he went and took them from a place where he had hid them, so I went to give him a mug of ale for his honesty, and he took an opportunity, while I was stooping, to shove me on my face and get out at the door; I went after him, and took him.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar brought the things mention'd in the indictment to me this day fortnight, and the day after the last evidence came to inquire of me if I had bought such things. I told her I had.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>

               <p>Haygath. I am a founder.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you give her per lb?</p>

               <p>Haygath. I gave her 8 d per lb; they came to 2 s. and 3 d. (produced in court.)</p>

               <p>Q. to J. Anderson. Do you know these things, whose property are they?</p>

               <p>J. Anderson. They are the property of my mistress.</p>

               <p>Haygath. The prisoner told me she came from Mr. Smith, a saddler in Gray's Inn-Lane, who, she said, recommended her to me; it is old brass, fit for nothing but melting.</p>

            . I took a stewpan in pawn of the prisoner at the bar. I asked him if it was his own. He said it was, and that it cost him 17 s. 6 d.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he pawn it for?</p>

               <p>A. Rochfort. For five shillings. He said my boy knew him. I turn'd to the boy, and asked him if he did. He said he did, and that he was a customer of ours; it is the same stewpan that the prosecutor own'd.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of it?</p>

               <p>A. Rochfort. I believe it is worth more than the prosecutor has mention'd; it is quite a large stewpan.</p>

               <p>Fletcher. I do any thing for a living.</p>

               <p>Q. Are not there some dregs or scrapings of casks, that are the porters perquisites ?</p>

               <p>Fletcher. Yes, there are; that belongs to the wharfinger's men.</p>

               <p>James Dougen. I was a servant to the wharfinger between eight and nine years; there was a man came in the prisoner's place after he was turn'd out. I do not know his name, but we call him Francis.</p>

               <p>Dougen. I can't say when. On the 12th of March I helped to roll a vessel out of the way of the carts, near a door in Fresh-Wharf gateway. I went afterwards to see if it was safe, or not, and this

             was standing in the gateway. He said, '' This is a puncheon of melasses, and I'll load it away presently.'' I thought it was his perquisite. Sometimes we get a good deal of it, and are two or three months in gathering of it.</p>

               <p>Q. How much might there be of it?</p>

               <p>Dougen. About eight hundred and a half, or three quarters.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you sell it for?</p>

               <p>Dougen. For about twelve or thirteen shillings per hundred.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner left his place ?</p>

               <p>Dougen. I can't say how long.</p>

               <p>Q. What is that you call perquisites ?</p>

               <p>Dougen. It is the sugar that runs in the buildings, and our master gives us that for keeping the warehouse clean.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you once send the prisoner of an errand for you?</p>

               <p>Dougen. No, never.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you send him with a receipt of your's?</p>

               <p>Dougen. He desired me to make a receipt for him.</p>

               <p>Q. Who received the money?</p>

               <p>Dougen. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. What was that receipt for ?</p>

               <p>Dougen. He came and said to me, '' As you are '' a person in our service, and Mr. Featherstone '' knows me to be out of my duty, if you'll make '' the bill he will like it better:'' so I did it, as being of service to him to get the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not that for this puncheon ?</p>

               <p>Dougen. I don't know what puncheon it was for.</p>

               <p>Q. Who drew the bill of parcels, and wrote the receipt at bottom?</p>

               <p>Dougen. That was the bill which I wrote in my name, to serve the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. What was that bill for ?</p>

               <p>Dougen. It was for melasses.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, yourself, write it ?</p>

               <p>Dougen. No, it was wrote by a friend of mine: I can neither write nor read.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you no share of the money he received ?</p>

               <p>Dougen. He came to me, and gave me some of it.</p>

               <p>Q. How much did you receive of it?</p>

               <p>Dougen. I can't say positively how much.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not he bring you 5 l.?</p>

               <p>Dougen. No; he bid me take some off the table for making the bill.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>

               <p>Dougen. At the Bull, in Pudding-Lane.</p>

               <p>Q. How much was the receipt for?</p>

               <p>Dougen. For five pounds, nine or ten shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you give him a guinea on some consideration or other ?</p>

               <p>Dougen. No. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any more than a guinea of that money ?</p>

               <p>Dougen. He had the rest of it.</p>

               <p>Q Had you, or he, most of that money ?</p>

               <p>Dougen. I had not; but I don't know justly what I had.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Featherstone buy that puncheon of melasses ?</p>

               <p>Dougen. I really do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the puncheon full ?</p>

               <p>Dougen. I can't say whether it was full or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Supposing that full of melasses, what is the value ?</p>

               <p>Dougen. We have had about twelve or thirteen shillings per hundred weight.</p>

               <p>- Stoaks. I am a carmin: I carried that puncheon out of Fresh-Water gateway, to Mr. Featherstone's in the Minories.</p>

               <p>Q. Who call'd the cart ?</p>

               <p>Stoaks. I do not know who did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner when it was lo aded?</p>

               <p>Stoaks. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q Did you see Dougen, or Fletcher, there ?</p>

               <p>Stoaks. No; somebody call'd carman down the gateway, so I went down, and followed the cart.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you see when you came there?</p>

               <p>Stoaks. Nobody: I turn'd about and the puncheon was roll'd up the gateway, and then three men were there, and put it into my cart; they were up at the capstern.</p>

               <p>Q. Who gave you the order to carry it to Mr. Featherstone's ?</p>

               <p>Stoaks. While I was binding my cart Richard Perrin went up the gateway. I asked him where I was to go with it. He said into the Minories. Then I said I know where, for I have carried several there before; it is to Mr. Featherstone's. He said it is.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to ask the prisoner where to carry it?</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200017"/>Stoaks. I seeing him, asked him; I did not know that he was discharged.</p>

               <p>Q. What was in the vessel?</p>

               <p>Stoaks. I do not know; it was bung'd up.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a melasses puncheon?</p>

               <p>Q. Which pocket did she take your watch from?</p>

               <p>Day. From out of my coat pocket. After she had stole it, she took my stick and flung it away, and said, '' Why don't you go and take your stick?'' This was to hinder my taking the other. I carried Dwyre to the Round-house, in St. Margaret Church-Yard.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you find Morris?</p>

               <p>Day. She came accidentally along with two women to justice Fielding's. I knew her directly, and challeng'd her.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again?</p>

               <p>Day. No, I never did; she said she knew nothing of it.</p>

               <p>Bright Wilmot. I was constable of the night; the prosecutor brought

             to me, at St. Margaret's watch house, and charged me with her; I asked him what he charged her with; he said, he had lost his watch. I went to search her, and he said I need not, for another woman had ran away with the watch; then there came a man to me, who gave me an account of the other prisoner, I went and took her, and brought her and two other women one by one into the room, and he knew her at first sight.</p>

               <p>Dwyre's Defence.</p>



               <p>The prosecutor has been with me backwards and forwards in Horseferry-Road for above these twelve months past. He ordered me to come there to him that night. I went and said to him, will not you give me some money, as you promised me? I am now with child by him. He said, '' You bitch, if you follow me, I'll charge a constable '' with you.'' When he found I would not leave him he said, '' I put my watch into my coat '' pocket, and she has taken it out.''</p>

               <p>Q. to the constable. Did he seem to have known either of the prisoners before?</p>

               <p>Constable. No; he said that night he had never seen them before.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he sober?</p>

               <p>Constable. He was compos mentis, half in half, not very sober.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Dwyre talk as if she knew the prosecutor before?</p>

               <p>Constable. No, not a word of that sort.</p>

            . My father's name is Edward. I let the prisoner a ready furnish'd lodging, being a back garret up three pair of stairs, and he was to pay 20 d. per week. He took the things mention'd in the indictment out of the room.</p>

               <p>M. Rogers. No, I did not know when they were gone. When he pawned the coverlid, sheet and saucepan, I asked him about them, and he own'd it, and because his wife lay in my heart bled for them; but there was no consent of either my father or mother, nor me neither, and we did not take him up till after he had pawn'd the bed, which was some time after.</p>

            . I live with a pawnbroker. I stop'd this pair of shoes upon the prisoner, seeing a mark upon them, when she came to pawn them on the 1st of April. My master went the next morning to inform Mr. Kitchen of them.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she say to you about the shoes?</p>

               <p>Harrison. She said she bought them in Cranbourn-Alley.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prosecutor's mark ?</p>

               <p>Harrison. I did, and that he did not live in Cranbourn-Alley.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to know his mark ?</p>

               <p>Harrison. We have a book with every shoemaker's mark, and where they live. (Produced in court.)</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look upon these shoes.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I know these to be my property, which I lost that night; they are a pair particularly mark'd.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them brought home?</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you the workman that brought them home here?</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. No, I have not.</p>

I was within about twenty or thirty yards of her at the time. I had observed that the child had buckles on, but after that, the flaps of her shoes hung about, and the buckles were gone. I said to her, has the child no buckles? She said, no; then I followed them to Gray's-Inn-Lane, near where the child lived. When they came to Liquorpond-Street she said to the child, '' Stay here a little time and I'll bring you '' your buckles again presently.'' There was Mr. Page. I said to him, this person has stole the child's buckles, and desired he'd fetch her back again.</p>

               <p>Perkins. It liv'd in Gray's-Inn-Lane. Mr. Page brought her back again. She was charged with taking the buckles, but she denied it at first. Then she desired to go into a private room with Mr. Page, and I saw him come out, and he had the buckles in his hand.</p>

I heard her say to the child, if you'll stay here a little I'll come to you again presently. Perkins told me the woman that was gone away had rob'd the child of her buckles. I ask'd the child if she knew that woman, she said no. I ask'd her if she had got her buckles, she said yes. I went and brought the prisoner back, when the mother of the child was there, we took the prisoner into a house, she desired to speak with me alone. I went into a room with her, then she turn'd down her stockings, and took a silver buckle from out of each stocking, (produced in court.)</p>

               <p>Q. What was it worth?</p>

               <p>Jackson. Half a crown. The next morning a watchman came to me and asked me if I had lost such a thing, I told him I had, he desired me to go with him to the constable's house, I went and found it to be mine, they had sent the prisoner to Wood-street Compter. I went before the sitting alderman and swore to my kettle (produced in court and deposed to) I know not how it was taken away, I had seen it but a little before I miss'd it.</p>

            . I am a watchman; a little after two o'clock on St. David's day in the morning, I found the prisoner lying under a bulk in the Fleet Market. I pulled him out, he had got this tea kettle tied under his coat, which was taken from him in the watch-house; the constable examined him, he said he had it at Knightsbridge, and was to carry it to the Swan at Islington. I left him with the constable and went out on my duty.</p>

            . I am the constable, the tea kettle here produced I took from the prisoner, it was tied under his coat. I told him he must go to the Compter, then he said he'd tell the truth if I would go by myself, which I did; then he said he had been at the Saracen's-head on Snow-hill, and seeing the tea kettle in the tap-room, and nobody being there, he brought it away.</p>

            . I live with Messieurs Dean and Potinger.</p>

               <p>Q. In what capacity?</p>

               <p>Post. I serve them as shopman; on the 11th of March last, about five or six in the evening, the prisoner came into the prosecutors shop and asked me to shew her some blond lace, and I thereupon handed the drawer of blond lace before her, and she handled several pieces of lace which were in the drawer.</p>

               <p>Q. In what manner were the pieces done up?</p>

               <p>Post. They were rolled upon a card, and the prisoner asked me the price of several of the laces, and took some of them out of the drawer and looked at them, some times at one, and some times at another in each hand, and I told her the prices of several of them; she did not buy any, but convey'd out of the drawer two cards or pieces of lace that were therein, and I believe she had one piece of lace in her left hand, when she took the other two out of the drawer with her right hand; she laid the pieces of lace she took out of the drawer on the counter betwixt the drawer and herself.</p>



               <p>Q. How far was the drawer from the edge of the counter ?</p>

               <p>Post. I believe it might be about a foot; after that she sent herself as it were forward over the counter towards the drawer, and took hold on the drawer and drew it nearer to her, and then she brought up with her right hand one of those cards of lace, which she had laid on the counter, and conveyed it under her cardinal.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she continue in that same posture, or alter her position ?</p>

               <p>Post. She was bending then, and she bent up again and look'd me in the face, fearing (as I imagined) that I saw her; she then bent herself over the counter again, and pulled back her cardinal with her left hand, and then drew the piece of lace out with her right from under her cardinal, and laid it on the counter again betwixt herself and the drawer, from whence she had before taken it.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she say ?</p>

               <p>Post. She said nothing to me. After that she put her hand in the drawer and examined several pieces that were there, and passed some time away, but never offered to buy any laces that were in the drawer, and only asked the price of some she had examined; I told her the piece; then she bent herself over the counter again and took with her right hand the same piece of lace as she had before put down, and carried it with a quick motion under her cardinal, and put it as it were under her arm, and held it with her arm, and then she put her hand directly into the drawer, and taking hold of the first piece of lace that lay uppermost, she took it out and asked the price of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the same drawer ?</p>

               <p>Post. The same drawer. I told her the price was sixpence half-penny a yard; she then desired me to cut her off a yard, which I did; she then asked me for some striped ribbons.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this at the same time?</p>

               <p>Post. This was directly following it. I leaned back into the window, and took the first piece of ribbon there out of the window and shewed it her; she desired me to cut off a yard without asking the price of it. I did, and folded up the yard of blond-lace and the yard of ribbon together in one paper, and gave them into her hand; then she desired to know what these was to pay. I told her twelve-pence half-penny, that was six-pence half-penny for the yard of blond lace, and six-pence the ribbon,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200023"/> she paid me the same, and then went out of the shop, and as soon as she was gone out at the door I call'd to

He is a furrier of whom we buy muffs, and I desired them to step forward immediately, and told them what had happen'd and directly jumped over the counter, followed the prisoner, and overtook her about five doors from my masters, and got her back into my masters shop, by telling her she had left something in the shop, and as soon as I got her into the shop, I directly said to Mortimore, I charge this lady with taking a piece of lace; she directly said to me, Me with a piece of lace, I have not got any such thing, neither do I know any thing about it. I directly said you have, and there is no occasion for you to deny it, for the lace you have got; and then I turn'd back her cardinal, and found the lace hold between her body and her arm, (produced in court, the card of lace so took from her) and he described the manner in which she held it, putting his hand close to his body, and sticking the lower part of the lace between his arm and body, and deposed that he took the lace himself on the prisoner, and from between her body and arm under her cardinal, and gave it to the said

               <p>Q. Was it of that same sort of lace that she bought ?</p>

               <p>Post. No, of a different lace about half inch wide like what he produced in court, and the lace which the prisoner took was about an inch and three quarters wide.</p>

               <p>Q. What is that lace worth that you charge the prisoner with taking ?</p>

               <p>Post. It is worth about two shillings per yard to any shop-keeper in London.

             carried the lace up to Mr. Dean, and when he came down and the case was told to him, he sent for a constable, and charged the constable with the prisoner, and I left them and went forward to secure the box of lace that I had left upon the counter, and likewise the other card, that the prisoner had moved from the drawer, and laid on the counter, and then I left Mr. Dean and the prisoner talking together.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the prisoner ask for at first coming into the shop?</p>

               <p>Post. She asked for blond lace.</p>

               <p>Q. How many pieces might there be in the drawer?</p>

               <p>Post. I believe there might be between ten and twenty cards.</p>

               <p>Q. Is this a whole piece, and what is the length?</p>

               <p>Post. I believe it is, the pieces don't run in particular lengths, sometimes they contain more, sometimes less; I believe there was none cut off the card, but it was as my masters bought it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the end of it so as it is now ?</p>

               <p>Post. I believe it came to my masters so as this is.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any lace in that drawer of larger quantities than this?</p>

               <p>Post. I can't justly say whether there was or not; I believe there was some of this narrow lace that ran longer in length, and it might be more in bulk.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner had any other parcel with her when she came into the shop?</p>

               <p>Post. Not that I saw.</p>

               <p>Council. You say you imagine the person might think you saw her take the lace, and then she presently afterwards laid it down and took it up again?</p>

               <p>Post. I do so, and that when she saw I took no manner of notice of her first motion, she ventur'd to take the second resolution.</p>

               <p>Council. Then you imagine she saw herself detected in the first attempt, and after that took it up a second time ?</p>

               <p>Post. To be sure I do imagine she thought I saw her, or she would not have laid it down again.</p>

               <p>Q. Describe the manner of the first taking.</p>

               <p>Post. The first was done with a sort of a slide, and the second with a sudden jirk.</p>

               <p>Q. In what position was you at the time?</p>

               <p>Post. I was right before her all the time.</p>

               <p>Q. How did she put it down again ?</p>

               <p>Post. She drew her cardinal back with her left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200024"/> hand, and slid the card of lace on the counter with her right, and after she had examined several other cards of lace, then she put her right hand by the side of the drawer, and took the card of lace up again with a sudden jirk, and put it in under her cardinal.</p>

               <p>Q. How wide is your counter?</p>

               <p>Post. It is about a yard wide.</p>

               <p>Council. When you called her back, she came you say very readily ?</p>

               <p>Post. She did so.</p>

               <p>Q. What was done upon that ?</p>

               <p>Post. I immediately charged her with having the piece of lace.</p>

               <p>Q. How far had you followed her ?</p>

               <p>Post. About five ors from ours.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is your shop ?</p>

               <p>Post. It is in Cheapside.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go before her to your shop ?</p>

               <p>Post. No, I kept behind her, fearing she should drop the lace.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she hold the lace in her hand ?</p>

               <p>Post. No, the lace was not in her hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you always given the same account of this as now?</p>

               <p>Post. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you never a doubt whether you took the lace from out of her hand or from under her arm ?</p>

               <p>Post. No, I never had any doubt about it, I was always very positive that I took it from under her arm.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember when you was before the Lord-mayor ?</p>

               <p>Post. Yes, very well.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you then express any doubt whether you took it out of her hand or from under her arm?</p>

               <p>Post. No, I never was in any doubt at all about it; when the prisoner was asked by the Lord-mayor what she had to say for herself, her answer was, that the lace was in her hand. I directly contradicted her, and said it was underneath her cardinal. I was asked by some gentlemen there, whether her hand was under her cardinal or not. I said I was not positive to that.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you never asked the question, whether you took the lace out of her hand or not?</p>

               <p>Post. I was never asked that, or at least I did not understand it so.</p>

               <p>Q. When she came into the shop again with you, and before you took the card from her, what did she say?</p>

               <p>Post. She denied having it, saying she had not got it, and knew nothing of it.</p>

               <p>Q. After this did she tell you who she was, or desire to send for any acquaintance, or whether she had not been buying things at another shop?</p>

               <p>Post. I believe she did, but cannot positively say; I have heard she mention'd something of that kind to Mr. Dean when I was not in the fore shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not she say she denied with Mr. Belchier?</p>

               <p>Post. I believe she did.</p>

               <p>Q. Was her request of sending for any acquaintance absolutely denied her.</p>

               <p>Post. I can't say that it was absolutely denied her. I did not hear what answer Mr. Dean gave her.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Mrs. Dean and her daughter coming down stairs?</p>

               <p>Post. I remember Mrs. Dean's coming down, but as for a daughter she has none.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you swear you did not hear Mr. Dean deny her sending for any person living?</p>

               <p>Post. I can, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was in the shop at the time?</p>

               <p>Post. Mr. Mortimore and

               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying you can't say she was positively refused sending for any of her friends?</p>

               <p>Post. I can't be positive what answer Mr. Dean made her.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she say before the Lord-mayor?</p>

               <p>Post. She only said she had the lace in her hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she give no account how she came to have it in her hand?</p>

            . I live with Messieurs Dean and Potinger, I am employ'd principally as their rider. I was in the back part of their shop on the 11th of last month, a little after five in the afternoon, talking to

            . I heard Mr. Post say, Mr. Mortimore, pray step forward here, for there is a thief. I came to the door and look'd out, and saw Mr. Post speak to the lady, the prisoner, and she turn'd round, and he followed her very close; when they came into the shop, he said, Mr. Mortimore, this lady has stolen a card of blond lace, on which she said, I have no lace I'll assure you; he said don't deny it Madam, for you have it, then he drew back her cardinal, and there I saw the card of blond lace sticking between her arm and her body; he took it from her and look'd at it, and gave it to me; then I look'd at it, and saw it mark'd with my master's private mark, and the maker's name, T. E. or W. E. and it contained<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200025"/> ten yards. I asked her how she came to take the lace, she said she did not intend to take it. I said I would carry it up stairs to Mr. Dean, who would certainly send for a constable; on which she followed me to the bottom of the stairs, and said pray Sir don't, consider me, I never will offend in this way again. I afterwards went up stairs to Mr. Dean and told him the affair, who came down along with me and order'd me to go for a constable. I went to the Nag's Head tavern where the porters are, for Mr. King, a porter, to go for one, and came back and staid at the shop till the beadle of the ward came and took her into his custody, in order to carry her before the Lord-mayor, but I did not go with them to the Mansion-House.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you liv'd with the prosecutors?</p>

               <p>Mortimore. I have liv'd with them from the 30th of last June.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say when you mentioned sendin g for a constable?</p>

               <p>Mortimore. She said she never would offend in this way again.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember when Mr. Dean came down, whether she wanted to send for any of her friends?</p>

               <p>Mortimore. I do, she desir'd Mr. Dean would send for Mr. Ironside or Mr. Belchier, and she mention'd some friends, but I can't remember who. He told her he would not, but as the thing was so clear on her, he would carry her before the Lord-mayor, and she might send there for whom she would.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of Mrs. Dean and another lady coming down stairs?</p>

               <p>Mortimore. I do.</p>

               <p>Q. What did Mr. Dean say to them?</p>

               <p>Mortimore. The prisoner desired they would petition for her, and she never would do so again; the ladies did compassionate her, and Mr. Dean said to them, it is my business to look after this matter, and sent them up stairs.</p>

            . I am a porter. On the 11th of last month I was sent for by the last witness to call a constable. I went and brought one to Mr. Dean's shop; there was that lady (pointing to the prisoner) there, and I heard her say to Mr. Dean, pray Sir, I beg you would forgive me, for I never did such a thing before in my life.</p>

               <p>Humphry Ralph. I am about sixteen years of age. I live with Mess. Dean and Potinger, and I was in the shop on the 11th of March, but not when the lady was detected; I came in afterwards, there were Mr. Dean, Mr. Mortimore, Mr. Major, Mrs. Dean, and the ladies that were visiting at Mr. Dean's there, and Mr. Dean desired I would go for a constable, and as I was going out the lady, the prisoner, beg'd she might be forgiven, and said she never did such a thing before, and this she spoke several times.</p>

               <p>Q. What were the words she made use of?</p>

               <p>Ralph. She beg'd he would have compassion on her, and not send her away, and said she never did such a thing before.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear her say she had taken the card of lace by a mistake, before you heard her say those words?</p>

               <p>Ralph. I came in almost when she was going to be sent away; after she was committed to the constable I heard her say she had other things, and took it amongst them; but not at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear it said by Mr. Dean, or Mr. Potinger, that she had said she had taken it by mistake, as soon as she was charged with it?</p>

               <p>Ralph. I have heard it has been given out so, after she was charged with stealing it; but I did not hear her say so.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>

               <p>I am intirely innocent of any intention of stealing; I dined at Mr. Belchier's that day, from whence I went to Mr. Piggot's, and bought a pair of gloves for a lady; from thence I went to the prosecutor's shop, and bought a yard of ribbon for myself, and a yard of blond lace, which I paid for; there lay a great many pieces of lace upon the counter, and in taking up my things I took up the lace, for which I am prosecuted, inadvertently, and went out of the shop. I had not gone far before a man came and said I had left something behind me in the shop, and thereupon I went back and asked what it was; then he directly took the blond lace out of my hand, and charged me with having stolen it. It never was under my arm. I beg'd he would let me send for my friends, and they would testify to him who and what I was. This they would not permit, and I applied to a couple of ladies, which I have heard since were Mrs. Dean and her sister, and beg'd of them to ask Mr. Dean to do it; he said nothing should prevail upon him; then I beg'd of him to send for Mr. Piggot; they said they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200026"/> would send for nobody, but charged a constable with me, and carried me to the Mansion House, where my Lord-mayor not being at home, they carried me to Wood-street Compter. I had three other little parcels with me, a pair of gloves; a yard of ribbon, and a yard of blond lace, which were produced by her in court.</p>



               <p>Q. to Post. Had the prisoner two or three little parcels in her hand, which she laid on the counter while she was looking at the drawer of lace, that she had bought some where else?</p>

               <p>Post. I did not see one parcel; I am positive there was not one lying on the counter.</p>

               <p>Q. When you took her back had she any parcel in her hand?</p>

               <p>Post. No; I saw no parcel she had, during the whole time.</p>

               <p>Q. When you brought her back, did she say she took it inadvertently?</p>

               <p>Post. She said she did not know that she had it.</p>

               <p>Q. from a juryman. Might not the drawer be so high, between you and her, that it might cover a little parcel from your sight?</p>

               <p>Post. I am positive that I saw no parcel, and that there was none put by her on the counter. I saw the two pieces of lace that lay down between the drawer and herself, and if there had been the least parcel besides, I must have seen it.</p>

               <p>Q. How deep is the drawer?</p>

               <p>Post. I believe it not quite a foot deep, but near it.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Piggot, a haberdasher. He lives about a dozen or fourteen doors from Mess. Dean and Potinger. I remember the prisoner coming to our shop on a Friday in the afternoon, about five o'clock; I don't know the day of the month.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it the day you heard Mr. Potinger lost some blond lace?</p>

               <p>Hodges. It was the same day; she bought a pair of gloves, cost 13 d.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at these (which were produced ) are these the gloves she bought?</p>

               <p>Hodges. This is the sort of leather. I matched them to a pattern glove?</p>

               <p>Q. How were they folded when she took them away?</p>

               <p>Hodges. Just as they are now ( doubling them together.) She asked for some blond lace. I told her it was on the other side, but she said none would suit her. A gentleman's servant came in to buy a pair of gloves for a lady, and I went backwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing of her buying any ribbon?</p>

               <p>Hodges. No.</p>

             is in the Compter, she has been at a haberdasher's, and has bought some ribbon and a little piece of lace, and through a mistake she has taken away a piece that she did not buy, and they have charged a constable with her and sent her to the Compter. I desired him to go to Messieurs Dean and Potinger, and give my service, and tell them if they would be so kind as to release her from the Compter. I would be answerable for her appearing before any magistrate; he brought me word back they could not do it; then I sent to the Lord-mayor, and desired he would be so good as to send for her from the Compter, and hear what she was charged with that night, which he comply'd with. I was there when she was examined before the Lord-mayor, and heard her say she carry'd a piece of lace out in her hand which she did not pay for, and I particularly asked the first witness who was examined, whether he found it in her hand or not, to satisfy indeed my own mind, because if I thought her the least guilty I would not have appear'd here on her behalf. I said are you sure where you took this piece of lace from her, he said from under her cardinal; I ask'd was it in her hand or not, he stop'd; then I ask'd him was it under her cardinal or not, it was; did you take it from out of her hand or not, he said I can't tell upon my word whether it was or not. I then went away satisfied that her own story might be true. I have known her from a small infant.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your opinion of her?</p>

               <p>Belchier. I believe none can exceed her as to her integrity and honesty, and as to other things I believe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200027"/> she is very careless and negligent. I never had any reason to doubt her honesty.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think her capable of robbing people in the manner she has been charged ?</p>

               <p>Belchier. I do not, and from all the conversation I have had with Messieurs Dean and Potinger, I could never bring any thing to my mind to induce me to believe that she is guilty of what she is charged with.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear all the evidence given before the Lord-mayor?</p>

               <p>Belchier. I heard part of it, but not all. She did insist before his Lordship that she had taken it thro' inadvertency.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear all Post's evidence there ?</p>

               <p>Belchier. I did not, her excuse there was, that she said, God bless me, I have got it, and I did not know I took it.</p>

            . I was before the Lord-mayor, and heard the prisoner say, that when she went into the shop she had taken up a piece of blond lace by accident, or thro' inadvertency.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known her?</p>

               <p>Ironside. I believe I have known her ten or twelve years.</p>

               <p>Q. What is her general character?</p>

               <p>Ironside. She has always bore the character of a very honest sober girl, and from the character that she has borne, and from her behaviour that I have known, I do not think her capable of committing the fact laid to her charge. I am so far satisfied with her honesty, that I can't think she did this with intent to defraud. I heard Mr. Belchier ask Mr. Post the question, whether the prisoner had the lace in her hand, or whether it was conceal'd under her arm, and he said he could not tell whether it was or was not, that was his answer; he said it was under her cardinal.</p>

               <p>Neve. I have had two instances of it, one within these three months; one was a lady came into my shop and wanted a pair of silk mittins, I took some out of a drawer and shew'd her. I believe there might be seven or eight pair on the counter. She asked me the price of a pair, I fitted them on, and told her the price was four shillings or four and six-pence; she said can't you take no less, and paid me for them, and took them away. I thought she had taken no more; she return'd in about an hour after, I was in the shop, and said Sir, I have made a very great mistake, you remember I was here to buy a pair of mittins, and I have got two pair instead of one, and delivered one of them to me again.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think she is capable of doing such an act as is laid to her charge?</p>

               <p>Captain Best. I have known her between three and four years.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your opinion of her character?</p>

               <p>Best. She has been upon a visit at my house near four months at a time, and in that time I have trusted her with a considerable charge (when I was obliged to go down into the country) with my writings, bonds, money and every thing that I had in my house, and I believe at that time there might be above 1400 l. or near 1500 l in the house; when I came home I found every thing as I left them. She was mistress of my keys, and from what I know of her I verily believe I myself would be guilty of what she is charged with as soon as Miss Philips would. I know she is a little careless, it is a thing I have often told her of, in leaving things about in one place or another where she did not know afterwards to find them.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Ironside. I have known her fourteen or fifteen years, and during that time she has frequently been with me for several weeks together, and has behaved with great integrity and honesty, and I never heard any thing against her character, neither have I the least reason to believe any thing against it; she is a giddy girl, and I have often told her she would one time or other lose her things.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think she would be guilty of stealing the value of fifteen shillings intentionally?</p>

               <p>Mrs. Ironside. Nothing should have brought me before this court, if I had thought such things of her.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think her capable of stealing intentionally any thing to wrong any body?</p>

               <p>Mrs. Belchier. If I did I would not have come here. I know she bought my cousin a pair of gloves that day, which I ordered her to buy, and I paid her for them next morning. I think these are the gloves, which she has produced, they were folded up as they are now.</p>

               <p>Miss Belchier. I have known Miss Philips from a little girl, and have been very well acquainted with her these seven years; she has always bore an exceeding good character, or else I should not have appeared here on her behalf.</p>

On the 22d or 23d of February, the prisoner came to my shop, and said she had taken a house in Shoreditch and was going into the linen trade, and wanted to see some linen goods. I desired her to walk into the warehouse, which she did; I shewed her several pieces, which she laid by to the amount of I believe near 40 l. it began to grow dark; she said she wanted several things more, but as she could not see she would call next day; she went away and came in the afternoon about four o'clock the next day, and then bought other goods to I believe near the same value; then I asked her in what way the bill was to be made.

I did, and described her and the goods, she was then very big with child; about four or five days after one of Mr. Fielding's men call'd upon me; and said he had seen the goods, and in the afternoon of that day I was sent for to justice Fielding's; there was a pawnbroker with the goods.

               <p>P. Poupard. I really can't charge my memory with that, but on the 22d of February she brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200031"/> three pieces of lawn to me, and I lent her 3 l. upon them; she said they were her own. I did imagine she liv'd very near us, but did not know where; the next day she brought two pieces more. I then more particularly asked her how she came by them; she said her husband had taken them for a bad debt, and if he had not taken them he would have had nothing at all, and that he had taken in all eleven pieces. She asked me if it would suit me to buy them, saying she wanted a little money against she lay in. I bought them of her for 3 s. and 6 d. per yard, that was, the five pieces she had brought; she brought to the amount of ten pieces in all. I bought them all of her, the last I did not give quite so much for, the ten pieces cost me in the whole between 11 l. and 12 l. On the 3d of March being at Temple-Bar waiting for a gentleman, I took up a paper, and read an advertisement, in which I found the prisoner described and eleven pieces mentioned; then I went to justice Fielding, and found several of the pieces I had bought answer'd to the numbers. I took the pieces that night to the justice, and the justice told me all I had to do was to discover the person I bought them of. I was oblig'd to go out the next morning, and left word with my wife that if Mrs. Jones came, to call my servant down to stop her; about eleven o'clock she came to the door, my wife call'd her in and desired her to go backwards, and turn'd the key upon her, and set a servant to stand by her till I came home; when I came home I got a porter to my assistance and took her to justice Fielding's in a coach, but call'd at Mr. Fryer's going along, and told him I had detected the person that brought me the things.</p>

            . I was going on a Sunday, which was St. Thomas's Day, to Mr. Hughes's in the Borough, and I overtook the prisoner and her husband; they asked me to go to a church with them, to which I said it would do me no good; on which Mr. Walker said, yes it will, I'll make it worth your while. I think there was a charity sermon there that day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they give you any reason why they were to go to that particular church?</p>

               <p>Yates. They said it was to a church where a great many good people came, and they might do some business worth while there, and these were the words as well as I can remember which were spoke; accordingly I went with them, and it was to a church in Old Fish-street, and I remember we went by St. Paul's.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is that the church he mentions ?</p>

               <p>E. Riley. It is the same church.</p>

               <p>Yates. We stood the time of the sermon, and afterwards coming out, Mr. Walker and I were close together; he said to his wife, the person coming along here is a fine lady or a fine woman, she said Gammon.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she mean by that?</p>

               <p>Yates. That was for us to get before the lady, it is a cant term, made use of by pick pockets, and it meant that she should not go too fast while she took her watch; accordingly we got both before Mrs. Riley, and were just got out at the church door when the lady call'd out she had lost her watch; upon that Mrs. Walker the prisoner and I walked away directly as fast as we could to her house near Cripplegate Church, where she pulled out the watch she had taken, and which I saw before in her hand just after she had taken it away from Mrs. Riley, and I saw the chain hang down when she shew'd it me in the street just after she had taken it from Mrs. Riley at the church door; after she got home she put by the watch, and when Mr. Walker got home about an hour afterwards she embraced him, saying that she had got safe off, and asked him how he got away; on which he told her that he had been stop'd, but that on shewing his licence as an excise officer, and his pocket book with a bank note therein, he was discharged; and then she fetch'd the watch to shew him, and he look'd at it, and then I desired to see it in my hands, but he said no, we never suffer such things.</p>

            . I was at St. Nicholas Coleabby Church, and near Mrs. Riley when she came out of the church, and heard her cry out she had lost her watch; a gentleman by me, pointing to Mr. Walker, who was well dress'd, said that is the person that assisted in taking the watch, on which I ran up to him and charg'd him with taking it; he said he was not the person, he was a very honest man; whereupon I took him into an alehouse near the church, and he there said he was an excise-man, and shew'd me a bank note and a pocket book; I am sure the prisoner is the man, and I fixt upon him at first sight on seeing him here.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to discharge him?</p>

               <p>De Poutu. I thought by his genteel appearance, and a 20 l. bank note about him, he was not a pick pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there?</p>

               <p>De Poutu. I can't recollect her?</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular to occasion a crowd there that day?</p>

               <p>De Poutu. There was my Lord-mayor there that day at a charity sermon.</p>

               <p>Q. to Yates. Describe how you and Walker placed yourselves at the time the watch was taken?</p>

               <p>Yates. Mr. Walker was at the side of me, and Mrs. Walker behind me, but she and I were before her husband when he was laid hold of.</p>

               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence, but call'd to her character -</p>

               <p>Jam es Mackall. I have known the prisoner about a year, I have liv'd next door but one to her and her husband for that time, and I never knew any harm by her.</p>

               <p>Q. What way of life does she follow?</p>

               <p>Mackall. Really I can't give any account of that. I believe her husband deals sometimes in horses, and goes to horse races, and I believe he lets horses out.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>

               <p>Mackall. I am a peruke maker.</p>

            . I live in a court in Beech lane. On the 24th of March I lost a two dollar piece of Sweeden, and a four dollar piece of Sweeden, nine pound odd ounces, value better than nine shillings. I suspected the prisoner, by reason I had missed a piece before, and I missed it from the place where it was put; after he had been in it. I went in, from a mistrust, the other being lost. I sent my servant after him. He had the piece of copper on him at that time. I then charged him with the other, and he own'd to the taking it; I had seen it a quarter of an hour before.</p>

            . The prisoner Hall came to my master to borrow a basket. He pull'd the door to where the basket was, and never brought the key. Master went in and missed the copper. He sent me after him, and I brought him back with it.</p>

               <p>I had no design to take the copper away; it was in the basket. I was coming back with it.</p>

            . On the 30th of March Mr. Rogers, the Alesbury carrier, took my brother from helping me to load his waggon, and set Narroway the prisoner to help me to load it, in Saracen's Head Inn Yard, Snow Hill. The wife of Mr. James brought a parcel. I either gave it to Narroway, or bid him take it, while I went in to book it. I had put another parcel into a flat. and ordered him to put this to that; but instead of that he took them both, and has since confessed it. He had been employed there before. He was taken up the next day and carried before justice Willoughby, and there confessed he put it into his pocket.</p>

               <p>Mr. Robertson. I am a constable. On the 30th of March there came one Mr. Yeomans, a pewter buckle maker, about eight o'clock at night, who told me they were offered to me for sale. (He wanted me to weigh them.) I told him they were not finished, and I suspected they were stolen. He said the man was drinking in Ship-Alley. I went, and found the two prisoners there with Yeomans's servant. I enquired of Darby how he came by the buckles, who said he had found them that evening on Tower-Hill. Narroway said he was by and saw him pick them up. Then I told Darby he must go to prison. I had them lock'd up in the Tower Gaol, in Wellclose-Square; the next morning I had them before Sir

            . Last Friday the prisoner came to my house in Rosemary-lane, as I was opening my shop, and asked me to look at some things; there were a coat, waistcoat and banjan. I asked him the price, he said two guineas all together, but I did not buy them. In about half an hour after he was gone the prosecutor's servant came in a great hurry, and said his matter was ruin'd a person had stole his cloaths, and in the pocket of his coat was a pocket book, wherein were notes to the value of above two thousand pounds; by his describing the things I knew them to be the same, so went to look after the prisoner while the servant staid in my shop. I found him, and brought him back; we found the pocket book in his bosom, and three notes taken out of the book in three of his pockets. He offer'd me half a guinea to let him go. We sent directly to the prosecutor, who came and own'd all the things ( the goods produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

            . I am a japanner, and go to gentlemens houses to fetch shoes to black. I met the prisoner about 300 yards from the prosecutor's house on Friday morning last, he had a coat and waistcoat on his arm. I saw him take a large snuff box out of one of the coat pockets, and put it into the pocket of his own coat. Soon after the prosecutor came to my father, and said he was quite ruin'd, he had been rob'd of a coat, waistcoat, banjan and great coat. I asked what colour they were of, and he told me. I said I saw a man with such things going along by the church in St. Mary Axe. I went to look for him, and found he had been at the first shop in Rag fair, but they could not agree. I went towards East Smithfield, and in the mean time he was catch'd in Rag-fair</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him the first time you saw him that day?</p>

               <p>Lopps. I did; he had his shoes black'd at our house before that.</p>

               <p>I began about a fortnight ago to go about with old cloaths. On Friday morning there were two men call'd to me, to know if I would buy some cloaths, and wanted me to go into an alehouse. I said, what signifies going into an alehouse to spend money, I can buy them in the street. They asked me 40 s. I said I thought it was too much, but would give them 30 s. They took my money, and I put them directly over my arm and went to Rag-fair. I am as innocent as a child of a year old. I don't know the person I bought them of.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. He said when we took him he bought them of one Pocock, in Cock and Hoop Yard.</p>

I went and stay'd some time, but finding his daughter guilty of very mean actions I went away, and afterwards met with him in Shoreditch, when he desired me to come again. I went, and found his daughter had beat him. I have wash'd that old innocent face with water many a time. I being a poor woman could not subpaena people upon my trial. I wash'd his linen, but never wrong'd him in my life. His daughter frequently pawns things, and he told me she had pawn'd even his pewter spoons, and that he should be ruin'd if I did not come again. We went to a publick house, in order to have a pot of beer and a steak. She was in liquor, and got at the box iron; and after that she quarrel'd with me, a nd wanted more things to pledge I said, Hannah, you shall not. I took the short cut, thinking to have wash'd it with my own things, but fell asleep and could not wash it on the Sunday. I thought proper to leave this man. I saw the daughter, and follow'd her into a house, and said she was the woman I wanted. Said she, I want you. I went with her to their house, where he was in liquor. The son sent for an officer, who took the shirt out of my pocket I own, but there were hour enough for me to have made away with it, if I had been so minded.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200037"/>Martin. It is about a quarter of a mile distance.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how they came to be away from your master's.</p>

               <p>Martin. No, I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you liv'd there?</p>

               <p>Martin. Almost half a year.</p>

               <p>Q. What is Mr. Carter ?</p>

               <p>Martin. He is a mill-washer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live in his house?</p>

               <p>Martin. He did, but I can't be positive that he liv'd there when the horse was stole.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he go from Mr. Carter's ?</p>

               <p>Martin. I don't know.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Carter turn him away ?</p>

               <p>Martin. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Q. How came he to go away?</p>

               <p>Martin. I don't know.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he go away with his master's knowledge?</p>

               <p>Martin. I don't know that.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did he go away?</p>

               <p>Martin. I can't tell.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was it before or after the horse was reported to be stolen?</p>

               <p>Martin. Not above three or four days; he was at our house when Mr. Hill had taken up Mr. Tate.</p>

               <p>Q. Had not he been away?</p>

               <p>Martin. There was a young woman he used to go to see sometimes on nights.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he go away before or after the horse was stolen?</p>

               <p>Martin. It was after the horse was stolen; he was servant to my master at the time the horse was stolen, but I believe he had been out a night or two before, because he had lodgings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he lie at your master's the night between the 20th and 21st of January?</p>

               <p>Martin. I don't know that.</p>

               <p>Q. Where had this surcingle and saddle used to be kept?</p>

               <p>Martin. In our mills.</p>

               <p>Q. Could any body come at them?</p>

               <p>Martin. They might</p>

               <p>Q. Were they lock'd up in the night time?</p>

               <p>Martin. They were.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you miss them?</p>

               <p>Martin. We miss'd them the Saturday before he was missing; after that we heard he was on shipboard.</p>

               <p>Q. to W. Reynolds. Are this surcingle and saddle cloth the same your master bought of the prisoner when he bought the horse?</p>

               <p>Reynolds. They are the same.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>

               <p>I bought this horse at Tottenham for fifty-five shillings, I ask'd my master leave to go out that day. I came as far as Hackney back again, and there I had this surcingle and saddle cloth, which I had left there a day or two before. I rode from thence to Smithfield, and sold him to this man the same day; please to ask my mistress whether she knows that I was not at home that night.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What time did you miss the horse?</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I miss'd him about seven in the morning.</p>

            . The prisoner liv'd servant with me two years, he was a very good servant, and always took a great deal of care; I never heard any thing against his character, or that he lay a night out of the house while he was our servant; that night the prosecutor lost his horse I am very certain he was at home.</p>

               <p>Q. What day of the week was it?</p>

               <p>J. Carter. It was on a Thursday night in last January.</p>

               <p>Q. By what do you know he lay in your house that night ?</p>

               <p>J. Carter. Because I and a servant sat up that night with a child that was sick, I was awake all night and should have heard if any body went out.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was he at home in the evening ?</p>

               <p>J. Carter. He was at home before dark, I saw him betwixt eight and nine o'clock in the kitchen, we never sit up late; I saw him and Martin, another of my servants, go up stairs that night, they call'd in as they went by, to know how the child did, and I saw him the next morning between eight and nine at breakfast. I suppose he had been at his business in the mill before he came to breakfast, he was up before I came down.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear him go down stairs?</p>

               <p>J. Carter. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. How can you pretend to give an account of his being in your house all night, if you did not hear him come down in the morning?</p>

               <p>J. Carter. I suppose he got up when his master called him. I can't swear to these things.</p>

            . On the 2d of October last, as I was walking alone in St. James's Park, the prisoner came up to me and ask'd me my name, and where I liv'd. I told him I liv'd in Berkley-street. He said, I was a country girl, and ask'd me if I had dined, and I said I had.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him who you liv'd with?</p>

               <p>Streeter. No, I did not. He said if I would go along with him, his man should see me safe home, for as I was a country girl it would be very dangerous for me to walk alone, and therefore I went with him, and he had me to the sign of the Hercules over Westminster-bridge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you walk it?</p>

               <p>Streeter. We did.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is Berkley-Street, where you said you liv'd?</p>

               <p>Streeter. It is very near Piccadilly.</p>

               <p>Q. What past as you went to the Hercules ?</p>

               <p>Streeter. He talk'd to me how dangerous it was for me to walk alone, and how happy it was that I had fallen into such good hands; and when we came to the Hercules, he had a fry'd rabbit for dinner.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>

               <p>Streeter. Between three and four o'clock. I did not know but that was his home.</p>

               <p>Q. What past after you got there?</p>

               <p>Streeter. He was inquiring where I came from in the country, and where my friends were, and who I was with in town, and where; and he ask'd the drawer if his man was come from Greenwich, and finding he was not, he said he imagined he was gone home; and nothing else past till we went to his lodgings.</p>

               <p>Council. Then he did not pretend that the Hercules was his lodgings?</p>

               <p>Streeter. No. He took a coach between the Hercules and the bridge.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he carry you to?</p>

               <p>Streeter. I went with him to <placeName id="t17570420-42-crimeloc218">Rider-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. How do you know that was his lodgings?</p>

               <p>Streeter. He said so. When we came there he got out of the hackney coach and bid me sit till he went and knock'd at the door. He ask'd at the door whether his man was come home, and some body said no; then he bid me get out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go willingly with him into his lodgings?</p>

               <p>Streeter. Yes, I did. He said he would send his man home with me, and said it was a dangerous thing for me to be alone. He had me up one pair of stairs into a dining-room, and the maid came up with two candles, which she lighted and then went down.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you express any uneasiness that you wanted to be at home?</p>

               <p>Streeter. Yes; but he desired I'd make myself easy, for I was safe, and the minute the man came home he should go home with me.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did he come home?</p>

               <p>Streeter. I believe he came home about an hour after. He brought a letter and gave it to his master, and went out of the room directly; after that I desired him to let the man go home with me, and then he said by G - d I should not go.</p>

               <p>Q. What past after that?</p>

               <p>Streeter. He strip'd off all my cloaths, and I screamed and cried, so that any body might have heard me in the street.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you sitting or standing, when he began to pull your cloaths off?</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200043"/>Streeter. He took hold of my legs and pulled my shoes off, and set his knees against me so that I not power to get out of the chair; then he pulled all my cloaths off.</p>

               <p>Q. What pass'd after that?</p>

               <p>Streeter. I fainted away while he was undressing me, and he took me up in his arms and put me into bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Were all your cloaths off then?</p>

               <p>Streeter. Yes they were.</p>

               <p>Q. What past after that?</p>

               <p>Streeter. He brought something for me to smell to, for I was not able to speak. I did not know he had carried me to bed, but when I came to myself I found myself there, and he was standing by the bed-side, holding something for me to smell to.</p>

               <p>Q. What past after this?</p>

               <p>Streeter. He undress'd himself and got into bed.</p>

               <p>Q. What happened after that?</p>

               <p>Streeter. He had carnal knowledge of my body against my will and consent.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any resistance on this occasion?</p>

               <p>Streeter. I did, and scream'd out till I was quite gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body come to your assistance?</p>

               <p>Streeter. No, no-body.</p>

               <p>Q. What past after this?</p>

               <p>Streeter. After he had used me thus he rung the bell, and his man came; and he ordered the man to bring him something to drink, and to take care of my cloathes. I made a mourning noise but was not able to speak.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you attempt to get away from him then?</p>

               <p>Streeter. I was not able.</p>

               <p>Q. What was it he did to you at the time you say he had carnal knowledge of your body. You must tell particulars.</p>

               <p>Streeter. He hurt me very much. I found what he had in my body.</p>

               <p>Q. What was that?</p>

               <p>Streeter. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any arms?</p>

               <p>Streeter. There was a sword hung by the bedside.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing else?</p>

               <p>Streeter. There was a blunderbus by the closet-door. I sat down to breakfast with the prisoner, and drank two dishes of tea. I cry'd, and he ask'd me what I cry'd for, and put his hand into his pocket, and took out and gave me a guinea, which I laid down on the table and told him I did not want money, and I refused to take it three times; on which he told me, if I did not take it, I should not go home, and for that reason I took it; after that he let me go, and gave me directions to write to him by the name of Douglas, at the Cocoa-tree, Piccadilly.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take that direction?</p>

               <p>Streeter. I did, but I did not say I would write to him.</p>

               <p>Streeter. He did. He went before me, and when I came to the house I rap'd at the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was in the house in Berkley-street, when you lodged there?</p>

               <p>Streeter. 'Squire Ladd, he was not in town then, I saw Mrs. Fletcher as soon as I came in.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you acquaint her with what past?</p>

               <p>Streeter. No, because there were a great many people there, men and women. But I acquainted a Person with it that brought me to town, her name is Box; she was housekeeper to Mr. Ladd.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after you came in did you acquaint her with it?</p>

               <p>Q. What was that illness owing to?</p>

               <p>Streeter. To his usage. I went from Mr. Ladd's house.</p>

               <p>Q. What was your reason for going away?</p>

               <p>Streeter. Because the housekeeper left Mrs. Fletcher and me alone, and as the prisoner had said he would send his servant, I was afraid to stay in the house. I lay there on Sunday night, and went the next day, being Monday, to Mrs. Hatchet's.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you find out the person that had used you thus?</p>

               <p>Streeter. I found him out the next day.</p>

               <p>Q . What advice did Mrs. Box give you when you acquainted her of it at first?</p>

               <p>Streeter. I did not speak to her about it.</p>

               <p>Streeter. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether you did not tell Mrs. Box you had lain out all night with a woman?</p>

               <p>Streeter. The first opportunity I had I began telling her, which was about half an hour or an hour after I came into the house; when I first came in they all set at me to know where I had been.</p>

               <p>Q. How many were there of them?</p>

               <p>Streeter. Seven or eight of them, people in the house, and people besides. I told them I did not know where I had been, nor whom I had been with.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give no other answer?</p>

               <p>Streeter. No.</p>

               <p>Streeter. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>A. Fletcher. Mrs. Box said she was sleepy, and would go up and lie down. Mrs. Ellis said she would not go; so she went by herself.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>

               <p>A. Fletcher. This was about three o'clock, but I don't remember the particular day. It was on a Saturday.</p>

            . Mrs. Box came to my house on the second of October, at night, and told me Christian Streeter had been gone out to take a walk in the Park, and was not come home; and she was afraid some ill had come to her. I said, she is a pretty girl, and a sober girl. Yes, said she, a very sober girl, I brought her from her home, and she never was from home in her life before. In the morning before I was up, my husband came to my bed side, and told me that Mrs. Box was there, and begged of me to go into the Park, and inquire of the guards whether they heard any noise there. I did not come down soon enough, and she begged that Mr. Hatchet would go with Mr. Hutchinson to justice Fielding, and ask his advice. While they were concluding about it she came home, which was about one o'clock at noon.</p>

               <p>Q. On what day?</p>

               <p>J. Hatchet. On the Sunday. I went and drank tea with them, and observing the girl to sit in a vast deal of misery I said, if you have been with any body all night, you had better tell it. Mrs. Box said, if you have done a fault, you had better own it. Then tears ran out at her eyes, and she said to Mrs. Box, Madam, if you'll let me speak to you I should be obliged to you. They went together; after that Mrs. Box came in and said she wanted to write to Greenwich, and had no paper. She went to get a sheet of paper. Then the girl told her story, and it was so melancholly that I cried. The girl was in such an agony, I never saw any thing like it.</p>

               <p>Q. What was it she said?</p>

               <p>J. Hatchet. She said a gentleman met her in the Park, and asked her what country girl she was; she told him from Sussex; he said he had a servant that was a Sussex man, from Lewes, and asked her if she had no relations. She said none but one brother, who was with her father. He said may be you may know my servant, and if you'll go with me I'll take care that he shall see you home. So she went with him; he had a fryed rabbit, and he pressed her to eat some, but she would not. He poured out a glass of wine, and made her drink it. This was at the Hercules. Coming away he asked the drawer whether he had seen his man. When they got a little way, he called a coach, and they went to his lodgings; and that she sat in the coach, and heard him ask if his man was come home; somebody said no, he was not. Then he came out, and desired her to walk up stairs. She did, and after a while she began to grow uneasy. He told her as soon as his servant came in, he should go home with her. The servant came in with a letter. She said, he had said so much about young girls being in danger to walk alone, that she could have trusted herself with any body, and thinking this man a Lewes man, she said she thought she should be taken care of by him. When the prisoner had read the letter, she asked him if he'd let the man go home with her. He answered, '' by G - d she should not;'' and then he got his knees close to her, and pulled off her shoes and undressed her. I began to examine her out of compassion, and talked to her as much as I could. I have since lain with her on nights, and talked to her time after time. She is a stranger to me, but I found her always in one story. She said he undressed her, and she fainted away; so that her head lay quite on her shoulder. He took her in his arms, and carried her to bed; and when she came to recover, she found something at her nose, and he by the bed-side. He undressed himself, and got into bed. I being married asked particulars. She made it appear he lay with her, as much as is possible for a man to do. I examined her linen, and have kept it ever since. I did not find a vast deal upon it. but she said the sheets were bloody. I asked her whether it was not about her times; she said, that was about a fortnight before she came to London.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200048"/>Q. What did you judge by the appearance of her linen?</p>

               <p>J. Hatchet. I judged she was a very virtuous girl, and I dare say she was a virgin.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she always consistent in the relation she gave?</p>

               <p>J. Hatchet. She always was upon my oath. I have talked to her for an hour together; and after that I have gone up again, and told her she had said things that she had not said, to see if she would tell a story, because I knew nothing more of Lackey than I did of her; and I thought I was doing my duty as much as I could. She always said to me, Mrs. Hatchet, how could I say so. She always stuck to the story she first told. On the Sunday in the afternoon, after she told me the story, she said, Madam, the gentleman said he'll send his man by. If Mrs. Box should go to-morrow, I am not well, and if my father was to know, I am sure he would right me for being used so barbarously. The girl desired to come and live with me, and my husband gave her leave; and as I never had a good opinion of Mrs. Box, I for that reason invited her to come to our house. The girl was desirous to find Mr. Lackey out. I said to her, do you think you should know the house again on the other side of the bridge. She said, yes, I believe I could. We took a coach, and went to the Hercules. There stood a man at the door. The girl ticked me, and said, that was the drawer. We went in. I said, has there been a gentleman here, that was along with this gentlewoman, to inquire for a couple of women? He said, no. I asked at the bar if they knew that gentleman's name. The man and his wife could not make it out. Then I called for a gill of wine, and said, I'd stay till he came. The girl said, I am sure the drawer must know him, for he asked him whether his man was come. Then I called him in again, and mentioned that particular; and he said his name is Lackey, and he lives in Rider-street. I desired he'd give it me in writing, which he did. He said to me he was a good for nothing man, and had used him very ill; but bid us not to tell his name, fearing he should come to any hurt. I said I should let her father know it, and he might do as he would.</p>

               <p>Q. What was that person's name ?</p>

               <p>J. Hatchet. His name was 
               <persName id="t17570420-42-person452">

            , we went to subpoena him, and found that he was dead. He told me he looked at the girl, seeing her look with a country look, and was surprized seeing her with him, and fear'd he should hear a noise every moment, and said if he had he would have gone up to her assistance. I asked him if the girl eat any thing there. He said, no. From the Hercules we went cross the Park; and at the end of Rider-street, I asked where a gentleman, named Lackey, lived, and said he kept a man. I was told he lived at the house of Mrs. Cox, and was shewed it. I went with her five or six times to see if she could find the way she was carried to the Green-park, but she never could. She persisted she was carried a round-about way. She said she did not come out at the end of the street, which I carried her in at, which was the right way. We could not write to the father 'till Tuesday, and he was at our door about eight at night on the Thursday following.</p>

               <p>Q. Who wrote the letter?</p>

               <p>J. Hatchet. Mr. Hutchinson did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you inquire whether the gentleman was at home when you was there?</p>

               <p>J. Hatchet. No, I did not. I thought it better for the father to do that when he came to town. Mr. Hutchinson, her father, she, and I, went to Mr. Lackey's lodging in a hackney coach. We went all four into his room, and saw him there.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it the same person you now see at the bar?</p>

               <p>J. Hatchet. It was. His veins arose so prodigious high, and his voice was so he could hardly speak. Mr. Hutchinson said to the girl, is that the man? She answer'd yes; said he to him, do you know this girl? he said yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the girl mention any money to you?</p>

               <p>J. Hatchet. She said he gave her a guinea and she gave me it, and I gave it to Mr. Hutchinson, and he sealed it up, she gave me also the gloves; we went from thence home, and after dinner to Justice Welch's, and from thence to a constable that he recommended us to.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you charge Mr. Lackey with this offence, when you was there?</p>

               <p>J. Hatchet. No. I never spoke till I got upon stairs; then I said any body may see by your looks what you be.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he charged by any body?</p>

               <p>J. Hatchet. The father told him he ha d used a child of his very barbarously. Mr. Hutchinson said, don't let us stand thus, we have seen the man; that is enough.</p>

               <p>Q. What did Mr. Lackey say?</p>

               <p>J. Hatchet. He said she had been there, and he thought he had used her very well. The girl<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200049"/> was in such an agony, we were some time in getting her up stairs.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Q. How many times might you have seen the girl after this affair before she told you this story?</p>

               <p>J. Hatchet. I really can't say, whether I had seen her once or twice before she came one night with Mrs. Box to our house, and they ordered some beer; I don't know that I spoke to her then.</p>

               <p>Jos. Hutchinson. The Friday after the affair happened I went with her, her father, and Mrs. Hatchet, in a hackney coach, from Mrs. Hatchet's door to Mr. Lackey's lodging.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the person that kept the house where he lodged?</p>

               <p>Hutchinson. No, I did not. I do now: her name is Cox. When the coach stop'd at the door, I ordered the girl to sit at the corner of it, that she should not be observed, and bid her look out as carefully as she could at the person that opened the door. A servant opened the door. I asked him if Mr. Lackey was at home, he said yes. He desired I'd send up my name, I said my name was Hutchinson. He went up. I step'd back to the coach, and asked the girl if she knew that servant, she said that was the gentleman's man.</p>

               <p>Q. What was his name?</p>

               <p>Hutchinson. His name is 
               <persName id="t17570420-42-person453">
                  William

            . I got them all out of the coach, and up stairs as soon as I could: I met the servant upon the stairs, who bid me walk up. I jumped up very quick, fearing he might see the girl get out of the coach: when I got up, there stood Mr. Lackey. I stood close to him, and said nothing at all to him. The girl was a good while in getting up, being affrighted. I said, come along, come along. When he saw the girl he retreated into his room. I followed him, and took the girl by her left arm, and carry'd her within half a yard of him, and said, Sir, do you know this lady? he shook and fluttered a good deal, and said, Yes Sir I do, and I think I used her very well.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he appear to be in any degree of a fright or terrour?</p>

               <p>Hutchinson. He seemed to be apprehensive of some mischief coming to him, he seemed as much in a fright as ever I saw a man in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by fluttering ?</p>

               <p>Hutchinson. His speech was altered.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you accuse him with any thing?</p>

               <p>Hutchinson. I said no more. I accused him with nothing. Then I asked her again, if that was the man, she said yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the father say.</p>

               <p>Hutchinson. The father introduced himself thus: Sir, you have used a daughter of mine extremely ill. That was all I heard him say?</p>

               <p>Q. What answer did Mr. Lackey make to that?</p>

               <p>Hutchinson. I don't recollect: that was spoke before I spoke.</p>

               <p>Q. Then who was his answer given to?</p>

               <p>Hutchinson. That answer was given to me.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to have knowledge of this affair at first?</p>

               <p>Hutchinson. On the 3d of October Mr. Hatchet came to me and told me, Mrs. Box had brought a girl out of the country, and she had let her walk out alone, that she was lost, and they were in a deal of concern about it, and he wanted me to direct them in some method to go into the Park, and ask the officers and people of the guard, to know if she might be taken away by violence. In the evening I went over to Mr. Hatchet's house, and Mr. Hatchet told me, the poor girl that her husband told me of was come home, and treated very cruelly.</p>



               <p>Q. Did the prosecutrix give you any account of her treatment?</p>

               <p>Hutchinson. She did, the same she has now. I wrote to the father, and he came to town.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she give the same account before Mr. Welch as she has done in court?</p>

               <p>Hutchinson. She did, I heard the last examination, it was as near it as could be. Mr. Welch advised me to go to see for Mr. Lackey, I went and found he was absconded, and I could not hear where he was. I took a great deal of pains to find him out. The last account I had of him was, that he was in Holland.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this bill of indictment found?</p>

               <p>Hutchinson. It was found at Hicks's-hall in October last.</p>

            , I am acquainted with Mrs. Box. My girl was brought up intirely with me in the country, and was never in town before. Mrs. Box requested of me several times to let her come up before I consented. When I permitted her to come to town, she promised me to take care of her. My girl was well brought up and very modest, and never till lately in any body's company.</p>

               <p>Q. How old is she ?</p>

               <p>Q. When did you come to town?</p>

               <p>Streeter. I came to town the Thursday after this happened.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>

               <p>Streeter. I live at Stenying, in Sussex. I came directly upon receiving a letter; the morning after I came I endeavoured to find out the house where the prisoner lived: We went there. Mr. Hutchinson got out of the coach, and knocked at the door; a gentleman's servant came. Mr. Hutchinson asked if his master was at home, he said, yes. Mr. Hutchinson sent up his name. The servant returned, and asked him to go up. We got out of the coach, and followed him. Mr. Lackey asked the reason of our coming. I told him he had used a daughter of mine very ill: He said, he thought he had used her very well; he seemed very much affrighted upon our coming up stairs, and looked very pale; his words seemed to shake. We went all out of the room directly after Mr. Hutchinson, and asked the girl if that was the man, and she said, yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the same person ?</p>

               <p>Streeter. I believe he is.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>

               <p>On the second of October, about three in the afternoon, as I was coming along the Birdcage-walk, in the Park, I overtook this girl near Rosamond's-pond; she looked up to my face and laughed in a very light manner; at that time of the day (it is known very well ) people walk there with an intent to be picked up. I took her for such. I said will you go and dine; she said she had dined. I said will you give me your company. I was coming from Westminster, she turned back with me. I was ashamed to walk with her. She had no gloves on. She followed me 'till I came to the street that fronts the bridge. I went into a shop and gave her a pair of gloves; she thanked me. I believe the person of the shop will give an account of my behaviour and her's, to your lordship and the jury; so it is unnecessary for me to tell it. I asked her at the glove-shop, what sort of gloves she chose to have; the woman brought some, and she chose mittens; the woman drew them on and smiled; then we went to the Hercules tavern, I had what the girl mentioned for dinner, and two or three glasses of wine. I talked with her about whence she came, she told me. I found her what I imagined her to be. I asked her what was the cause of her coming out of the country; she said there was a young man that I was in love with, and he disappointed me; he slighted me, and I was ready to break my heart, so I came up to London to forget him. I said you'll probably have a lover here in town. I asked her if she would see a play; she said she would. I had her in my arms when the drawer came in, but I was dressed in a manner not fit to go with her. She went home with me. We took a coach pretty near the bridge. I handed her in; and when I came to my lodgings it was about the beginning of dusk, between six and seven. I was anxious to know whether my man was returned from Greenwich, where I had sent him. I was not polite enough to give her my hand, I forgot to hand her out of the coach, but left her there; she came out of it herself, and followed me in, and up stairs, knowing she had been some time in my company; I left her up stairs with the servant maid, and went down to talk to my land lady to put things in order for tea, and the maid carried up a couple of candles. When my servant came home, I told him here is a girl that came from Sussex, perhaps she is some relation of your's. She undressed herself, and I went into the bed-chamber; at the time she was undressing herself at the table in the dining-room there was I believe five-hundred pins. I said what do you do with all these; she said my gown pins on. I protest to God she was no more in a sit than I am now, as your lordship will find. After we had been some time in bed, I rung the bell, and ordered a negus; my man brought it up with a candle; and put it on a mahogany waiter. He stood by with the candle. I said, my dear, will you drink; she said no I thank you, I am not dry. In the morning we had a couple of muffins for breakfast; then she had her hair cut by my servant; I asked her which way she would have it cut, or in what fashion: she said, Sir, you are the best judge, cut it as you please. Afterwards I said, you are a pretty girl, and kissed her. I could not get her to stand away, from the glass. Then my music master came to play some tunes with me; I said, I beg you would excuse me this morning from practising in music. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200051"/> should have observed to your lordship before, that I said, Child I must not keep you here all night, if it is known Mrs. Cox will not like it, because I never did such a thing here. I rung the bell, and went down stairs; the man met me, I opened and shut the door, and said good night, I wish you well home my dear. This I did to deceive my landlady; here are gentlemen that visit me, who know it is impossible to talk with a tone of voice as I do now, but they may be heard. I gave her a guinea, which she thanked me for; she put it three times on the table, which shewed how fond she was of a guinea. The evidence that will come before your lordship, will make it insignificant for me to take up your time. I sent her home the direct way. There was a deal of stress laid on my taking her a round about way, and the like; I had keys for St. James's Park-place, and I ordered my man to carry her through that way, which was a great deal the nighest way to her home. I walked after her myself, and asked my servant at his return what she said, whether people would be affrighted at her being out all night; she said, no, they would not; she was familiar with me, and told me what cloaths she had, what gowns, what petticoats, and said, she would come to me again. My rooms are so situated, that had she made any noise at all my landlady must have heard her. When they came into my room to me, they came in a tumultuous manner, and said, '' I'll do for you,'' and Mrs. Hatchet said, '' I'll have you torn to pieces.'' I did not know what they might be provoked to swear; but I hope in the course of the evidence, the court will see there never was such a piece of iniquity as this.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner coming to your house with a young woman?</p>

               <p>D. Armitage. I believe I do.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see her last?</p>

               <p>D. Armitage. I saw her here when she gave her testimony. I can't be particular to the day, it might be about the second of October.</p>

               <p>Q. Which came in first?</p>

               <p>D. Armitage. Really I can't say that. I believe the young woman did. I was then at dinner. I believe it might be about three o'clock. I arose from my dinner, and the gentleman asked me if I sold gloves. I took down some mittens, and drew them on her hand, and he paid me for them.</p>

               <p>Q. How were they dressed?</p>

               <p>D. Armitage. I did not observe that. I did not make any great observation. I took him for a gentleman, but I did not take her for a gentlewoman. What she was I did not know.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she seem to be frighted?</p>

               <p>D. Armitage. No, she did not. He asked her, how she came to come without her gloves; and she said, she forgot them. They had no other conversation in the shop as I can remember.</p>

               <p>M. Head. I was in the dining-room, and heard somebody knock with a double knock. My mistress<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200052"/> opened the door. Mr. Lackey came in first; he came up stairs to me, and the young woman followed him up stairs immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. What rooms had he in your house?</p>

               <p>M. Head. He has got the first floor, a dining-room, and a lodging-room, and another higher up for his man. The first floor consists of those two rooms. He pulled off his sword, and laid it down on the table, then went down stairs, left me with the young woman.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was you with her alone?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any more of that young woman that night?</p>

               <p>M. Head. He desired I would shut the windows, and draw the curtains, which I did. Then he said pray go down and make the water boil for tea, which I did. I came up again in about half an hour, the door was open. Then he told me he could not make tea, his servant had the key; so there was no tea at all. I saw no more of the young woman that night.

               <p>R. Cox. I do; he was some time in my room, and asked me if I could think what was the reason his man was not come back.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Lackey after that, that night?</p>

               <p>R. Cox. No, I did not. I remember the servant coming home between seven and eight o'clock, his going into the room when the bell rung, and his coming for wine and water; there were some negus made.</p>

               <p>Q. You know what Mr. Lackey is charged with; if the young woman had screamed should not you or your maid-servant have heard it?</p>

               <p>R. Cox. I think I must, I am very wakeful, and if I hear a noise I get up.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to sleep that night, can you recollect ?</p>

               <p>R. Cox. I did not go to sleep soon that night, I was angry with my maid that she did not go up sooner, and I remember I heard Mr. Lackey's man go to bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear your maid go to bed?</p>

               <p>R. Cox. I did; she went to bed about half an hour after me. I believe Mr. Lackey's man and she went up soon after one another.</p>

               <p>Q. When you went to bed was you apprehensive there was any body in your house besides Mr. Lackey?</p>

               <p>R. Cox. No, I was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Who lodged in that apartment before him?</p>

               <p>R. Cox. Mr. Hubert did.</p>

               <p>Q. If there had been a screaming, must not you have heard it?</p>

               <p>R. Cox. If there had, I think it impossible but I must have heard it.</p>

               <p>Q. Who lodged with you besides Mr. Lackey at that time?</p>

               <p>R. Cox. I have no body but Mr. Hubert's son lodges with me now, and a gentleman, that is now in the country, who has been with me eleven years; there was no body in the house that night but my servant and I.</p>

               <p>William Ellis. I am Mr. Lackey's footman. I have lived with him almost four years. I remember being sent to Greenwich, on the second of October. I returned about eight at night. When I came home I knocked at the door, and Mrs. Cox's maid opened the door. I asked if my master was at home; she said, in the dining-room, and a gentlewoman with him. I went there and saw my master walking about, and the girl sitting in a chair, by the fire side. I delivered a letter to my master, the door was open; I might stay about five minutes in the room.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular ?</p>

               <p>Ellis. No, I went down, and went up again in about ten minutes; when he asked me if I delivered the letter to the person I carried it to. I said, no. He asked me whether I received the letter, and whether the person seemed to be in spirits. I said, yes. Then he asked me if I had any relations at Lewes, in Sussex. I said no. Then he said is not your name Ellis? I said, yes, and then went down stairs again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he mention that the lady was a Sussex woman?</p>

               <p>Ellis. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you in that room after that?</p>

               <p>Ellis. I was, three or four times</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any conversation between your master and the lady about supper ?</p>

               <p>Ellis. Between nine and ten o'clock he rung the bell, I went up and he asked her if she would have any supper, or drink any thing; she said, she did not choose any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not she signify she wanted to go home?</p>

               <p>Ellis. I did not hear any thing of that.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know else that past that night?</p>

               <p>Ellis. I heard my master's dining-room bell ring some time after ten o'clock; it might be half an hour past ten. I went up stairs into the bed-chamber, and I there saw my master and Miss Streeter in bed together</p>

               <p>Q. Was this before or after Mrs. Cox and her servant were gone to bed?</p>

               <p>Ellis. It was before my master bid me mix some wine, water, and sugar together, and bring it up to him. I went down stairs, and sent Mrs. Coxs maid for a lemon, and got some water and wine, and carried it up stairs. Master arose in the bed, and tasted it, and said it is very good, and said Miss will you drink with me. No, said she.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you heard any screaming before this?</p>

               <p>Ellis. No, I had not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe by her looks or anything hat she said, any uneasiness at her being there ?</p>

               <p>Ellis. None at all, she smiled at me, and I thought quite the reverse.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she speak faintly, or chearfully?</p>

               <p>Ellis. I thought quite chearfully.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them any more that night ?</p>

               <p>W. Ellis. No, not till next morning, when he rung the bell, I believe about eight o'clock. I went up and found master in the dining-room, alone.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200055"/>Q. Was you ordered by your master to take care of the young woman's cloaths?</p>

               <p>Ellis. No, I was not. I touched none of her cloaths.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>

               <p>Ellis. I am.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see her in a fit?</p>

               <p>Ellis. I know nothing of her being in a fit</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any tears in her eyes?</p>

               <p>Ellis. No.</p>

               <p>Q. No signs of grief?</p>

               <p>Ellis. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your master dressed when you went up?</p>

               <p>Ellis. He had his coat and waistcoat on loosely about him in the dining-room; he said, William are breakfast things ready, get them ready. went down stairs and got them ready, and about half an hour after that master rung the bell again; I went up and he was in the dining-room, and the bed-chamber door wide open; I got two muffins, he usually has one for his breakfast.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the lady then?</p>

               <p>Ellis. I did, I saw her in the bed chamber putting on her cloaths; he said put by the breakfast a little, for miss will have her hair cut. I brought my things up and cut her hair.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a barber?</p>

               <p>Ellis. I was bred a barber.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the lady submit to have her hair cut ?</p>

               <p>Ellis. She came out of the bed-chamber, sat down, and I cut it: I asked her how she would have it cut, she said just as I pleased: she took off her cap, which was loosely upon her head, and sat facing the glass: it took up half an hour to cut it I did it according to the best of my skill, in the fashion: she seemed very well pleased: master talked to her and kissed her once or twice, and stroke her over the face.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she express any thing of her liking it?</p>

               <p>Ellis. When I had pressed her hair she got up, (there were three glasses in the room) and went to a glass; master said, well, how do you like it miss'd very well she said. I cut a good deal off, and did it properly as it should be done.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she eat any mussin ?</p>

               <p>Ellis. They were both eat, I know not by whom: master hardly eats a whole one: he ordered me to take the things away, and I dressed him.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did she go away?</p>

               <p>Ellis. She went away about twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she put on her gloves on the Sunday morning?</p>

             when she came to town, about three weeks before this accident happened. I went several times in the Park with her: she asked me at dinner one Saturday to go into the Park with her, I said I would not.</p>

               <p>Q. What was your reason for that?</p>

               <p>S. Ellis. Because she had so many airs which made the gentlemen take notice of her. I said if I went with her, people would give me a bad character, and no body would take me into their service.</p>

               <p>Q. What were the airs you mean?</p>

               <p>S. Ellis. She wink'd and laugh'd at people that looked at her: she certainly did behave so, and Mrs Box and another woman heard me give that reason.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she say when you said you would not go?</p>

               <p>S. Ellis. She said she would go by herself.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>

               <p>S. Ellis. As nigh, as I can guess it was betwixt one and two o'clock; when we found she was missing we were very uneasy, we neither of us pulled off our cloths all night. As soon as it was light we both of us went into the Park, asked, everybody we saw, and described her dress to the pentinels, but no body gave us any account. She came home the next day, being Sunday, about the same time she went out the day before; I let her in. She saw me in a surprize. I shook when I let her in, and she said, Lord. what is the matter I said, are not you ashamed to stay out all night, to nefright Mrs. Box and me out of our wits. She said, what matter is it where I have been, here I am now. She went into the kitchen. Mrs. Box said to her, are not you dirty; she said no, she had not walked a great way, and pull'd up her coats to shew that she was not dirty. I said have you been in a bed; she said yes; I said with whom. she said with a woman. Mr. Hatchet said, don't be so harsh with her: My dear, if you have been misused confess it, and don't be afraid, we'll vindicate your cause: she said, no body has used me ill, far from it; then I went away. Coming in again, the lady at next door came for me to go and drink tea, and after that in my absence I was told she had confessed to Mrs. Box. I went up stairs where she was all alone. Some body knocked at the door; said she, Mrs. Box says it is a gentleman, but the gentleman that I have been with is more of a gentleman than he, for every button that he has got in his wastcoat cost twenty guineas. I looked at her and laughed, and said, do you think such a gentleman can mean you any good; she said, he means me no ill, but if Mrs. Box uses me ill, I'll go to him again. She asked me for a pen and ink, and said she'd write to the gentleman.</p>

               <p>Q. What gentleman did she mean?</p>

               <p>S. Ellis. The gentleman that she had lain with: I said as you are under Mrs. Box's jurisdiction let her do as she pleases; I'll have no hand in it. I said, how will you direct to him; she said, she would put it into the penny post; I said where will you find one, she said at the corner of every street there was one.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she tell you what the gentleman had given her?</p>

               <p>S. Ellis. She said nothing to me of that.</p>

               <p>Q. How came she out of the custody of Mrs. Box to go to Mrs. Hatchet ?</p>

               <p>S. Ellis. I don't know.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray, what kind of airs were those she made use of?</p>

               <p>S. Ellis. When any body look'd at her she'd look in their face; she said to me, don't you think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200057"/> it is very pretty to cock your eye at gentlemen that take notice of you.</p>

               <p>Q. Might not that be owing to simplicity?</p>

               <p>S. Ellis. It might for what I know.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was present at this conversation?</p>

               <p>S. Ellis. Mrs. Box, Mrs. Fletcher, and Mrs. Hatchet.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this after she had told you she had been in bed with a man?</p>

               <p>S. Ellis. It was. I found her undaunted, and went out of the room directly.</p>

               <p>Q. How was she to direct to the gentleman ?</p>

               <p>S. Ellis. I don't know.</p>

            's reason why she would not walk in the Park with her?</p>

               <p>A. Box. I did. She told her, she did not chuse to walk with her, searing people should take notice of her, and she should lose her character.</p>

               <p>Q. What had the girl done?</p>

               <p>A. Box. S. Ellis told her, that gentlemen took notice of her behaviour.</p>

               <p>Q. How did she behave?</p>

               <p>A. Box. I can't tell.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the girl go alone?</p>

               <p>A. Box. She did immediately. Whether she asked me to go with her I know not, but if she did, I denied her.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see her afterwards?</p>

               <p>A. Box. I never saw her after that, 'till about one the next day.</p>

               <p>A. Box. No, he was not at first, he came in afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she ever lain out a night before that?</p>

               <p>A. Box. No: we could not guess where she was gone. When she came home, I enquired of her where she had been? Her answer was, It was no matter where she had been, here is your pincushion.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she mean by that?</p>

               <p>A. Box. She heard me say the day before I wanted one. I asked her where she had been all right, and where she had lain? She told me, she had lain with a woman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she mention what woman?</p>

               <p>A. Box. No, she did not. I did not ask her any more questions at that time. I asked her if she was dirty; she pulled up her coats, and shewed me she was not, and said, she had not gone far. We went up stairs together; there I began to enquire where she had been. She sat down, and made no answer. I said again, Where have you been? She said, If you talk too much, I'll go again. I got up, and lock'd the door, and said she should not Then she went and sat down in the window. I again asked her where she had been; she said, What did that signify? Said I, Did you lie with a woman all night? She said, No. Did you lie with a man, said I ? She said, Yes. I said, Kitty. how could you do so? She said, she was bewitched. She asked me whether I would give her leave to write to him? I said, No. She asked whether I would give her leave to speak to his servant; and said he would come by the door. I don't remember she mentioned what time. I said, How will you write to the gentleman, and took hold of her pocket. Said she, It is not there. Then she took a paper out of her bosom, and gave it me; it had wrote upon it, To

               <p>Q. Did she shew you the guinea?</p>

               <p>A. Box. No, not just then. Mrs. Hatchet came, and she advised me to take the girl into the country to her friends, which I thought not proper, thinking her friends would wonder what was the matter. I intended to do it, but not in a hurry. Mrs. Hatchet desired I'd take a post-chaise next day, with pretence to take her to Greenwich, and so take her into the country. When I would not agree to that, then she desired me to leave the girl with her, which I agreed to. That night she gave me the guinea, and said the gentleman gave it her. Said I, And did you take it? She said, He threw it down on the table, and bid me take it. I asked, What answer did she make? She said, She made none, but refused it; and he threw it three times on the table, and bid her take it; and at last said, If that would not do, she should have more. I gave it her again the next day.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200058"/> When I came from Greenwich, I went to demand her, and they would not let her go with me. Mrs. Hatchet insisted upon letting her father know, if I took her out of the house.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Q. What was you in Mr. Lad's house?</p>

               <p>A. Box. I had been his housekeeper, tho'at that time I was not, but had leave to stay in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not the girl at any time tell you of any rudeness that was committed upon her by the prisoner?</p>

               <p>A. Box. Not as I remember. She told me no farther than this. - She was walking in the Park, the gentleman met with her, and they went from thence to the New Inn, on the other side Westminster-bridge; going along, as she had no gloves, the gentleman took her into a shop, and gave her a pair. At the New Inn he had a rabbet for dinner, and he drank to her three times, and they took a coach. I asked if they were coming home; she said she knew she was not coming home. He said, when they came to his lodgings his servant should come home with her. He took her out of the coach, and handed her up into his own room. The servant came home with a letter to him, and went down stairs. He took and undress'd her, taking every thing out of her cloaths, even the buckles out of her shoes; and she cried and sereamed murder very much.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not she ask you your advice what was proper to be done on this occasion ?</p>

               <p>A. Box. No, she did not, but begged for God's sake her father might not know of it, for he would be the death of her. She asked me for no assistance, only to hide it from her parents.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know one Grissith of Steyning?</p>

               <p>A. Box. Yes, I do.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever write any letter to him, or shew him one?</p>

               <p>A. Box. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In that letter did you mention Mr. Lackey's offering any sum of money for a compromise?</p>

               <p>A. Box. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How much money was he to give for the compromise?</p>

               <p>A. Box. I think a hundred, or a hundred and fifty pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she not tell you, that after she was in bed she was ravished against her will and consent?</p>

               <p>A. Box. She did not mention any thing of it to me. She said, he unpin'd her cloaths, and put her to bed against her will, and after that got into the bed to her; that she cried and screamed out murder, and was so hoarse that she could not speak.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say she cried and scream'd before she was in bed, or after ?</p>

               <p>A. Box. I really can't say whether she said it was before or after.</p>

               <p>Council. You said he put her into bed against her will.</p>

               <p>A. Box. I imagine so; by her talking of screaming and crying, it was so.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was this sum of money to have been paid to, for compromising this affair?</p>

               <p>A. Box. I really can't say who it was to be paid to. The coachman that was in the house where I lived, was asked by a gentleman where he went, who he last lived with; he told him: the gentleman asked him if he knew any thing of this affair; he said, No. The gentleman told him he heard Mr. Lackey wanted to give so much money to compromise it. This he told me, and I put it into the letter.</p>

               <p>Q. Have not you told this to several people?</p>

               <p>A. Box. I don't know but that I have.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you ever offered any sum of money by any person for your giving evidence on this affair ?</p>

               <p>A. Box. No, never in my life.</p>

               <p>Council. Nor no promise at all?</p>

               <p>A. Box. No.</p>

               <p>Council for the Prisoner. When was it that the girl told you of having screamed out? Was that her first story?</p>

               <p>A. Box. This was in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Q. When? before or after she had seen Mrs. Hatchet?</p>

               <p>A. Box. I am not certain.</p>

               <p>Council for the Prisoner. What authority had you to write any letter at all of their offering a hundred, or a hundred and fifty pounds?</p>

               <p>A. Box. I don't know that I had any at all.</p>

               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Where does that coachman live now?</p>

               <p>A. Box. He lives now with the duke of Leeds.</p>

               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Was it any body that belong'd to Mr. Lackey?</p>

               <p>A. Box. No.</p>

               <p>Council for the Prisoner. How came you to write this letter?</p>

               <p>A. Box. I wrote it to a friend of mine, that it might come round to the girl's friends, and they might have it.</p>

               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Did you ever see Mr. Lackey before?</p>

               <p>A. Box. No, I never did in my life. I don't know him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200059"/>Council for the Prisoner. Did any body ever hint to you to give false evidence?</p>

               <p>A. Box. No, nobody.</p>

               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Have you any expectation from giving evidence in any shape whatsoever?</p>

               <p>A. Box. No, I have not</p>

               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Did the prosecutrix, (when she owned she had been in bed with a gentleman that night ) tell you those circumstances of going over the new bridge, and buying a pair of gloves, and then going to his lodgings?</p>

               <p>A. Box. She told me all that I have said at that time.</p>

               <p>To the Character of Mrs. Cox.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hubert. I know Mrs. Cox extremely well, I have lodged at her house four years last past, at times, when I came to town for a month or six weeks together, with my wife and daughter with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you take it to be a sober house?</p>

               <p>Hubert. I certainly did, or I had not suffered my wife and daughter to come there.</p>

               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>

               <p>A.. I apprehend him to be a gentleman, and one who has always behaved himself well.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you look upon him to be a man of honour?</p>

            , Esq; I have known the prisoner for ten years, and I think him utterly incapable of committing such an action as he has been charged with.</p>

               <p>Sir Crisp Gaycoyne. My acquaintance with the prisoner was throught my son. He has often come to my house with and without my son, and always behaved as a man of honour, and with great decency; and I always esteemed him and behaved him to be a man of honour and character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alderman Blakiston. I have known the prisoner thirteen or fourteen years, and always looked upon him to be a gentleman of as much honour as any I ever knew in my life.</p>

               <p>Bamber Gascoyne, Esq; I have known the prisoner ever since I can remember, and I do not think he would do any thing to corrupt a lady morals or virtue.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know he gave it to his mother?</p>

               <p>Jennings. She was in the tap room at the time, and was gone before that was missed. I went there the next morning, but we could hear nothing of it. Some time after that, a little boy, that is here to give evidence, was taken up in the Borough for stealing other things, and he said he could give an account of this mug. We took him before the sitting alderman, and he told us the boy at the bar took it, and gave it to the other person, his mother, and she went away with it. Then we took the two prisoners up, but they both denied it.</p>

               <p>Trotter. I was just come from Mr. White, my master, and was waiting for my mother coming from work to me. Mrs. Knight was gone to the other end of the town, and Mr. Jennings was in the house; he went down into the cellar. The boy that is at the bar went to take the silver mug from the bar; he took and rinsed it in the water-tub, and then he gave it to his mother (the woman at the bar).</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see this?</p>

               <p>Trotter. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the house was his mother?</p>

               <p>Trotter. She was in the middle box on the right hand side. She called me to her, and bid me say nothing of it; and said, she would give me something the next day.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>

               <p>Trotter. This was in December last.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to be here to give evidence?</p>

               <p>Trotter. I was taken up on the other side the water, about a metal watch, and then I discovered this.</p>

               <p>Q. How long is it ago since you discovered this?</p>

               <p>Trotter. It is about a month or six weeks ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the woman take the mug away?</p>

               <p>Trotter. I saw her go out of the house with it, as soon as Mr. Jennings came up and went into the other room. She called him, and paid him for a pint of beer she had had; then she had the mug under her apron, and went out directly.</p>

I said it was not fair play, and desired them to help me up, and let me know what they wanted, and if I had any thing that they wanted they should have it; then he knock'd me down, clapped his hand to my mouth, and said d - n your soul if you speak a word I'll cut your throat, and at the same time cut me along the side of my face on my cheek with a hanger, which was visible to be seen for several days; one of them pulled my watch from my fob.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it?</p>

               <p>Scott. It was a silver watch. Another put his hand into my right side pocket, and took out 17 s. and sixpence and a single farthing; then they went away. As soon as they were out of sight I went to Kensington to a public-house, and took a man with me and went to the guard-room, and had the rolls called over; the first regiment were upon duty there. I knew it could not be any of them by their cloaths, for I had taken particular notice of the trimmings of their cloaths, and found they belonged to the second regiment. I went the next morning being Monday to justice Fielding, and made information of the thing, and also to Mr. Legrand in Spring Gardens; the next Saturday Mr. Legrand sent me word to be at his house on the Sunday morning. I went to the Savoy with capt. Devenant, and there I saw all the three prisoners; one of them, I think it was John Green, own'd they had stopped a man at that very time and in that very place but did not know it was me, and that he took a particular half-crown wrap'd up in a piece of paper, which he said he changed at a cook's shop, I think in St. Martin's Court, and that he said was all he had.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>

               <p>Scott. There was snow fell now and then, and it was moonlight.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you by that dissinguish any of their faces?</p>

               <p>Scott. Not so as I would have sworn to any of them, if they had not own'd it in the Savoy; I should have been very loth to have done it.</p>

               <p>Q. Had they any accoutrements about them?</p>

               <p>Scott. No, they had regimental cloaths on and but one hanger, and when I saw them in the Savoy they had the same regimentals on.</p>



               <p>Q. Did you ever see that half crown again?</p>

               <p>Scott. No, I did not; when they were before justice fielding my watch was taken out of Search's pocket.</p>

               <p>Search. It was not taken out of my pocket, I delivered it up.</p>

               <p>Q. Which do you think it was that knock'd you down ?</p>

               <p>Scott. I believe it was Search, but I will not be positive.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200063"/>Q. How do you distinguish the second regiment from the first ?</p>

               <p>Scott. They differ in their pockets.</p>

               <p>Nathaniel Hill Stretton. Search delivered this watch to me at justice Fielding's (producing one) and said that was the watch.</p>

               <p>Scott. This is the watch I was robbed of that night, my property.</p>

               <p>Q. to Stretton. How came you to be at justice Fieldings?</p>

               <p>Stretton. I am servant to Mr. Akerman, and I went with the prisoners in order for them to be examined there.</p>

            . I am a serjeant in the Cold-stream regiment to which the three prisoners belonged; there was a letter dated March 9th, signed Fielding, brought to the office belonging to that regiment, setting forth several robberies committed about town by soldiers or persons in soldiers cloathing, and desiring the commanding officers would do their best endeavour to find them out; accordingly my commanding officer gave me orders to do what I could in observing who wore watches, or who had more money than usual; after that my comrade telling me he had a suspicion of

            , we went to him and told him he was suspected of several robberies, and if he would impeach it probably might save his life; accordingly he did, before capt. Devenant. I also heard John Green say before the capt. and the prosecutor, he had been importuned by

               <p>Q. How did he describe the prosecutor?</p>

               <p>Benning. He said it was a man that they had stopped in the fields between Kensington and Brumpton.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say when?</p>

               <p>Benning. I think it was on the 14th or 15th of March that he told me this, but he did not tell me at what time it was done as I can recollect.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this confession made?</p>

               <p>Benning. It was in a room in the Savoy; since I have known Green I never knew him brought before a court-martial, or guilty of any ill, but always took him to be an honest man.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Akerman the keeper of Newgate. I went along with the prisoners to justice Fielding, who ordered us to search them. Search pulled out a watch from his waistcoat pocket and delivered it to my fellow servant Stretton; the prosecuter own'd it, but said his seal was not on it. Search said he would deliver the seal to me, and a day or two after that I went up into the goal and he delivered it to me; produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor to be the same that was on his watch when taken from him.</p>

            . I and the three prisoners at the bar met the prosecutrix and this last witness in Pancras-fields; on this side Pancras I attacked her, and the three prisoners attack'd the gentleman.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any agreement with you before this?</p>

               <p>Randall. There was. I took her bundle from her</p>

               <p>Q. What did you say to her?</p>

               <p>Randall. I don't know whether I spoke to her or not, only asked her for her bundle.</p>

               <p>Q. How far were you, at that time, from the three prisoners?</p>

               <p>Randall. We were close together. After we had got his gun, watch and buckles, and her bundle, we all ran away over the fields homewards. We came into London from towards Marybone way, but I can't say the name of the street; I parted with them, and went to my quarters. The next day we all found one another. Green sold the shoes in Thieving lane for a shilling.</p>

               <p>Q. How came he by them out of the bundle that you took?</p>

               <p>Randall. I carried them to him the next morning, and kept the other things in my quarters, and when I was before Mr. Fielding I told them they were in my knap lack, hanging up against the wall.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you meet before you set out that night?</p>

               <p>Randall. We met at the Plumb of Feathers in Charles's-Court, by Hungerford-Market, and from thence set out all together.</p>

               <p>Q. from Green. Whether he did not tell me these were a pair of shoes he had of a maid he had lain with all night, and she gave them him to sell to get him money for a breakfast ?</p>

               <p>Randall. I did not tell him any such thing; he knew I took them from the woman, and asked me what was in the handkerchief. I did not open it, but they felt about it, and found there was a pair of shoes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you ever in this court before?</p>

               <p>Randall. No, never.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not you once concerned in a robbery near Turnham Green. about four years ago, and admitted an evidence?</p>

               <p>Randall. I impeached two men, but they never were taken.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe how they were dressed?</p>

               <p>Ellis. They were in soldiers cloaths. I past them. One of them turn'd again, and said if I made any resistance they would run me through, and began to rifle my pockets. The others were close by, one behind and the other before me; but neither of them did any thing to me.</p>

               <p>Q. What did that person take from you?</p>

               <p>Ellis. He took a silver watch, a half guinea in gold, and one shilling and six-pence; after which they all made off as fast as possible.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know either of the prisoners?</p>

               <p>Ellis. I can't swear to any of their faces.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take them up?</p>

               <p>Ellis. I heard of them by justice Fielding; I went there, and they were accused of it by the evidence.</p>

               <p>Q. What did they say for themselves there?</p>

               <p>Ellis. They neither own'd nor denied it.</p>

            . I don't know the day of the month, but the two prisoners and I were all together in Chelsea fields.</p>

               <p>Q. What was your business there ?</p>

               <p>Randall. We went there with an intent to rob.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you set out from?</p>

               <p>Randall. From my own quarters in John Street, Golden Square. When the prosecutor told me he was rob'd in those fields, I remember'd we were the people that rob'd him.</p>

               <p>Q. Which of you stop'd him?</p>

               <p>Randall. It might be me that put my hand to his shoulder.</p>

               <p>Q. Who took the things from him ?</p>

               <p>Randall. Search took the watch and I his money.</p>

               <p>Q. Which of you took hold of him first ?</p>

               <p>Randall. I don't know.</p>

               <p>Q. What is become of the watch ?</p>

               <p>Randall. It is here now. Produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Q. What money was taken from the prosecutor?</p>

               <p>Randall. There was half a guinea in gold. and one shilling and six pence. We sold the watch to Mr. Studd the serjeant for 25 s. and a pair of breeches.</p>

               <p>Q. Who sold it?</p>

               <p>Randall. Search and I did.</p>

               <p>Q. What had Garrett for his share?</p>

               <p>Randall. I don't know, but he had either 6 d. or 9 d. out of the money.</p>

               <p>Q. What pretence did you make to him of your having it?</p>

               <p>Randall. I told him it was my own, and that it was in pawn. Search and I went to meet Garrett as he came off his guard from the Hampton-Court party, but we had made the money away which was to be his share, and he was very angry with us.</p>

             had pawn'd it before he deserted; he wanted me to buy it, and I knowing he for the generality wore a watch in his pocket, when Garrett was taken up as a deserter, then I told Randall now he'll be brought to a court-martial, and you'll have your watch again that he has pawn'd; he said he'd not say any thing abo ut it, for he'd get it out of pawn as he could; about two months after that time he brought it to me.</p>

               <p>Q. What day did he bring it to you?</p>

               <p>Studd. He brought it to me on the 10th of Feb. I really took him to be a very honest man. I bought it of him for 25 s. and a pair of breeches, which I deliver'd, and was to deliver him also another pair.</p>

He took from me 3 s. and a key, my silver buckles and my hat; one of them said we have got your key, that will be of no use to us. I said gentlemen it is to me, and I hope you'll let me have it again; then one of them put it in my pocket again.</p>

            . The prisoner and I together committed this robbery on Sunday evening, just on this side Pancras.</p>

               <p>Q. How long ago?</p>

               <p>Randall. I can't justly say, it may be about three months, it was a very dark foggy evening, between five and six o'clock I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the prosecutor is the man?</p>

               <p>Randall. I look'd in his face, he seem'd to be a very fresh colour'd man. Gaul went to stop him first, he ran away from him, and I ran and laid hold on him, and threw him down. Gaul came up directly. I took 3 s. out of his pocket, and his hat and buckles; there was a key, which I put in his pocket again, as he was on the ground.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the prisoner do?</p>

               <p>Randall. He stood close by me with his hanger drawn, and said he'd cut his head in two if he made any resistance.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do with the buckles?</p>

               <p>Randall. We sold them almost by Westminster-Bridge the next morning, and we sold the hat to an old cloaths woman.</p>



               <p>Q. When was you taken up?</p>

               <p>Randall. Six weeks ago next Saturday, and the prisoner was the same night, upon my information.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was this before you was taken up?</p>

               <p>Randall. I can't justly tell.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What sort of a night was it when you were rob'd?</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. It was a very foggy night, there has not been it's like this year.</p>

               <p>Q. When the prisoner stood over you did you hear any body say they would cut your head in two?</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. They did say some words, but in my fright I cannot say what.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you distinguish either of their voices?</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. No, I could not so as to know them, not their faces neither.</p>

               <p>Q. to Randall. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Randall. Ever since I have been a soldier.</p>

               <p>Q. Has he always had the impediment in his speech he has now? He stammer'd very much.</p>

               <p>Randall. Not quite so much when I first knew him, but he always had an impediment in his speech.</p>

I have agreed for them, but they are not convey'd me. He asked who the gentleman was that I had agreed with, I told him he liv'd in Gloucestershire, then he said I ought to prosecute.</p>

               <p>Q. How far have you agreed about them?</p>

               <p>Fresselieque. I have all the title deeds, but there is a dispute, the wife will not join in it.</p>

               <p>Fresselieque. I think I may say I am, I have had the houses repaired, and I have paid the workmen's bills; the agreement says I shall have the houses from the 10th of October last, but in case he neglected or refused making a good title before the 10th of October, he was to pay all expences that I should be at, and the agreement to be void.</p>

               <p>Q. What had he used to give you for lead?</p>

               <p>Newcome. At the rate of 8 s. per hundred weight; the first time I went to him he sent his man with me to Mr. Morris's house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Day know how you came by it?</p>

               <p>Newcome. He did, we used to go about to get iron pallisades, he made a wrenching tool on purpose for us to take them off, and used to supply us with a great sledge hammer when we wanted it, or a chissel; and what he could not work up, he used to sell to other smiths.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>

               <p>Newcome. I have sat there to wait for my money, and seen smiths come to buy.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Mathews concerned with you in such practices?</p>

               <p>Newcome. He was about three months. He was caught with me in the same fact.</p>

            . Some time ago a man came to me and ask'd me if I bought lead. I said I did, if honestly come by. He said what he had he came by very honestly, and that he was a smith and liv'd near Drury-lane. I bought some for 14 s. per cwt. He sent it by his man.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that man again?</p>

               <p>Morris. To the best of my knowledge it was the prisoner Day. He said he had more to sell if I would buy it. When the lead came to be melted my man told me there was a good deal of waste in it, and as I can buy clean lead for that price I bid my man not buy any more if he brought it, without he allows for waste. After that my man bought half a hundred weight of him, at 13 s. per hundred. The last time I bought any of him I was at home myself, and told him I did not want any more; but if I did I said I would send to him. I had no suspicion of him then.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see Newcome at your house?</p>

               <p>Morris. I can't recollect him. There was a man with the smith the first time of his coming; the smith I remember told me it was his man, I think he had a great coat on.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the last lead that was brought, brought by that man?</p>

            . I am a constable belonging to St. James's parish; between the hours of one and two a watchman came and told me there were thieves broke into a house in Angel-court, Windmill-street. I took the lanthorn bearer with me, and found three or four watchmen round the house. I saw a bar was wrenched off a window, so sent a watchman down, and desired another to follow him. The thieves hearing them, made haste down stairs. Newcome came to the fore door and pull'd back the lock, and came out, and I seized him and search'd his pockets, but found nothing but a cord, which I secured him with. Then I ask'd him whether there were any more thieves in the house; he said there was but one man more, and he was some where in the house.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200068"/>Q. to prosecutor. Where is the house you miss the lead from?</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. It is the corner of Angel court, the same that the constable speaks of.</p>

               <p>Parry. I went into the house, and could not find him; I went out backwards, and found the vault was shut; I took hold of it and found it fast, so put my staff to it, when Mathews said, Sir, don't break the door, I'll come out to you; so he came out, I pinion'd him with a handkerchief, and took him to that Round-house, and carry'd Newcome to St. Martin's Round-house; going along Newcome told me they had been guilty of several robberies, and at the same time that there was one Riley in Rupert-street, in a cellar, that used to go with him for some months past. I went there and took him. Then Newcome told me that one Day, in the Coal-yard, Drury-lane, a smith, was a receiver of the goods they had stolen, that he had a trap door to his cellar, and that when they came there any time in the night, they could throw their burden against it, and it would open inwards, so that the burden would fall into the cellar, and the door would clasp to again. Then we went and took Day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine to see if there was such a trap door?</p>

               <p>Parry. I did, and found one as he had described. It was a piece of board nailed to the window with leather to give way, and it would answer the purpose just as he said. (A bar of iron produced in court.) This I found at Newcome's lodgings according to his direction. This Newcome told me Day made for them, to wrench off iron rails or palisades (he also produced a large hammer.) I said to Mathews do you know one Riley. He said yes, he had been acquainted with him five or six years. Riley said the same, of knowing Mathews.</p>

               <p>Mathews's Defence.</p>

               <p>I never stole a bit of lead in my life. I was fuddled, and did not know where I was got when I was in the vault.</p>

               <p>I never had no concern with the fellow (meaning Newcome.)</p>

            . I heard Newcome say before the justice that Day made this trap door on purpose for; and this cellar window has been ever since I had the house in my hands</p>

               <p>Q. to Newcome. Describe the trap door.</p>

               <p>Newcome. There is a slap to it fastened with leather, so that when we shruit in our bars or lead it opened and sell to again.</p>

               <p>Q. to Constable. Has he described it as you found it?</p>

               <p>Constable. It is as he has said.</p>

               <p>Newcome. I here was a window there before, and he put his piece of wood on because he would not get up on nights when we came, and he was a that the neighbours should hear us knock at the door; he bid us always go up the stable yard, where there is a dunghill, and put the things there where he was knocked up, till he contrived that door to give way and fall to again.</p>

               <p>Q. to Hatrick. As you are the landlord do you know when that board was put there as it is?</p>

I got up, threw up my sash, and call'd to a lodger that lay in a two-pair of stairs room backwards to get up. We went down stairs. When I got into my shop I found the counter slap open, and the counter about a quarter empty. It was full of goods when I went to bed. I shut the counter down about eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Give an account of the goods you missed, and their value.</p>

               <p>J. Gatehouse. There were three pieces of cheque, value about 5 l. two pieces of printed linen, value about 19 s. two pieces of lawn, value about 16 s. ten linen handkerchiefs, value 5 s. thirty six silk and cotton handkerchiefs, value about 3 l. 10 s. and two dozen of silk handkerchiefs, value 5 l. I opened the door. Three men were waiting for us. The cellar window, that leads to the inside of the counter, was broke open, and the wainscot between the window and counter was broke also; so that a man might pass through.</p>

               <p>Q. How was the cellar window fasten'd before you went to bed ?</p>

               <p>J. Gatehouse. There was an iron bar cross the door, and a large padlock on it; the cellar is under my shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you rent the whole house ?</p>

               <p>J. Gatehouse. I do; there is a trap door to the cellar window, that people in the street tread upon, and the door opens first before that can be taken up, and when that flap is open there are steps down into the cellar.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe that to be fast the over night?</p>

               <p>J. Gatehouse. I can't say I did; but I know it was, because it being in the high street, if the lock had been off, the bar would have tumbled down.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the outward door broke?</p>

               <p>J. Gatehouse. The lock was wrench'd off, and flung away.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to have any suspicion of the prisoner ?</p>

               <p>J. Gatehouse. He was taken in the cellar, and brought out to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were the goods?</p>

               <p>J. Gatehouse. They were all found in the cellar likewise.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed the over night?</p>

               <p>J. Gatehouse. I believe about twelve o'clock. When we took the prisoner before Sir

               <p>Q. Where is Abel's-Buildings?</p>

               <p>J. Gatehouse. It goes into Rag-Fair; there was also found in the cellar an iron instrument, with which I suppose the door was open'd. (Produced in court an iron with two strong forks, and an iron tooth about eight or nine inches long, on one side.)</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that the padlock was thrown away?</p>

               <p>J. Gatehouse. Because we could not find it.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know he was taken in the cellar?</p>

               <p>J. Gatehouse. Because I was at the street door when he was brought out to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there a way out of your shop into the cellar?</p>

               <p>J. Gatehouse. No; there is none without going out at the street door, except you break a door that has been fastened up some years.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it not possible for a man in the street to tread on the door, and fall into the cellar?</p>

               <p>J. Gatehouse. No, he cannot.</p>

               <p>Q. What use do you put the cellar to?</p>

               <p>J. Gatehouse. To no use at all. I can take my oath the door has not been opened but once these three years. (The goods produced in court, and deposed to:)</p>

             were going to work on London-Bridge, between three and four o'clock, on the 31st of March; we saw the prosecutrix's cellar window open four or five inches, and the iron instrument by the slap of the door.

               <p>Q. Did any body go in while you stood there ?</p>

               <p>Cooper. No; I clap'd my back against it. We call'd up the people of the house, and the prosecutrix came down to the door. Then my master and the watchman went into the cellar with a candle; I look'd down and saw a man lying upon the stairs under the door as if he was asleep, and the goods in a sack in the cellar by him. They pull'd him up out of the cellar. We carried him and the goods before the justice, and did not take the goods out of the sack till we came there.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that man if you should see him?</p>

               <p>Cooper. It was the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in his senses?</p>

               <p>Cooper. He could not speak.</p>



               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Did you look at the goods before the justice?</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix I did; these are the same.</p>

            . I am a paviour. I was with Cooper on the 31st of March going by the prosecutrix's house. I observ'd her cellar door open about six inches. I stoop'd down and took up this iron instrument, which lay on the flap of the door. The iron bar was laid up carefully against the wall of the next house, as it somebody had open'd it that belong'd to it. I shut it to. I left my man there, and went up to the watch-house, and brought Ellick Pearson a watchman. We alarm'd the house, and the prosecutrix came down. We found a flap that open'd into the shop, and bolted with two bolts, was broke open. The watchman went down into the cellar, and I followed him, and saw the prisoner lying on his face, just by the foot of the stairs; there were some pieces of handkerchiefs lying out of the sack, and the sack about a yard from him, with the rest of the goods in it. This is the sack (taking it in his hand.) We brought him up into the house, and the sack with the things in it. He wrote in the shop that he had lost his speech four years ago, that coming by and hearing a noise he fell into the cellar. We took him before the justice, and there he wrote that he was going to look after a captain, and coming by the door he heard a noise; he crossed the way, and there were two men; one pull'd up the flap, and the other open'd the door, and he fell down into the cellar. But I pull'd up the flap in order to get him out, it had not been open'd before.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Q. In what condition did he seem to be?</p>

               <p>Rawlins. He seem'd to be quite sensible; he could hear any thing as quick as I could.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think the prisoner was able to have got out of the cellar with the goods, had you not open'd the flap?</p>

               <p>Rawlins. I think he was. I brought out the goods; they were about half a hundred weight.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it possible for a man to tumble in there ?</p>

               <p>Rawlins. No, a child could hardly tumble down there.</p>

               <p>Q. Suppose a man was to cross from the opposite side of the street, might not he fall down there, by making a safe step?</p>

               <p>Rawlins. There was a lamp just by it.</p>

               <p>What observation I made on the witness is, they are very different from one another, but I am not acquainted with the laws of this nation; I hope my Lord and gentlemen of the jury will consider it is impossible for me to answer in such a short time, therefore I hope, when I have called several gentlemen, which are in court, to justify my character, you will find it is good, and I hope you will inquire into the character of my witnesses.</p>

I accidentally happened to come in company with Sullivan at the White Bear in Princes-street, Clare-market. After having been in his company often till the middle of May, I did not see him till March 1755. Then he call'd at the same house, inquiring for me They directed him to me at the Sugar Loaf, Great Queen street, Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. Then he told me there was a countryman of mine, born in the same town that I was, would be glad to drink a tankard of beer with me, and brought

About the 25th of May, 1755, he desir'd me to come to the house of one Saunders, at the Black Lion, White Hart Yard, Drury lane, to dine<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200072"/> with him on a Sunday. I went, and we dined together, when he told me he had something particular to say to me, saying he was going to the Hermitage stairs to see for a ship to go to Holland, to merchandise in velvets and laces, and said they two were partners, and as I was a taylor I must needs be a judge of these things, and I should go along with them as a servant. I went with him to Wapping, and on our return to Mr. Saunders's we went into a house in Doctor's Commons where Maclary told me he would give me ten guineas per month, which I agreed to; this was on the first of June, and about two or three days after we all three went on board captain Huter's ship, and went down to Gravesend, then to Rotterdam in Holland. They both told me they did not design to go any farther than Rotterdam, where they should compleat their affair. We got to Rotterdam about the ninth or tenth of June. From thence we went for the city of Hamburgh, and said at a place call'd Alno. From thence to a countryman's house that lives by the side of the river that goes up to Hamburgh, where we staid all night. When we got to Hamburgh they pretended the same there, and that they must go five or six miles to an inland town, where they could suit themselves. We went in a carrivan to a place call'd Lersey in Brandenbourg, and put up at an Inn. After we had din'd and drank two or three iriss of punch, Maclary ask'd Sullivan if he had the pattern measure (which I understood afterwards was my measure ) and said he would go and speak with his master. He went out a while, and came back again, and then desir'd I'd go along with him, and likewise said he'd go and buy a horse for the man that drove the carrivan, for his was tir'd. I went along with him. When I came to the place, it seem'd like and inn yard; at the entrance of the passage we went into a little parlour on the right hand side going in. I was not there above five or six minutes before there came an officer, who look'd very hard at me. I said what does he look so hard at me for, I don't like him. They told me he was the general of the town, and we must have a pass before we could proceed, (I found that to be my passport to the regiment that I was to go to join) the officer went immediately to writing, and soon both the prisoners absconded. I could not understand what the officer said, he spoke all in German. When they had been out some time, I began to be very uneasy. When the officer had wrote what he had to do, I took it up and look'd at it. I only saw their two names, and my name. I thought it was a passport to pass us through the country. After that the officer made motions to me to go along with him. I went along with him thro' a passage, he signified to me to pull off my shoes (there was a standard) I did, and was measur'd. I had no manner of notion that they were going to sell me for a soldier, or rather a slave for life. When I was measur'd he took me into a room on the opposite side the passage, where I was oblig'd to pull off my coat, waistcoat and shirt; they view'd my carcate, as if I had been a horse for sale; then they oblig'd me to pull off my shoes, stockings and breeches, and turn'd me into the room where I was at first. Then the officer call'd for wine in great plenty, and I drank two little tumblers full. I thought I was in a strange company, and a strange country, so I refused drinking any more, and turn'd very uneasy. They saw my counternance alter, and directly sent a man that could speak English. I told him I was very glad to see him, or any that was master of the language, because I had been left by two men that were good companions, or rather guardians, for an hour and a half, and I thought it hard usage to leave me so long in strange company. He desir'd me to sit down and make myself easy. I did for a little while. He asked me to drink a glass of wine, I did, then he said to me young man, how should you like to be a soldier in this country. I said it was never my intension in my own country, and much less here, if I serve any it shall be my own native prince. He replied he was afraid I must. I looking very hard at the man, must I, said I, - yes indeed you must; for these two men that brought you here have made a property of you and sold you. I did not know how to contain myself, but said I could not believe that, if he was to swear it. He went out, and in about a quarter of an hour's time he brought in the two prisoners. I said to them, Gentlemen, what are you going to sell me out of my native country, was this your intention when you brought me out of my country. They said yes it was, and you need not think much at it, for when you come to be incorporated into the company, you will find a great many young fellows that we have sold as well as you. I strove to make my escape out of the room, when one laid hold of one sleeve, and another the other, and in the skuffle pull'd off my coat. I got into the middle of the street, and said the first man that attempted to lay hold on me I'd be the death of him. Then there came a dozen or more of grenadiers with their bayorets fix'd, who laid hold of me, and carried me into the guard house, and a centry was let over me with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200073"/> drawn swords. In that manner I sat or lay the whole night. The next morning about three I was taken away, my two hands tied cross each othe r, and thrown into a waggon, and rode all day towards Stathene in Pomerania, where I was brought before the prince they had sold me to, the prince of Bevern. Then I found there were no less than seven men sold there before me by there two men, and two others that were concerned with them. I refused to put on my regimentals or swear to the colours, till I was obliged by stripes. I served a year and four months. After that a war broke out between her Imperial majesty and the king of Prussia. On the first of October, we had a great battle at a place call Powositz. which held from seven in the morning till three in the afternoon; seven days after the battle I had the good fortune with a young man, now in court, named

            , that was in that action, to be sent upon a foraging party, consisting of 12 men and an officer; there we made our escape, thirty of us escaped from that place. I believe I had upwards of a thousand miles to march to Ollend; there were three of us Englishmen as they call'd us, one was Irish, one English and I was Scotch We got to Dover the 29th of Nov. where we were obliged to inlist into my lord Manners's regiment, where I now am. When I came to London, I went to several houses which I knew the prisoners frequented, and found it all to no purpose. At last I went to the house of Mr. Saunders, at the Black Lion. White Hart Yard. I asked him if he had seen them lately, he said he had not. I said you are ignorant of the injury these men have done me, and told him how they had serv'd me. Then he told me where he thought I might find Sullivan, and I went and found him accordingly.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether they had any thing for you where they left you?</p>

               <p>Maxwell. John Maclary told me that very day I was told, laughing, he believ'd he should get about 20 guineas for me.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was Sullivan at that time?</p>

               <p>Maxwell. He was by then.</p>

            . I keep the Black Lion alehouse in White Hart Yard; the two prisoners used my house about two years ago along with Maxwell; the prisoners pretended to deal to Holland, they used to drop in, and sometimes lodge there, and away again. Maxwell lay there about two or three nights. After they were gone from my house about three weeks, I received a letter from Maclary from Holland, which I have look'd for, but cannot find; it mention'd he had an opportunity of going over sooner than he expected. About three months after that they came to my house again, and the first question my wife asked them was, what have you done with the young man that went along with you?</p>

               <p>Q. Was you present?</p>

               <p>Saunders. I was. Said Maclary, he likes the country very well, and is very well settled there. I never saw Maxwell after that till some time in January last, about the latter end of which month he came and told me the hardship he had undergone after he went from my house.</p>



               <p>Q. Did he tell you the same he has here?</p>

               <p>Saunders. He did; I believe I have heard him tell it ten times, and he never varied. He desired my assistance to find out the two prisoners. I said, I did not in the least doubt finding them. While we were speaking one Mr. Scot told us where to find Sullivan, which was at the Rising-Sun, near Lincoln's-Inn fields, by the duke of Newcastle's. I went there and found him; he was a helper in the house. I said I was glad to see him, and ordered him to draw a pint of purl, which he did. While I was drinking it I said, pray when did you see Mr. Maclary. He gave me directions where to find him. Then I went to Maxwell, and we went to a house somewhere in East-Smithfield, by the Maypole; there we met with Maclary, who seem'd not to know Maxwell. We took him in hold and carried him before justice Wright, and he committed him. Then we went and took Sullivan, and he seem'd to make as if he did not know Maxwell too. He was committed also.</p>

               <p>Q. Who paid the expence at your house?</p>

               <p>Saunders. I did not look to Maxwell for any thing; they paid me. Maclary oweth me money now.</p>

               <p>Maclary's Defence.</p>

               <p>Maxwell dined there one Sunday, and paid sixpence for his dinner; we never inlisted him, or gave him any money. At the time of our acquaintance with him, he went to Holland, on his own account, as business was very slack here. If we did do it, the king of Prussia is in alliance with us, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200074"/> we did not think there would be any harm in assisting him with men.</p>

I mistrusted they were not honestly come by, so I informed Mr. Wilson of the affair, and he, I, and others went to Adams's together, and bought these here produced of Adams.</p>

            . I live in Strutton Ground. On Monday about one o'clock, on the 28th of Feb. the prisoner came to my shop and brought a piece of crimson silk, which had been a curtain. I asked her whose it was; she said she was recommended to me because I would keep it clean, and said her husband had it in order to make a waistcoat. I lent her 18 d upon it. I never saw her in my life before or since till she was taken up. On the Thursday the overseer came to my house, and ask'd me if I had no prayer books, I said no; then he ask'd me if I had any crimson velvet or gold lace, I said no; then he took a search warrant out, and laid it on the counter. I said, gentlemen, I perceive you have been rob'd, if it is any thing in my possession I'll deliver it to you; he said he would not trust to that, he would search; I said and welcome Then he shew'd me the other curtain which he had in his bosom. I said I had the fellow to it. I shew'd it him, he ask'd me where the fringes and bindings were, and I said it was as I took it in: he ask'd where the person was that brought it, I said I should know her was I to see her; when I saw her, I said that was the person, it was the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Bright Wilmot. I was the constable, and took the prisoner up in St. Ann's lane, I have known her six or seven months. I was at the pawnbroker's and saw the curtain deliver'd.</p>

               <p>I was going along St. James's park with a shirt that I had to wash for a man, and saw something roll'd up before me; a man came behind me, who saw it; he ran and I ran, but he gather'd it up. I said halves, so he went home with me to my house, and let me have it, which was this curtain.</p>

               <p>Pine. By my servant, named

               <p>Pine. The whole came to 7 l. 14 s.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you got to say against the prisoner at the bar?</p>

               <p>Pine. About the latter end of March, I hearing there was such a man in the Poultry Compter for putting off a bad note as my boy described, I went and took my servant with me, to see if he could pick him out; the boy went in, and there were about a dozen men standing in the yard, and the prisoner among them; the boy pick'd the prisoner out, and said that is the man.

            . I am sixteen years of age. I am servant to the prosecutor, who sent me on the 12th of January with a parcel of goods to the Rose Inn, Holbourn Bridge.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what sort of goods they were?</p>

               <p>Callis. They were threads, tapes, bindings, worsted, needles and pins.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them before they were put into the box?</p>

               <p>Callis. I saw them put into the box; going along Ludgate Hill, about half an hour after five o'clock, or something more, I met the prisoner and another man.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>

               <p>Callis. It was not dark. I turn'd up my head to let the box slip upon my shoulder, and look'd up and saw him well. He ask'd me where I was going, I said not a great way. They bid me take care I saw no more of them till I got to turn up the market, where I saw them both going up the inside of the market. I was near the houses.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell them where you was going?</p>

               <p>Callis. No, I did not; whether they saw the direction on the box I can't say. As I was going to the book-keeper, there stood the prisoner on the steps of a door, next to the White-Horse, within about fifty yards of the Rose-Inn; he stop'd me, and ask'd me where I was going; I said to the Rose Inn. He took hold of the top of the box and pull'd it off my head; then again I saw his face.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a man was the other with him?</p>

               <p>Callis. He was a short man. ( The prisoner was very tall.) The prisoner told me he was the bookkeeper.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was the other man then?</p>

               <p>Callis. He was gone then.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner take it forceably?</p>

               <p>Callis. He took it by force; my hand was on the cord. He hurt my hand very much. I went to the inn yard, and there was the book-keeper in the warehouse. I told him of it; he said I was rob'd of it, and there were a great many tricks done this way. Then I ran up and down all the turnings I could think of, but could not see any thing of them.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see him after this ?</p>

               <p>Callis. I saw them both together about three weeks after that on Snow-Hill, but I was afraid, so did not speak to them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner after that time?</p>

               <p>Callis. I did, in the Poultry-Compter. Master told me I should go along with him there. There was the prisoner. I went and pick'd him out from a dozen or more.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body point out the prisoner to you?</p>

               <p>Callis. No; I knew him as soon as I saw him. I was there before my master.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the person's face so as to know him?</p>

               <p>Callis. There is a lamp close over the door where he stood, and another very near it, and by those lamps I saw him plain, and I knew him by his dress; he had the same black coat on when he was in the compter.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you went to the compter, or in going, did any body describe the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Callis. No; I did not go with my master and the other gentleman, I went before.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was it that you met after him that on Snow-Hill ?</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200078"/>Callis. It was between three and four o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it light ?</p>

               <p>Callis. It was, and I knew him again.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you not speak to him?</p>

               <p>Callis. I had nobody with me, and it is such a bad place I did not care to speak to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any irons on him when you saw him in the compter ?</p>

               <p>Callis. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did Mr. Neal, the man that went with your master to the compter, say he had any dealings with me?</p>

               <p>Callis. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the book-keeper?</p>

               <p>Callis. No</p>

               <p>Wod. Cuel I am book-keeper at the Rose Inn, Holbourn Bridge. This boy came to me and said he had lost some things, as he was bringing them to me; a person had taken them that told him he was the book-keeper.</p>

               <p>Q. What day of the month with it?</p>

               <p>Cuel. I don't know; it was on a Wednesday night, the latter end of January, or beginning of February.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any information from any person, before he pick'd him out?</p>

               <p>Woodman. He had no information at all; he pointed him out before he went into the prison, by seeing him through the bars.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>

               <p>I was at Hudersfield in Yorkshire at the time this box was stolen, the place where I was born; I never knew the time they designed to charge it upon me, till they arraigned me at the bar. One Neal brought the prosecutor and boy to the compter to see me, after I had been there three days; he said he'd give 50 l. to see me go up Holbourn-Hill to be hanged. It is all revenge. If I thought I had a drop of blood in my veins that would do such a mean thing, as to take such a box from such a lad, I would let it out immediately.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner knew the day of the month he was charged with taking these things; when we were before my Lord-mayor, the boy and I too mention'd the day.</p>

I asked him where he had it, he said what was that to me. I secured it and him, it weigh'd eleven pounds and a half, bag and all. We carried him before my Lord-mayor the next day, when he said he found it coming up Fresh-wharf gate-way (produced in court ) I can't say this is the same that was taken out of that bag; he fain would have left it with me, if I would have let him go.</p>
