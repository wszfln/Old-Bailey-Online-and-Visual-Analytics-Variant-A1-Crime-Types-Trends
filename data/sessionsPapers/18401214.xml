The prisoner formerly lived with me for nine months as shopman, and kept my books—he left six months ago—this is my book, and a great portion of it is in the prisoner's hand-writing—when I lost it, it was in a perfect state, and there was room for further entries—it had not been gone through—I first missed it on Saturday, the 18th of January last, and considered it was stolen by parties coming to the shop—it contained en<lb/>tries which were very important in my business—we have no duplicate of the book—it is the only check we might have on servants as defaulters—we lose the check on things going out, and entries that may be made in the book which were not really bona fide pledges—pledges might be en<lb/>tered in the book by persons in the prisoner's situation when no money</p>

                  </hi>. I rent the upper part of a house in Regent-street—I let portions of it furnished—the prisoner came into my service in the early part of September—in November I missed some things, among others, the articles stated—I spoke to the prisoner about it, and she said she had not got them. On the 1st of December I gave her warning, and gave her leave to go out and look for a lodging—on the Wednesday follow<lb/>ing, in consequence of what I heard, I went to the house of Mrs. Crow, and there I saw a tray-cloth which I recognised as mine—I went from there to the station, and saw the prisoner there—the constable took the tray-cloth—I said to the prisoner, "Mary, this is the tray-cloth I asked</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. After I had been with you a month, when Miss Frisby, one of the lodgers, was going away, you asked me to collect all the napkins and towels, to see if they were all safe—I did so—you said there was one wanting—I went down stairs, but did not find it—next day I found it down stairs, I brought it up, and you then said all your things were quite right. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. That did occur, but it was subsequent to this—I did not re<lb/>ceive all the towels and cloths—part of them were kept back—I did not ask for the jack-towels, because those things were in use in the kitchen—if you washed out any kitchen cloths, you kept them down stairs—I was not in the habit of seeing them brought.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>.

I found her to be a very malicious creature, and making very false statements to the lodgers, and in consequence I had her up, and she said it was not her—I afterwards found it did originate from her, and she then said, "Rather than have any more confusion, we will part"—I said, "Very well, this day month"—she gave me warning—I never gave her the ribbon, I positively swear—I missed several knives and forks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Edward Crow, and live at No. 16, North-street, Marylebone. On Tuesday, the 1st of December, the prisoner came to hire a lodging of me—she left, and said she would come in the evening—she then brought me a bundle containing some things damp, and asked me if I would take care of it—I afterwards opened it, and found in it three napkins, and a jack-towel cut in three, all apparently very wet, but I am not quite sure—next morning she asked for the towels and said they were not hers, she was going to take them home—I gave them all to her as I supposed, but the tray-cloth had fallen down behind the arm-chair, which I did not see—in consequence of something, I gave notice to Mrs. Cole, who came to my house, saw the tray-cloth, and claimed it—I saw the constable open her boxes the same night, and in them were found the same napkins she had taken from me in the morning, the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184012140010"/>
               <p>jack-towel, two other towels, two pieces of ribbon, and a gilt slide—I saw them all taken out—before they were found, the prisoner said to me at the station, "The towels that you have of mine, I have had these three years, and there are more in my box—they were in pledge last February twelve-month with a silk handkerchief."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The night I left my place I engaged this lodging; I had these towels washed; I gave them to Mrs. Crow to take care of; next morning, when I asked her for them, she gave me five; I said there was another; she said she did not know where it was, she would look; she afterwards met me on the stairs, and said, "Here is your towel;" I said, "Be so good as keep it till I come back;" when I returned, a policeman was there; Mrs. Crow said, "This is the young woman you want;" I said, "What do you want me for?" he said, "You are accused of stealing a table-cloth;" I said, "Where is it?" he asked for the towel; I said, "That is my own, and I have five more in the box;" I gave up the keys, and said, "There is nothing in the boxes but what is my own;" I said I had had the towels three years, and before I bought the duplicate of them they were in pledge thirteen months.</p>

I searched the prisoner's boxes on Wednesday evening, the 2nd of December—the prisoner was then in custody—I found all these things in the boxes except the tray-cloth—Mrs. Cole and Mrs. Crow were present, but I took them out—I opened the boxes with the keys the prisoner had given me—I found the gilt slide at the bottom of the box—no one put their hands into the box but me—Mrs. Cole and Mrs. Crow were standing two or three feet from it—no one could have put any thing in while I was searching it without my seeing it, and I am positive no one did—I took the things to the station, and showed them to the prisoner—she said the towels and napkins were hers, she had had them three years, (I am sure she said that of all the cloths,) and the ribbon her mistress had given to her—the gilt slide was not mentioned to her—I have had these things in my possession ever since the Wednesday when I found them.</p>

It is quite false—I never followed her, nor ever went out of my own door—I did not go to Mrs. Cole's till eleven o'clock next morning, when, seeing the fish-napkins, I went to inquire about the prisoner's character—I told her that I was very particular who I took in, for last Sessions a woman was tried who had brought stolen property to my house, and I was frightened.</p>

I told Mrs. Cole that I must get time to wash my own things before I left; she said, if I would get them ready and bring them to her, she would send them to her washerwoman for me; I brought her up a cap and one of these napkins, and when the woman sent them home they were marked with the "W" in blue cotton—when the lodgers made a piece of work about Mrs. Cole and this gentleman, they had me up—this gentleman said I was telling falsehoods, and he did not think I knew it; he said, "Mary, I think you are doing a great deal of mischief, it is very wrong;" I said, "How sir?" he said I had told Mr. Wells, and the whole of them of it—I said I could be on my oath I had never named it to any one in the house; he said Mrs. Cole meant to have them all up to clear her character; I said, if he had me up it would not be very plea<lb/>sant for either party; Mrs. Cole said, "Why? and I said, "I saw Mr.——in bed with you one morning;" Mr.——said, "Do you mean that?" I said, "Yes;" he asked if I had not told any one of it, I said, "No;" he advised me not to speak of it, and said Mrs. Cole had said she was very sorry I was to leave her, for I was a very faithful servant; he said, "Mary, promise you won't speak of it, and let the scandal go no further;"—he gave me half-a-crown, and I promised before I left the room that I would never speak of it any more.</p>

On the 1st of December, I saw the prisoner come past the shop—she had her hand on a piece of pork—she saw me and went away, but came back at half-past one o'clock, and took half a ham and put it under her shawl—she then came into the shop, and called for a quartern of shilling butter—before I served her, I asked her what she had under there—she said, "No<lb/>thing"—I lifted up her shawl and saw the ham—I took it from her and gave her into custody—it was my master's ham.</p>

The prisoner was our journeyman for six or seven months—he came from the country—I saw him behind the counter, near the till, putting the bread in the window—I afterwards went to the till, and missed half-a-crown, which I had seen there about five minutes before—I said either him or the other baker had taken half-a-crown out of the till—he said he did not—I called to the young man, and asked him about it, but the prisoner called out to him, "Hold your tongue," and then the other did not speak—at last the prisoner gave me the half-crown out of his watch-pocket, and said, "Here is the half-crown"—I told my mistress.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No</hi>. 370.) On the 26th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw a wagon, loaded with coals, standing at the top of Gough-square—I did not look at the name that was on it—Parker was the driver of it—I saw Parker take a sack of coals from the wagon, and carry them down a court to Fletcher's premises—he shot them in Fletcher's presence—Parker then came out with the sack in his hand—I was standing by the side of the door—he pushed me back, and said, "Halloa, you long-sided policeman, what do you do there?"—he then went up King's Head-court, and Fletcher called, "George," who I understand is his son, and said, "Have you done your tea? make haste, and away with these coals"—the boy then came up into the shop, held up a bag, and Fletcher filled it with coals, but did not weigh them, and the boy carried the bag down to Shoe-lane—as I was going on my beat I met the boy coming back, and he asked if I had seen that man bring any more coals there—I said, "No, only that one sack," and he shot them—I was then going round my beat, and saw Parker with another sack of coals on his back, going in the same direction that he did before, but I did not see where he took them—I went on, and saw the other man taking coals out of the wagon to Mr. M'Dowall's premises—I do not know how many he took in there—after they were all shot, they were going home with the empty wagon, and Parker stopped me and said, "How are you? have you got any money?"—I said, "No"—he said, "We will have a drop of gin, but I suppose you don't dare drink?"—I said it was against our rules—he sent his mate for a quartern of gin, and I drank with them—he said, "You and I shall see one another another day; it is no use for such fellows as you and I to kick one another's shins, unless some one sets us on"—when I first saw the wagon it appeared to be full.</p>

               <p>act on that power—I effected the sale of the stock as soon as the power was passed on the Monday—I sold it to Mr. Clement Smith—this is the trans<lb/>fer of that stock—I saw the prisoner sign the name of William Pillgrem to that transfer—I am the witness to his identity upon that—I received the money for the transfer of that stock, 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and deducting the commission and expense of the power, I paid him over the net proceeds, 96<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

Dick lived at No. 3, Trafalgar-square, Charing-cross—I live at Islington—it was on the 14th or 18th of August that I acted on Mr. Dick's business—I am not certain whether or not, in the course of the business I had done for Mr. Dick, I had seen his hand-writing—I had not seen his hand-writing frequently—I will swear I had not seen it a dozen times—I may have seen it half a dozen times—I think I have seen his hand-writing, but I cannot say how often—I am certain I have seen it half a dozen times at least—I have carried on business as a stock-broker on my own account since May last—I have been eighteen years with a broker, who died in May—I am not a member of the Stock Exchange—I am not licensed at present—I was not licensed when this transaction took place—I am not aware that in acting without a license I was doing an illegal act—I was frequently on the Stock Exchange while with Mr. Parsons—I do not know that it is customary to have a license—it is optional, I believe that, on my oath—all respect<lb/>able stock-brokers do not act under a license.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a policeman On Tuesday, the 24th of No<lb/>vember, about noon, in consequence of information, I went to No. 17, New-street, St. Giles's, to the back room, first-floor—the door was closed, but not fastened—I found the two prisoners in the room—Hughes was sitting on the bed, and M'Guire standing by the stove—Hughes had something white in his hand, which appeared to be a lump of plaster-of-Paris—he instantly crushed it in his right hand, and some of the pieces fell on the floor—he then put his right hand into a jug of water which stood on the floor, and at the same time I saw him pass a shilling with his left hand on to the bed—I then seized his right hand, drew it out of the water, and found it was covered with white, something like dough—it was plas<lb/>ter-of-Paris which had been dissolved—I asked him what he was doing—he said, "It is no use, you are too late, there is nothing in the room that I care for"—I noticed two counterfeit shillings on the bed-side, besides the one I saw him put there from his left hand—Hardwick took them up—the prisoners were both secured—we searched the room—I found some of the pieces of plaster-of-Paris, which fell from his hand on the floor, and also some pieces of metal—they were found between where Hughes was, and the fire-place—I found a pipe half-full of metal near the grate, and a pan under the stove, quite hot, and with white metal in it—there was a slow coke fire sufficient to melt any thing of that sort—I also found a file and broken knife—I took possession of the shilling which I had seen Hughes put on the bed with his left hand.</p>

On Monday evening, the 7th of December, I was going through Lincoln's Inn-fields—I happened to turn my head, and saw the prisoner close behind me, with something white in his hand—I pot my hand into my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I laid hold of him, and said I thought he had my handkerchief—he said he had none but his own, which he took out and showed me—I said I thought he had got mine—I searched him, and found it in his left-hand trowsers pocket—he then said he had picked it up—I had used it about three minutes before, and put it safely back—I gave him in charge—this is ray handkerchief—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>.)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was not in Lincoln's Inn-fields at all; I came down Kingsgate-street, and picked the handkerchief up under the archway in Great Queen-street; he came and asked if I had got his handkerchief; I said no; I did not know it was his; he said he saw me put it in my pocket; he searched rue all over, then went on one side, and afterwards came and took it out of my pocket; there were three ladies close by, who said they had not seen me touch his pocket. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I asked three ladies if they had seen him do it; they said no; it was under the archway I missed it.</p>

M'Farlane, the landlady, allowed him to sleep in the same bed with me—in the morning he asked for a needle and thread to mend his jacket—I went down and brought one up to him—I then went down and washed myself, leaving him in the room—he afterwards came down stairs, and said he was going to the Sailors' Home to get some assistance—I afterwards went up stairs, and all my clothes were gone, with 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in my waistcoat pocket—I met him next day at the London Dock, and asked if he had taken my things—he said he had not—I said there was nobody but him to take them—he said, "Well, I have, here are the tickets of them," giving me two, one of which was for my things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk in the service of Messrs. William James Chaplin and Benjamin Worthy Home, proprietors of Hambro Wharf, Upper Thames-street—they became proprietors in June last—at that time Cox and Young were their porters and warehousemen—Bannister was shipping and loading clerk—it was his duty to superintend the receipt of property on the wharf, and to see to the faithful delivery of it out—he was to have returns of all the property—Cox and Young were subordinate to him—Bannister's situation made it necessary that confi<lb/>dence should be placed in him—on the 24th of June among other property turned over from the previous proprietors of the wharf to the present, were 158 barrels of soda—the owner sent orders for 99 casks, which were deli<lb/>vered up to July—that left 59 casks—in September I received an order to deliver the test, and the whole were supposed to be delivered in Septem<lb/>ber or October—soon after that there was a complaint that the whole had not been delivered—I referred to an account that Cox and Young kept of what had been delivered, and found that 57 casks only had been delivered—I stated to Cox and Young that there was a deficiency of two casks of soda according to their statement, and asked the reason they had not delivered the whole—they stated they had delivered the whole that was on the wharf, and that there was not any soda whatever remaining on the wharf—there were at that time some bags of wool and some rags on a part of the wharf opposite the counting-house in which Bannister was em<lb/>ployed, and near to it whilst I was making my inquiries of Cox and Young I perceived two casks amongst the wool and rags—they were covered over, and so concealed that unless any one had suspicion, and were looking out, they would not have been seen—there were bags of wool or rags on them—in going from the counting-house to the warehouse, which it was the duty of Bannister to do several times a day, he would pass by the spot where these casks were—I had this conversation with Cox and Young about a week or a fortnight after the delivery of the hat soda,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184012140043"/>
               <p>which was in October—on the 4th of November I received a letter from Child, the watchman of the wharf, and on the 18th or 19th I received a message from Messrs. Coulthards, the proprietors of the soda—I showed the letter to Bannister, and asked if he knew any thing about the soda—he said he did not—that there was no soda on the premises—he said he would call Cox and Young to inquire of them—I said it was no use as I had spoken to them before—this was on a Thursday, and on the Saturday following the prisoners were taken into custody—Cox and Young both stated they were going to make a search for the soda on the following morning, and if they found any they would let me know.</p>

                  </hi>. I am private watchman to the prosecutors on Hambro' Wharf. On the evening of the 2nd of November, I went on duty at seven o'clock, and between seven and eight I saw Cox and Young rolling two casks of soda from behind the wool into the warehouse—after they got them there, they took both the heads out—I went into the warehouse and asked what they were going to do with that soda—they said to take the heads out for the purpose of showing me that the soda was clean, and as I dealt in the article I might bargain for it (my wife keeps a shop)—I asked them how they came by the soda—they said it was part of Messrs. Coulthard's stock—that Mr. Skey had made up his accounts, and was satisfied that they had had their number, and so were Messrs. Coulthards, that these were two casks that were left over, and they did not consider that the soda belonged either to Chaplin and Home, or to the late Company, and if I would go to Mr. Bannister, be would give me every information—I asked the weight—they said about 12 cwt., and Young said he had weighed one cask, and he had marked on the head in black-lead pencil the weight, which was 5 cwt.—he showed me where it was marked, and he supposed the other cask weighed 6 1/2 cwt.—there was about 12 cwt. together—each of them rolled a cask into the warehouse, and Cox took the head out and showed me the the soda—I left the warehouse, went to Bannister's office, and said, "About the soda, is it all right?"—he said as far as being right, Mr. Skey had made up his account, and he was satisfied that Coulthards had had their number, and Coulthards were satisfied also—there were two casks that were left, and he neither considered that they belonged to Chaplin and Horne, or to the late Company, and they were going to dispose of it—I then asked what he wanted for it—he said he should leave that entirely to William Cox to dispose of it, and whatever was got for them, he would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184012140044"/>
               <p>take his share and go <hi rend="italic">snacks</hi> with them—I then returned to the warehouse, where Cox and Young were, and told Cox that Bannister said he would leave it entirely to his disposal—Young was in the warehouse at the time—Cox then said I should have it for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, very well, I would consider of it and let them know in the course of a day or two—I then wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) and gave it into the hands of Mr. Skey—on the 8th of November, which was Sunday, as I was sweeping up the wharf, Ban<lb/>nister came and asked whether I had agreed with William Cox for the soda, if I had, he said, it was Thomas Cox's turn to the Western railroad on the Monday and Chittenden's on the Tuesday, and Thomas Cox would be at liberty to bring the soda over to my house—on the following morn<lb/>ing, Monday, the 9th of November, I saw William Cox on the wharf—I told him my wife had got sufficient soda by her, and could not make any more room for it, and I should be obliged to decline having any thing to do with it—the soda still remained in the same place under the rags—after the heads had been knocked out in the warehouse, they were rolled back again—I saw it on the wharf on Thursday night, the 19th of November—on Monday night, the 16th of November, I saw William Cox on the wharf, and asked him if he had disposed of the soda—he said he had not—I asked on the following night if he had disposed of it—he said he had sold it to the Jew for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he expected it would be fetched away on the follow<lb/>ing Thursday—I saw William Cox again on the Thursday, and asked if he had seen the Jew—he said he had not, but if he did not come and fetch it away, he should be obliged to dispose of it to some one else, as there had been a stir about it, and Coulthards had written about the missing casks—on Friday, the 20th of November, I saw Young on the wharf when I came on duty at night, and asked him if the soda was gone—he said yes, both the casks were gone clear off the wharf, and there was only a small remnant of soda left in an empty cask, and if so be they were applied to on the subject, they should state that they had searched the wharf all over, and that was all they could possibly find (the soda was gone then)—on the Saturday, Young and Cox were in custody—I went into Bannister's office, and he said it was a lucky job that I had had nothing to do with it, and said it was a very bad job—at that moment, I was called away by Mr. Home, who happened to be on the spot, and in con<lb/>sequence of what Mr. Home said to me, I returned to Bannister's office, and Bannister wanted to know of me what Mr. Home had said—I told him Mr. Home had been questioning me about the soda, and I had told him I knew nothing about it (I said that by direction of my master)—Bannister said he hoped I should continue to say so, and if the prisoners kept their own counsel, nothing could hurt them—on the Sunday follow<lb/>ing, Bannister came to me about ten o'clock at night, just before I retired to rest—he said he hoped I should continue to say what I had said before, on the morrow when I went before the Magistrate—I afterwards received some information from Mr. Beard, and went to Chamberlain's Wharf, in Tooley-street—I there found two casks of soda, and on one of the heads I saw the pencil-mark that Young had before pointed out to me.</p>

I was in the omnibus with Mrs. Auld—I went in after her, and sat the second on the left hand—when I got in there was no person sitting on the right-hand side of her—I saw the prisoner come in, and set himself at her right—im<lb/>mediately after he got in he placed himself in an oblique direction, and threw a large Mackintosh cloak over his knees, and over the prosecutrix's knees—I perceived there was something extraordinary in his conduct—I saw his hands moving under the cloak, more towards his left—he did not move when other persons came in—he was occupying the place of two people—just as we got to Chancery-lane a lady got out, and the prisoner rushed out in a very hurried manner—I then asked the prosecutrix if she had lost any thing—I said, "Feel in your pocket"—she did, and said she had lost her purse—I told the conductor to stop—I went in pursuit, and came up with the prisoner at the corner of Red Lion-street—I was on the opposite side of the way—I saw him speaking to a gentleman—I crossed the road—he noticed me, and they went on to the Coach and Horses public-house—knowing it had a stable-yard, I placed myself at the corner, but perceiving they did not make their escape by the side-door, I waited two or three minutes, and not seeing an officer, I thought I would go in—just as I was going in they were coming out—I seized the prisoner's companion, under an impression that they had been dividing the booty—the companion thrust me violently away—the prisoner turned towards Red Lion-street, and I followed him—I went by his side, and charged him with having robbed a lady in the omnibus—he said, "What lady?"—I said, "There is no necessity for saying what lady, you know you have robbed a lady"—he said I must be mistaken—I said, no, I had marked his conduct too well to be mistaken—he then said, would I go home with him—I said, no, I would follow him till I saw an officer, and give him into custody—he said, would I take a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and go with him to his residence—I said, no, I should not lose sight of him—as we were going through several streets, he asked what I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday, the 24th of No.<lb/>vember, I was on duty in Harrow-road, near the Windsor Castle public-house—I heard what appeared to be the report of a gun, and afterwards the prisoner's brother, Edwin Williams, came and fetched me to the house, which is about 200 yards from where I was—I met the prisoner outside the house—Edwin said, "Here he is; now take him into custody for shoot<lb/>ing at me"—the prisoner was near enough to hear that—I was going to take him to the station—and told the brother be must come with me—the father and mother then came out and said he should not go and prosecute, and pressed him not to go on with it—I asked the prisoner what he had done with the gun—he said he had thrown it into some ditch—I then let him go into the house, as the parties said they would not prosecute, and I went to search for the gun—I found it in a ditch, and now produce it—about a foot of the muzzle was out of the water—I examined it—it had every ap<lb/>pearance of having been recently discharged—Edwin told me how it hap<lb/>pened after I came up to the prisoner, and before, too, and also at the station-house—he told me in the prisoner's presence outside the door that</p>

               <p>he was going outside the house, making his escape from the bar-parlour from the prisoner, and when he got about a foot from the door, he heard the report of a gun behind him, and his brother had fired at him—I think that was all that was said then—the prisoner was kicking up a noise, and was intoxicated at the time—I did not pay particular attention to what he said outside the house, but he said it was all a jealousy towards him—the place where the bullet had gone, was pointed out to me—it had gone across the parlour into the wainscot—I then took the prisoner to the station, and found twenty-seven bullets in his pockets, some percussion-caps, and gun<lb/>flints—the prosecutor stated the whole particulars at the station—I charged the prisoner with being drunk and disorderly—the brother made no charge—my charge of drunkenness and disorderly conduct was taken down, and the brother was a witness to it—he stated in the prisoner's presence what had transpired—the prisoner said it was something of a jealousy existing between him and his brother—that was all the prisoner said to the best of my knowledge—the brother stated before the prisoner at the station pretty well exactly the same as he stated before the Magistrate—I am the only witness here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. M'Gray gave the prisoner into my charge, in Smithfield, for a robbery in Homer-street—I desired him to go the station—he went readily, without resistance—he said he never did it, he was not the man, and was never in a station-house in his life—he gave me his address, "No. 3, Union-street, London-road"—I went there the same night, inquired at several No. 3's, but he was not known there—it is a street occupied by prostitutes and thieves, and low characters—I could not find him out then, but on the Tuesday morning following I found he did lodge at a No. 3 in that street, kept by a person named Jordan—the prisoner had then been admitted to bail, but I thought he was still in cus<lb/>tody—Thomas James went with me to the house—I saw a female there, calling herself Mrs. Jordan—she pointed out the prisoner's room to me—it was the up-stairs room—there is only one up-stairs room—there was a bed there—MRS. Jordan pointed out his bed to me, and pulled the bed down herself—I searched the clothes, and found an old jacket and a pair of trow<lb/>sers—in the jacket pocket I found a memorandum-book, with some bills, and a duplicate for a rosewood box, pawned at Sharwood's—I got the box from him—I applied to the different pawnbrokers, who are here, and traced out the property—this waistcoat was pawned at Griffiths', a pair of trowsers at Smellie's, and a coat at Button's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> After you searched the jacket and trowsers, did you put them down again and go away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I came back again in about two minutes, asked Mrs. Jordan for the jacket, and took it—James is a tradesman, for what I know—I will not swear he is—I believe him to be so—I met him cursorily on London-bridge—I knew him before—I first met with him about twelve months ago, on a trial here about Mr. Porter's robbery—he was a witness—he did not communicate with me on the sub<lb/>ject of that robbery, nor with any of the police, to my knowledge—I was a witness in the case—I have not known him ever since—I do not know how he gets his living—James said to Mrs. Jordan, in my presence, "I suppose you know where your lodger is?"—she said he was gone to his work—I did not say, "How can you tell that d——lie?" nor did James, in my hearing—I should think I should have beard him if he had—I did not hear him say, "How can you tell that lie?" nor any thing of the sort—I told her I thought he was in custody—she said he was at work at the London Docks—I do not know that he was there, nor do I know that he was employed there, only from his own lips, and from her—I made no observation at all when she said he was at work, nor did I hear James say any thing—I was not at Bow-street when they refused to take James's oath—I was going to this place when I met him, and asked him to go with me—I did not take him before the Magistrate—I did not consider it requi<lb/>site</p>

               <p>—MR.

The prisoner has lodged there all that time, up to the night of his apprehension—he left my place about eight o'clock that evening—he slept down stairs—I and my wife slept up stairs—his bed was carried up stairs of a morning, and taken down at night, as we live in the room below in the day time—I know this jacket to belong to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>six to nine months—I knew them carrying on the business of lithogra<lb/>phers in Church-street, Soho—they were, I believe, in partnership—I had done some business for them, to a trifling amount—card-plates, their own door-plate, and articles of that sort—on Monday, the 9th of August, Mazeaux came to me and placed in my hand two papers—this is one of them—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was then a perfect, whole note—the other paper he produced, was similar to that, but printed in different colours, and had the figure "5" upon it—this has "25"—he asked me if I could engrave a plate to correspond with that paper—I had never seen any thing of the kind before—I looked at it, held it up to the light, and saw on the paper a water-mark—I said there would be a difficulty in getting paper with that water-mark on it—he said the persons he was executing the plate for, would get that themselves—I bad then a person named Gould in my em<lb/>ployment—he was present at the interview—he engraved in the shop, and was there in his business—I spoke to him on the subject, and then told Mazeaux we could execute it for him—he said the price was no object—he went away, leaving me both the papers—I saw him again, I think, on the same day—next day I went to Mr. Smart, a refiner and changer of foreign money—I consulted with him on the subject, and showed him both the papers—in consequence of what passed between us, I found out the Rus<lb/>sian Consul, and had an interview with him, I think, on the same day, Tuesday—I made a communication to him of what had occurred—Ma<lb/>zeaux came to me again that same day, and had both the notes away which he had left with me, and said he would ask whether the person would have them executed—(I have in my hand a little diary of the trans<lb/>action—I entered each circumstance as it occurred from time to time—this is the original paper which I wrote)—he brought back the note pro<lb/>duced, on the Thursday, I think—I never saw the other again—Ramuz and Mazeaux came together on the day it was brought back (prior to that, Mazeaux had asked me if I could engrave it for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I said yes)—they came up to my bed-room, which is on the second floor, and gave me a deposit of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they said I was to go on with the note—one of them gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other gave three sovereigns—I do not remember any thing else passing—I then set about the engraving—while the engraving was going oh, I saw both Mazeaux and Ramuz a great many times—sometimes together, but more frequently Mazeaux—he came on several occasions, and I think about a month afterwards I showed him a rough print, which he took away with him—it was a proof—I once made a re<lb/>mark to Mazeaux, with reference to the paper, to print them, and he said he had not got it, but the party would get it—neither of them gave me any directions what I was to do with the note, or where I was to put it—the whole of the note was not a style of engraving which I could execute—I engraved the centre part of the front of this note—it has been cut to its present state for the purpose of engraving—a piece of the border has been lost in the progress of the work—I employed another person to do the border—there is also a border round the back part of the plate—(<hi rend="italic">For<lb/>rester here produced the plates</hi>)—this front plate is the one I executed without the border—it was from this plate the proof was given—this paper marked "Z," is the first proof I took from the plate—I gave it to Ma<lb/>zeaux—I applied to Mr. Bacon, an ornamental engraver, to do the border—he did the border for the back of the plate, and a plate was exe<lb/>cuted for the border round the front of the note—I had an impres<lb/>sion</p>

               <p>taken of the border he engraved, which I gave to Mazeaux—this is the border-plate which Mr. Bacon prepared—I went to the house in Church-street a great many times, and I showed the prisoners from time to time the progress that was making in the work—I saw Ma<lb/>zeaux transfer a print from the plate on to a lithographic-stone—I think Ramuz was not there at the time—after that I received directions from Mazeaux, respecting the back-plate—I saw Ramuz on the subject of the back-plate several times, and he asked me if I was getting on—this is the back-plate, which I executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did either of them, at any time while the work was in progress, tell you what the notes or papers referred to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, both at different times—Ramuz said he would not have it known for any sum of money—some of them were engraved at that period—on one occasion Mazeaux said they were for some use, such as a banker or some person was to place them in such a position that they were to represent some which had been taken away—he said he was aware they were money, and that they were to be used, or placed in a drawer or box, where the good was taken away, and these were to have the appearance of the good, but they were fictitious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not understand you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will endeavour to give his words—the subject was this, admitting they were good money—he said that they were to be used to represent money if the real money was taken away—I do not know how to explain the thing better—he said it was to be used in a way that if there was money in a drawer or box, if that was taken away, these were being manufactured to be placed in their stead—I do not recol<lb/>lect what led to this conversation—on one occasion I took a print to the house, and gave it into the Hands of Mazeaux, at the door—he opened the door—that was a print from the back-plate, without the border round it—I cannot recollect how many impressions altogether I gave to them—I gave them several—when I took the print Mazeaux told me the man they were executing the order for was present in their house, in their parlour—(I think that was about a month before the officers went)—I was in the pas<lb/>sage at the time—nobody was present then—in consequence of what he said, I watched outside the door after I left, and saw the prisoner Rault come out of the house—about three weeks after that I went to the house again, and saw both Ramuz and Mazeaux—they made an objection to the back-plate, saying it was not so good as they wished, and said that I had better get on with another plate instead of it—I agreed to do so, and came away—I went again about a week after—I do not recollect whether I took any thing with me then—the two plates were then in my possession—I saw Mazeaux—I took the plates about a week after—the original back and front plates—I saw Mazeaux then—I took a proof of the back-plate, and he did not like it—he said it was not good, and begged I would alter it, but he would show it to the gentleman it was for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you said before, they objected to the back-plate, and you agreed to make another, and some time after you took the same plate, not a new one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I took the original ones.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you do when you went with them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left one of them, I think the front, but I cannot be sure—Ramuz called several times prior to the officers taking them, about other business which I was doing for them, cards and card-plates—I kept the back-plate by me—on the day they were taken into custody, which was on a Thursday, I went to their house, about half-past three o'clock, and saw Mazeaux and Ramuz</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184012140064"/>
               <p>—they were both standing at the door—I went into the back-parlour with them—I gave into the hands of Mazeaux the front-plate, which he had previously brought back to me—(the back-plate was at my house then)—they said they wanted the thing finished—I went there that day, by arrangement with the officers—the officers came in soon after I got there—these impressions, marked "B, D, E, G, and K," were pulled off from the plates, and are similar to those I gave the prisoners at different times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver—I am at present lodging in Lon<lb/>don, but my residence is in Bath. In August last I was in Mr. Salt's employ<lb/>ment, and was there when the prisoner Mazeaux came there—he produced this note, and another with the figure "5" in the corner—it was of a similar appearance to this, the same language, I should say, but I rather think it was printed in blue—Mazeaux asked Mr. Salt if he could execute a paper similar to that—MR. Salt asked me if I thought I could do it—I said I thought I could, and Mr. Salt told Mazeaux he could do it—I remember Mazeaux saying something about the price being no object—he left the two papers on that occasion—he came again, I think, the next day, but I will not be quite positive, and took away the paper with the figure "5" in the corner—he left the other—I do not remember any thing that passed be<lb/>tween him and Mr. Salt at that time—after that I saw Mazeaux and Ramuz there—they generally came separately—I saw them together once, and they went up stairs to Mr. Salt's bedroom—he was then ill—I do not ex<lb/>actly recollect how soon that was after the one was taken away—I after<lb/>wards went to work on the plate—I engraved both sides, the front and reverse—I did not engrave any part of the border—it is not a sort of work which Mr. Salt did—it is done by a machine, and he is not a machine engraver—I remember being at work on the reverse plate when Mazeaux saw me at it, and he told me to put aside the paper, the original note, in case any one came in—it was at that time lying by my side, while I was working at the plate—these impressions appear to have been taken from the plate I engraved—I remember the, day the prisoners were apprehended—I do not recollect the day, but I remember its happening on a day—I did not see any one in company with them that day—I know the prisoner Rault—Mr. Salt pointed him out to me, (I cannot exactly say the time,) in Princes-street, right opposite Mr. Salt's shop, in the street, looking in at a shop window opposite—that was perhaps about a fortnight before Ramuz and Mazeaux were apprehended.</p>

In consequence of information I received, I went on Thursday, the 8th of October, to No. 22, Church-street, about three o'clock in the afternoon—there was an arrange<lb/>ment made beforehand for our being there—when the front-door was opened I went into the passage and opened the door on the right, which leads into a front parlour—I saw a person standing at the front-window, inside the front-parlour, doing something—I looked, and was turning round, when I saw Ballard open a door which leads into a back-parlour—there is a communication between the two parlours—Ballard was in the front-room at the time he opened the door, the door opened to him, to the best of my recollection, then I walked in, and he followed immedi<lb/>ately with my brother John—(he is an officer—Ballard is not now, he was formerly)—when I went into the back-parlour I saw Mazeaux, Ramuz, and Salt—they were standing nearly all together—I said, "We are officers," and at the same moment I took a plate from the hand of Mazeaux—I marked that plate afterwards—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">the front one</hi>)—the prisoners were brought into the front-parlour, and on a table in the front-parlour I found this border-plate, wrapped up in a piece of pa<lb/>per and this pocket-book—I presented the pocket-book and border-plate to Ramuz and Mazeaux, and said, "Do these belong to you?"—they said "No"—the paper which the border-plate was wrapped in was partly open, so as to be exposed—the pocket-book turned out to belong to Mr. Salt—I searched Mazeaux, but nothing transpired on his person con<lb/>nected with this affair—there was a printing-press in the back-room—I did not find any thing upon it—I took them into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the City officers. On the 8th of Oc<lb/>tober I accompanied Ballard and my brother to the house in Church-street—I went into the back-parlour, and there found Ramuz, Mazeaux, and Salt—I assisted in taking them—I took Ramuz, searched him, and found this note, marked "A," in his breeches-pocket—he did not say any thing—I said we must take them into custody on account of a forgery on the Russian government—they said, "We know nothing at all about it,"</p>

I left home last Thursday even<lb/>ing about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, and am positive I shut the door—I returned at ten minutes before nine, and found the prisoner stand<lb/>ing in my front-parlour, with a drawer open—I asked what he wanted—he said he saw two men go out of the house, and he wanted to know what they wanted—I sent for an officer, and gave him into custody—I missed from the back-parlour a coat, a black silk gown, and a shawl, which had been safe when I went out—I found on the floor a lot of lucifer matches, some burnt, and some unburnt—my door could be opened with a latch-key.</p>

On the night of the 10th of December I saw the prisoner, about twenty minutes to nine o'clock, in company with two others—I knew them all by sight—they were in University-street, Tottenham Court-road, which is two or three minutes' walk from the prosecutrix's house—I saw the prisoner go up to a door-way in University-street, as if he was going to enter the house—there was then a whistle, and he came from the door, and walked on towards the prosecutrix's—I saw the prisoner in custody the same evening—I asked him if he had any <hi rend="italic">screws</hi> about him—he laughed at me—I went to the prosecutrix's house, and in the gutter opposite the door I found this key, but it does not open the prosecutrix's door.</p>

I am a horse-dealer at Hounslow, About half-past ten o'clock on Monday morning, the 30th of November, I saw the two prisoners going along the road to Hounslow, with a mare—they came to the Coach and Horses public-house door, where I was, and had a pint of beer—I went to the door, and said, "That is just such a little nag as I should like to buy"—Glew said it was for sale—I asked him the price—Hale said he was going to have it killed—it did not quite look like a dog-horse—I walked with them down to my house, and had the mare taken into my yard—I asked Hale what he wanted for it, where he brought it from, and who it belonged to—he said he brought it from Mr. William Hall's, of Whiphill, I think, near Guildford, but that he had then come from a public-house just out of Hounslow—Hale said I was to give the money, and put down on a piece of paper what money I gave for the horse, so that he should take it home to a relation of his—I told him I would go along with him to the public-house he said he had brought it from—Glew walked off towards London—I put the mare into the stable—and Hale went towards where he said the public-house was—when we got within about five yards of the station, I told him we had better walk in there, and we could see about it—he said "No, I won't," and started off, and ran towards Kingston—I could not follow him, having the gout—I directly gave information to the police at the station—(I saw Hale in cut<lb/>tody on Wednesday week, and knew him to be the man)—I gave Glew in charge the same day, about two hours after—he was coming by my door while I was giving the policeman a description of the mare—I walked out, and said, "That is one of the men, take him"—I said to him, "What have you done with your mate?"—he said he had not seen him—I asked if he had sold his little nag—he said he did not know, he had not seen him—I asked him if he was acquainted with Hale—he said no, he never saw him in his life, till he came up against that public-house, and asked him to have some beer—I am positive he is the man—I had never seen him be<lb/>fore</p>

On Tuesday night, the 24th of November, before twelve o'clock, I was at the Pavilion theatre—I was returning home to my lodging—I turned into Angel-alley, and in the alley I met the prisoner—I knew her before, but was never in her company—she asked me to give her some money—I told her I had got none to give her—she then hit me in the lip with her fist, then put her hand in my bosom, and took my purse out—there was no money in it—it was a blue purse, with white stripes on it—I turned back to go a different way home, to get out of her way—I did not strike her at all—she followed me, and hit me, at the corner of Osborne-street, across the nose and in the eye—she then undid the string of my bonnet, and threw me down in the mud—I did not fall from the blow—she threw me down when she hit me, to undo my bonnet, to take it off my head—she broke the string, and took it right off—she ran away, leaving me there—there were a good many people present when she ran away—she took my bonnet with her—I went home—I made no charge against her next day—I could not come out till Friday, because my face was so bruised—I came out on Friday, and saw her in Angel-alley—she spoke to me first, and began to abuse me again, calling me names—she did not strike me again—I then gave her in charge—I did not see any body present when she struck me and broke my bonnet-string—the bonnet had a feather in it—I have not seen the feather again—I had never spoken to her before, but I had seen her walking the street—my occupation and hers are the same.</p>

On Tuesday, the 24th of November, I had been to the Pavilion, and had a quartern of gin with the prosecutrix—we were both quite sober, I am certain—she left me to go home, just by the Pavilion, in Wnitechapel-road—I live in the same house with her, but in a different room—I came home about a quarter to one o'clock—Phillips was then at home, and crying—her face was bruised—she was saying when I came home, "Don't tell Mary Ann"—(she was afraid to tell me)—I said, "I don't want to know any of your secrets," but two or three minutes afterwards I asked her how it happened, and she sat down in a chair, burst out crying, and told me all about it—on the Tuesday night she had on a straw bonnet, lined with Persian silk, and the outside trimmed with velvet—I did not see that bonnet after she parted with me that night—I went out with her on the Friday follow<lb/>ing, and saw the prisoner standing in the alley—Phillips said, "That is the girl that stole my bonnet," loud enough for the prisoner to hear—the prisoner began to abuse her, and call her names—we walked down the court together, and saw a policeman at the bottom, and Phillips gave her in charge.</p>

The prisoner lived servant with me for about three months—on the 3rd of December I gave her in charge for stealing two pairs of boots in the middle of the night, as we heard a door slam—the answer she made was, "I did not take them in the middle of the night, I took them on Sunday night when you were out"—I had not told her it would be better for her to tell me—I then searched her bed, and found two pairs of boots, and three yards of very fine flannel—I found in her box a pair of black stockings—this flannel was cut off a piece that was measured and put up stairs—it was never brought into the shop for sale—I missed exactly this quantity from it.</p>

Elizabeth Saxby, who lodged at my house, was in the habit of bringing down her time-piece and stand, and placing it in the parlour, as it would not go in a room where there was no fire—she was taking tea with us that day, and when we had</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Clayton William Ward, who keeps a beer-shop in East-street, Walworth, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. On Saturday night, the 28th of November, I was serving in the bar the whole evening, my husband being ill in bed—I remember the prisoners coming in together—they looked round the tap-room, said there was very little fire, and walked out again within five minutes—they had ordered something, but said, "Never mind," and went out—Hardiman walked into the tap-room again in five minutes, looked round, and walked out again—I went to bed about one o'clock—I locked the till, and put the key into my pocket—there was a considerable quantity of copper money in it, some of which I can positively swear to—about seven in the morning my boy alarmed me—I went down stairs, and found the tap-room window open—it is a double window—when I went to bed the sashes of that window were down—I found the till wide open, and a desk which had not been locked was ransacked, and a particular shilling of the reign of George the Second taken out—our premises are next to Mr. Keller's, whose yard comes near our window—any person in his premises could get over the fence, and open the window—we lost from 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in copper money, and not less than 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and about two pounds of cheroots—we gave information at the station, and on Sunday morning between ten and eleven, the policeman produced some money to me.</p>

Ward gave me information, and I went with another constable, and took the prisoners at No. 1, Pleasant-place, East-lane—we found Hardiman in bed, and Dalton concealed in the privy, both in the same house—the other constable found 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, under Hardiman's head in bed, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver was found on Dalton, at the bottom of his trowsers—I went back and searched the privy, and found 108 cheroots thrown down into the soil—MRS.

                  </hi>. On the 2nd of December I was at the Dun Horse pub<lb/>lic-house, in the Borough, and saw the prisoner and James Redman there with some friends—they were all drinking together—the rest went away about half-past seven o'clock, leaving the prisoner and Redman alone—there was no quarrelling before that, but they were very comfortable together—both the prisoner and Redman were drunk—they went out about half an hour after their friends, then returned to the bar, and the prisoner quarrelled with Redman, and knocked him down in the corner of the room—he hit him on the side of the head before the bar, quite at the door, in the doorway—I only saw one blow struck—Redman did not make any blow at all, but laid his head down, and covered his head with his hands—the prisoner did not strike or kick him while on the ground—not inside the house—the land-lord came from behind the bar, and caught hold of the prisoner, and with my assistance, put him outside, and kept Redman inside—the prisoner, when he was outside, said, "I will wait for him till he comes out, if it is two hours, but what I will have my revenge," using bad language—I stopped there till about half-past ten, which might be an hour and a half—Redman went away about half an hour after we turned the prisoner out—he went out by himself, and I saw no more of him.</p>

               <p>—he then stooped down to lift Redman up, and the people finding I knew him, several said, "This is the man, (referring to the prisoner,) who has knocked him down, and been stamping upon him"—he did not deny it, but put himself in a fighting posture, and said to one of them, "Are you go<lb/>ing to take it up?"—I told him to be quiet, or we should put him in the watch-house—he replied, "Oh! I shall not flinch"—at that moment the policeman said the man's leg was broken, and I saw it was so—I told him to take care of Betts—Redman was taken to Guy's Hospital on a stretcher.</p>

Clark came up directly after, and his evidence is, correct—I went with the policeman to the station with the prisoner—I am sure the prisoner is the man who was beating him—he appeared in liquor.</p>

About two o'clock in the morning of the 1st of December, I went to Woodland-street, Dalston, where Bird (Redman's mother) lives—I saw her in bed—after searching a room, which was pointed out by the husband as Redman's room, I asked Bird if she had seen her daughter bring home any mouseline-de-laine dresses, or shawl, or had seen her in possession of any watches—she said she had not brought any there, and she had only seen her with a gilt watch, and if her daughter had done any thing wrong, she was innocent—I searched the house again, about five-o'clock in the afternoon, after the examination be<lb/>fore the Magistrate, and in the front parlour, which was Bird's room, I found in the neck of a bottle, thrust in as a cork, three duplicates, one for a watch, pledged for five guineas—I then questioned Bird—I said I had information of some mouseline-de-laine shawls and watches being brought home—she most solemnly denied that such things had been brought there—on the following Friday I went and found this dress there—I said to Bird, "I have called once more to know if you still persist in your story, that your daughter has brought nothing home?"—she said she had not—I said, "Have you not redeemed any thing since then?"—she said, "Oh, my God! I have, I did it to save my daughter"—this dress had been pledged while Redman was under examination, and redeemed that night.</p>
