I carry on business as the London Musical Agency, 71, Hatton Garden, London—I complained on several occasions to the post-office of letters addressed to the London Musical Agency—on the morning of 30th June I was on the watch for the delivery of letters; I received five letters from the prisoner about half-past 11 or 20 to 12—the letters found in his pocket were not delivered nor tendered to me—a letter was tendered and refused, I believe that of the 27th June is the one—these are my advertisements.</p>

On 21st June I was in plain clothes on an omnibus passing through Dawes Road—I received infor<lb/>mation, got out, and found Mayne struggling with the prisoner, who was very violent—I interfered, and then Rose came up—the prisoner tried to bite Rose's leg and also in the privates—it took seven policemen to take him to the station.</p>

I am divisional surgeon of police—on 21st June, about 10 p.m., I was called to Walham Green Police-station to examine Mayne—I found he had a wound on the knee, an injury to the left thigh, an abrasion on the right knee, a bruise on the left side, the back of the neck bruised, both eyes blackened, and a cut on the left thumb, and a slight cut on the back of the head—he was seriously injured, and is still on the sick-list—he got a month's leave from the chief surgeon on Saturday.</p>

I am a hosier, of 100, Newgate Street—on 28th June, about 11,45, the prisoner came in and my assistant served him, but I was very close—he asked for a collar at 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and tendered a florin—Wilson took it from him and passed it to the cashier, who gave the change, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the prisoner left—he came back in about five minutes, asked Wilson for a collar, and tendered another florin—I went up and bent it with my teeth and found it was bad—this is it—I said "Oh, this is the second time you have been in here this morning on this game, is it?"—he said "It has nothing to do with me, it is the man across the road you must look after"—I said "Very well, point him out through the window, and I will catch him; I don't want to lock you up if you are not to blame"—he did not offer to go to the window—he wanted to go outside, but I prevented him—he said he had to go on an errand for his master, and wanted to get away—he did not say that the collars were for his master—I called a barman in and left him with the prisoner, and went to the door and heard the prisoner stumble against a box, and turned back and held him, seeing it was not safe to leave him with the barman—he said "He was over there"—a constable came up and I gave him in charge, saying "If it is, a man across the road, con<lb/>stable let him point him out to you"—the prisoner said "He was here just now"—I afterwards looked in my till and found another bad florin; that was the only florin there, but I found another on the desk by itself.</p>

I am a solicitor, of 2, Exchange Buildings—on 1st July the prisoner called at my office and stated that he had purchased some property in the Mile End Road, that he had agreed to re-sell it a profit to a friend of his, and asked me whether. I would act for the lady from whom he had purchased, as well as himself, in preparing the agree<lb/>ment for the re-sale—he said he would bring the purchaser, and did so the next day—he saw me alone first and said "I have arranged for my<lb/>self to receive the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, that will be all right, won't it?"—I said "I can say nothing about that until I have seen the purchaser"—I then had the purchaser in my room, in the prisoner's presence, and cautioned him against paying anything to the vendor until the title was shown to be satisfactory—the prisoner refused to complete, and I then arranged for the prisoner to receive the money which he had paid to Mrs. Margaret Horton, as he alleged, which was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he received from my cashier in my presence—the prisoner then said "I will bring you the deeds to<lb/>morrow, so that you can prepare the title"—he did not bring them—he produced the agreement and the receipt—the agreement was dated 1st In July, 1884, and purported to be made between Margaret Horton, of 67, High Street, Romford, Essex, of the one part, and himself of the other part—on the faith of that I prepared the agreement between himself and the prosecutor, whereby the prisoner agrees on demand to assign to the prosecutor all interest in the memorandum of agreement made 1st July, 1881—this was in consideration of the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to the prisoner as</p>

                  </hi>. I am a travelling clerk in the Confidential Inquiry Department of the General Post Office—about the 9th of July I went down to the South-Eastern District in consequence of reports from that branch in Blackman Street, accompanied by Mr. Wooder and con<lb/>stable Bick; we got there about 5 in the morning; the employee were at their work sorting letters—the prisoner was employed at that branch and was sorting letters at one of the sorting tables—we placed ourselves in a position were we could see the prisoner at work, about six yards from him, in a slanting direction, looking down, not in the same office; I had a clear view of what he was doing—he continued sorting at the table till about 6.30, when he went to clear in the letters at the different walks—he went to the packet table and brought away a basket of packets and newspapers, which he brought to his seat, where he was arranging his letters for delivery—in sorting the packets I saw him take a small packet, take his pencil from his ear, and deliberately break the packet open at one end; he shook it and placed it on the third tier on his table, there are four tiers at his seat, and he covered it over with some papers—it was a small thin packet about two inches long—shortly afterwards he took the packet again from under the papers, and with his pencil he probed the inside of it—I saw him place the pencil down as if he was moving something—he again shook it and replaced it on the third tier—I also saw him examine some other packets in a very suspicious way, about 7 o'clock he tied up his letters for delivery; he took up his bag from his desk, shook it, it was perfectly empty; he then placed his letters in the bag, and with them this packet—I am quite confident that no one touched his bag but himself—he left the office about ten minutes past 7 to go out on his delivery—that was his regular time—he had no one to help him—I afterwards left the office and saw him on his delivery, and afterwards I saw him in the Blackfriars Road by the Surrey Theatre, he had then completed his delivery—I was accompanied by Mr. Wooder and Bick—I stopped the prisoner and said "Kirkpatrick, we belong to the</p>

               <p>General post Office, you must come back with us"—he looked at us, hesitated a little, and then said "I will give up what I have in my bag, I have been tested, some one put the packets into my bag"—I said "You had better not say anything now, wait till we get to the office and then I will tell you what we saw you do this morning"—on arriving at the office he was taken into the Postmaster's room; I then told him who we were, and said "I saw you break open a packet this morning with your pencil, and afterwards put it into your bag and take it out of the office"—he said "When I finished my delivery in Peabody Buildings I shook out my bag and two sovereigns dropped on the ground"—he then produced these fragments of a packet, and said "Some-one put them into my bag this morning"—I said "No one touched your bag but yourself, and we are here in consequence of what I saw you do last night; when you finished your delivery at Fuller's Dye Works in Blackfriars Road, I saw you take a packet from your pouch and put it into your left-hand trousers pocket"—he said "No"—I said "I dis<lb/>tinctly saw you, I was standing close to you at the time"—he afterwards said "I will tell you all about it; the packet contained a cigar, which I smoked, I don't know what became of the cover"—I had seen him do this—the officer then searched the prisoner and produced these frag<lb/>ments, which together form a packet addressed to Mr. A.H. Lee, 21, Great Bland Street, Great Dover Street—one sovereign and two half-sovereigns were found in his pocket—I said "Is that the money which came out of that packet?"—he said "Yes"—on looking at these portions of the packets I found there were marks of pencil which would be caused by probing it as I have described—his bag was then turned out and another packet was found intact, which was addressed to Mrs. Jackson, 23, Great Bland Street, Great Dover Street—that had not been opened—it was not in his delivery, quite in an opposite direction—he was asked to account for that second packet being in his bag—he said it had been put there, but I told him no one had touched his bag but himself—that packet contained this pair of gold earrings—I saw it opened at the police-court—the prisoner was told that he would be charged with stealing, and he was asked if he had anything to say—he made no reply.</p>

I am a solicitor—during the initiation of the divorce proceedings in November, 1882, up to the granting of the decree <hi rend="italic">nisi</hi> in 1883 I was a clerk in my brother's employ—he was at that time a solicitor in practice, and was acting as solicitor to Dr. Durant—I had the entire conduct of the divorce proceedings—from time to time I saw Dr. Durant and received instructions from him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the brief for advice on evidence which I submitted to Dr. Pritchard—it states "He, the petitioner, had never removed from his military port until he left India for good except for one or two short excursions to England"—I drew that statement from what was said to me by the defendant—he had informed me that he had been from time to time in England on leave—in consultation with him I showed him these instruc<lb/>tions for advice on evidence and the opinion of Dr. Pritchard—I was not present at the time when he gave evidence when the decree <hi rend="italic">nisi</hi> was obtained, I was unable to be present from illness—to the best of my belief a clerk of ours was present at the time, he is no longer in our service—Dr. Durant informed me that he was in England several times between the time his wife left him in 1862 and August 1882.</p>

               <p>the only copy brief I have was given to Sir Hardinge Giffard with other papers—I did not know when the petition was tried in June, 1883, that the defendant was engaged to be married to a lady at Carlisle—I never knew that he was engaged—I did not know that he was married till the delivery of the plea to the Queen's Proctor, not before—he did not tell me he was going to be married—I knew that he was living at Carlisle I don't believe that the absence from India is mentioned in the proof, but I will look—I didn't know that it was a material point at that time—I don't consider it material—this is the brief I gave to Mr. Inder<lb/>wick—I don't believe the absence from India is in the brief—I believe it arose on the evidence—the defendant never asked me whether he could marry before the decree was made absolute.</p>

My address at Manchester is 10, India Buildings, Cross Street—I reside at 249, Upper Brook Street, Manchester, I occupy the whole house—I am not married—no action for seduction was over brought against me, I swear that—I once had an action entered against me for breach of promise of marriage, which came to nothing—I had no action, civil or criminal, against me with respect to women—I served my time to a business, I was not a servant—I have not brought an action or got 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damages for wrongful dismissal—there was an action for breach of contract when I was a partner with Mr. Blakeley as agents for a house in Egypt, five or six years ago—I am not in partner<lb/>ship with Mr. Blakeley now; I am now in partnership with Mr. Thomas Whitworth, of Manchester—I joined him last September—it is possible that in January last I may have requested Mr. Tilbury to come to Man<lb/>chester to look at a horse that was lame; he was in the habit of calling on me, I had known him about two years travelling for dealers, and he called on me for orders—he may have broken a horse for me at Manchester in January, 1884—I cannot say how many horses I had then, it varies, sometimes more, sometimes less—I remember his looking at a lame chestnut of mine; he constantly looked at my horse's when he came to Manchester—I had a bay horse called Baron—I did not specially put horses under his treatment; I treated him as a friend—he gave me medical receipts for the horses, which I have—I lent him money and took an engagement from him—the first item, I believe, was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about the middle of March, I think, it was suggested that I should take the financial arrangement of the business, and that Mr. Johnson, the manager of the Capital and Counties Bank, should in future honour my cheques—I was not aware at that time that I was a partner in the firm; the firm was Tilbury and Sons, that was the only name I knew of; I was the only person to sign cheques after I found that Mr. Tilbury was very irregular, either from negligence or otherwise—I cannot remember any special entries in the cashbook—the books will be produced</p>

               <p>in proper course, and will show what entries were made; I cannot re<lb/>member individual entries—I did not spend a night with a lady in Leicester Square and put it down in the cash book as "8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expenses and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. luncheon," I will swear that, it is a fiction—it is not true that on the 18th April I prayed Mr. Tilbury to overlook my extravagance; there was no such discussion, he had nothing to do with what money I chose to spend—there were no moneys of the firm—I had my own money—I cannot possibly say whether I drew 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the banking account of the firm in one week, it may have been so, all the money in the bank was mine, and I drew what I liked—I put money in with a view of helping the business along, tending Mr. Tilbury was irregular—it was my private money—the account was opened as Tilbury's, and he signed a paper that from that date he ceased to sign cheques; before that it was his account, and he had the right to draw—I cannot tell you too what was drawn from the business from day to day—I cannot tell the largest amount I took in one week—I most certainly swear that I did not ever draw to a large amount and apply to Tilbury to overlook my extravagance; he may have said "I would rather be by myself in business, as I do all the work and you have all the pleasure and the money"—Mrs. Tilbury was confined wiihin a few days of the 2nd of May; she shut a cupboard where there were medicines made up for which there were orders, and she refused to give up the keys to Dawson and myself, and I told him he must break open the cupboard and get them—I did not put my fist in Mrs. Tilbury's face—I cannot say what Dawson did—I gave Tilbury in charge on 25th April for stealing a mare for which I had the receipt, and produced it at the police-court; the police thought there was not sufficient evidence to sustain it, and they would not take the charge; they made him deliver up the mare—it was in the public roadway that I gave him in charge; I asked him for the mare first—he was detained a short time at the station, I could not say how long; while he was there I took away a horse of mine and a saddle—I had a pass key—there were two horses taken away and some saddlery, I could not say exactly; nothing else that I remember—he threatened to remove goods and to injure my horses—I did not break into his wife's bedroom a day or after her confinement—the girl was in the bedroom on the 2nd of May to superintend the inventory—I did not close the door, it has hinges that naturally go to quickly of itself, without being pushed—I was in the neighbourhood of the room from a quarter to half an hour—I took Wheeler on for a time; he is not in my employ at present—I did not treat horses, I have nothing to do with the business that Tilbury carried on, it was dissolved—Wheeler was paid his wages when I managed the finances of the business, I think a guinea a week, I cannot say—Dawson said not been paid anything, and I paid has arrears after the trial began, something like 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have paid Dawson 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week because he had a certain salary with maintenance—they are not in my employ—I was appointed receiver, and I had to appoint such servants as were necessary to wind up the business, and in that way they have received what was right and proper.</p>

               <p>how much I have given to Miss Tilbury—I will not swear whether she was alone when I gave it her—before May 2nd she made complaints to me of being uncomfortable at home; I sympathised with her as any ordinary man would, and said, "I am very sorry for you"—I said it was a pity to see a family in that way and the girl suffering—she told me she intended to leave home and go to service, and she was very unhappy at home—I didn't dissuade her one way or the other, I left her to her own devices—no one suggested that she should be in the room for the purpose of making the inventory—she was the person who had charge of the linen—I don't think she complained of her father on that occasion, I am not certain she did not, I was too busy taking the inventory—I cannot say where it is—I wished her to see that I took only what belonged to me—I don't think the son was in the house at the time, I cannot say whether he was or not—I went to the place the next day to see how things were going on—I was talking to Dawson the whole while I was there and looking road the stable—to the best of my recollection there were only two horses there then—Captain Bradley's house is two or three hundred yards off—I have a witness to prove which way I went to Bridge House—I swear that I did not see Miss Tilbury that morning about 10 o'clock—I drove all the way to London—I first knew that she was at Moore's cottage when I called there at 7 that evening—Wheeler told me she had left or run away—I don't think he said he had taken her to the cottage, I can't say—I went with Wheeler and Dawson there in consequence of the message Wheeler gave me—Wheeler gave me the message to the best of my belief—I knew then that she had left her home—I saw her; I didn't tell Tilbury that I had seen her, that was not my business, I was not on speaking terms with him—I couldn't say when I gave Wheeler the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I believe it was two or three days after he said he had given her money and could not get it from her—no letter was written by Miss Tilbury when I was at the cottage; I first heard of the letter when I was charged before the Edgware Magistrates, Wheeler had not mentioned it to me to my recollection—I went to London by the afternoon train; I was not in the village all day; I was with Captain Bradley most of the time.</p>

I am a groom engaged at Bridge House—I was there on Saturday, 3rd May, and about 7 a.m. saw Mr. Belcher there—he went away about ten minutes past 8—I next saw him on Saturday evening about half-past 10 I believe—I went to the cottage, I saw him there at 7 o'clock—I had a conversation with Florence Tilbury on that Saturday; it was that Bertie came and told her her father was going to beat her when he came home, and he thought he would punish her and half murder her, and she asked me to protect her—I had known Mrs. Moore when she was single and lived at Tring, she is a young married woman; I took the girl there.</p>

On Friday, 24th June, at 7 p.m., I went to Broad Street and saw Creed there—I kept observation on the parcel room, and about 8.30 the prisoners came into the station, each carrying a parcel; Gill went towards the train and Doidge to the cloak-room, and the porter gave him this parcel; he went towards the train and showed it to Gill on the platform; Gill patted him on the shoulder in a familiar way, and they both went by train to Dalston—I followed them to 11, flayland Road, Stoke Newington—Gill opened the door and Doidge followed—I went quickly on Doidge's heels; Gill turned round and asked me what I wanted—I said, "I am a police-officer, and I want you to account to me for the possession of that parcel"—we all three walked into the parlour, and I said to Doidge, "Can you account to me for the possession of that parcel?"—he said, "Me, sir? I am only the porter, that is my master," pointing to Gill—I said to Gill, "Is that so?"—he said, "Yes, he does odd jobs for me"—I said, "Then perhaps you can account for the possession of it?"—he said, "I bought it of a man at the Old Burton public-house, Honey Lane Market"—that is in Cheap<lb/>side—I said, "Do you know the man?"—he said, "I know him by sight, I do not know his name, and I don't know where his shop is"—I said, "Do you know if he has got a shop, or whether he is employed by anybody?"—he said, "I don't know, I think he does a bit on his own account"—I said, "How much did you give him for it?"—he said "2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "Had you ordered the goods from him?"—he said, "I ordered the trimmings, and he brought the parcel to-night and told me that there was some other stuff in it, could I do with it? I said, 'Yes, I can't pay you for it because I don't know what it contains'"—I said, "It is hardly satisfactory, and you will both have to go to the City with me"—I got a cab, and on the way to the City said to Gill, "What do the other two parcels contain?"—he said, "Fur also"—I said, "Where did you get them from?"—he said, "I bought them of the same man"—I said, "How much did you give him for them?"—he said that he could not tell me the price or what class of fun they were, as he bought them at odds and ends within the week—I said, "Have you got any invoice to show me for these goods?"—he said "No"—I took them to the station and went to see the firm, but they had gone—I went again next morning with Outram, and Dinwoldie, who has since died, was brought into the office—I took him to the station, where he was charged, and on the 25th he was charged at the Mansion House, and asked in the other prisoner's presence whether he had any<lb/>thing to say, and he pleaded guilty.</p>

I am a tailor, and live at 1A, Wimpole Street, Cavendish Square—on Sunday night, 1st June, I spent the evening at the house of a friend in King Henry's Walk, Islington—I left shortly before midnight—I walke with a friend to High Street, Islington, where my friend left me, and I walked alone down Pentonville Road—about half-past 12 o'clock I passed a beershop at the corner of Hermes Street—I saw several men there, one standing against an iron lamp-post; and as I passed he threw the whole weight of his body against me and knocked me down on my back, I am suffering from the effects of it now—as soon as I was on the ground I was surrounded by from eight to a dozen men and women, mostly men—they tore my watch and chain away and tore off the head of my scarf-pin; they couldn't get the pin, because it has a screw—this is the remaining part of it; it was a diamond horse-shoe pin, and the horse-shoe part was taken—I recognise Barnum and Bailey as two of the men, and I believe Smith was present, but I won't swear to him—Barnum tore the things away while the others held me down by the arms, legs, and shoulders—I caught hold of Bailey's legs he called out to leave go—I said I should not—I halloed out, and a constable came after some time, after I regained my legs, and they ran away—the value of the property I lost was about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the following Saturday, 7th June, I went with the police to a public-house on Pentonville Hill by the sign of George the Fourth—I saw from a dozen to 18 men there and picked Barnum out immediately and gave him in custody—after he had been taken to the station I went to another public-house and there saw Bailey with four or five others—I picked him out and gave him in custody.</p>

(that means a man losing a gold watch and chain; a "red light" means gold, a "white light" means silver.) "I said 'No,' he said, 'Me and my <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> got it, pointing to a tall fellow on his right like me,' but what is the use of all this? if the prosecutor says I am the man, I know I am in for it."</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner—on 8th July, about 9.30, I examined the child, and thought it better to examine her again by daylight, which I did next day—she was suffering from an incised wound of the perineum, which is between the vagina and the rectum—it was a clean-cut wound, and must have been done with some sharp instrument—it was about a quarter of an inch long, and a cor<lb/>responding depth—a quantity of blood would flow—on 9th July Sergeant James showed me this knife—it was stained and imperfectly washed—I formed the opinion that the stains were blood—the outer parts were wounded—it was right at the back of the lapis.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Albert Scott, of Uxbridge—on 19th June the prisoner had been in my service nearly three weeks as domestic servant—I had four children then—on 19th June, at nearly 4 p.m., I sent her out with my little daughter, Lottie Marian, aged one year and 11 months, in a perambulator—I told her to go and meet two of my children from school—their ages are nearly six and nearly five—I also gave her a letter to post—my two children returned from school alone, about 5.30, and about 6.30 Mr. Ginns, a neighbour, brought back the perambulator with the dead body of my child Lottie in it—Mrs. Burn came in and untied this scarf (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the child's neck—she called my attention to the way the scarf was tied; it was put round and drawn back and tied in a double knot—it was twice round—she had no scarf round her neck when she went out; it belongs to the prisoner, and she had it on when she went out—I did not see her again till she was in custody—about a quarter of an hour after the child was brought home Dr. Davidson came and examined it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was in the habit of taking the child out, and on the Sunday before she took two of the children to chapel—the baby was fastened into the perambulator with a strap under her arms—the elder children usually took their tea about 5 o'clock, sometimes later—both children wore a scarf, I believe—the prisoner was to take the letter to the post-office to get a stamp, and not to the pillar-box at the corner—the prisoner always seemed kind to the children—she was fond of reading—I did not notice that she took out two books with her when she went out—in the evening the letter I had given to her was restored to me without a stamp and unposted.</p>

I live with my father at Park Road, Hillingdon, nearly opposite Grove Road—on 19th June, about 5.30 p.m., I was sitting at my gate facing the road and saw the prisoner and a perambulator standing still four or five yards beyond Chippendale Alley—the perambu<lb/>lator was in the road, and I could see that there was a child in it—Mrs. Scott's two other children were a few yards in front of the perambu lator coming towards me—they went on and went into their father's house, and the prisoner wheeled the perambulator towards the Eight Bells public-house and kept near Mrs. Watford's wall till I lost sight of her.</p>

I live at 19, Edge Street, Notting Hill, and am a dustman—on the afternoon of 15th July, about half-past 3, I was in the Dudley Arms public-house—the prisoner came in and had some drink with a baby in her arms—after she had finished her drink she kissed her baby and said, "We are both well prepared for it"—she then went out—I went out after her—she went over the canal bridge on to the towing-path, and when I got on to the bridge I saw both the prisoner and baby in the water of the canal about 6 feet from the side—I went on to the towing-path, jumped in, and pulled them both out—the water where they were when I got them out was about between 5 and 6 feet; in the middle it is 7 or 8 feet—a policeman came up.</p>

About half-past 3 on Tuesday, 15th July, I went to North Wharf Road, where I saw the prisoner all wet—she said, "Here I am, policeman, take me to the station"—I took her to the station, where I heard her make a statement—she was asked why she jumped into the water—she said, "I jumped into the water to drown myself and baby, as I was leading a miserable life which I was tired of, and we were better dead than alive, as the man I was living with has been sharpening a knife to kill me, as some one had told him I was unfaithful to him"—that was all she said—when I first saw her and took her to the station I did not see the baby; it was at the station all wet when I got there—I sent for Dr. Westmacott to attend to it—the child was alive, and got all right.</p>

After Glover was in custody Salmon came to the House of Detention—I and Sergeant Martle followed him when he left, to 39, Lomard Street, where we went into a back parlour, and there saw him in the act of taking hold of this black Glad-stone bag, as if about to walk out with it—I asked him "How do you account for your presence here?"—he hesitated and did not reply for a moment—the landlady, Mrs. Kartell, came in—I asked her if she knew this man—she said "Yes, he is a man that came with another man named Thomas, and took this room on 8th December last; they continued living there, paying 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; Salmon left after a time, and up to that date he used to visit Glover there, who lived there as Thomas."—she also stated that he took a brown ulster, a Gladstone bag and hat case on Saturday, stating he had a note authorising him to do so from his friend Thomas—he did not acquaint her where he was at the time—after that Salmon took us to his lodging at 136, Fonthill Road, Finsbury Park—on the way there I asked him "Have you got any other property at your place?"—he said "No more whatever, the only property I have is the bag and hat case I took on Saturday"—I went to Fonthill Road—he took me into his rooms and pointed out the bag and hat case which he said he had taken away on Saturday. (<hi rend="italic">The hat case was that identified by Captain Noel; the bag was not identified</hi>)—I then searched the room with Sergeant Martle—we found a quantity of property, and five Gladstone bags under the bed—on finding them I said "Halloa, Salmon, how do you account for these?"—he said "You have got me now, I thought this man was a respectable man, I understood him to be an American journalist"—I understood him to be referring to Glover alias Thomas—I then took took him into custody to the station, and then went back with Martell to Fonthill Road and to Lomard Street—I found the property which has been identified by Captain Noel in the room occupied by Salmon, some in the drawers, and a portion in one of the bags—I also found there the things identified by Major Odie—there was a red book and a paint box identified by Mr. Odie found in the bag he was about to remove from Glover's lodgings in Lomard Street—the things identified by Mr. Scaris-brick were found partly at Fonthill Road and partly at Lomard Street—Martle also found at Fonthill Road some articles which have been identified by Mr. Macfie, who is present.</p>

At 10 minutes to 1 o'clock on the morning of 28th June I was on duty in the Borough Road—I saw the prisoner there, and in consequence of having heard of the robbery and receiving a description, I took him into custody—I told him I should take him into custody on a charge of being concerned with one James Buchanan—the prisoner said "I know nothing about it; they think I am in this, but I am right out of it"—I did not say when it had hap<lb/>pened—he said "They think they know a lot, but they know nothing"—I found on him two paragraphs cut from a newspaper; they were reports of the case against Buchanan at the police-court and Old Bailey.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman X</hi> 21). On 19th July I was living at Springfield House, Wands worth Road, taking care of it for Mr. Percy Gye, and about 5.40 a.m. I was in bed and heard glass break in the adjoining room—I got up and saw a door open leading into the adjoining bedroom—there is a window there—I dropped on the floor and saw the prisoner looking out at the window—he stopped there about a minute and turned round and walked round the room—I went to the door, pulled back the bolt, and it rattled—he rushed back into the room he first came from—finding the door closed I went to the back of the house and saw him coming out at the window leading on to the lawn—as soon as he dropped to the ground I knocked him down, and then took him into the house while I dressed myself—he looked round, and seeing my uniform hanging up he said "I beg your pardon, Sir, I was hard up; I would not have come here if I knew there had been a policeman here"—I found a window broken leading to the store-room; the catch was turned, and it was open—I had locked the house up about 11 o'clock and fastened that window with two bolts and the catch in the middle—two guns had been taken off a shelf and placed under the window—it was daylight.</p>

I received the prisoner when he was brought to the station about 6 o'clock a.m.—he said "I got in at the fanlight; give me a chance, inspector, make it housebreaking instead of burglary"—I examined the premises and found a window on the ground-floor broken so that a hand could be put in and the bolts drawn back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did not enter the premises with a criminal inten<lb/>tion, but only to get a lodging, because I had walked from Bristol and had parted with all I had got. I believed the house was empty. I slept in a cupboard about seven feet by eight for 8 1/2 hours. I broke nothing in entering, the window fell back against two water-pipes. When I woke up I went into the next room, picked up one of the guns, looked along the barrel, and replaced it. I went into the passage and saw two coate hanging up, and finding the house inhabited I got away as quick as I could. I had my hand on the sash and it slipped and broke the window. It is very hard to be convicted of a crime which I did not intend to commit.</p>

I live at 26, Hargwynne Street, Stock well—Adams is my son; he lived with me at home till he was taken in custody—Cobley used to go with him very often—on Saturday, 12th July, about 12.30 in the day, Cobley called on me and asked if I knew about Frank, that is my son—I said, "No, what is the matter with him, has he met with an accident?"—he said, "No, it is worse than that, he got locked up for passing a false cheque"—I said, "Where did he get it from?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "Were you with him?"—he said "Yes"—I asked him if he knew where my son got the cheque from—he said "No"—I went to the station and had some conversation with my son—on Sunday, 13th July, I went to see Cobley at his house, and said, "I have been down to see my son"—he said, "Well, what about it?"—I said, "My son tells me you know where he got the cheques from, and he says that you had part of the money; it is a nice thing you have brought my son into, such disgrace as this"—he said, "Well, if he says so, we can't help it now"—I said, "My son told me the cheques came out of Armstrong's Bank"—he said, "Oh, yes, there have been several cheques out of his bank"—I told Cobley my son said that he had had part of the money—he said, "Yes, I have"—Cobley said at the police-court, Kennington, that he had had 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I suggested that Cobley should go and see Mr. Parish—he said, "Yes, it will be ihe best way to see if we cannot settle it"—he did not say whether he had the money or not—I made an appointment at the White Horse public-house for Monday at 8 o'clock for him to go to Armstrong's to see what they could do in the matter—I kept the appointment and met Cobley, who intro<lb/>duced Reigate to me—I said to Reigate, "You are mixed up in this affair, are you?"—he said, "Yes, unfortunately, they dragged me into it"—I said, "Have you seen Armstrong?"—he said, "No, he is not at home"—I said, "We shall go"—he said, "Yes, you had better go, perhaps"—I went in, and he was not at home—we went across to the public-house opposite, and waited to see if he came in—ultimately Cobley and Reigate were taken in custody—Armstrong called at my house on the Saturday evening; I had never seen him before; he gave me this envelope with his name and address on it, and asked for my son—on the Monday night I went to see him, but he was not at him,—I saw him on</p>
