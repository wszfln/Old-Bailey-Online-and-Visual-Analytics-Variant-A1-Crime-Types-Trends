On Sunday evening. the 6th of April, about ten o'clock, I was going to see my sister, who was dangerously ill - she lives in Green Arbour-court, between Golden-lane and Goswell-street; instead of passing through the court I went through the <placeName id="t18281023-1-crimeloc4">Queen's Head public-house</placeName>

               <p>Q. Where was the landlord's son at this time? A. He was present, near me; and when the scuffle ensued he said,"You had better let the man alone - I know him - he is going to his sister's;" I had told him I was going there on my first entering the house - she lives within fifteen yards of where the hat was taken from me; I did not know Donohough before - there was nobody with him when he took my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men do you think rushed out of the taproom? A. I should think five or six or more; I did not know any of them, to be acquainted with them: I am positive Cotterell is one of those who rushed out of the room- when they all came round me I scuffled with them; they lifted my legs from under me, and carried me into the skittle-ground - I was laid hold of in all parts, and tumbled about, and being struck at the time; I cannot say what part of me they laid hold of in particular, except my legs: I called out - the landlord came, but they had got me on the ground then; they kept me on the ground; as soon as the landlord came I knew his voice, and said would he allow a man to be robbed and ill-treated in that manner - he asked me what my name was; I told him, and he said he did not know me - I said, "If you do not know me then, tell my brother Eatly, who is so close by (he is my sister's husband); he said I might be d - d, or something to that effect, and I must get out of it in the best manner I could; my shoes were off then: I was held by the legs, and beat on the heel of my left foot, to hinder me from hallooing, the pain was so intense, that after a short time I became quite senseless - I was kicked about the loins and the side of my head, and my lip was cut in getting me into the skittle-ground: they took from me there, a blue surtout coat and a pair of shoes - my money was in my waistcoat pocket; they tore my waistcoat off my back: while they were stripping me I was held by the handkerchief, by Cotterell, and he was threatening me during the time, that if I made resistance they would finish me; I told them to take what they liked, but not prevent my getting more (meaning not to hinder me from work) - they left me; and as soon as I recovered, which I suppose was in a few minutes, I got to the door, and got out, but when I got to the door leading from the house to the court, (having nothing on but my trousers, stockings, and shirt,) they kicked me into the gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were all about the place, though not near you? A. They were in different places; one was about the door - I was kicked into the gutter, they saying at the time, "You b - r, we wish we had finished you;" I got up, and said, "I don't care - I have got out safe;" I went to my sister's door - I was bruised about my side, and hurt in the face, but not disabled from doing my business, it not being hard labour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had any thing been done to you when the landlord came? A. My shoes had been taken off, and I was on the ground, on my back, when the landlord spoke to me; I am quite positive of that - he was barely a minute talking to me; this was in the skittle-ground: a glimmer of light came into the skittle-ground at the time the landlord came - a candle was brought in; I am positive of that - I think I mentioned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230004"/>that at the last trial; I have not read what I stated then - I am positive I mentioned it before the Magistrate; it was quite dark of course, but the candle came in and went away - it did not remain there; I believe it was a woman who had it: I said I could not see Donohought assisting to take off my clothes - I will not be certain that I mentioned about the candle on the last trial, as I omitted many trifling things, and made it as short as I could; I do not think I was asked the question - I said I was senseless for a short time; it was a kind of fainting: when they took my property they left me - I cannot say they ran, as I was lying in a dormant state; when I came to myself they were gone from the spot - I had seen Cotterell in the passage; he was one of those who joined at the time I was struggling with Donohough for my hat: I suppose there were five, six, or seven in the passage, or more - the landlord's son was looking on; there was a light from the bar - the passage runs down by the side of the bar, which has a counter and a window, which forms a partition; I have known the landlord eighteen or twenty years. Nothing had been done to me when I struck Donohough, except my hat being taken; I was too much confused to see whether they were drunk or sober: my sister left her room a minute or two after I got there - I cannot say whether she went out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Donohough took your hat before you struck him? A. Yes; when they gave me these blows on the ground I became insensible; when I came to myself I got up to go away, but as I came out they kicked me into the gutter; I cannot speak to Mawley, but there is another not in custody, who I know.</p>

            . My father kept the Queen's Head - he now keeps a potato-shop; I am a lapidary. -On Easter Sunday, the 6th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock, Holland went through the house - he did not speak to me, nor say any thing about his sister; as he came by the bar, going out into Green Arbour-court, Donohough took his hat off - I said "Give the man his hat, or else I will tell the officers of you;" there were no blows struck: I did not see Holland strike him - Holland did not call out for help.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see done? Who came out? A. They were all standing in the passage - I cannot say how many came out of the tap-room; there were five of them altogether: I told the officers who they were - I had seen them coming to the house several times; after Donohough took Holland's hat, he was trying to save it from going - they took hold of him and brought him towards the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean by "They"? A. The thieves who took hold of him and pulled him to the yard door, are not taken: I saw both the prisoners in the passage that night - they stood in the passage; they took hold of me and stopped me from going into the tap-room to tell my father that Holland was being robbed - I heard no words used.</p>
               <p>Q. Not about "Entrails"? you have been examined before. On your oath did you hear nothing about entrails and kicking? A. There was no kicking at all - I have sworn they said "If you speak a word, I will kick your entrails out."</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying you did not hear it? A. I thought you meant if they said it to Holland, they said it to me - I told them to let the man alone; they were then pulling his clothes off, between the passage and the yard door; they took hold of his coat, pulled him to the yard door, and pulled off his coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present when they pulled off his clothes? A. Banks was - he had hold of Holland: the two prisoners kept me from going into the tap-room; I said "Let him alone, because his sister lives in the neighbourhood;" he had not told me he was going to his sister's, but I often saw him going to his sister's, and I thought he was going there when he came through the house - they also took his shoes off; the tap-room is parted from the bar and the passage.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them do any thing to the prosecutor while he was on the ground? A. No: after they took his clothes off, they shoved him down; he was not in the skittle-ground at all, nor within several yards of it - that is the whole truth; I had seen the five or six men in my father's house before, but not to stop, not to sit down to drink - they have drunk at the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you were quite sober? A. Yes; I was there all the time and am certain Holland was not within many yards of the skittle-ground - he was about six yards from it; my father was not present during any part of the transaction - he did not converse with Holland; he knew nothing of it - I was within three yards of Holland.</p>

               <p>Q. Could your father be conversing with Holland for a minute and a half, while he was on the ground, without your seeing it? A. No - he never came there at all, or I must have seen it; I saw Holland at the time his hat was taken off - he did not strike any one then - he could not have struck Donohough two blows in the face without my seeing him; he could have gone to his sister's, without going through our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Cotterell, during this affair, touch Holland at all, or lay violent hands on him? A. He did not, because he had hold of me at the time, to keep me from going to my father; they went away after the transaction - Mrs. Eatly let her brother in, and came into our house in about four minutes; Cotterell was not in the house then - I did not see her conversing with him; I saw her all the time she was in the house - she did not converse with Cotterell at all while she was in the house - that is the truth; she could not converse with him without my seeing her. The young men had been in the house about an hour and a half, before Holland came - they had been drinking ale.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they not been larking about the skittle-ground, with some women of the town? A. No - there were no women at all; they had been shoving each other about the passage, and saying, "I will treat you - I will stand a pot, and you shall stand a pot:" the direct road to Green Arbour-court is through Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know when Mawley was apprehended? A. No; it was a long time after the robbery; I had seen him before the offence, but never afterwards till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you live with your father? A. No - he lives in Whitecross-street - I saw him last night.</p>

            . I am Holland's sister, and live in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230005"/>Green Arbour-court. There is a small narrow alley leading to the house, which two people cannot pass through, or they may go through this house; my brother came to my house on Easter Sunday, about a quarter-past ten o'clock - I was ill at the time; I let him in - he had nothing on but his trousers, stockings, and shirt - no shoes, coat, or waistcoat; he was dirty and his trousers torn - he seemed very much beaten, and as if he had been on the ground; his face was scratched and he had a little scratch on his lip - he told me what had happened when I let him in - I ran to the public-house directly, and called the landlord out of the bar; there were several persons about him - I asked him if he knew any thing of the robbery, and my brother losing his things; he said he knew nothing of it - he was very saucy indeed, and very much in liquor; he called his son and asked if he knew any thing of it, and he said No - he then called the pot-boy, who said he knew nothing of it; I went away - Blower's father came to me next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you see Cotterell there? A. I did - he came up to me and said he knew nothing about it; he came to my house next day, and said he heard I represented him as one of the party, and had come to ask why I said so - my husband was at breakfast and could have taken him, but young Blower had not given his name then: I knew Cotterell before - he is a neighbour, and worked with my husband, (who is a bricklayer) he knew where I lived, and I suppose knew I was Holland's sister.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When the landlord called his son, he said he knew nothing about it? A. Yes; he denied all knowledge of the fact, and the person Mawley was taken about five weeks ago.</p>

            . I am a badge-porter of Lincoln's Inn - it is part of my duty to attend to the security of the Inn in the evening. On the evening of the 13th of October, in consequence of what Morris. Mr. Thompson's clerk, said to me, I went to No. 16, Old-square, and from there to No. 19 - I saw no person there; I went through the passage of that house, to No. 21, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner of No. 21, with a bundle under his arm, in a red handkerchief, with white spots - there was a gas-light within five or six yards of him; I took particular notice of him, and am certain he is the person; I have not the slightest doubt of him - I walked towards him, and when I got within five or six yards of him, he jumped back in the corner, threw the bundle over the rails, and then ran towards Chancery-lane; I followed him, caught him by the arm, and turned him round - he struck at me, got from me, and ran through the passage, towards No. 16 again, and then towards the New-square, but seeing Evans, a porter, coming towards him, he turned to the right, and ran up by the garden wall; I called Stop thief! he kept saying, "It is only a lark - let me go;" one of my fellowservants ran towards him, and Eldridge came up; he went to avoid him, and fell over him - I then secured him; I had not lost sight of him at all, and am positive he is the man who threw the bundle over the rails.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not some turning which the person had to go round? A. None but what I could see him the whole time; he ran up towards No. 9, Old-square, and there I took him - I followed him so close that I never lost sight of him; he only turned one corner, and that is a very wide place, by the Vice Chancellor's Court.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the bundle picked up? A. Yes - it was picked up from the place I saw him throw it, and it appeared to be the same bundle; Mr. Bayley saw it in my presence, and claimed the contents.</p>

At half-past nine o'clock I went to see if our chambers were safe, and saw a person coming down the staircase - he said to me, very faintly, "Good night;" I went and told Walker what I had seen, and he secured the prisoner - I am not able to say I had seen him before.</p>

               <p>MR. FRANCIS BAYLEY. These chambers belong to me. I have examined the contents of these bundles carefully, and have no doubt they are all mine - they consist of all the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth 20l. at least.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are they new? A. Some of them. I sleep in the chambers very often - when I went there I found my door double locked, but on going in I found the trap-door in the roof was open - a person could then get from the chambers on the roof, and to No. 19.</p>

            . I am a sailor. On the 29th of September, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, Mr. Young spoke to me in the street, and in consequence of what he said I watched at the back of his garden wall - I saw a young man drop from the wall, and about a minute afterwards I saw another man drop - that was the prisoner - I attempted to stop him; he lifted his hand up, with something in it, and said, "I will cut you down if you don't let me pass;" I could not see what it was - he passed me; I followed him, and came up to him; I was about three yards from him, and saw him heave this silver mug away - I stooped, and picked it up; I put it into my pocket, ran. and collared him, about twenty yards from where I took up the mug; I had never lost sight of him, and am quite certain he is the person who dropped from the wall - Norris came up, and I gave it to him.</p>

I went to Mr. Young's house on the 30th of September, and brought this pannel away, (producing it) here are twenty or thirty marks of two different centre-bits on it; I applied the two centre-bits to it - one of them fitted the marks, and the gimblet fitted the hole in the middle.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JOHNSON. I am servant to the prosecutor. I believe these eight tea-spoons to be Mr. Young's; he had eight of that description and I missed them; there is R. T. on the back, which was on his - it is the maker's initials - he had a sonp-ladle of this description, no mark is on it, but from its appearance, I believe it to be his; the mug I know - it has the cypher on it.</p>
               <p>MR. YOUNG. The river was dragged, and a tea-pot produced to me; the value of all the property lost could not be less than 30l.; there was a silver waiter which I have heard nothing of - I know this mug.</p>

I went back and asked him if he was going to murder the woman - he said "If you do not go away, I will serve you worse than I do her;" I then went to pick the woman up, as she was still on the ground; he went to push me away as I thought, but I felt something prick me, it run into my side - I dropped the woman and ran away - he ran after me; the prick was in the lower part of my body - he followed me, I dare say a hundred yards, and said, "You b - r, I will stab you;" I did not then know he had run a knife into me, but I knew something was run into me, and as he came by the gas-light I saw his hand raised up, and the blade of a knife about three inches out of his hand - that was when he said he would stab me; I said,"You have stabbed me!" he said, "You b - r, I will murder you;" I ran forward - he ran on, and I called Watch! some persons came to my assistance; he was secured in a very short time - I gave charge of him, and his wife came up to me, and gave charge of me; she told the watchman to take charge of me as well as him, charge for charge; the watchman let go of him, and took me - he sprang his rattle, and another watchman came; he was secared, and taken to Islington watch-house - I was taken to Mr. Jeaffreson's, the doctor's-shop; that was twenty minutes after it was done: I have the shirt here which I had on - it is stabbed through; the stab was below my waistcoat - I was stooping at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing passed between you and the woman, except your asking for a loaf, and her saying she would pay you if you went home? A. No - I had made no proposition to her, or offered to kiss her, or any thing; there was nothing improper whatever.</p>

               <p>The prisoner then handed in a paper, which was as follows; On the day in question, on my way home from employment, I met the prosecutor, in company with my wife; after remonstrating with him, as to the apparent intimacy between them, the prosecutor replied that he had a greater claim on my wife than myself; he immediately struck her down, prostrated her at my feet, and from the feelings most men possess towards their partners in life, I committed the assault complained of; I have been under Lord Wellington at Waterloo and in several engagements - I have a pension for life, in consequence of a wound in my head; I therefore might, as a military man, have been more irritated than another - the prosecutor was able to go to his work next day; my wife is in attendance, and will prove the truth of this statement. I am a poor man and beg to submit my case to the humane consideration of your Lordship.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Well-street, Oxford-street. I slept in Mr. Witham's house on this night, by his consent - he was out of town; the housekeeper was there - Mr. Witham is a single man and has a house in Gower-street; I believe he rents the whole of the house in Boswell-court - Ross had to sleep in Gower-street and asked me to sleep in Boswell-court, as there was no male there: I went to bed at ten o'clock, and slept in the top room - the housekeeper slept on the same floor; I saw the doors and windows safe - I came down about a quarter to six o'clock in the morning; it was then light - I was the first person who came down (we had both gone to bed at the same time) - I found the back door open, and the sash of the kitchen window taken out altogether; I had left my boots down stairs, and they were gone.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROSS re-examined. I left the house about eight o'clock in the evening of the 16th, and left five sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and some silver of mine in the house, and all my clothes; I went next morning at eight o'clock and missed two blue coats, a pair of trousers, two waistcoats, a pair of silver sugar-tougs of master's, and several other things, which I know were safe the night before; I found the window out, and some table-cloths spread on the floor- I saw a blue coat and a waistcoat, which I knew to be mine, on James' back, at Bow-street, on the Friday, two days after the robbery, and the boots which James had on I was convinced were Fisher's - the coat had not been altered.</p>

               <p>JAMES' Defence. I bought the clothes of a Jew in Petticoat-lane, the morning before I was taken: he had the coat and waistcoat on his arm and the boots in his hand - I asked the price of a black coat; he asked 10s. for it, and said "I have a coat and waistcoat here, which will just fit you;" he took me into a public-house - I tried them on, and bought them: he then produced the shoes, and they exactly fitted me - I gave 23s. for the whole; he said "As you have not bated me much, we will have a glass of gin."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any other name? A. No: I only left the servant up to let in the lodgers, who were out - she is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the lodgers might not have gone to the back place? A. They could not force the locks; Mr. Palmer, a merchant, who lives in the same street, keeps the key of the gate of the back-passage, leading from the wharf; I have a back-door from the house to my yard, and another door from the yard to the passage - I found the back-door of the house locked in the morning, but I had left the key in the lock, outside the door; I had fastened the back-door of the house - the persons had got in at the staircase-window; it is the kitchen staircase-window- I had shut that window down myself; it had shutters to it, which I did not fasten - they had moved a ladder to get at it.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Salisbury coal-wharf, Strand, which is close behind this house. On the night in question I perceived the iron gate, leading to a passage behind Clint's house, and to some wine-cellars, was broken open - I opened the gate, went in, and picked up a lock, which had been forced off; I proceeded up the passage about thirty yards - the passage is under ground; I there saw a writing-desk, a cash-box, two gentlemen's cloaks, a parcel of papers strewed about, and some letters - I returned, and went into Salisbury-street, closing the gate after me; I got four watchmen - we went through the passage, till we came to No. 7, and I perceived the back-door of the yard wide open, and on the steps I picked up some caps and two veils; I looked about the yard, opened the water-closet door, and saw the two prisoners sitting there, in a sleeping posture - it was four o'clock in the morning, and dark; we had lights: I took them to the watch-house. I found in the pan of the water-closet a large chisel, a stock, two centre-bits, a skeleton-key, a phosphorus-box, matches and candle; the mark on the padlock forced off the gate exactly corresponds with the chisel.</p>

On the evening of the 24th of September, I went to bed about ten o'clock, and left every thing secure; my elder children and servant were up after me; my bell rang about eleven o'clock - my servant called me down to speak to a person, and every thing was then safe: I was alarmed about two by the watchman ringing the bell violently - I came down and found my house open; I had left in a cupboard in my counting-house, 10l. in copper, all in 5s. papers, except a few loose coppers in a bowl - I left a sovereign and some silver in the desk, and have no doubt there were crowns and half crowns among it - after the alarm, some 5s. papers of copper were produced to me - there was 5l. 15s. in the basket, some of the papers had my own hand-writing on them, and some my son's; two of them were not marked - here are some with my writing on them; I am certain they are part of what I left safe when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear the person had got out of your house? A. There is a door in the side of my premises which leads to a passage at the side of my house; he had opened that door and drawn out two bolts; I found the door entirely open, when I came down - it must have been opened by somebody within, certainly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons did you leave up when you went to bed? A. Two sons and perhaps my daughter - I have no partner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent, and throw myself on the mercy of your Lordship. I was coming through the market, and actually picked up the basket with the copper in it - when the man stopped me I put it down, and if I had known them to be stolen, I could have thrown them down and escaped - but knowing myself innocent I went to the watch-house with him.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>MR. BASIL FRANCIS. I am living with a friend, in Featherstone-buildings - I am not in business. On the 16th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, I was going towards the City, and was stopped by Carlisle, at the bottom of Skinner-street; he asked me if I had lost a handkerchief - I felt and missed it - I am sure I had it safe when I left home: my wife and nephew were walking with me; Carlisle desired me to return with him, and he would recover my handkerchief - I went, and found the prisoners in custody, at Mr. Raven's, the grocer, at the bottom of Holborn-hill; my handkerchief was produced at the Compter, by the officer - it was the same I had had in my pocket before; I had perceived nobody near me.</p>

On the 29th of September, between one and two o'clock I lost some carpet, which was safe a quarter of an hour before; the shop-door was open, but the carpet was seven yards from the door inside the shop - I was called down stairs by my boy; the prisoner was in custody with it - he was quite a stranger to me.</p>

I was in a shop opposite the prosecutor's, in Budge-row, and saw the prisoner, in company with another, pass the shop - in a short time he returned, went into the shop and brought out some carpet - I pursued and brought him back to Mr. Matthews, who gave him in charge; when I took him, he threw it down and said, I might carry it myself - I gave it to the officer.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 19th of September, I saw Mr. Stamp beyond Hatton-garden, near Furnival's Inn, in the City; I saw the prisoners for ten minutes before, in company with a third- I saw them just before they came to Brook-street, following Mr. Stamp, who was with a lady; at the end of Brook-street, they all three went close up to Mr. Stamp; Sage laid hold of the left-hand skirt of the pocket, put his hand in, and took out a box - the other two were close behind him; Sage immediately handed it to Greenway - they then rushed up into Brook-street; I rushed on them immediately and laid hold of the two prisoners, without losing sight of them, and Greenway threw the box down on the pavement - I picked it up, lodged them in a shop and handcuffed them; I then went after Mr. Stamp, and told him of it - I have not seen the third since; I should know him again. The prosecutor described the box to me before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230013"/>he saw it - it had a particular kind of snuff in it; I was on the curb, the same side of the way as them.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMP. This is my box - it contained some of the same snuff which I had put into it; it had come from the West Indies.</p>
               <p>SAGE'S Defence. A man came up and asked me to buy a box; I said I had no use for it - he came to this young man, (who is a stranger to me) and asked him to buy it; I followed him, and the officer took us.</p>
               <p>GREENWAY'S Defence. A man in a leather apron came and asked me to buy the box; I said I had got one - he took me to the light to look at it, and put it into my hand- the officer came and he ran away; the box dropped out of my hand.</p>
               <p>DANIEL RIORDAN. That is impossible; I was after them before they got three feet into Brook-street - he threw the box down.</p>

On the 10th of October I missed eighteen calf-skins and 4 horse-hides, from my passage, which leads to my shop; I have seen the prisoner once or twice at my shop within the last six weeks - he came to buy some leather; I supposed he was a shoemaker. Mr. Hall, a currier, sent for me on the 14th, and produced part of a skin which I considered to be mine - it was the butt-end of a calf-skin, the head and the King's stamp was taken off; it was not in a fit state for a shoemaker, it would be quite useless to him, as it was not finished - I found part of a skin corresponding in quality and colour with it, on my premises, but not to match it in the cut, as I had sold part of it - this was cut in the way I cut mine; I have not any part which tallies with the cut, but it tallies in quality - while I was talking to Hall, the prisoner came and asked him about the leather; I asked how he got that piece of leather, he said he bought it in Strutton-ground for 9d. - that he should know the man if he saw him again, but could not tell his name; I then went to Queen-square, met an officer, and told him - he had said he lodged in Strutton-ground; I went there and found it was false - I found him in the street afterwards, and gave him in charge; he took us to his lodgings in Old Pye-street - he said they were his lodgings, and there I found these pieces of leather; they are pieces of horse-skins - there was no mark on them, but they corresponded with others which I have in my possession; they are fit for a shoemaker to use for stiffeners - I believe them to be part of this hide; it tallies exactly with a piece which is on my premises - it dovetails on both sides; I am perfectly satisfied that they are part of the same in quality, and they tally in the cut; the prisoner said he had bought this piece at 1s. a pound, at Mr. Pounds, of Wardour-street, Soho - I know he is a currier; this piece must have been taken within nine days - no one skin is worth 5l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you could not swear to it? A. I could not swear to satisfy any one but myself till I found this piece, which matches - there were some pieces which were not mine.</p>

            . I am a currier and leather-seller, and live in Broadway, Westminster. I have known the prisoner six or seven years as a shoemaker; on the 14th of October he brought this piece of calf-skin, and asked me to curry it for a pair of shoes for himself - I asked where he got it; he said he had bought it for 9d.; I asked where - he said in the street; I said I suspected it was stolen, and should neither curry it, nor give it him back till I had sent for Foulkes, who I heard had lost some - I asked his address - he said No. 15, Strutton-ground; it is worth 2s. 6d. or 3s. - curriers can speak very well to the quality of skins; here are two pieces of horse-skin, which tally - I believe them to be part of the same hide, and am satisfied of it; I have been in the trade all my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say at the office that you doubted whether they corresponded? A. I did on the first appearance, but after minutely examining the other side I was as well satisfied as if I cut it myself.</p>

Very honest; he has been about two years with us - he appeared voluntarily before the Magistrate - but at the time he was charged with it, he appeared rather embarrassed; there were nine or ten of our workmen on the premises that evening - I was in the shop when my father told him to go with him to a public-house, where it was supposed a note had been changed, and he went; he was told he was suspected about eleven o'clock - there was nothing to prevent his leaving the house before that; I was present when he was given in charge - no silver or gold was found on him; his mother took his boxes away - I do not know whether they were searched.</p>

            . I keep the King's Head public-house, King-street, St. James's. I know the prisoner by having seen him come after Mr. Moor's men. On the 19th of September, about half-past ten o'clock at night, he came and asked me for change of a 5l. note; I asked who for - he said for Mr. Moor, St. James's-street; I gave him four sovereigns and 1l. in silver; I marked the note before I gave him the change - he saw me mark it; I put Moor's name on it; and put it into my cash-box, where I had no other notes; next day Mr. Moore came in with the porter; and about twelve o'clock he came with the prisoner, and asked if he was the young man I had changed the note for - I turned round and said Yes - he said "No, Mrs. Horner, I never was in your bar;" I said I felt quite confident that he was - he persisted in saying he was not the man, and was taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mr. Moor's men frequent your house? A. Not constantly; they come at times, five or six at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Mr. Moor if he had any body else like the prisoner? A. The prisoner persisted in saying it was not him; I said "Then Mr. Moor must have a man exactly like you" - I only said that once; I described him to Mr. Moor before he brought him to me - he did not frequent the house, but came occasionally for the men; I never served him with a glass of liquor but once - if he had not come for change at so unseasonable an hour, I should not have noticed him; none of Mr. Moor's men had been to my house that day - I changed no other note that day; I was not out of the house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ALLIBAND. The prisoner's boxes were searched on the 20th, after he had been to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went to the lady's house she asked Mr. Moor if he had not somebody in the shop like me - he said he did not know whether he had any body exactly like me; I went back with him - he asked what money I had - I shewed it to him; it was two penny-pieces; I told him I had changed half a crown out of my wages at the public-house the night before the note was changed, and received 2d. out; he asked me to go with him - I went to Marlborough-street; the key of my box was found on me- the officer searched it, and found nothing.</p>
               <p>MR. MOOR. I had paid him 10s. on the Saturday night, when he was discharged on an understanding that he should come three days in the week till he could find another situation.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he discharged for any impropriety? A. My father thought him too intimate with the female servants.</p>

Knox) I know this one shoe to be one which I picked up in the street, after rubbing down his coat - it is one of my mother's; here is the fellow to it - here are two more pairs: they are all my mother's, and worth 20s. - the opening in the window was large enough to get them through.</p>

            . I live at No. 115, Jermyn-street. I heard a cry of Stop thief! went up, and saw the prisoner struggling with Vaughan, endeavouring to get away; I assisted in bringing him back, and observed him endeavouring to get a pair of shoes out of his pocket, which I prevented his doing, but when we got to the shop, I took them out of his pocket myself, and gave them to Vaughan; they were delivered to Knox.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I generally leave work about six o'clock in the evening, and take a walk for about two hours - unfortunately I went down Jermyn-street, and met two men who appeared to be intoxicated; they pushed against me, and had not got two yards, before I heard a window break- I turned round and saw the two men go from Vaughan's shop - I went up, saw the window broken, and the shoes on the area; I picked them up, and tried the door to get in, then went and stood at the corner for five minutes, thinking somebody might come out of the shop; I gave a whistle for my dog; Vaughan came up and looked at me; I looked at him, not knowing who he was - he laid hold of me, and I wrestled with him and dropped a shoe; he sang out Stop thief! I then desisted, and went into his shop. Now if I had a felonious intent, might I not have gone away with the shoes instead of stopping at the corner of the street? I am a shoemaker and have a wife and child.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Martin's-parish. On the morning of the 16th of October, I was alarmed by Mr. Barron's family - his house is in St. Martin's-in-the-fields; I observed the back part of his premises, leading to Kinnerston-alley - there is a high wall there; I saw Mahoney drop from the ledge of that wall, and immediately secured him - he had no shoes on; I gave him to Mosely and Watkins: I afterwards went round to the front of the premises for a light - I went through the house; I found a silver table-spoon out of the back-kitchen window, in the yard, that morning, and have kept it ever since - I afterwards searched the dust-hole of Mr. Simpson's house, which joins the prosecutor's, and found Morris in that dust-hole - this was near five o'clock in the morning; I could not observe any tract on the wall - I found three centre-bits, three skeleton-keys, a large knife and the stock of a centre-bit on his person: I saw Boucher pick up a crow-bar in Barron's yard, about four o'clock - there was a piece cut out of Barron's back-kitchen door, and I saw Mr. Barron apply the centre-bits, found on Morris, to the door, one of them fits it; I have brought the pannel here; I saw him fit the crow-bar to the kitchen-door - it corresponded; I took Morris to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You found these things before Morris was in custody? A. They were in his pocket; I found the spoon before he was taken - I have always said I saw Mahoney drop from the wall; there is a little privy in the yard - I do not know whether it belongs to Mr. Barron's premises; it is in the alley - the wall encloses none but Mr. Barron's premises - it encloses all his own yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you were examined before the Magistrate and said Mahoney came over the wall, did you say you heard any thing? A. Yes - I heard a rattle like a chain.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARRON. My house is in the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-fields. On the 16th of October, about ten minutes past two o'clock in the morning, my servant alarmed me; I employed the watchman to search my back premises, and I searched myself - I found the back-kitchen window wide open - and the kitchen-door wide open: a piece of the pannel which had been cut with a centre-bit and wrenched out, was lying by the side, the hole would admit a hand to withdraw the bolt - I searched the drawer in the kitchen, and missed five tea, two table-spoons, and two forks, all silver - I applied one centre-bit to the pannel and found the end had been broken off by boring against the bolt - it corresponded with the marks on the pannel, and the crow-bar fitted some marks on the door; I afterwards saw Mahoney at the watch-house, and asked him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230016"/>tell me the truth, and asked who was concerned with him; I afterwards saw Mr. Simpson's dust-hole searched, and saw Morris after he was taken out; I was looking over the wall and saw him - I did not see him in the yard before the dust-hole was searched - I saw the stock of a centre-bit, three centre-bits, three skeleton-keys, and a clasp-knife taken from his person; I saw Wells, the watch-house keeper, fit a pair of shoes on Mahoney's feet - they appeared to fit him - this is my spoon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose they would fit any man of the same size? A. They might: I have no other Christian name, nor any partner; the house is my leasehold.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Martin's-in-the-fields. I took Mahoney to the watch-house, and on the way he begged very hard for his liberty - I did not hold out either threat or promise to him; I only said"What have you done with your shoes?" he said he had lost them, and that his crime was very frivolous, for he had only been having a lark with a young woman; about fifty yards from the watch-house he made a sudden stop, and said "I cannot think of going to the watch-house, let me have my liberty;" I said I could not; he said he would reward us, or any thing - I put him into the watch-house.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Barron. On the 16th of October, I was called up about three o'clock in the morning; I searched the back of the premises - about five o'clock, I heard somebody coughing in Mr. Simpson's premises - I jumped on the wall, heard a noise there, and found Morris in the dust-hole; I found this crow-bar in Barron's yard, about twenty minutes before I found Morris.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you say, at the office that you found the keys? A. The watchman and I drew them out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MAHONEY to JOHN WARDLEY. Q. On your taking me in the alley, you opened the door which parts the privy from the court, and said that is the door you came out of? A. I did not; nor did I tell the Magistrate so - I said, "I have got one without his shoes" and heard Bruckner say,"I have got the shoes here;" I did not spring my rattle, one was sprung by my order; I had hold of you at the time Moseley, Wardley, and Briggs came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MAHONEY to BRUCKNER. Q. Where is your beat? A. From St. Martin's-lane up to Long-acre; I only had to run across the road when I heard the alarm - I was let in immediately; I was in the yard about ten minutes before I found the shoes, and said I had found them when I heard the watchman say he had taken a man.</p>
               <p>MAHONEY'S Defence. It is clear I could not be ten minutes crossing the yard from the house; if the shoes are tried, it will be plain they are two inches too big; they are new - and is it likely I should buy new shoes so much too big? - on the night of the robbery I was at home; a friend called and said "Will you go and have a share of a pint of beer;" I went and spent the evening with him, till half-past twelve o'clock; I drank freely, and went out in my slippers, and getting into company with a parcel of men and girls, I quarrelled, and in the row, lost my slippers; the watchman came up, and I followed; I was taken short coming by this court, and went to the privy - and as I came out Wardley laid hold of me: I said I had only been having a lark.</p>

               <p>Prisoner MORRIS. I throw myself entirely upon the mercy of the Court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MAHONEY to SARAH MANSELL. Q. How many times have I been in your master's house? A. I cannot say; but you were there on Twelfth Night and slept there, and for two nights before - I never left you alone in the house on Sunday morning, or at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MAHONEY. I leave it to you to say whether it was better to sleep there and rob the house, or to break it open.</p>

Two months before this happened I had left a message for my lodger at the prisoner's sister's, how the door could be opened. I found my child's hat at Mrs. Mills' - the maker's name had then been taken out; I went away, and when I returned to Mills', the hat was gone - it has been produced since.

A person resembling the prisoner came to my shop, and asked me if I bought gowns; she said they were two muslin ones - she had them wrapped in a cloth, and had a child's hat: I said I would not look at the gowns, as it was too late in the season; I bought the hat of her - I believe the prisoner to be the woman, but my sight is bad.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Robins' employ - there is a private communication from his dwelling-house to the auction-room, without going into the street; he has no partner - the business is always conducted under the name of Messrs. Robins. On the 10th of October I was in the auction-room, about a quarter before nine o'clock, when the prisoner came - I knew him before; I understood he had lived with Mr. Harrison, of Tottenham-court-road; he came in, wished me good morning, and asked Mrs. Kelly for a catalogue and permission to go round the room, to look at the goods for that day's sale; he staid there about a quarter of an hour, and was within the counter, where there was plate, watches, jewellery, and apparel- any person having permission to go behind the counter, could take a watch; we had several watches for that day's sale - I did not observe him do any thing: Mr. Bentley came in about a quarter of an hour, and asked to look at a watch, with the name of Bentley on it - it was not his own; I gave him leave to go behind the counter, and told him it was on the last nail, but when he went round it was gone - I am certain it was there when the prisoner was there. I went out with the officer to give information, and when I came back I heard another watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you remain in the room the whole quarter of an hour the prisoner was there? A. I did - my attention was not directed to him, for I was busy sweeping the room; we seldom lose property - Bentley is not here: I had no knowledge of the loss till he informed me it was not there; any body who we know to be respectable we allow to go round and see the goods: there is a Mr. Henry Robins - he sells, but is not a partner; Mr. Edmund Robins also sells - they are cousins; I only know they are not partners from what Mr. George Henry Robins said at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. From all appearance in the business, they participate with him in the disposal of property? A. Yes; many of the catalogues are in the name of George Henry Robins, and some as Messrs. - the principal of them are in the name of George Henry Robins only, and the advertisements also - I have no means of knowing whether the cousins have an interest in the business.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What age are these gentlemen? A. Mr. Henry is thirty-two; Mr. Edmond lives in the house with George Henry - I know nothing of their arrangement except what Mr. George Henry stated at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know who the dwelling-house belongs to? A. The whole premises belong to Mr. George Henry - I always understood so; and have seen the receipts for the rent in his name alone.</p>

I delivered two gold watches to Mr. Robins' porter on Tuesday or Wednesday, the 7th or 8th of October, with a great deal of other property, at our house - they were Mr. Harrison's property, and worth 25l. together; there was a seal to them - I should know them again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you happen to know that Mr. George Henry Robins lives at Turnham-green? A. That is his country-house, but he lives on the premises at times- the whole of the goods in the sale that day were Mr. Harrison's; I had a catalogue - it described the property to be sold by Messrs. Robins; it was unredeemed pledges.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know you ought to have two tickets when the property exceeds 10l.? A. I gave three, one for each article; he offered them at first to a young man in our shop - he brought them to me; I said I thought they would do for 20l.: I then went down the shop, and saw the prisoner - he said I had lent him once before 17l. on one of them; I said I did not recollect it, but 15l. was as much as I could lend now: the two watches were offered first, and the seal afterwards.

On Tuesday morning, the 7th of October, I went to bed about half-past two o'clock, leaving my mother and the servant up; the house was secure, to the best of my knowledge, when I went to bed - I was called up about four, by my father, who lives with me, but I am the housekeeper - I jumped out of bed, ran down stairs in my night clothes, and found a candle burning under the kitchen table, and a pair of wet shoes in the kitchen; they did not belong to any of the family - I then saw the kitchen-window open, and the shutter closed. I and my father went out, after dressing myself, towards London, in the Hornsey-road; we went about half a mile up Hornsey-lane, and then returned to Crouch-end, my father going another way - I had not proceeded far before I saw the prisoner and another man coming towards me, and towards London; when they came up to me I asked if they had met any one - they hesitated some time, and then the other man said they had met two men in Lordship-lane, Tottenham; I said I had had my house broken open, and as I was rather suspicious, I wished to know their names, and where they were going - they said they were bricklayers, and were going to work at the top of the hill; I then cast my eye down, and perceived either shoes or boots shining on the prisoner's feet - they turned out to be top boots, just fresh put on; that increased my suspicion: I lifted up his smock-frock with a poker which I had taken with me, and saw they were top-boots; I took them down to the village, and the other man ran away - the prisoner never got out of my custody; the boots were taken off his feet, and I found they were my father's.</p>

About seventeen days after this occurrence, about two o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner Smith at the window; he came straight up, and looked at that part of the window where the tray was on the day they came - it was near the door; he was in the street: Gaselee, our porter, was in the shop at the time I saw Smith looking in at the window - I said something to him, and sent him out to where Smith was standing; a lady came in at the time, which prevented my going out: I am certain Smith is the person I saw looking in at the window. On the 15th of October I saw both the prisoners in custody at Mary-le-bone office - it was about a week after Smith came to the window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Does any body but yourself serve in the shop? A. Yes, Greenhow - he was in the shop, and saw the prisoners; Gaselee cleans the plate, but not the jewellery: there is a boy named Read, and Mrs. West herself, but nobody is allowed to go to the glass-case unless we are out; we put so many rings in a row - if one is stouter than another there might be one less: the one in question was generally in the center of the tray, but I cannot say what line it was in; I saw it safe at half-past four o'clock the day before, and we shut up shop at nine o'clock at night - I had no occasion to go to the glass-case afterwards till I locked the tray up: I did not then see any vacancy but what the three occasioned, but will not swear I saw this very ring there after half-past four o'clock. I did not know the prisoners before - they were about ten minutes in the shop; no other customer came in while they were there, but directly they went out others came in: the two rings were not taken from the same row as the three- I put back the one they did not chose. I am positive Curtis is one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. When the ring was missed, did you not inquire among the young men in the shop, if they had sold it? A. I inquired of Grenhow if he had sold it the moment he came in, which was about four o'clock, but not of any body else. I did not tell Cobham, the constable, when I had seen it last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When did you see Cobham? A. On Monday evening, the 15th of October; I did not tell him I had not missed it for a day or two after they came - I took the two rings out of the tray myself, to show them; the tray stood about half-way down a pane of a glass-case on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inquire of Mrs. West if she had done any thing with it? A. I did afterwards - I wished to make every inquiry; I saw Smith at the window for about a minute; he could not have seen me send the porter out- some things hung in the window, but I could see distiactly between the chains, and am positive it was him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230021"/>our shop is opened about seven o'clock in the morning - I sleep there, and was in the shop about seven o'clock the day they came, and was there all day; I am sure I put the tray into the window after they went out, before the other customer came in.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. The three rings had been out for two days? A. Yes; I am sure I saw the cluster-ring at half-past four o'clock the day before they came: the ladies came in about two minutes after the prisoner left - Smith left the window, and passed the door before Gaselee went out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Mrs. West in the shop when the prisoners came in? A. No - she never serves in the shop; I am certain she did not serve that day, nor the day before.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mrs. West. I remember the day when the ring was missed - I knew the ring very well; I had seen it the afternoon previous, about half-past four o'clock, in the tray: it was a large diamond ring - as far as I can recollect it was placed in the third or fourth row in the tray, not quite in the centre; I took it out at that time to show to a gentleman - I then put the tray into the window; I am quite sure that when I put it in the ring was in it: I was in the shop when the two persons came in about twelve o'clock next day, and in the shop all the time; I was not particularly engaged - the shop is small, but of some depth inside; I was close to the two persons, behind the counter, and outside also; I cannot speak to their persons, as my attention was not particularly drawn to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were in the shop the whole time? A. Yes - I might be doing something; we watch customers as well as we can: I paid no attention to them - I am not in the habit of looking at people; I saw the ring safe the afternoon before - I will not swear to the prisoners in the dress they are now in.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You did not assist in serving them? A. Not in the least.</p>

            . I am porter to Mrs. West. About four days before the prisoners were taken I was directed to go out and watch the prisoner Smith, and if I saw an officer to give him in charge; I went out, and saw Smith just below the next house; I was at the further end of our shop, and did not see him till I got out - I followed him as far as Wine-office-court, Fleet-street; he walked all the way, and stopped at the court; I was on the opposite side, crossing the road - he came back, and I came back also; a waggon or two were passing, and when I got over he was gone - I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You saw a person beyond the next house? A. Yes - that was the first I saw of him; his back was towards me: I walked on the same side of the way, till he crossed on Ludgate-hill - I have not seen him since till to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell people before you came here, that you would swear to him? A. They said Smith was the man - I said I would swear to the man when I saw him - that I should know the man if I saw him.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you asked before you came here, if you should know the man? A. Yes, by the shopman, and said it was possible I should - that is the man (pointing to Curtis;) I am sure he is the man I followed down Ludgate-hill: I only knew his name by what I heard from other people - I followed the same person as the shopman pointed out.</p>
               <p>HENRY SMITH re-examined. The prisoner Smith is the man who came to the window, and he is the man I directed the porter to follow - (pointing to Smith.)</p>

On the 8th of October, about one o'clock in the day, the two prisoners came into my shop together; I am certain of their persons - Curtis requested me to show him a gold seal which was in the window, in a tray; I produced the tray, with gold seals and keys in it - he then wished me to point out those which were solid and most valuable, and said he would leave it to me to select him a good one, that the price was no object; I selected five or six of the best - he took them in his hand separately, weighed them, and showed them to Smith; they both stood at the counter: Smith said they were good seals he had no doubt, and then selected one - he asked if I could recommend it; I said it was one of the best I had: Smith then put his arm on the tray, towards the top of it, and took up several, which I told him were inferior; he took them up again and again - Curtis then decided on the one I had recommended; he then gave it to Smith, and Smith said he could not have a better: he then said had I another that would match it - Smith was by him all the time; my sister was in the kitchen; I knocked with my foot for her to come up. to get another tray out of the window, to show them - I kept my station behind the counter; there was nothing that they liked in the second tray - Curtis put his hand into his pocket, and gave me 5s. as a deposit for the one he had selected, which came to 3l. 18s., he said he would call again in two hours, and in the meantime I might possibly find another that would match it, and that he should want a key also; Smith urged him to go: he said, "No, I wish to look at a key" - Smith said he might look at the key when he returned; they then left the shop: after they were gone I took the tray off the counter, and put it on the glass-case; the seals were disturbed, and when my sister and I were putting the tray in order, I missed one of the solid seals, but cannot say there was one less in the tray than when they came in (not suspecting them); I reproved my sister, as she generally attends to that tray. I expected them to return in two hours, as they had said so two or three times, but they never came again; I waited at home all that afternoon and evening, and sent for some seals to match the one Curtis had selected - Mr. Hardman, a neighbour, came in the evening; in consequence of what he said to me, I looked at my tray about seven o'clock next morning - (it was before any customers came) and missed a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230022"/>gold key, worth 2l. 5s.; I am quite sure that was in the tray when the prisoners called: the tray was kept in the window, secured by slides, and locked - no person could reach it from the other side of the counter: no other customer looked at the tray. I saw them in custody on the Monday following - I am quite sure they are the persons who came to buy the seal; they never came to my shop again - the key has never been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long were the persons in your shop? A. I suppose ten minutes; I never saw them before - I speak to them with the greatest certainly; my tray is a very large one, and in taking it out the key caught my eye, but I cannot positively say the seal was there then.</p>

On the 8th of October I was called up by him, and saw the prisoners in the shop; I am quite sure of them - I produced a tray from the other window; they selected nothing from that - I always arrange the tray which they first saw; it was on the counter when I came up, and the prisoners were close to it - I had seen it safe about half an hour before they came in; I saw Curtis give my brother 5s., and said he would call again in two hours: after they were gone I put the tray to rights, and then I missed a key, and my brother missed a seal; he was very angry with me about it - I cannot say whether a seal was missing myself; I am quite sure the key was safe that morning - I had seen it about two or three hours before: I have never seen the prisoners since, till last night; I am quite sure they are the persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw the key two or three hours before? A. Yes; I was in the shop all the morning, and that tray was not produced to any one - it was enclosed in the window, and not within reach.</p>

I was serving in the shop on the 10th of October, when the two prisoners came in together - Curtis had spectacles on, and wanted a mourning-ring: Smith said Curtis wanted it for his father, who was lately dead - I took out the tray of mourning-rings to shew them; they both stood close to - gether on the other side of the counter - Smith was nearest to the door; Curtis selected two rings, one for the size of the finger, and the other for the pattern of one he wished to be made, as he did not like any that would fit him - there was to be engraved inside it, "John Sidmouth, obit 26th January, 1828, aged 82;" they staid about ten minutes, and Curtis gave me 5s. for a deposit, which he borrowed of Smith: and in less than five minutes after they were gone, on our arranging the rings in the tray, I missed one which I had in my hand shewing to them - I had put it into the tray only half an hour before; I had only a boy in the shop, and could not go after them; this was on Friday - I saw them on the following Wednesday at the office, and was certain of them; they never called for the ring or the 5s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you lived with Mr. Marriott? A. Eighteen months; he and his brother are partners in an ironmongery business, but not in the jewellery - Curtis was to pay 38s. for the ring, and to call for it on the Monday - they were in custody then; the ring must have been taken while I was writing the inscription - they had several rings in their hands, and scattered them about; I drew them together as quick as I could - the boy was not in the shop, but in a back-room.</p>

               <p>Q. By what means had the persons entered? A. By raising the window of the Board-room, not by breaking the glass; the Board-room is part of the building, and communicates internally with the rest of the premises - it is part of my dwelling-house; I know that window was shut down the preceding night, but whether it was fastened I cannot say: I looked about that night to see that every thing was safe - the boxes had been broken open, by a chisel, which we found; a piece of brass, belonging to a centre-bit, was found under the window in the garden - they had entered at the Board-room window, which was found open. Moore was a pauper in the house two or three years ago.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Is the upper part of the bill your writing or not? A. Yes, the top part is my writing I must say, but not the receipt, nor is it written by any person in my employ, nor by my authority; when the prisoner came to me first, he said her Ladyship was very good pay, and that she paid every three weeks.</p>

            . I am a constable of Mary-le-bone Office. I took the prisoner into custody on the 7th of October, in Williams'-mews, Devonshire-street, Portland-place; I said I had a warrant against him, and asked if he knew what it was for - he said."I suppose it is for not giving my livery in;" I said No, it was for felony - I said there was a case of felony against him: I neither threatened or promised him any thing - he said he did not know what it was; I asked if he had ever received money from Lady Nepean, to pay for corn and hay - he said Yes, he had received it from Lady Nepean; I asked if he had ever paid Mr. Swain any - he said he had not, except the first bill, that he paid the first bill, but never paid any afterwards; I asked what he had done with the money - he said he was very much involved in debt, and made use of it for himself and family; I asked him who receipted those bills - he said he receipted them himself; I had not got the bills myself at that time.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN SWAIN, JUN. I make out my father's bills; Lady Nepean had about 30l. worth of oats in the year, and about 30l. worth of hay, 60l. in all. (Receipt read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - being called on to say a something in extenuation for my guilt, at the same time well knowing the awful situation in which I am placed, allow me to remark, that had I wished to have robbed my prosecutrix, I had other opportunities besides what I am charged with, having on one occasion been sent to her Ladyship's banker's, where I received the sum of 100l., which her Ladyship, I am sure, will not attempt to deny, having had an undeniable character with me from my last place. Therefore, my Lord and Gentlemen, let me humbly intreat you to take my truly deplorable case into your most humane consideration, for the sake of my innocent family, being five children, one of which is now on the breast, who will be left to an unforgiving word, who are more ready to oppress the unfortunate than to relieve and forgive the faults of their unfortunate parent. I was induced, my Lord and Gentlemen, to pay my debts with the money I am charged with embezzling, thinking that if her Ladyship knew I was in debt she would discharge me from her service, and knowing that in time I should be able to recover from my difficulties; and having known Mr. Swain for upwards of sixteen years, I supposed he would have waited until I was able to pay him. I had been out of employ for a length of time previous to my being engaged by her Ladyship, during which time I was laid on a sick bed, and was obliged to dispose of every thing I had to maintain my starving family, who have no one in the world to look up to, either for instruction or support. Therefore, should your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury, think fit to find me guilty, let me intreat your Lordship to consider the awful state of my disconsolate family, whose prayers are always ascending for the protection of their unhappy and distracted father, who is well aware that his very life is in your Lordship's hands, and who is well aware that whatever the decision of this Court may be, it will be passed with mercy, for the sake of his wretched, but perfectly innocent, family, having never appeared before at any bar.</p>

               <p>DAVID HIATT. On the 19th of July, I and a friend named Goddard, went to the Lancers public-house, on <placeName id="t18281023-34-crimeloc220">Hounslow-heath</placeName>

                        targets="t18281023-34-off218 t18281023-34-crimeloc220"/>, between eight and nine o'clock; we staid there till between eleven and twelve - I asked for a lodging in the house, but the beds were all full; we said we did not know where to go to lodge - a young woman said she would show us a rick where we could lie down; she took us to a rick not half a mile from the house: we went into the rick-yard, and lay down directly, about two or three yards apart - I was dozing off to sleep, and Goddard hallooed out to me, "Come and pull these men off me;" I roused up, and before I could get up three of them came and fastened me down - there were five in all - they were all on the top of Goddard when I first awoke, then three came and held me down - I threw them off once, and then they fastened me down before I could get up; Godwin then fastened me with his left hand in my throat, and said if I did not lie still be would blow my brains out; I could see a pistol in his right-hand at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you say it was Godwin? A. Because I knew his face. It was about one o'clock in the morning; I could see five or six yards, well enough to know any one - he was a stranger before, but I am certain he is the man: I lay still after he said that, and they took two sovereigns from me, a knife, a tobacco-box, a leather cap, and a black beaver-hat, also two or three halfpence; I wore the hat, and had the cap in my pocket - I saw Richard Pinder there, he was on the top of my hip, and helped to hold me down; I did not know him before, but am positive of him - we ran to the gate, hallooed for the watchman, and cried Murder! they got away, I do not know which way they went - Goddard and I went for assistance, and met Hall, the watchman; I described to him the person who held the pistol to me; he took me to a house where I saw a man and woman, I knew the man; I said I thought I knew him, but should know him a good deal better if he had his clothes on; he was undressed - he shut the door, and we went for Stevens, a constable, who returned with us to the house; the man came down stairs half-dressed, with his coat on his arm; I said, "That is the man who had the pistol;" I am sure he is the man; Hall told him to put his coat on; I said I knew him to be the man who had the pistol - we went into the house, and saw a pistol on the mantel-shelf - it was very much like the one which was held at me. Filby shewed me my hat next morning (Monday.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This took place about one o'clock in the morning? A. Yes. I was dozing off to sleep; the affair lasted four or five minutes - I was much alarmed and confused; I was taken to a public-house at Hounslow on the Sunday morning, about nine o'clock, and one of the constables pointed out Pinder and Mitcherson to me; they were in the same room as me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not as good an opportunity of pointing them out to him? A. Yes; I was three or four yards from them; there were five or six people there - I said I did not know Mitcherson - I said he was not one of the men, and he was let go; he knew I was making a charge of highway robbery; he was taken up on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. You say Pinder and Mitcherson were pointed out? A. Yes - I was taken into the room and asked if I know any of the men in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GODWIN. Q. The first time you came to my house I came down, and you said it was a younger man who robbed you? A. I said there was one in a flannel jacket, whose face I did not see, but he seemed to be a young man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where had you been at work for some days before? A. I had been reaping rye for Mr. Layson; I finished work about twelve o'clock on Saturday, and received my money; I then went to Belfont, got a job, and went to the Lancers about nine o'clock; Goddard and I were drinking with two more who came from Belfont - we had six pots of beer between four of us, and I had a glass of gin coming out; the landlord turned us out, and we were at the door for a few minutes - there was a considerable disturbance caused by the people wanting to get in, but it was not us, and then the woman took us; to the rick - she appeared a common woman; I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Some of these people were in custody in July, and examined before the Magistrate? A. Yes, and committed for trial; I had notice to attend at the September Session to prosecute them, and was bound over in a recognizance of 40l., but I did not attend; I went home to Brittle in Oxfordshire, two or three weeks after I was examined before the Magistrate - I was cutting oats during that time at Belfont; I received 3l. 5s. to pay my expences to Oxfordshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive that to induce you to go away and not appear against them? A. Yes; I accepted that at the risk of forfeiting my recognizance - I was at home all the time; Filby, the constable, came down and fetched me here.</p>

            . I am constable of Hounslow. I was out on duty on Saturday night, the 19th of July, three or four hundred yards from the hay-rick, and four or five hundred from Godwin's house, when I heard loud cries of Murder! I waited a few minutes, and heard it again; I ran down the town towards London, in a direction towards Godwin's house, and when about forty yards from his house, I heard a door either open or shut - the sound came from Godwin's house; I ran along the back of the town, turned round our watch-house, and met Hiatt and Goddard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230026"/>and from what Hiatt said I took him to Godwin's house, and called Godwin up; he made his appearance at the door undressed, as if he had come out of bed - Hiatt was close by - I said "These two men have been robbed, and you are suspected to be one of the men;" this was before Hiatt had said any thing - Godwin said to both of us, "If I am the man, say so;" I told Hiatt not to swear to him without he was certain; Hiatt then said, "I don't much think he is the man;" he said nothing more then - Godwin then shut the door; we went a few yards, then Hiatt said something; I then went and called Stevens - we all returned to Godwin's house, having been absent half an hour or more - we knocked at the door, Godwin looked out of window; we said we wanted to speak with him again - he came down directly, as soon as he could, and opened the door; he had got his trousers on and his jacket on his arm - Hiatt immediately said, "You are the man that lay on my breast, and put the pistol against my head;" (Godwin put his jacket on after that) he said,"If I was the man, why did not you say so before?" Hiatt said, "I can swear to you better with your clothes on than I could with them off," this was before he had his jacket on; I asked Hiatt if he was quite sure he was the man - he said he was; we had a candle; I do not think there was any candle the first time - if I recollect right, there was a light the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing take place about his jacket? A. No, not that I recollect; he put it on because I told him to put on the rest of his clothes, as I must take him into custody - this was after the conversation.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then that was not to enable the prosecutor to judge whether he was the man, but because he was going into custody? A. Certainly - Godwin said several times that he was not the man; I said nothing to Hiatt after his jacket was put on. On the shelf, nearest to the fire-place down stairs, there was an old pistol and a little saw; I afterwards searched the hay-rick and found an old hat, which Goddard claimed - a purse was afterwards found, which Hiatt owned.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hounslow. - I was called up by Hall, about two o'clock in the morning of the 19th of July, and went with him, Hiatt, and Goddard to Godwin's house; Hall knocked at the door, and said "Godwin, we want you" - he looked out of window and said he would come down directly; he did so and opened the door - he brought no light with him, and we had none; I could see him - he was in his shirt; I do not believe he had any thing else on - he was just as if he had got out of bed; he said if we would wait while he put on his clothes, he would come down; this was at the door - we waited at the door: he went up and came down again with his trousers and waistcoat on, his shoes in his hand, and his coat on his arm; I had run home and got a light by that time - we then all went in and searched the house: Hiatt said that was the man who robbed him - that he presented a pistol at him; I believe he made no answer - he was very willing to go with us; he denied the charge, and said he was not at the place - he said he was at the Cricketers, public-house, and left there at six o'clock, and had been in bed ever since; we found a few shillings on him - I saw an old pistol in the house; Hall and I searched the hay-rick, and I think it was he who found the bag or purse - he picked it up and took possession of it; I was present when it was shown to Hiatt, who owned it - there was nothing in it.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. Did you carefully search Godwin's clothes? A. Hall did in my presence - we searched all his pockets carefully; the pistol was an old one - an old apron or something of that kind, was over it.</p>
               <p>Q. The first proposal about dressing came from Godwin himself? A. Yes - I was bound over to appear at the September Session, but could do nothing, without Hiatt; we afterwards found he had been bribed to go out of the way - I am certain the proposal to dress, proceeded from Godwin and not from Hiatt.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many people were in the room? A. Seven or eight - he offered it openly; he knew that I knew him - the of ficers took him away without Hiatt being there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not Pinder exceedingly angry, as an honest man would be? A. He was very angry; I did not hear Hiatt say Mitcherson was not one of them - I was not present all the time, as I took Pinder to the cage; Mitcherson was let go about half-past six or seven o'clock, and taken again about seven next morning.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You were bound over to prosecute? A. Yes, and attended at the September Session, but Hiatt had absconded; I went down into the country and asked him to come up, and he came - I did not make him a prisoner - I prosecuted Godwin, Pinder, and Mitcherson for a riot in the Mgaistrates' room; while I was giving my evidence, Pinder came and said "You bl-y little rogue," and struck me.</p>

On the 1st of October I shut up about ten o'clock; I am a hair-dresser; after putting my family to bed, I was looking over my half-batch door, and heard a noise - I looked out, and saw these three men having a man down on the ground, (I had only my shoes on) and before I could get my pantaloons on they were gone; there was a fourth man with them, he ran away when I opened my door; I went to the man who they had been robbing - it was the prosecutor, he was rapping at the constable's door - his face was as black as it could be, and all over blood; he is a pensioner; I did not go with him to White Lion-street, and know nothing more.</p>

               <p>REYNOLDS' Defence. Two or three days before I was apprehended, Wright told me my mother was rotten with v - l disease; I told him to look at home; then he said he would have me transported like he had the other boy - I could bring witnesses who heard him say so.</p>

               <p>CROZIER'S Defence. I am not guilty; I know no more of the prosecutor than a child unborn; on the Wednesday I went with my brother-in-law to take his pension, and was with him till eight o'clock - I then went home to my mother, and never went out afterwards.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This took place in a crowd? A. In the year of the crowd - I was not in the crowd, that was near the river; I had no pocket in my trousers, and generally carry silver loose in my coat pocket - he took nine pieces of coin out of my coat pocket - it was all loose; I did not make an alarm in the crowd; I said in the guard-room, that if he produced the whole of my money I should be inclined to let him go - not if he gave me all the money he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you name any specific sum that you had lost till you found what he had about him? A. Yes - to every body there; I told them he had taken more out of my pocket, before the officer searched him - he had only offered me 7s. 6d then; whether I mentioned the exact sum I lost I cannot be positive - I mentioned the two halfpence before he was searched; when I found he had got one half-crown I put my hand into my pocket, and found I had lost one half-crown and five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state how much you had lost before you found he had money? A. No, I had no time - he offered me the 5s. as he was going into the guard-room; I had received my pay that morning - I cannot say how much, having money about me belonging to the Company, and I do not always receive alike, as I lay out money for the Company; my full pay was 9s. 10d - I do not suppose I receive more.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to recollect exactly what money you had in your pocket? A. I counted it in a grocer's shop in the Minories, where I laid some out, and took all my money out to get at some halfpence.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were your fellow-soldiers in the guard-room? A. Yes, the corporal was; the prisoner said he was sorry he had robbed him - I am sure of that; he said he had taken the money from him; I did not hear him say he had not robbed him, but would give him the money to let him go: I was anxious to see the rowing-match, and went out once or twice - Clark was present all the time I was there, and I should think must have heard him say he had taken the money - he did not deny it in my presence; when Meller said, "You have taken my half-crown" - he said, "I have," and he said he would make it all right; he said those words before he produced the money.</p>

I said, "No, but stop;" master just happened to come into the shop, and I said, "This is the man who a fortnight ago stole a ball of twist;" they were both secured, the other man was discharged at Guildhall: I am sure I saw the prisoner take a ball of twist on the 3d of September.</p>

No - I saw him every day for a fortnight after; I do not know why I did not tell him of it - he might have been cross with me for not securing him, and I thought it best to say nothing about - it was very improper, I own; nobody was passing in the street - it is an out of the way place: I do not know whether the female servant was at home. I gave the prisoner a look to make him think I saw him; he went straight out to Ludgate-hill - if he thought I had seen him, of course, he would not come again; there were rolls of cloth on the counter, and it would not be right for me to follow him: the other man produced the same pattern as the prisoner brought before - when they were secured a ball of twist was found between two cloths, they must have been placed there while I was gone for a constable; a silk handkerchief was found on him, which he said belonged to his companion.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and took charge of the prisoner; I found nothing on either of them - the prisoner had a watch and about 7s. 6d., also a handkerchief, which he said was his companion's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He accused me of having been there a fortnight before, and taking the twist - his master was at the door; I was out in the street - he said, "My young man says you have robbed me," and I came back - at the second examination the young man said he found a hall of twist in the window.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not come back to the shop of his own accord, and ask you to send for a constable, if you had any charge? A. Not to my recollection - he had the handle of the door in his hand, when master told me to go for a constable; I said, "Stop," and he came back.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH POTTER. I produced the twist which I found between the cloths, at his first examination - the first time he was at Guildhall was not an examination.</p>

I said Yes; he said,"Well, he has got me in a complete hobble. I took some linen home for people, and on returning I had a bundle, and put it into the cart; and when I came to where the wild beasts were, I went to see them, and left nobody with the cart" - and he did not know whether the bundle was in the cart or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he follow you into the Three Tuns? A. I never looked back to see, and never saw him afterwards; I desired somebody to come back with me, to see if the children were not murdered, as I was afraid be was murdering them; I was taken to a doctor's shop in Fleet-street - I was able to walk there; I was supported by some friends; I was not married before I married the prisoner - my children are young; I was supported to the doctor's in Fleet-street - I do not know his name; he is a surgeon - he looked at my wound, but I cannot tell what was said, though I still had my senses: I was taken up into the street, put into a coach, and taken to the Hospital - my wound was dressed there; I remained in the Hospital five weeks; I was at Guildhall twice - I think it was a month before I was able to go before the Alderman, but I cannot justly say how long.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time you came home till he cut you in the neck, there was every expression of kindness on his part? A. Yes; no anger at all - he was very kind that night; every thing appeared kind and affectionate on his part, from the time he brought me from the public-house; I did not see the knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your name Ann or Hannah? A. Hannah; I have had four children by the prisoner - three of them are alive; the eldest is turned seven, and the youngest is three years old - I have been married to him going on for eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. He is rather weak in his mind I understand - not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230033"/>strong understanding? A. He is not very stout; I cannot say any thing of his mind - he is in general in the same way; I do not know any difference; I thought him a sensible man myself - I never heard that he was thought weak in his understanding.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he had any cause for it or not I do not ask, but was he not very much given to jealousy? A. I cannot think he was given to jealousy at all - I have no reason to think it in the least; I do not think he was at all jealous - he had once left me for three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not jealous then? A. He pretended so; he left me, and took his clothes off with him; I cannot tell whether he was jealous or not then; he went out, and said he was going to take a walk - I asked if I could not go with him; he said I should not, and as soon as he went out, I put on my bonnet, told my little girl to mind her sister, and followed him, but lost sight of him; I returned, and found that he had got back as soon as me - I followed him in, and followed him up stairs (we then lived in Collingwood-street), and as soon as I went in he said, "Oh, you have been having it - you have been having it:" I said,"Oh, James, what have I been having?" he then began to abuse me in a most disgusting manner, which I cannot repeat; I went down stairs to the door, because I would not hear his words - he came down to the door to me, and asked what I had done with his black trousers; I said I thought he had taken them up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the disgusting words imputing some infidelity to you? A. Yes, but there is a clear proof that it was quite false; I do not know my landlady's name - I was not there above seven or eight weeks; we lived two years in King-street, Smithfield, at Turnbull's: I cannot say that he was jealous there, for he frequently offered me protection - Mrs. Turnbull and I were very good friends; I have no reason to think he was jealous, or he never would have a desire for me to go on the town to get money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean, on your oath, that you never heard, and did not understand that he was very weak in his understanding? A. I never observed it, nor ever heard it; I swear I never knew of any deficiency in his mind more than wickedness - he was excessively wicked.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that his life is now at stake? A. My life was at stake as well as his; I never considered my life safe with him - I do not wish him executed; it is my wish to save his life, but my own as well.</p>

On the night of the 9th of September, I was serving in my shop between ten and eleven o'clock, and heard the cries of Murder! upon which I rushed out of my back-door, and saw the prisoner's wife rushing out of the passage; I followed her into the Three Tuns - she was then bleeding very much from the neck, as I suppose; when I went in, I saw the blood come from her throat - it flowed in considerable quantities; she immediately requested somebody would secure her children from being murdered by her husband - I went up to her room with a constable, and saw the prisoner; we apprehended him - he stood by the bed side in his shirt, and on his right-hand sleeve there was blood; they asked him if he had cut his wife's throat; his answer was "She must have done it herself, for he knew nothing of it" - the knife was not found at that time; I was not present when it was found, which was two or three days after - I was at Guildhall when it was produced: he was taken to the watch-house - I was not intimate with them.</p>

I was dresser at St. Bartholomew's-hospital when this happened; I was present when the prosecutrix was brought in - she was rather taint, and had received a deep wound in the throat; I did not imagine that it would prove fatal; there was a great hemorrhage, the carroted artery was not divided, the wound was hut two lines off it - the pulsation of the carroted artery was very visible - if that had been cut, it must have proved fatal; she was able to leave the hospital much sooner than she did - she had recovered strength enough to leave in about a month - it would not have been proper for her to leave before.</p>

            . I am a leather-dresser, and live at No. 22, Crown-street, Soho. I worked for the prisoner at a shop, which he hired of Russell, in Fetter-lane, not where he lived; he borrowed a knife of me on the 9th of September, between two and four o'clock in the afternoon - he told me it was to skin a cat - I saw the knife again at Guildhall; after he had borrowed it he asked if I would turn the grindstone, and it was ground in the form of a table-knife - I turned the stone, and he ground it round, which would make it sharper than when I lent it him - I am quite sure I saw the same knife before the Alderman; he appeared at times very low in spirits.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known him long? A. I have seen him about for three years - I only knew him while I worked for him, about seven weeks - he has worked for three hours together without saying a word.</p>

            . I am a boot-maker, and live in Fetter-lane - I sleep on the same floor as the prisoner. On the night this happened, I was sitting in the room with my wife and children, between ten and eleven o'clock; I heard a shriek and a cry of Murder! I expected it proceeded from Abbott's room - I went into the passage, still hearing the cry of Murder! I knocked at the door and called Abbott; I had no answer, but still heard the cries of Murder! and forced the door open; I heard a scuffle towards the door and went back to my own door, stood with it in my hand, and saw Mrs. Abbott come running out of the room; I saw some one behind her in the door-way - she was coming towards my door, and for some reason, which I cannot account for, I shut the door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230034"/>- I did not see her afterwards; I heard her running down stairs, but did not go down myself; I opened my door, went and knocked at Abbott's door two or three times - he came to the door, and said in a very slow tone of voice,"Did you call, Mr. Fitzgerald?" I said "Yes, what have you been doing?" he said, "I have been asleep;" I then saw some blood on the side of the door, and in the passage - I said "Why, your wife must be cut terribly, how has this happened?' he said he knew nothing at all of it - she must have done it herself; I saw some blood on his shirt sleeve, and asked him how that came; he said he supposed it must have come from a cut on his knuckle (he had cut his knuckle that day, and came into my shop and shewed it to me just after it happened) he then went into his room; I followed him, and he went as he was getting into bed - I said, "Abbott, it is no use you getting into bed, you will have to go into the watch-house;" he said "Do you think so?" I said "Yes, I am certain of it;" he said, "Then I had better dress myself, I suppose?" I said "Yes, by all means, get you clothes on as soon as you can;" he put his trousers on, and was putting on his waistcoat; several persons then came up stairs, and he was secured - they asked him how he came to do it - he said "She must have have done it herself," and that she had attempted to hang herself some time before; I never heard of that before - the room was searched twice in my presence, but the knife could not be found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you known him long? A. About twelve weeks; he always appeared to me depressed in spirits; he would go in and out of the house with his head hanging down, and never speak unless spoken to - he appeared to be under jealousy; I did not know that till the day this happened; about twelve o'clock that day I had seen him in and out very frequcutly - I went up into my room, and said "Abbott seemed very uncomfortable to day" - they had been quarrelling a few minutes before that; when I had said that he came to my door, knocked, and said he wanted to speak to me - I went into his room; he put the door too, and said "I want you to give me some advice about my situation;" I said if I could give him advice I would, but I did not like to interfere between man and wife - he said "I am very miserably situated; I wish my wife would stop at home, and pay attention to her home the same as your's - she can earn money at glove-making at home, but prefers going out charing, that she should have an opportunity of going with other men," and the three children he declared were not his own, neither of the three; he was always depressed, and never spoke unless spoken to - he was under a strong fit of jealousy I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know any thing of his wife except seeing her go in and out? A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is Mr. Upham's name? A. John Constantius: he is not here - he is at my house ill in bed at this time - I had seen the boxes - I am quite certain the prisoner was in my employ at the time - I do not pay him wages; my servants are paid by the persons frequenting the house: he was a <rs id="t18281023-54-deflabel335" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were never present when Mr. Upham gave the boxes to him to take to Mr. Dulin? A. I was not. I never stated so - if that is put down in my deposition, it is a mistake - I might have said Mr. Upham was in the habit of employing him as a messenger.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is nothing of the sort in his deposition.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM EPHRAIM DULIN. I only know that I have never received these boxes since they were delivered to Mr. Upham - I know they were delivered to him - I delivered one of them to him myself, at the Crown tavern, kept by Symonds; the value of that one was twelve guineas: it was on a Saturday in September - they are manufactured abroad, but I sell them - I saw another one in his possession at that time; they were merely sent to him on approbation - I have not seen either of them since.</p>

            . I am housemaid at the Crown. I was in the room where Mr. Upham used to sit, at the time the prisoner took the boxes out - they were musical-boxes, and came from Mr. Dulin; I saw the prisoner go out of the room with them about eight o'clock in the evening, or a little after - I never saw him after; I do not know the day of the month - it was in September: he was taken up three weeks or a fortnight ago last Friday; he took them some weeks before that - I never saw him again; they stood on a table - Mr. Upham had left the house when he took them, and was not expected to return; I did not see Mr. Upham again till three weeks ago, and when he inquired for the boxes I said I had seen the prisoner take them; my fellow-servant has seen them since me, but they have not been found - I have lived at Symonds' about fifteen months, and am still there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mr. Upham is in town? A. I do not know: I have come from Mr. Symonds' to-day - I saw Mr. Upham a few days ago: he may be ill in bed there now, but I have not seen him for some days: I believe he is in the house - he was there on Saturday, but I do not often see him; I did not see him on Saturday, but I made his bed then - I do not recollect seeing him yesterday; I do not always see him, though I make his bed - he had been in bed, and was not well on Saturday - he was not in the room when I made his bed; he never dines in the coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the boxes wrapped in paper when you saw them? A. Yes - he did not take them out of the paper, but I heard him say they were musical boxes; I did not look at them, I understood they were Mr. Upham's, and were going to Mr. Dulin's, to be repaired; Mr. Upham had left the house about half an hour when I saw them - I did not state to the Magistrate that he had left three days.</p>

            . I am servant at the Crown, and have lived there nearly four months. I saw the prisoner bring two musical-boxes into the kitchen - they were kept in the room Mr. Upham used to be in; when he brought them into the kitchen they were in paper - I asked him what they were: he said they were musical-boxes, and that he was going to take them home presently - I did not know where he meant by home; I have not seen them since: Mr. Upham had left the house on the Monday, and I think this was Wednesday - it was on the same night as Mr. Upham went - I am positive of that; I heard the prisoner say they came from Mr. Dulin's, and he was going to take them home - I cannot say how long after this he was taken up; I was examined at Guildhall on a Monday - I do not know how long ago; I asked the prisoner to let me look at the boxes - he said he should not, for he was going to take them home presently, and went out of the kitchen; I tore the paper, thinking I should see them, and saw them, but could not see the music; I had seen Ford take one up stairs, playing, under his arm, a day or two before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About how long before? A. I cannot say, to be positive; I live at Mr. Symonds' now; I cannot say where Mr. Upham is now, whether he is in Devonshire or not. I am the kitchen-maid - it is a large house; I do not know whether Mr. Upham is there or not; it is impossible for me to say - he has been sleeping there for the last few nights.</p>

My fellow-servant, whom you will hear presently, contradicts me; I did not hear Nicholls tell the Magistrate she saw them in his possession three days after Mr. Upham left; she was at Guildhall twice - I was only there once.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever say it was three days after Mr. Upham left the house that you saw them? A.

            . The prisoner was given into my custody on the 11th of September, by Mr. Symonds, charged with stealing two musical-boxes; he said he knew nothing of them; I searched his lodgings, but found no boxes.</p>
               <p>MR. DULIN re-examined. The box I myself delivered to Mr. Upham was worth twelve guineas, the other twenty-five guineas - they were very large; I have seen Mr. Upham several times, but have not been able to find the boxes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What cases had they? A. Mahogany; they were very large - one played eight tunes, and the other four.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. SYMONDS. Q. The prisoner was absent for two days after this affair; did he return to your premises? A. He came to speak to one of my servants, and was taken up - that was the very day the loss was discovered.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he given you any notice of his meming to quit you? A. I discharged him two days after this happened - not for dishonesty; he was about nine months in my service.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He behaved well? A. Why, if I must answer you, I found two knives in his pocket, which shews a dishonest principle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. They were in the clothes I had on? A. No, in the clothes which were in his bundle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). Gentlemen, I may perhaps be permitted to state, that prior to my engaging to become a servant to Mr. Symonds, I was employed by Thomas Brandram, Esq., of Sise-lane, in the City of London, merchant, as his footman, for a period of two years and a half, whom, I have no doubt, will feel much pleasure in satisfying your Lordship and Gentlemen of the Jury, that I served him during that time with diligence, honesty, and good repute, which, I trust, will not be deemed undeserving of your kind attention and serious consideration. I acted in the capacity of a porter for my last employer, Mr. Symonds, in whose service I continued about nine months, during which time I made it my study and delight to make myself subservient to his interest, which I trust he will most readily admit. Gentlemen - With regard to the two boxes, which I am accused of having stolen, I can only say that I never saw nor had them in my possession after Mr. Upham left town, on the 8th of September last; and if that gentleman left them at the house of my late employer, Mr. Symonds, after I had given them to Mr. Upham, I declare most solemnly I was not aware of it; so far from attempting flight, I even went to Mr. Symonds' house, for the purpose of speaking to a waiter, upwards of a month afterwards, and was then given in charge.</p>

               <p>MR. SYMONDS. I never found anything amiss in his conduct before; I only discharged him for being careless.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Has he ever quarrelled with the other servants? A. I believe not.</p>

I employed the prisoner to print out of doors, at his own place; in July last, I discovered my loss - I received information, and went to Mr. Christie, of Snow-hill, and found 38lbs. of minion type, which I knew to be mine; I had lost considerably more; I sent for the prisoner to my house, and told him what I had seen, and that I was convinced the type was mine, and that Christie had informed me he had bought it of him - he did not for some time deny it being mine; he seemed confused, and said it was not mine, and he could prove of whom he had bought it; he had no minion for my work - it was kept in my shop in <placeName id="t18281023-55-crimeloc341">Chancery-lane</placeName>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230038"/>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was any body present at this conversation? A. No; my son had let the prisoner's father some rooms for a short time in Black Horse-court, Fleet-street; they were under the same roof as my son's business, but not the same rooms; his father was formerly in business, but not the same rooms; his father was formerly in business in the Borough; he left my son's premises in July or August, as near as I can tell - they worked together I believe at the time I got this information; the type found at Christle's is a font, but a very small one - they are regularly-assorted letters - it could not have been in the water; he came when I sent for him - he told me about a fortnight after that Shruhsole had sold it to him; I did not have him taken up; I had lost a great deal more type.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you took him up did he not demand some money as wages? A. No, the account is in my favour - he began to do business for me in January; he might have a job in hand at the time I discovered the type; he once said something was due to him - I said there was not: I took him before Mr. Rogers - he was not inclined to discharge him; I did not say I could produce a boy who had seen him steal it; my son informed me his errand-boy had seen something.</p>
               <p>Q. From July till October you took no proceedings against him? A. I was extremely busy, and out of town- I have a house at Newington-green, and it takes a good deal of time going backwards and forwards, and Mrs. Wilks was ill; I plead guilty to delay, but I was busy - I never proposed to settle it for 15l.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you think it easy to steal an entire font? A. I should think it very difficult, as it is an exact proportion of type; I should think it as easy to swear to sugar, tea, or sand, as to type - I should be very lothe to swear to any taken from my premises.</p>

            . I live in King-street, Snow-hill; Wilks saw some minion type at my house - he said he believed it to be his - it was a complete font; I had purchased it of the prisoner about the beginning of May last, at 2s. 6d. per 1b.; it might have been a little used but not much - being thrown into the river might discolour it a little; this appeared to have been used, and it is always washed with water after being used; I think when Wilks saw it the appearance would be the same if it had fallen into water; I met the prisoner at the corner of Fleet-market after Wilks had seen it, and told him of it; he gave me Shrubsole's card, saying it was bought of him; I think nobody can swear to type - a printer may have the same description of letter from the same font; I could not swear to my type; I appeared before the Magistrate in September.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When type has been used, is it put into water and washed? A. We brush it with pearlash, and then wash it with water; Thames water would make no other effect on it.</p>
               <p>Q. As to its being bought of Shrubsole, did he not say his father was in some circumstances which made him unwilling to tell where he bought it? A. He did afterwards; he sold it to me publicly in my shop, and did not tell me to conceal it; it is as complete a font as the quantity will admit.</p>

            . I called on Mr. Christie in July, we were talking on business when a message came, in consequence of which this type was shewn to me; I immediately told him it was my father's, and was stolen; it is decidedly possible to identify type - I have examined it minutely.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What founder does your father buy from? A. It was part of the materials of the Evening Times newspaper, it came from Pouchee's - I know it by the nicks on it; that is common to all type; he might make type exactly like it for other people; I charged the prisoner with having some of this minion type in April last - he said he had some which he would give me; I said it was my father's - he acknowledged it, and said it was very little; he afterwards gave it to me, it was nearly half a pound; it was no part of this font, but similar to it: his father and I worked in the same place then.</p>
               <p>Mr. WILKS. I can speak positively to this type - it is certainly mine, as far as I am able to judge - there is a peculiarity about it; there is always a nick to direct the compositors to keep it all up one way, but this letter has two nicks; and referring to my type I find it the same - this must he caused by the founder being obliged to mix two fonts to complete the order; he might possibly do so for another printer.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CHRISTIE re-examined. It is very common for type to have two nicks, and I have seen three - part of this has three.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Between one and two o'clock in the morning I saw the prosecutor and prisoner together; the prosecutor had been drinking, but knew what he was about - he had hold of the prisoner, and charged her with robbing him of three half-crowns and a shilling; she said she had taken no money, but did take the box, and he might have it if he liked: the prosecutor gave the same account he has now - she said she did not intend to steal it; I opened the box - there was nothing in it. I knew the prisoner before; a man came up to her in the street, and wanted to speak to her; I would not let him, and he knocked the prosecutor down.</p>
               <p> - HORTON. I took the prisoner, and searched her as far as decency would allow, but I knew by her position she had something about her - I could not get a woman to search her, and from a certain part of her person I took three half-crowns and a shilling, which I gave to Noyes, who is not here.</p>

On the afternoon of the 29th of September I saw the prisoners in company with another, at the end of Cornhill - I followed them, thinking they looked suspicious, and in Cheapside I saw them survey two or three silversmiths' shops; I then followed them to Ludgate-hill, and saw them cross the street to Mrs. West's shop - I saw them walk three or four times round under the archway, and return again: Simpson twice looked into the front-window on Ludgate-street - I went into Mr. Alger's shop, where the last witness lives and told him to observe the lad, pointing him out - I then went down Ludgate-hill, facing the passage opposite the Old Bailey, came round through the archway, and saw Jones talking to somebody; I passed them, and saw Simpson still standing at the corner - I crossed over to Mr. Alger's, and said to the witness."You have kept your eye on the boy, shall you know him again?" he said he should; I then crossed, and saw the boy cross his hand at the window - I went round the hill, returned, and saw the glass was cut across and down: I went in and shewed it to Smith - I turned my eye, and Jones was leaning with his arm against the corner - he forced the glass in some little distance: I asked if there was another door - Smith said there were two side doors; Simpson then put his hand up, took the gass from the frame, and put it into his pocket - Jones immediately turned round, and drew the property out of the window: I saw him draw out some articles - the porter opened the first door, and in opening the second, which leads into the street, the bolt made a noise, and they immediately made off: I kept my eye on Jones - Simpson turned round and looked me full in the face; I followed Jones up the bill, and stopped him two doors from the house; I asked him what he had been doing - he said Nothing: I took him back to the shop, and asked what he had got in his pocket - he said Nothing; I found these articles in his coat-pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why did you not make somebody else take Simpson? A. I had not an opportunity - I was at one time on the opposite side, and at another time by the gateway: I saw him pass him hand across the window - the window was not broken, but cut and starred; I never saw one broken in that way by accident - glass so thick as this would not split by the pressure of the elbow without being first starred; we might he not above six yards from Simpson - I saw nothing in his hand to cut the glass with; he did not run - I cannot conceive that it could he done by accident in the way it was broken - Jones took the glass; he took no goods out; it rained at the time, and there were a number of people standing under the archway - none of them are here; the crowd would hide him; the glass broken was in the gateway, where the people were standing - the prisoners stood rather away from the people, and were more conspicuous to me; the persons standing up were looking on to Ludgate-hill - I knew Simpson had not got the property, and by taking him I should have made a disturbance, and the one with the property would have escaped; the property was taken about four minutes after the window was broken: I knew Simpson's person before - he had on a brown jacket, waistcoat and trowsers, and a black hat - his jacket was braided.</p>

E. Davis" on the back of it; I wrote that to indentify it as the cheque I had received from the prisoner; I always do it the moment I receive it; I will not say I did it in his presence, but it must have been before he left the office; the cheque was sent to Gosling's, the bankers of our establishment; it was returned from Gosling's on the following day dishonoured (looking at a cheque,) this is the cheque - it was my endorsement on it; John James Lawson is one of the firm of the office; there are others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLHUS. Q. Your's is an office of great business? A. It is - my department is the publishing, which is separate from where the public came; we have one other customer named Davis; I am certain the prisoner is the person who gave me the cheque, and that he said he came from Davis - by W. E. I mean West-end Davis, to distinguish him from the other, who lives in the City.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are the Christian names of the other Mr. Davis? A. We do not know their Christian names - they go with us by the names of West-end and City Davis; I know the prisoner acted for the West-end Davis - he came regularly from him, and took a very different quantity of papers to the other.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you the books of the firm here? A. No; my knowledge is derived from those books, there is no other criterion - but I have not only to examine the various accounts, but to go through every account, and if there is any default, I report it to my employers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does your knowledge merely arise from the inspection of the books, or from your knowledge of the business of the house? A. From the ledgers; I generally go through the accounts every evening, and my habit of checking the accounts enables me to say no such customer was authorised to draw on the house on the 26th of August.</p>
               <p>JOHN DAVIS. I am a newspaper-agent, and live in Broad-street, St. Giles': the prisoner was in my employ. I have purchesed newspapers from the Times for these nine years, to the amount of 75l. a week; I always sent down a cheque on the Monday morning for the week's papers in advance; I send it by different boys, sometimes by the prisoner, and sometimes by others; I did not owe them a halfpenny on the 25th of August - not to my knowledge: the prisoner lived three years and three quarters with me - I am well acquainted with his hand-writing (looking at the cheque) - I will swear this is the hand-writing of the prisoner - I am confident the whole of the cheque is in his writing; but this on the back, and W. E. Davis is not his.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 25th of August had you sent him to the Times office? A. I saw him on the Sunday, and his business was to go to fetch the papers without further orders; he comes every morning at six o'clock - I saw him on Monday, he brought the papers; I did not see him on the Tuesday, nor afterwards, till he was apprehended on my offering a reward of twenty guineas; he left me on the 25th of August, at nine o'clock in the evening - I did not see him again till the 8th of September, when he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see this cheque? A. On the Wednesday morning - Street sent me up a memorandum, and I saw the cheque - I had never seen it before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you so well acquainted with the prisoner's hand-writing, that you can swear the cheque is his? A. I am; it is disguised from what he generally writes; but I am confident it is his writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In paying for your papers, would you deliver to the person who went for you a cheque on your own banker's? A. Yes; Messrs. Praeds, of Temple-bar, are my bankers - I never sent the Times a cheque on any body but my own banker's, as the amount was so much; I have no customer named Taylor.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 8th of September, at No. 14, Home-street, Paddington.(The cheque was here read, see Indictment.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Overwhelmed with despair at the awful situation in which I am placed, and being called upon to say something in my defence, I will not trespass long upon your time but in as brief a manner as I can, will state the facts of how I came in possession of the cheque. My Lord, I stand before you for having forged a cheque, and afterwards uttering it, knowing it to be forged; I declare most solemnly that I am entirely innocent of either the one or the other. On Saturday, previous to the presentation of the bill, I was at a gambling-house near Temple-bar; by appointment I was to meet a person there on business: a young man, of a most gentlemanly appearance, took a pocket-book from his pocket - he opened it before me, it contained various papers - I saw him drop one; he having left the room, I picked it up unperceived by any one - on opening it, I found it to be a cheque for 64l. 10s.; I rejoiced at my seeming good fortune - put it in my pocket, and left the house; being embarrassed in my affairs, and not hearing any thing respecting the loss of the cheque, on the Monday following, I presented it to one Mr. Street, offering to pay him what I was indebted to him; Mr. Street took it, deducting his account, and gave me the balance. My Lord, in regard to my absconding, I answer, that knowing I had become possessed of the cheque in a clandestine manner, having received the balance from Mr. Street, who knew me well, and being convinced that should Mr. Street call upon me for the money which he had given me, I should not be able to reimburse him, I left the service of the best of masters. My Lord and Gentlemen, - I have been in the service of my prosecutor for the last four years; I call God to witness, at whose tribunal I must one day render an account, that I have never injured him in any one instance, but have in every thing served him faithfully, which my prosecutor will not deny. My Lord and Gentlemen, I have a wife and three helpless infants, destitute of bread, in consequence of my long confinement - and aged parents forlorn and distracted for my disgraceful and awful situation, trembling for the result. My Lord and Gentlemen, I have stated the whole truth of my unfortunate case; should you after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230046"/>the above facts deem me guilty of the charge, I leave my life and all my future prospects in your hands, feeling assured, that whatever may be the decision against me, it will be given with due deliberation; and should the utmost penalty of the law be awarded me, I shall still be able to say with my last breath - I am innocent.</p>

I saw Wheatley and Todd take some horse-hair to the prisoner's premises, in Church-street, Mile-end; they took it in, and he weighed it and gave them money - when they came out they said he gave them 1s. per lb. for it: I think this was on the 23d of July last year - it was about a month before I went to the Magistrate.</p>

            . I saw Hodges turn into the prisoner's house one day, but I do not know on what day, nor what month - it was in the last year; I was on the opposite side of the way, and did not hear what passed.</p>
               <p>JAMES HANLEY re-examined. Q. When did you find this hair? A. On the 18th of August; we had apprehended the other four men on the 17th, and a warrant was taken out for the prisoner - we went there the next day, but he was not found till the 4th of this month, when the prosecutor met him in the street.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230051"/>WILLIAM PURKIS re-examined. Q. Do you know at what time you were robbed? A. I had been robbed for two months before August, 1827. I can swear to this hair, as it had been washed out on the Monday before it was found - it was not washed to my mind, and I sent it to be washed again; I can swear to it - it must have been taken in that week: all the hair I lost was worth 3s. per lb.</p>
               <p>COURT to DANIEL MURPHY. Q. You were before the Magistrate on the 18th of August in last year; How long before that did you see the men take the hair to the prisoner's house? A. About a month; I was afraid of them, they were all big fellows - I saw them take the hair and put it round their waists, under their shirts; they took it to this man's house, and there they took it from their waists, and gave it to him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you come into my house? A. No- I stood at the door; I saw you standing at the door when they came - you went in, and they after you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My friends are not here to rectify it; if you could put it off to another day I should be obliged; I can bring plenty of proof that it was not worth more than I gave for it.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. PURKIS. Q. Had you ever sold any horse-hair to the prisoner? A. No, never. I have some hair at 1s. per lb., but what I lost was worth 3s. per lb.</p>
               <p>JURY to DANIEL MURPHY. Q. What part of the 1s. per lb. did you have? A. I had none; they asked me to go and have something, but I did not; I had no promise of any thing - they said I knew of it, and if I told they would give me a good hiding, and be the death of me, no doubt. I staid away from Mr. Purkis' above a month.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the men take the hair from their persons, in the presence of the prisoner? A. Yes - I can swear he saw it there.</p>

No, nor a knocker; that is the only place to which a person should come on business, and go out; the wooden gate in the pales, out of which Lanham got, is only used for carts to come in.

            . I am a constable. I received information, and went on the 14th of October, and found two asses in a shed in Gibraltar-walk, Bethnal-green; I waited there till the evening, when the two prisoners, and another person came to the shed, and began to feed the asses: I went in and asked who they belonged to, and each of the prisoners owned one - I asked who the third boy was, and he said he merely came to see them; I then asked where they got them, and they said they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230056"/>bought them in Smithfield on Friday last - I asked what they gave for them, and Belnap said he gave 7s. for his, and Bracken said he gave 10s. for his - I told them I suspected they were stolen, and took them to the office.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I have known the prisoner these two or three months; I was at Smithfield with Bracken on the 10th of October - I did not see the other prisoner there; I saw Mr. Sturgeon there, whom I had seen before - I saw him buy three asses that day; I do not know whether Bracken saw him buy them - a drover, who lives near Mr. Sturgeon's, took the drove of asses out of the market; Mr. Sturgeon told me to mind them - I went with them down to the Globe; Bracken was there, but the other was not - we staid there till about half-past eight o'clock, when we went to the field, and he took out one donkey, and I took another; we took them to the top of Hoxton and put them into a field - the next morning we went to Belnap's in Old-street-road, and told him we had been and taken two donkeys, which Mr. Sturgeon had been buying, and we had stolen two out of his drove: Belnap had the smallest and paid me 7s. for it - they told me they took the other round Hackney and Hotherton; Belnap offered 13s. for the other, but Bracken would not take it, and he kept it - I believe it was found in the stable; I told the same story to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you always told the same story? A. Yes; I have been in the House of Correction - they put me there for fear I should not come here; I was never there, nor in a Court of Justice before - my mother was at the Police-office; she did not tell me what to say - she did not say "I say Sam, mind what I told you, when you went down yonder, mind you say 'Mind E. B. B.'" nor any thing to that effect, either there or at any other place.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. STURGEON. Q. What did you give for the asses? A. 18s. for one, and 20s. for the other.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police-officer. On Saturday night, on the 11th of October, about half past ten o'clock, I saw a boat alongside of a lighter - I suppose half a mile from this barge; I was coming down the river at the time - I saw a man standing on the gunwale of the lighter in a stooping position; I put my boat alongside that boat, and saw Daley in it stooping down with his face on the rope; I said to him, "What have you got here?" he said Rope, and he got on the lighter where Haggerty was standing - I had them both into my boat; I then saw two lads, who, as far as I can understand, were Barrett and Dwyer; I asked Daley how he came by the rope - he said they picked it up in the river, and were going to sell it to get some beer; I asked Haggerty if that was the case - he laughed, and spoke in Irish; I took them to the office; I then went to the lighter and found two more bundles of rope - I went to the next lighter, No. 28, and there found Barrett and Dwyer asleep; I awoke them and took them - some more rope was found on board that lighter.</p>

            . On Saturday night, at eleven o'clock, I went round to see that all was right, and saw a barge alongside the jetty, loaded with scaffold cord; I went round, and asked the watchman if it was right - he said "No, the barge is gone adrift;" I went and found she was fastened to a buoy - I saw Daley on the gunwale of a lighter, by the side of a boat; I asked where he was going - he said on shore; I said, "That is not the way, come with me" - he came with me on shore, and I left him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

After I got my money I was ordered to watch this lighter - I was rather tipsy, and Haggerty would not go till he saw me safe into the lighter; these boys would not go till they saw me safe, and I told them not to go till I had a nap; I then went and saw this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230057"/>rope in the boat - I did not know what to do with it, and the Police-boat came down.</p>

            . I am an officer, and have the care of these docks. On the 23d of September, I heard the coat was lost - I went and secreted myself in a place near the flue, and about a quarter-past six o'clock, the prisoner came and tried to get into the place where I was - the men should have left about ten minutes before that; he could not get in, he went down, and got into the flue, and came out with something; the bricks on which I stood gave way- he heard the noise, and crept into the flue again, and came out without any thing; he then caught hold of me; I called for the beadle, who came and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you say you saw him with any coat or jacket? A. It was something dark - I cannot swear what it was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find any coat in the flue? A. Yes - I went into the flue, and found this jacket, but it was removed from where it had been; I have no hesitation in saying he had it; I cannot swear positively it was the coat - I suppose there are about two thousand men on the premises.</p>

Adaman sent me to watch; I saw Woodroff in a field - he saw me, and ran across a field; Barrett, who was with me, ran after him to Lee-bridge-road, and took him - I found four fowls and a duck ten or a dozen yards from the spot where I first saw Woodroff; they were dead, but quite warm - Mills owned them.</p>

               <p>WOODROFF's Defence. When they first took me to the watch-house, the officer said, "You have got another;" he said, "Yes, I have;" he said, "Can you swear to this man?" "Yes," said he, "I saw him throw the fowls over the hedge, and they were found in a ditch:" I was with some friends catching birds, and it is generally the custom to run across fields to turn the birds back again.</p>
               <p>JOYCE's Defence. I bought three ducks and three fowls of a man for 6s. - they were white ducks, and speckled fowls; they have no mark on them.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN BARRETT. I did not see any bird-catchers or any persons at all,</p>

I make up one bed for a single man - the prisoner came to lodge with me in the latter part of September; I had a trunk in one of my rooms - it was locked, but the room was not; the key of the trunk was kept in the cupboard in my bed-room - the prisoner had nothing to do with my rooms; in the trunk was a little box, with a ring and three sovereigns in it; on the 3d of October I saw my key safe when I went out in the morning - when I came back it was gone; I went down to the prisoner about it - he denied it, but I felt it in his trouser's pocket; I then went out, and on my return he threw the key at me, and said he had taken it for a lark - I went up, opened the trunk, and all was right; I hung the key on a nail in the cupboard, and on the Monday I missed my money, ring and little box - I went down to the prisoner, and asked him to give me the man's money - he said, "What man?" I said,"Don't ask me what man, I mean the man that is sick in the hospital" - he said he knew nothing of it; it was in the chest - he took his hat to go out; I said he should not go out till I found the money - I sent for the officer, who found the ring and one sovereign.</p>

            , of Chatham, "Six months," meaning that the account had not been standing six months, the goods having been sent in May, and they would not be paid for till November; he went again in April last, and then he writes against it "Next journey:" in April or May last we desired a conference with him on the subject of his accounts; he produced a long list, in pencil, of accounts which he had received, and not paid in, as was his duty to do, but had purloined - I think it very likely he used the word embezzled; we told him if he would give up every instance of what he had embezzled, we would not prosecute him, but go on his former security, which was a bond of indemnity - he said he had never received any account of any one person who lived out of London but what he had mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a statement did he give? A. A pencil memorandum, and some verbal statements; this written list (looking at it) was not made out in his presence, nor shown to him; he said there was every single instance on which he had received money from the country, and not accounted for it; no account of 1l. 12s. from Mr. Lawrence, on the 15th of September was received - here is his book of receipts of that day, and there is no such account in it- I never received it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you the person who spoke to him at that time? A. Yes; I can swear he never gave me an account of the 1l. 12s.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. You say that not only Mr. Lawrence's money is not down here in the book, but from your own recollection that he did not account for it to you? A. Kidley's account at Chatham was 1l. 15s. 6d., but he did not receive the whole of it; I believe he received 1l. 3s. Mr. Hathersick was the gentleman who succeeded the prisoner, and he went round the journey to investigate the accounts - he is not here; this letter we received from him - it is addressed by the prisoner to him, and is in the prisoner's hand-writing; the sums mentioned in these indictments were not mentioned by the prisoner at the time of the investigation, nor at any other time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. This man had been in your service five years, had he? A. Yes, thereabouts; I know nothing of a firm of Russell and Warren - I have heard of them about eight or nine months: at the time of this investigation we had security to the amount of 500l., in a bond of indemnity, for any deficiency of the prisoner's - the parties were solvent, and paid us on the 5th of June; if the prisoner had stated these accounts in his investigation, they would have been paid no doubt - we did not turn him away till the 31st of May; we have never had him back since that; when we spoke of his accounts he was away for a week - we wrote to his friends; he came and made up a story; we took him again, and he went this journey - I think we took him about a month ago, in September; we could not find him before - the officer said he was on the look out for him; I did not know he was on the journey for the other firm till afterwards - we had a warrant out against him.(The letter was here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>DEAR SIR, - Agreeable to my promise, I write, but am sorry to say, not with the cash, as I cannot get it these three weeks; since I had the pleasure of seeing you, I have heard that Mr. Warren intends to prosecute me, if any more accounts are brought against me, and they are only waiting your letter to hear: now, my dear Sir, I know your kindness, and the unpleasant situation you are placed in; my liberty and prospects in this life are entirely left in your hands. If you take the accounts in against me I am done, which I am sure is not your wish; I pledge you my word all shall be paid long before the next journey is due; if you will send me the accounts, I will get a friend to pay them at different times, saying they wanted to Mr. account, or in any other way you may think proper; you have only to say on the bills - "not at home;" I am sure you would not be the means of sending me out of the country. It is not for myself I care, but my poor motherless child; for God's sake, Mr. Hathersick, let me know what you intend to do, and when and where I may take the liberty of sending you a letter; will you be pleased to send a letter for me to the barn by Sunday night's post; I leave here at ten o'clock to night by a sailing packet. I hope you will excuse this scrawl, and not say that I am in London.</p>
               <p>I am, Sir, your humble servant, J. HENDERSON.</p>
               <p>For God's sake do what you can for me. I have heard from London, and know they only wait for your letter.</p>

               <p>JOHN JONES. I am a hatter, and live in Tottenham-court-road. This witness gave me information, I went in pursuit, and saw the prisoner about one hundred yards from my shop with this hat under his arm; I ran by him first, then turned, and followed him about four hundred yards, and just as I went to take hold of him, he dropped this hat and ran; I ran and took him; this is my hat he had it under his arm.</p>

               <p>HENRY WHITTAKER re-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner? A. Yes: about a quarter before one o'clock, he was looking about - I asked what he was looking for; he said for some things which had been thrown over the wall belonging to him; he did not say how he came possessed of them, but said that if I would go with him to Blackwall, to a shipmate of his, he would redeem the property; in going along, he said it was not his own, but belonged to the Captain of the ship Charles; I then gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am an officer on duty at the docks; on the 20th of October I heard the prosecutor had lost a shovel, and I found the prisoner about three hundred yards from the place, in East Smithfield, with a shovel; I asked him how he got it - he said he bought and paid for it - this was about half-past six o'clock.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was there at work; I put down my shovel where there were a lot of shovels - the foreman told me to go and get the earth down for some stones to pass; I went for my shovel but some one had taken it, as I suppose in place of his own, as we never mind to have our own - I said some one had got it, and the officer said "Come along, I will shew you the man who has got it," and he struck me a rap on the head; my foreman came up and said "Let the man go, he did not want to steal it," but they would not let me go.</p>

               <p>COURT to THOMAS HAYLOCK. Q. Will you swear positively that the prisoner said he had bought it and paid for it? A. Yes, he did; when he got to the prosecutor he said,"Well, then, it may be a mistake;" the prisoner is a pavior, and the prosecutor is in the employ of Messrs. Bennett and Hunt.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who was he talking to in the Curtain-road? A. To a tall man,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230070"/>who turned away, said Good bye, and went to Chapel-street.</p>

            . On Saturday, the 11th of October, the little boy came to my house to fetch a pair of trousers and a waistcoat - I gave them to him in a silk handkerchief; in about an hour he returned, and said I had given him a wrong bundle - I said, "No such thing;" he said,"You must come to my father" - I went, and in going back he said there stood a man just like the man who took his parcel; I said, "If you think it is him, go and fetch your father" - he fetched him, and he took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the prisoner when the boy said, "That is like the man who took my parcel?" A. Twenty or thirty yards perhaps - he stood then talking to another tall man.</p>

            . I am eight years old. I was coming down the Curtain-road with David Simeon; the prisoner called him, and said "What have you got there?" he said"My brother's trousers and waistcoat;" the prisoner said"Where did you come from?" he said "From Mr. Pratt, in Henrietta-street;" the prisoner said "Mrs. Pratt sent me to say she gave you the wrong parcel, and to give you this;" he took that parcel, and gave him another; he then ran away with it; this was about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know the time? A. I heard the beer-man going along - it was near the corner public-house that the prisoner took the bundle; I am sure he ran away; I have been talking with my father and mother about this business, and to David - I had never seen the prisoner before - it was about thirty yards from the public-house; he ran straight along, so fast that I could not see him; I saw him again about twenty-five minutes past one o'clock.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say the man ran away with it? A. Yes - this was near the public-house; it was near the same place that I saw the prisoner afterwards - that was the reason why I charged him as being the man; there was a crowd round.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for and took the prisoner; he denied it, but the boys said he was the man - some woman came up, and said she had been in his company till very near the time they charged him with it; I think she said till within ten minutes, or something like that, of two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear that the hour of two was mentioned? A. That did not take my attention at the time; I would not be bound to swear it; it is my belief that she did say so.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and went to the house with the witness - I could not find the prisoner, but he described her, and stated verbatim almost as he has now; the prosecutor met her the next morning, and took her into a house, and sent a neighbour for me - I went and found her there with him; the moment I went into the room, he said "This woman robbed me of my watch in Sun-court yesterday morning; in going to the watch-house;" she met three very low looking characters, and said to one of them, "Tom, good bye, I am going for seven years," and the tears came into her eyes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was on the 18th he met me, and said he had come from my parents, and they were all well; he said he had but 10s., and he had spent it in drink - he met a young woman, and asked her for a bed; she said she had a room in Sun-court, and we went there, to a room on the first-floor - there was a man in bed there, and we went up to the other floor; he lay down on the bed with his clothes on; he sent the woman for 1s. worth of gin - I heard a person come in in; I went and said to the young woman, "Is that you come in;" a man there said "Yes, she and I have drank it;" the prosecutor then jumped off the bed, came down, and said I had got his watch; I said I had not seen it - he then said "Where is the young woman I sent for the gin?" and said to the man "Have you got it?" he said No; he then went out - I waited an hour and a half - he did not come; he had a pot of beer at a house the night before, and a quartern and a half of rum, at the White Hart public-house; when he asked about the watch I said"I have never been out of the house;" I undressed myself, and had nothing on me; he said he was fully convinced that I had not got it; he then went and got the officer.</p>
               <p>COURT to JAMES PEARCY. Q. Were you at any house the night before? A. I had a pot of beer at one house - I had no spirits; I was quite sober - there was no other woman in the house but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the officer came in, the prosecutor had had three pints of beer, and given 1s. to a young man to go for an officer - I said I was quite innocent, and would not move for it; the prosecutor took out some gold, and said "If you will tell me where the watch is, I will give you money to take it out, if you have pawned it."</p>
               <p>COURT to JAMES PEARCY. Q. Where did you find her? A. At her lodging the next morning - I had but 6s. 6d. the morning before, and had only 2s. left; I had neither gold nor silver.</p>

On the morning of the 18th of September, I was sitting between two and three o'clock, on the shambles at Whitechapel - I was sober, but very tired; I live at Sheerness; the prisoner came and asked what I did there; I said I was waiting for a coach; I had been to two houses to try to get a lodging, but they could not accommodate me; she said, "I can show you where you can get a bed;" I asked her how far it was - she said, "Not far;" I went about fifty yards, she met two more - they said,"Where are you going?" she said, "To a house, to get a lodging for this gentleman;" they said, "You know where to go;" and we all went to a house, and into a room on the first-floor - I saw the woman of the house, and gave her 6d. for my bed, but did not give the prisoner any money; she did not ask for any; I said to the others, "I am going to sleep here, and I will thank you to disperse;" they said, No, they would stop; I said, "I don't want you to stop here;" they would not disperse; I felt the prisoner's hand coming out of my pocket; I said, "You have taken my money;" she said she had not; I had not given her 2s. - she wanted 3s. of me; she began to unbutton my dress; I said, "I will thank you to disperse;" while the prisoner's hand was about me, I missed my purse with two sovereigns in it and some silver; I said, "If you don't give me the money I will call the watchman;" the other two woman were in the room at the time; I called the watchman; the person below let him in - he came up, and I told him the prisoner had robbed me of two sovereigns and 1l. worth of silver in a leather purse; the watchman found 17s. 6d. in the purse on the bed, but no sovereigns; I also lost a tobacco-box; nothing else was found but a bit of India-rubber; the watchman searched the room, and the other woman; I had seen the two sovereigns and the silver safe in the purse at five or six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where had you seen them? A. I came to London in the morning, and saw them at a house I had been at - I do not know the name of it; I had not taken lodgings; I was there getting a pint of beer - I took out my money to see that it was correct; the house is a very little way from Irongate at the Tower; I then walked down the Minories - I only went to two houses to ask for a lodging; I did not stop there long - I kept walking about till I got to Whitechapel at near two o'clock; I did take a little beer at the houses where I asked for a lodging; I was at Irongate till near nine, standing outside the house for about half an hour; I had been about with a truck to sell ketchup - that truck was taken down by the Mint; there were two men drawing it, and I was in it riding to where it was hired; I was not in the truck above five minutes; I asked the men to have something to drink, and they went with me to a back part of Whitechapel; I then said, "I will not go any further;" I know the name of one of the men was Griffiths; I lent them 1s. a piece - I do not know where they live; I was on the shambles but not asleep; I can swear that three women did not come to me; I did not say to them that my friends had behaved very shabby to me, that I had lent them 1s. a piece, and they left me there and I fell asleep; I do not know whether it was a front room or a back - it was a room where there were old rags, rope, and iron; I was sober; I gave one of the women 1s. for showing me the room; one of them said, "I should like to have a drop of gin," and I gave 1s.; I did not offer the prisoner 2s. to sleep with her - she wanted 3s. for me to stop with her; I said "I would rather you would disperse;" I said "I would not give you 2s. let alone 3s.;" I was not at any public-house with them; I was not sitting on the bed with them - the prisoner was close to the bed; I was looking at the watchman when he searched her, and he found 8s. 4d. on her; the room was on the first-floor - I do not know whether it was a front-room.</p>

I found on her - and this tobacco-box, and 3d. or 4d. on the other women.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take any means to ascertain whether she had any thing in her mouth? A. Yes; I took hold of her mouth, and said, "Spit them out;" she said, "What? I have got nothing;" she spoke in a good tone of voice - not half a second had elapsed: the prosecutor said he had given 6d. for his bed, and one of the girls something for beer; he did not say whether there had been any chaffing about 2s. or 3s.; - he never told me he had offered 2s. to the woman; I should think he had drunk more than a pint or two of beer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she say any thing about 2s. that night? A. No. the prosecutor looked very red; I thought he had been drinking something, but he spoke very freely - he was very much flurried.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at the watch-house when the prosecutor and prisoner came there; the prosecutor seemed as sober as the generality of men would be at that time; he might perhaps have had a pint of beer or so; I took notice of him - he was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If the watchman has sworn that he appeared to have drunk more than a pint or two of beer, is that true? A. He appeared perfectly sober; he might have taken a pint or two; he did not tell me he had offered 2s. to this woman to sleep with her - he identified the person; that was nearly all that happened; he told me he had sent some one from the house for drink.</p>

No - she had it in her pocket, and I was going to take it out - she said "I will take it out;" I caught it in her hand - it was not cleverly out of her pocket. <rs id="t18281023-167-verdict988" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am head-messenger at the Navy office - the prisoner was one of the messengers there; there is an allowance of candles during the six winter months; the housekeeper supplies them to get the coals and other things to be used in the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there any pretence for saying, that in any of the Government departments, any of the messengers or other persons, can use, off the premises of the King, what is allowed them to use there? A. No; I have no doubt about that - I have been there about seven months.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WHEATLY re-examined. Q. How long have you been in the Navy office? A. Nearly twenty-six years; I have heard that a certain quantity of candles and brown paper is allowed to messenger to light the fires, and if they can save any thing of it, they take it away - I believe it is done, but not from authority, but that does not apply to such paper as this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The candles and other things are allowed from October to March, and if I can save any, I take them home; with respect to that white paper some time ago Mr. Vinal's room was altered, and a desk put away - I believe, to tell the truth, some of the paper, that was in the desk, may be there. Mr. Smith's room is very hot in the summer time, and the drawers smelt very much - I was ordered to clean them, and some of that paper was in them.</p>

On the 3d or 4th of August, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was coming down Oxford-street, and saw a man with paintings on a board - I was looking at them and a person spoke to me; we walked on together, and in consequence of some representations he made to me, I gave him a little silver - I had never seen him before, to my knowledge, but I gave him the silver out of charity; he said he was in distress, and had a wife and child - I had no other conversation with him, except about the pictures, and about his wife and family: the shops were open and people were about - there was no look or act of an indecent nature passed between us; I was going to Mr. Hatchard's in a few days afterwards, when the prisoner, and the person I had met before, and another person, overtook me; they said "You know what you have been doing, and if you don't give us money, you know what we can do with you;" I said "I am a servant - I can't afford to give any money, and I have done nothing that I know of," with that, to get rid of them, I gave them a shilling; they did not name any sum of money that I was to give - this was about seven or eight o'clock; after this, the prisoner and the other two men, came to my master's house and rang the bell - I spoke to them from the area; the prisoner was with them, but not close - he was within sight; the man I had met first asked me to give him 5l., or otherwise he would expose me: I said I had no money - I was a servant and could not afford to give any money; I said "Whatever you have to do, you must do;" the next day, which was the 9th, we went upon the Circuit, and returned on the 9th of September. On the 10th Mr. Warren went down to his country seat, near Seven Oaks, and I was packing up the things, to send to him: in about a quarter of an hour after the carriage was gone, the prisoner rang at the bell - I opened the area-door and he threw down this note. (The Note was put in and read.)</p>
               <p>September, 1828.</p>
               <p>SIR, - I should be glad if you can oblige me with the loan of 5l., and I will let you have it next Monday week, without fail. Be so kind as to meet me in half an hour's time, at the corner of the square.</p>
               <p>Mr. Goodall, at Mr. Warren's, No. 15, Bedford-square. I asked him who it came from, but he went away; in about a quarter of an hour a servant of Lord Chief Justice Best's called - I showed him the note, and had some conversation with him; he went and got the streetkeeper, and I went to the corner of the square, to see if I could see any thing of the prisoner, but I could not: on the following morning there came another letter, by the twopenny-post - this is it; I went out the next day, and met the prisoner and the man I met first, but the third man I never saw afterwards - the other man said to me, "Have you got the money? the 5l.?" I said, "I have not;" the prisoner then said, "You can let us have half-of it now, and half another time;" I said, "I can neither let you have half, nor the whole - I have not so much:" the prisoner said, "Come, you can surely let us have half, for I am going out of town this evening, and want to pack up my things;" I told them I would make an appointment to meet them at any house at any hour they thought proper - the prisoner and the other man whispered together, and appointed the Orange Tree public-house, in the New-road, opposite Gower-street, at half-past two o'clock; I told them I might perhaps get some money by that time. I went to Bow-street, and got two officers, and went to the Orange Tree - I waited there some time, but saw no person; I then said, "I think we shall not meet them here - we are more likely to meet them in going home;" the officers said, "You go on, and we will follow you;" I went down a street, and saw the prisoner at a distance, sitting on a step; he got up, and walked a little way, then looked behind him, and ran - I followed him, but he turned down a street, and I lost him - about eight o'clock that night the area-bell rung; I went to the door, and there was the prisoner and another man - they said, "Have you got the money?" I said, "I can do nothing to-night, but I will meet you to-morrow, at the public-house; Why did not you meet me at the public-house?" they said they must have the money, or part of it, that night: I said, "I can give you no money to-night - if you will call at eleven o'clock to-morrow, I will see what I can do for you;" had I had any one in the house I should have taken them then. I wrote a letter immediately to Mr. Wheatley, who sent me word he would pay attention to my letter, but he did not come, and the prisoner was in the square from ten o'clock in the morning till half-past two, when he was taken - we had coals coming in, and the prisoner walked by two or three times, but did not take any notice of me; the officer came about half-past two, but Mr. White took him - he said to Mr. White, "What business have you to take me? Are you an officer? I will make you pay for this;" I said, "Never you mind that - you are my prisoner;" Mr. White went for another officer, but could not get him - Mr. Wheatley and another officer came down the area, and asked if that was the man; I said Yes: they took him to Bow-street, and I appeared in the evening - the prisoner, in my hearing, said, he did not deliver the first letter, but he afterwards said that two gentlemen gave him 6d. to throw it down the area.(The second letter was here read.)</p>
               <p>September, 1828.</p>
               <p>SIR, - I am surprize at you not cumming to meet me; on the second thought I am not, for I perceived a friend call on you - you was so kind as to let him se my letter, and then go to the street-keeper to come to you; but you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230077"/>to think to frighting us, it is all in vain, for your friend is a person that I can expose, knowing is character so well; and the first time i se him any were, i shall make a publick example on him. Sir, i sent to you for the loan of a small sum of money; and if it was not convenient for you to oblige me, you might a come and spoke to me your selfe, for i should have taken more kind of you; but as you thought proper to expose your selfe, i shall think proper to, for sending for that street-keeper yesterday, is the worst day work you ever did, My friends say that if you do not come to meet us to-night, at the Orange Tree Public House, near the turnpike gate, New-road, opposite Gore-street, at half-past six o'clock to-night, without fail; and please to bring no one with you, for if you do, you will only get yourself expose with all your fellowservants - for we shall acquaint them all, and your master will have a line dropt him; for we shall closely watch your actions to-day, so be on your guard, for my friends you will know nothing of them to look after you: if you can oblige me with the sem of money, you will never hear from us again; if you have any reguard for your selfe and character, you will not hesitate one moment; for knowing the state i found you in, whould hope sent you to prison for a yeare or more, for you know there is five or six whitness i can bring against you with are respectable character, that know you to be guilty of that annaterall crime; so if you can oblige me to-day, come, and you will once more make yourself a h man; for i shall never call on you again, if not - you may expect to se bill up at every corner of the square about you, you name, and where you live, and the situation - as my friend is a printer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were they all total strangers to you? A. Yes, and no conversation took place but what I have stated.</p>

            . I am pot-boy at the Gower Arms public-house, in Store-street. The prisoner and another man came to me, and the other man asked me if Judge Warren was in town - I said, "Yes, he came to town last night;" they then asked, "Is the butler come?" I said, "Do you mean Mr. Goodhall?" they said Yes - I said, "He has come;" the prisoner did not say any thing, but he heard what the other said: I saw them again the next day, and the man in company with the prisoner asked if Mr. Goodhall was at my master's; I said I did not know: I have frequently seen the prisoner and the other walking about Bedford-square - Mr. Warren's house has the name on the door.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WHEATLEY. I am an officer of Bow-street. I went with the witness to the Orange Tree, and waited there four hours, but they did not come; the prisoner came near the house, but before I could get out he ran down the road, and got away - I said we had better go towards the square; I told the witness if he saw any one to take no notice, and I would come up - in going along he saw the prisoner, but he got away; we had before marked some money for him to give them. I received a note in the evening from Mr. Goodhall, but I could not go till half-past two o'clock the next day - I then found the prisoner in custody in the area, I said he was my prisoner - he said, "What about?" I said, "You know what - it is about those letters;" he said, "I did drop one down the area, but two men gave me 6d. to do it." I took him into the butler's pantry.</p>
               <p>JOHN WHITE. I am a tailor, and live near Bedford-square. I saw the prisoner on the Friday evening, talking to Mr. Goodhall, and another taller man with him; I saw the prisoner in the square the next day - I went to him, and told him to come with me to the butler; he said he would not - he made great resistance; I seized hold of him, and he tore his shirt; I got him into the area - he told me he would bring an action against me, and offered to fight me; he said he had never been in the house, and then he turned round, and said he had, and he could bring witnesses to prove what he had done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along Bedford-square, and two respectable men stopped me, and said,"Have you any thing to do?" I said No - they said, "I will give you a shilling to take this note to No. 15;" I took it, and they gave me but sixpence, told me to meet them the next day, and they would give me a shilling; I went, but they did not come - I staid half an hour, and was taken.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 14th of October, I had been for a pail of water; I met the prosecutor; he was drunk, and the man who was leading him said "Will you have the goodness to hold this axe for me;" he then asked me to go with them, as he could not hold the prosecutor up with one arm; I put away my pail, and went - I stood at the foot of the stairs - I said to the young man "Are you coming?" he made no answer; I then went up, and said"Come, I wish you would come" - he came down, and we went down the street together; he said "I wish I knew where to leave this axe" - I took it to these two shops, and they would not take it in, because it was without a handle - I took it back, and gave it to the young man.</p>
               <p>JANE SCOTT re-examined. Q. Did you see the axe fall from your father's arm? A. Yes, and the prisoner took it up.</p>

            . I am a night inspector. On the 16th of September, at ten minutes past five o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners in Bethnal-green, going towards Dog-row, about half a mile from the prosecutor's; they were driving a sow and two pigs - each of them driving; one had a stick, the other a piece of iron; I watched them for a quarter of a mile, and in Three Coltlane I went up and collared Smith - I said "Where are you going to take the pigs to, and where have you got them from?" he told me he was going to take them to Spitalfields, but he did not know where there, nor the man's name he got them from; the other prisoner heard all this; Smith said the man was to give him half a crown, but he had not given it to him; I took Smith to the watch-house, and in his right-hand pocket I found this piece of a poker; I left the pigs safe, and found the owner; Simpson did not say any thing.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. If you saw them amongst one hundred more could you swear to them? A. Yes, I could - one was a sow-pig, one a barrow-pig, and one a boar-pig.</p>

            . I am a butcher and a constable - I live at Hounslow. Sexton came to me last Friday morning, and said he wanted me - there was a man had got three pigs near the Bell public-house; I went and found the pigs and the prisoner - Sexton then said, "Shall I have them?" the prisoner said, "No, not without 10s. more;" he asked what he would take for the three - he said 4l. 10s.; I should think the value of them was 6l. - I then took them into my care; Humphries claimed them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I ask five guineas for them? A. No, not to my knowledge - you asked 4l. 10s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out looking for work for two days, and had had nothing but 2d. worth of bread- these pigs ran after me, and then walked on steadily before me; when I got to Hounslow the witness came and asked if I would sell them, and being starving I did offer to sell them.</p>

I took the prisoner running from Wingrove's, and as he was turning into the street I saw the handle of a saw in his bosom - he turned into another street, and in a minutes or two he was brought to me; he begged very hard to be let go.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

He was not there at all - it is not uncommon for me to be employed in paper-hanging, and as this house was not finished I went to see for the master, and seeing no one, I came out; I was met by the witness, who said I had stolen the saw, which I had not- as to the saw sticking out of my bosom I solemnly declare it did not.</p>

I should not have noticed the prisoner, if the child had not turned round; I missed the necklace, and caught hold of the prisoner - I held him about three minutes, and he dropped the necklace from the bottom of his trousers; I knew they were the child's - I held him; he begged of me to let him go - he then threw off his shoe, and asked me to let him go, and put it on, but I kept him till the witness came and took him - there were several other persons near us, but not so near as the prisoner; he was close to us.</p>

At one o'clock in the morning I felt my watch drawn out of my pocket by Chalon, who made off with it - I saw both him and Wild close to me at the time - they were standing together; Wild stopped fast at the place - I do not know whether he saw what was done, or whether he knew it was going to be done; he did not resist my going after the other - he merely stood before me; I gave him a shove, and ran after the other; I have never seen my watch since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR, CLARKSON, Q. Were any other person taken to the watchouse? A. I did not give Wild in charge; we went altogether - he could not be in custody; there was not a person named Norcutt there -Wild went to the watch-house; he did not say any thing - he attended before the Magistrate; he was called in as a witness - I was asked if he was the other; I said he was - I did not say he was one of the persons who robbed me; I said he was there, my knowing him was the cause of his being taken into custody - there were three or four men on the spot; I do not know Norcutt - I was quite sober; I am a carpenter, and was out on a little business for a sick man - Norcutt was not charged by me at the watch-house, as being one; I did not see either of them searched - I was called to sign my name in the book; I still say I was sober.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of Sunday week I saw the prisoners, and Norcutt was not far from them - the prisoner Chalon first called me to send the prosecutor one way, and he would go the other; he did not give any reason for it, not I did not ask him, but in a moment the prosecutor told me to take charge of him, for robbing him - I took him, and he went very quietly; he wanted to go to the watch-house; I do not remember what they said at the watch-house, but Todd complained to me that Chalon had stolen his watch - the watch has not been found; it was in Church-street he showed him to me, and in George-street he said he had been robbed at the corner of Vigo-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Chalon call you to take the prosecutor, who had been using abusive language to him? A. Yes, neither Wild nor Norcutt said so; we went to the watch-house, and they were searched by the beadle - I do not know whether the prosecutor said that there were several persons there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were there many persons about, at the time you were called? A. No, only the four - I had not heard a cry of Stop thief! nor heard Todd call out that somebody had robbed him; he gave charge of Chalon the moment he saw me.</p>

            . Q. How long had you been out of employ? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. You said in your examination "Wild and the other man went to the watch-house, but were permitted to leave it; on Monday morning last, upon my coming to this office, the prisoner Wild appeared as a witness for Chalon, but upon my identifying him as one of the men who had been concerned in stealing the watch, he was ordered to be taken into custody;" Did you identify him as one? A. The question put to me was did I know that man? I said I knew him - he was with the other; Chalon was never charging me with insulting and abusing him - when I ran after Chalon, it was a very dirty place, and I did no go far up the place; I turned back, and there were three persons there, who urged me to go to the watchman - when I went to him, Chalon came up and urged him to make me go one way, and he would go another; I then gave charge of him - when I lost my watch, there were three or four women, and one of them caught hold of my arm.</p>

I remember the time the prosecutor said he lost his watch - it was a few minutes after one o'clock; I was with Chalon and Wild - I was about thirty feet ahead, and heard Chalon sing out "James, here is a man charges me with stealing his watch;" I turned my head, and saw the prosecutor and the watchman, but Chalon had not been out of my sight - he could not have taken a watch and disposed of it, without my knowing it; I did not hear Chalon charge the prosecutor with having assaulted him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were there any women? A. I did not see any - I saw Chalon and the prosecutor together.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you go before the Magistrate? A. Yes, and so did Wild; the prosecutor saw me at the watch-house, and he said he had never seen me, and did not know me - the night-constable searched us all, and no watch was found.</p>

The witness and prisoner came to the office, and the charge was heard; the witness then had to pay 1s. for his discharge - he had not got it, and I was ordered to detain him; in going down he said, "It is very hard I should have to pay 1s. for my discharge, when I have been robbed of a sovereign, two half-crowns, two shillings and a sixpence;" I said, "Did you tell the people at the watch-house?" he said Yes, and they had searched every body, and could not find it; he then said he suspected the Irishman I had just locked up; I called the prisoner and said, "This young man says you have robbed him; Do you know any thing about it?" he said No; I said,"I will search you;" he began to pinch my toes - I said,"That won't do - I shall search you;" I took this money out of his fob-pocket - it corresponds with what the prosecutor says; the prisoner said he received it from his master a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had but 4s. 6d. that night, and I had paid 6d. for my breakfast; I then had two shillings, two sixpences, and some halfpence in my pocket; my sister came to the place where I was, and I told her to go to my master, who would come and speak for me - he could not come, but he sent 25s., which I put into my pocket; my master has been here, but he was obliged to go - his name is Benman, and there is a young man in Court who he accused before me; the watch-house-keeper could not find any thing on me.</p>

               <p>MARY PERRY re-examined. Q. Did she tell you she had taken the shirt? A. No; she had the Saturday before, asked for leave to go out, and I missed a child's seal-skin hat; I had stopped a shilling from her, because I had lent it for a time, and she said I could take the shilling; she did not tell me of this other shirt, which she had pawned - I did not say I would go as far against her as the law would allow, or say I should get well paid for my time.</p>

The watch was hanging up in my father's window on the Wednesday night, and I was sitting in the back-room with my mother; we have a little bitch, and she would not go into the shop; I got up, and saw the prisoner just round by the counter - I went and took hold of him; he put up his finger, and said "What is the price of that knife?" I held him tight; he wanted to get away - he got to the window, and broke it - he then stood quiet; I got him in the room - the constable came and searched him, but nothing was found; I then went to the window, and found this watch, with the case off, just inside the window - down by the window; I had seen it safe in the window nearly all the evening; I was not looking into the shop when he came in - I was sitting by the fire, and we could not see the shop - we were on the listen; my brother and father were in and out that evening; I think we were near enough to have heard if any one had come in; I think this watch had been hanging on a hook, which I saw shaking when the prisoner was there.</p>

I said Yes; he said "Have you brought the screws?" I said Yes, and then he would not answer again.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took up the prisoner, and found a sixpence, a knife, a had farthing, two needle-cases, and a tobacco-box, on him; I put him into the cage, and saw Cooper go and whistle; the prisoner said"Jem, have you got the screws," which I understood meant picklock-keys.</p>

Walking quietly with the ferrules in hand - he was not attempting to escape; I had seen the watch just as they knocked at the door - it has not been found; I suppose Canthon did not stay more than five minutes, and the other not more than ten - they came through the room where the watch hung, to the shop.</p>
               <p>SHEAF'S Defence. I went for 2lbs. of brass - she said she did not know that she had quite two lbs.; I said,"Let me have what you have got" - I helped her to break the sticks, and she weighed them; while I was being served Canthon went away - I paid her, and went away; while I was going along the street the officer stopped me.</p>
               <p>CANTLON'S Defence. I saw Sheaf, who asked me to go with him - I said Yes, if he would not he long; I went to the house, and they were a good while breaking sticks, and I could not wait, as I had to take some fan-lights to Peckham.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had the prisoner been your tenant? A. I think last November; I let him the premises rent-free - one Dale was there before; I think it was in May or June last that I brought the ejectment - I did not pay the costs, on condition of his going out; I understood from my solicitor that 20l. were paid to me in part of the costs - this was on Michaelmas-day; I never received that as rent, and never understood it as such - I do not know that there was any lean-too to the premises the prisoner occupied; he took down a door and a frame, but not a building, to my knowledge - he took some premises on the opposite side of the way: my premises have been a baker's shop for fourteen or fifteen years, and it is my wish to continue them so; I know all these timbers very well - they were worked in the building.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol of Hanwell, and am a carpenter by trade. I had the overlooking of the prosecutor's premises - giving cheques for the bricks, and any thing wanted; the prisoner was a tenant of Mr. Gosling's in the month of July - I saw him living there in the latter end of July; I had orders from Mr. Gosling to watch his premises - I went down, when off duty; I saw a number of bricks on these premises, perhaps one thousand at a time - they were on the adjoining premises, in front of Mr. Gosling's new building; there were some laths and wood there likewise; In August last, I missed three pantile laths, and a little after that three pieces of timber and one paving-stone - I had seen the timber the night before I missed it - that was early in August; I had been working up some of these timbers myself, that enabled me to know them - it was on Sunday morning I missed the timber; I afterwards saw William Brown, and in consequence of what passed between us, I went to the premises of Mr. Gosling - I do not recollect seeing the prisoner there that day, but I did on the Sunday, in the bakehouse which he occupied of Mr. Gosling; I saw the pieces of timber and pan-tiles on the oven on the premises he occupied of Mr. Gosling, covered with some empty sacks - the prisoner was not there then; this was before I took Mr. Gosling to the premises over the way - we afterwards went over the way, and saw the laths and some elm and fir timber, which I did not know, and some bits of paving-stones, shot down loose in the wash-house - one of them I could speak to, as I had seen it in the bakehouse on Mr. Gosling's premises, covered with two sacks; some bricks were missed from the premises, but I could not identify them; I saw Filby on the premises, but not the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If I understood you rightly, you began to miss these things in August? A. There was a good deal missed before, but what I missed was in August; the prisoner was then in possession of the bakehouse on the prosecutor's premises - I told him the prisoner was robbing him, but he continued in possession of his house; the house opposite was building for him, but that part which he had to build I do not think was built at that time; I did not take away the timbers which I saw there; I spoke to Palmer about them, he did not take them away, and I had orders not to molest him in any way; there was something about the action going on, but every man on the premises was told not to hurt a hair of his head - and it is my opinion Mr. Gosling would not, had not the stones been taken away; I took something to another house in July because some things had been missed, but we had not seen any thing on the prisoner's premises then; I know Abbot; Mr. Gosling claimed some rafters, but Abbot was not called to prove that he had supplied them, in my hearing; the prisoner has been living there ever since, and came here this morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was this coach-house? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you left the prisoner's service? A. About five weeks - that was before this business; I am now in the service of Mr. Strand, of Brentford, and have been so for three weeks; I think I did not take any thing away when the prisoner was present - I took them away about one o'clock, when the men were at dinner; Mr. Abbot built the premises over the way for the prisoner, but the bakehouse and wash-house the prisoner was building; I left the prisoner because he worked on Sundays, and I did not like it; when I was going away, he said I had charged loaves to his customers.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did the premises stand by themselves? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were employed by the prisoner? A. Yes - Abbot did not employ me.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to the prisoner's premises, and received these laths, which had been taken down, and these timbers.</p>
               <p>MR. GOSLING. These belong to me - they are what I saw nailed up against the prisoner's premises; this piece of timber was in the pig-sty, and this was a rafter in the wash-house, and these laths were there; here are some of the stones here - I did not take any proceedings against the prisoner, when I heard of none of my property being on his premises; because I had had so much trouble to get him out, I should not have taken any steps had he not continued to take things - there was no argreement with him for a lease; it was on account of the difficulty of getting him from the premises that I took no steps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where is this agreement about getting him off the premises? A. I really do not know; it was done at Westminster Hall - I cannot tell whether it was settled by my solicitor and the other, before the trial came on; he continued on the premises after that; Higgs told me of this in July or August, and I believe the agreement was made in July, but I cannot tell exactly; I had had so much trouble I did not really intend to take any steps; I think it was on the 4th of October I went before the Justice.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you go on the prisoner's premises? A. On the 1st of October.</p>

Yes; I believe he had some old bricks of his own on the premises he occupied of Mr. Gosling; I do not know whether they were taken to assist in his building - I believe he had a small bit of a shed and a pig-sty on the premises of Mr. Gosling - I do not know whether he took them away; he had an oak cill which he changed with me for two pieces of railing; they were Mr. Gosling's - the cill was worked up in Mr. Gosling's work; this piece of wood is a good deal like one of those pieces, but I cannot swear it is one; it has been cut since I saw it.</p>

            . I know the prisoner; his father rented a house in Hanwell many years - the prisoner afterwards took the house of Mr. Gosling; I saw some stones removed from his father's premises to the bakehouse, at Mr Gosling's - his father's premises belonged to the Rev. Dr. Bond; four or five of the stones which are here I saw at the bottom of the truck, which the prisoner took from Dr. Bond's premises to the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is Dr. Bond alive? A. No; it is six or seven years since I saw the stones on those premises - they then went to Mr. Gladman's, a painter, at Hanwell, and remained there till a few months ago, when the prisoner took the house of Mr. Gosling - I did not see them removed, but I saw them a few days afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see them removed? A. No; but I know they were at Gladman's in a box, and it was so weighty it could not be removed.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is the prisoner's father's house pulled down? A. Yes; I was called on to speak about the stones last night.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you before that any conversation with the prisoner about them? A. No; last night was the first time I heard anything about this - the prisoner's father had some stones which were removed to Gladman's, and I saw them afterwards at the premises occupied by the prisoner at Mr. Gosling's - it was the same premises and bakehouse, used by his father before him - I saw these stones in the bakehouse, and one was laid down.</p>

            . I am a baker - I lived at Hanwell during the time I worked for the prisoner; I recollect two stones adjoining his bakehouse door, at the time I lived with him at Mr. Gosling's premises, which are now pulled down - they were about two inches and a half thick - I do not think these are quite so large; I cannot tell for an inch or two; this was during the prisoner's father's life; I left him about two months ago - I knew of his sending Palmer for some bricks which had been used for his copper to be set in - I do not know of his taking any other; I do not know of any timber - I burnt none but faggot-wood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you build the premises over the way. A. No; I am a baker - I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230089"/>the bricks taken by Palmer - I swear he took no new ones; I cannot tell what he took at any other time.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Give us some reasons? A. He was in the habit of fetching yeast for me every day - he went to another place and got it cheap, and got threepence a day by me; he has acknowledged it himself oftentimes - another reason is, he got into bad company, and ran awya twice; if I sent him anywhere he has always told me lie - I sent him once to Wimpole-street, and went there two hours afterwards; when I got there he came to the gate - he told so many lies I could not believe him; here is a person here who told me he has acknowledged that he robbed me of 4s. a day, but I do not believe it; he took a pound of butter of mine and asked a young man to take it away, but he would not - I found the butter under the trough.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is it because you found him in the daily habit of telling lies that you would not believe him? A. Yes. <rs id="t18281023-213-verdict1243" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am the wife of Thomas Lewis, and live in Grange-road, Bermondsey. I have a little daughter named Jane Amelia. On the 12th of September, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning (I had been confined for three weeks), I sent her to take these things to the mangler's, about one hundred yards from my house - there were all the articles stated in the indictment in a towel; a person came and told me my daughter was in fits in the street, and the bundle taken from her by a man; I took the officer, and found the prisoner in his own room, about four o'clock - a person went to show us the place; one of the shirts was on the prisoner's back - we found some of the articles in a corner of the room, and two duplicates were given us by a woman he cohabits with; he was quite a stranger to me.</p>

            . I am nine years of age; my mother gave me the bundle to take to the mangler's: I met the prisoner, who asked me to get him 6d. worth of trotters, and said he would give me a halfpenny - he gave me the money to pay for them; he took the bundle, and put it into his basket - I went for the trotters, and when I came back he was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q, Did you go to a shop? A. Yes; I was not to meet him at a public-house - he said he would be standing till I came back; I was not gone above five minutes - it was only just over the way; I am sure he is the man; I did not ask him to hold it - he took it; I said I would take it home first; I inquired for him at the public-house when I came back, but he was not there; I saw him again at half-past four o'clock.</p>

            . I am an officer. Mrs. Lewis gave me information, and I went with her to the prisoner's lodgings, in Frying-pan-alley, a little after four o'clock - he had just come home; I asked if his name was Seabrook - he said No; I called in the child, who said he was the man - he had this shirt on his back, and his coat was on a nail; I found his basket in the room; a woman in the room gave me two duplicates, and I found a shift, a napkin, and pillow-case.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he offer to hand you over some money, which he said he got for the things? A. No; I took some money out of his pocket; he pulled this shirt off himself, and said he was sorry for what he had done, and hoped he should be forgiven - he did not say he was kept waiting almost all day.</p>

On the 1st of October, I went to No. 5, Perkin's-rents, Westminster, with another officer, and found Thomas Williams, Creeman, Henry, Taylor, and Elizabeth Williams, all in the room, and a quantity of carpenters' tools about the room; Creeman sat in a chair near the window, examining this saw, I asked how these tools came there; they all said they knew nothing about them - Elizabeth Williams was sitting up in bed sewing something; Taylor was in bed with her - I asked her who the room belonged to - she said to her, that she had taken it the day before; I asked if she could not give some account of the tools, or how they came there; she said she could not, as they came in the night before, while she was out - I asked how they came there; she said they were brought there - I asked if she locked the door; she said she had - I said "Was your place broken open, then?" she said she supposed it might be so - I examined the door, it had not been broken; she then said she had left the key with an Irish girl, but did not remember her name - I looked round the room, and saw Henry on a chair, and a jacket was at the back of his chair; I found a great coat hung up at the window as a curtain - I told Elizabeth Williams to get up; she said the Irish girl was out, and had got her shawl and shoes - I went to the door, and saw Chapman at a distance, she had the shawl and shoes on - I brought her in; she said she had the care of the place last night, while Elizabeth Williams was out, and that at eleven o'clock she went to Williams again with the key of the door - I searched further, and in Thomas Williams's hat I found a flannel jacket, and on the table a crooked nail, which I tried to the door of the workshop - it opens it very well; I heard Thomas Williams say at the office, that he was not seen at eight o'clock at night at the place, for he had all the property in a coach at Westminster by eight, and that none of the other prisoners had any thing to do with it - after the examination he told me where the things were pawned, and I found them; I had applied to some of the pawnbrokers before, and am sorry to say they denied having the things.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a headborough. On the night of the 6th of October, Williams was brought to the watch-house by the prosecutor, charged with stealing his watch; I searched her, but found nothing - but recollecting I had seen her in company with Cozens, who she always walked with, I went to look for her, but could not find her till the 10th, when she was with another girl, who she called her sister; I searched her - she said she was innocent; I said it was useless to say so, as William had made a split of it- she said "If she split, I'll split too, if you will be favourable to me;" I said that was not in my power; she then said she and Williams met the prosecutor in the Back-road- Williams asked him to go home, and she, Williams, drew the watch from him, and she went and told Kimbley,(who cohabits with Williams,) of it, and I should be likely to find him at his mother's, Mrs. Smith's - he had come to the watch-house while Williams was there, and gone away again; I went to Smith's - knocked some time at the door; they did not open it - I peeped through the key-hole, and saw a man make his escape out at the back-door; I got in, and found somebody had gone out with naked feet, as there were the marks on the damp ground; I scaled the wall, and found a bit of braces; I then heard a woman in the next house scream out that a man was there; I called to a watchman, who found Kimbley there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You told an untruth in saying that Williams had split? A. She had told me she had been in trouble before through Cozens - she had said nothing about this watch; I meant to say she had said enough to convince me she was in it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

The prisoner Barrett called on me two or three times in July last; he first said he wanted a harp for a lady: on the 25th he called again and said Mrs. Sutton had been out the evening before and tried a harp - that it made her fingers ache, and she wanted a piano-forte; he asked what it would be a month, I said 26s.; he said he would come the day following and give me an answer - it was to be a cottage piano-forte; he came the next day and said the lady was quite agreeable to the price, and she wished it to be sent that evening, as she had a little party, and wished it particularly; he left me this blue card, with a reference to Mrs. Paul, No. 4, Curzon-street, May-fair, where he said Mrs. Sutton had lived, but she had now taken a house in South-parade, Chelsea - being in ill health I sent my wife there - I do not know whether this was the first time he mentioned the name of Sutton; I sent the harp by my son on the evening of the 26th of July, and two or three days after Barrett called and said Mrs. Sutton was very well pleased with it - I have received no money for the hire - I have seen my piano-forte again for the first time this morning at a pawnbroker's in Houndsditch; I would not have parted with it unless I had received a reference.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. He said he was sent by her? A. Yes, and said he would bring the money for the hire himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MILLER. Q. What was the price of the best cottage piano-forte you had? A. I do not make expensive ones - there are rosewood ones at seventy guineas; some harps are one hundred and fifty guineas - this piano-forte was worth thirty-six guineas; I did not tell him the price, on my oath - he did not ask me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not agreed between you, that if the lady chose to buy it, it was thirty-six guineas? A. Never - no such thing was named.</p>

            . I live in Curzon-street, May-fair. A Mrs. Sutton and her mother lodged with me, but I know nothing of the prisoner - I never saw her till I saw her at Bow-street; my daughter had heard me talk of Mrs. Sutton, but did not know her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MILLER. Q. When did Mrs. Sutton live with you? A. About nineteen years ago - it is ten or eleven years since I saw her - I had a letter from her three months ago, dated from Bath; her mother has been dead about fourteen years - I cannot read or write; I received a good many letters from Mrs. Sutton - I have burnt them; I believe if there had been twenty references I should have given them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever know Barrett? A. I believe I have seen him at my house two or three months ago - he called, and asked me to come and see Mrs. Sutton at Queen-elms, and I had a two penny-post letter before that to invite me to see her; I supposed it was the Mrs. Sutton whom I knew - a person had called to say she had returned from Bath.</p>
               <p>MR. MILLER. Q. If you had gone to Queen-elms, and seen the prisoner, you would have known she was not the person? A. Yes.</p>

            . I know a counting-house in Sherbourne lane - the name of Drummond and Burgh is on the door. I saw the prisoner Sutton there once, and she wrote a letter there - this is it; (looking at the card) - I believe this to be her hand-writing; it corresponds with the letter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MILLER. Q. Have you compared it with the letter? A. Yes - my opinion is formed from that comparison, and having seen her write the letter.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Looking at them separately, do you believe the card to be her writing? A. Yes - (card read) "Mrs. Sutton, 12, Queen-elms" - on the reverse side, "Mrs. Paul, Curzon-street, foom twelve o'clock to half-past three."</p>

             I took the piano-forte to No. 12, South-parade, Queen-elms, on the 26th of July, and to the best of my belief the woman at the bar is the person who received it; I believe she ran her fingers just over the keys - I afterwards called there for my money, and found Captain Pettingall there; I returned, and told my father - I have since seen the piano-forte at a pawnbroker's in Houndsditch, and am sure it is the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How do you know it? A. The fall projects over, and it was never finished - there was only one beading instead of two; our name is on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MILLER. Q. On your oath, did the female you see here, run her fingers over the keys? A. Yes, and I did the same - she did not play a tune; I stated this at Bow-street - I did not state that she did not touch it; I know two reporters were examined there - I got to the house about four or five o'clock in the afternoon; to the best of my belief the prisoner is the person; I did not see her again till she was at Bow-street - I do not think I had any conversation with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that woman behind you, have you ever expressed a doubt as to which of the two women you saw on that occasion? A. I take that to be the person (the prisoner;) when I was asked about it I could not exactly say which was the woman, because I could not see her face, and when the piano-forte was taken, she kept her back as much as she could towards us; I think the prisoner is the person by her beight - she appears to be the person; I cannot swear which is the woman.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you believe the prisoner is the woman? A. Yes - I saw her at Bow-street, and expressed the same belief there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you took the instrument, did you ask for Mrs. Sutton? A. Yes; I went to deliver it to Mrs. Sutton.</p>

            . I am proprietor of the house at Queen-elms - I let the house to Barrett, that was the name he gave, and referred me to Messrs. Alois and Co., No. 9, Liverpool-street, Broad-street; I went there the following day, and saw a very respectable looking man - he either answered to the name of Alois, or I understood from the representation that he was the person; I said I was referred to him by a man named Barrett, who was about taking a house of me for Mrs. Sutton; he said, "Mrs. Sutton is coming to town, I have received a letter from her from Bath; she is coming to town for her health, and to consult her physician; she stated that a reference would be necessary, and begged me to give it;" I asked if he would guarantee the payment of the rent; he said, "No; I guarantee nobody's debts; but when the quarter or half-quarter is due, if Mrs. Sutton gives you an order on me for the money, I will pay you:" he said she was a very respectable lady, and I think said she was a West Indian; I let the house to Barrett - I told him the reference was perfectly satisfactory, and I would let him have it; I desired him to call on a certain day, which he did, and we finally agreed about it: a paper was signed by my son and Barrett - the signature of Mrs. Sutton was added some days after she was in the house - she came in that evening before I left it; I had lived there before - a woman, who I understood to be her housekeeper, came an hour and a half before - that is the woman who has been pointed out in Caurt.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the prisoner the Mrs. Sutton who took the house? A. Yes, most certainly; I was at the house several times, and once sat an hour with her - she said to me, "Captain Pettingall, I believe my rent is due on the 1st of May, but I shall not receive my money till the 10th, will it make any difference to you?" I said, "Certainly not."</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you get your money on the 10th? A. I am sorry to say not; my house was empty on the 12th of August; I went on the 14th of August, and found Alois and Co. had decamped; I saw Mrs. Sutton sign the agreement, and believe the card to be her writing; my son signed it - as I intended to go abroad I left my son to act for me; the house was let for one hundred and forty guineas per annum.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did Barrett sign it as a witness? A. I suppose so; I did not ask him to sign it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MILLER. Q. Was the house let furnished or not? A. Furnished respectably all over; they did not take it all away - I left a piano-forte there; Barrett said, "Mrs. Sutton will be quite delighted with this, for she is very musical;" my daughter replied, "I don't know that I shall leave it, but I will leave it for two or three months to accommodate the lady;" it is now in my possession - I had it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you aware that she is the daughter of a west India planter, who left her 40,000l.? A. I knew nothing about it.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Parkinson, of Greek-street, Soho. I was at Brighton from November to February last - a cousin of mine used to wash for Mrs. Sutton in November; I knew them both there; I came to town in February, Sutton then lived at Chelsea; I remember Barrett being there; I heard Mrs. Sutton say the piano-forte was in pawn for eighteen guineas, but when she could raise the money it should be sent home; this was at my cousin's house in the Borough, the latter end of August; she said she did not pawn it, and did not know where it was, but if she could get eighteen guineas she would take it out and send it home - that she was involved in debt, and she thought she should be taken; I was with her at the Falcon public-house in the Borough, where she was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MILLER. Q. She said if she could get eighteen guineas she would take it out, and send it home? A. Yes; I was in Greek-street on the 26th of July - Sutton was there several times on Saturdays, and lived there solely for a time I understand.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did you see her at Brompton? A. I was there in June, and part of July - I left about the 17th; I was there with her at Mr. Parkinson's about a fortnight - she was at Parkinson's every Saturday - whether she was at Nine-elms, I do not know.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I had instructions to apprehend Sutton; I saw her on the 3d of September, and told her she was taken for stealing a piano-forte, the property of Mr. Rathmacher; she made no observations then, but before the Magistrate, she said the piano-forte would be forthcoming, and it might be at Mr. Rathmacher's by that time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner SUTTON put in a written defence, protesting her innocence, and stating that circumstances had compelled her to leave the house in South-parade for five weeks, during which time the instrument was sent - that she was not at the house when it was brought, and on her return to the house, on the 3d of August, it was not there; that she was entitled to considerable property by the will of her father, some of which was now in the Accountant-General's hands.</p>
               <p>BARRETT, in a long address, stated, that he was an agent for letting and hiring houses, and as such had taken the house for Mrs. Sutton; that he was afterwards arrested upon a forged bill, and Sutton, finding him without a home, had given him an asylum in her house; that he had hired the piano for two months, and intended to redeem and return it, but both himself and Sutton were taken into custody before that time had expired - that it was pawned to prevent its being seized for rent or taxes.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What is your husband? A. A cork-cutter; I never heard the prisoner called any name but Sutton - I have known her twelve months, and I saw Barrett at Walworth about twelve months ago; I never saw him at the house at Chelsea - the child the woman has, is the prisoner's - I did not hear the instrument played.</p>
               <p>MR. MILLER. Q. Did you go up stairs into the parlour and kitchen? A. Yes; if she had been there, I must have seen her; this woman gave me a note to take to Greek-street to Mrs. Sutton - she owed me 6s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is that woman? A. The housekeeper - she was up stairs scouring; I went up to speak to her - I was there from three o'clock till about eight.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. About what time was it you began to miss your watch? A. After I was in the watch-house, about ten o'clock, I believe; I do not know rightly.</p>

            . I was going home with the prosecutor, and in Broad-court the two prisoners came and asked where he was going; I said he was a Chelsea pensioner - Cooper said, "We are going to Pimlico - we will put him into the coach:" they went up Bow-street, and to Hemmings-row, and then another man took hold of him; I followed them all: they went on to the waste ground, and soon afterwards I saw the prosecutor on the ground, and the third man was with him - I went up to him, and saw his watch was gone; I said if I knew where there was an officer I would have the man taken up - I called out Stop thief! and the third man, said,"There go the two men who have robbed him," and he took to his heels and ran away; King came up - I said, "This man has been robbed of his watch;" I know it was safe before, for I felt it - King and I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did the third man come up? A. Just before they got to Hemmings-row; the prisoners were gone when I found him on the ground; I cannot say at what time he lost his watch: when the third man ran away the prisoners were in Pall Mall east - I was in the middle of the waste ground; I wanted to get home, and thought they were gentlemen - I followed, to see if they would put him into a coach.</p>

No; nobody remained with him after Allensby left him - we both got up to him together; Allensby was then running - the prosecutor was very drunk. Allensby had once met me at an anction-room in the Poultry; he struck me, and called me an informer, because I had appeared against Cooper. his comrade.</p>

On the 24th of September, there was a knock at the door; I went, and saw the prisoner there - he had the appearance of a gentleman; he gave a note into my hand, which was not sealed; I asked who he brought it from - he said from Mr. Oxley, or some such name; I said "I don't think this note is for me" - he said "If you open it you will see;" I took it up stairs, but did not stop hardly a minute - I came down again, and missed a travelling pelisse, a box-coat, and an umbrella, from the passage - the door was wide open, and the prisoner gone; the value of the articles was at least 9l. - one of them was quite new and had not been worn above once or twice in the chaise; I was much alarmed - I went out, and a woman asked me if I had lost any thing, and I told her - I have never got them again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time was it? A. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - it was quite a moon-light night; I had not a light; I stated at the office that the person had light trousers, and a blue coat buttoned quite close.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure he is the man? A. Yes - I am quite positive I saw him at the door - I stood talking with him I suppose about five minutes, I had no light, but it was quite light - I could see to read at the door; it was a beautiful night - the 24th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the woman say to you? A. She asked if I had lost a coat; I said I had two; I saw her at Hatton-garden, but she is not here; her name is Shanks - she is the prisoner's mother-in-law, as she stated; this is the note the prisoner brought.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you a lad named Nash in your service? A. Yes; I do not know of the prisoner lending him 2s.; the prisoner told the Magistrate, if my apprentice was there he could state that he had lent him 2s.; I said he should come, and fetched him; all manufacturers mark their stockings; I missed one pair out of one paper.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Austen. The prisoner was in his service - he lent me two shillings on Mr. Austen's account, not for myself, and it was understood he was to pay himself; he never told me he had taken it out of the till.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Till this private whispering there was no charge against her? A. No; the prosecutor was sober - I searched but could find no sovereign; a gilt farthing fell down on going to the watch-house.</p>

Yes, on the 7th of October, in the evening; but he had made up his book before he went; if there was any errors we correct them on Sunday - he once summoned me to the office: the Magistrate dismissed the charge, and said it was a mercy to horsewhip him, for kicking me; I said if he went on in that way he would soon be there again - he has been two years with me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written).</p>
               <p>On the 1st of last month I received warning to quit my mother's house, but owing to my not being able to get employment, she consented to let me stop until I could get into a situation. On the following Wednesday I went to the house of Mr. Hook with bread, who (without being asked), paid me 1l. 3s. 4d. as part of his bill; and on my leaving his house I met with some friends, and having no money of my own, I spent 10s., and of course gave my mother but 13s. 4d., she agreeing that she would stop it out of my week's wages; but on Monday she paid me my full money, telling me that she would place it to an account she had against me of monies paid by her on my account.</p>
               <p>COURT to CATHERINE EDWARDS. Q. Why did you not charge him with this till October? A. Because I wanted to keep him in my house, but his conduct was such I could not endure it; I never gave him permission to take out money, but he has done it; I would have placed this to his account, but his conduct was such; he has put me in fear of my life - I have been forced to have an officer in the house to keep me from blows and insults - I did say I would place it to account that night, but my little son told me that he was just as usual, very drunk - I have devised every means to reclaim him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MILLER. Q. How long has he worked in Mr. Taylor's employ? A. About three years, and had a very good character - he had 10s. or 12s. a week.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Wardour-street - this watch was pawned with me on Monday, the 20th of October, between one and three o'clock, by the prisoner, in the name of William Scott; I am confident it was him, because he came a second time the same day, after we had closed business; and said he had lost the duplicate of the watch, and wished me to detain it, if it were brought to me - I would say nothing that night; the next day the prosecutor came and said he had received a letter, saying it was pawned at our house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the value of it? A. It is worth altogether about 7l.; I lent him 2s. 6d., which was all he asked - had he asked more, it would have aroused my suspicions; I cannot fix the time more accurately than between one and three o'clock - I was in the shop all day, and may have had two hundred customers; but this was a remarkable case, it being pawned for 2s. 6d. it excited my attention.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you call to mind your recollection of his features? A. His asking 2s. 6d. lulled my suspicion; I have said excited my attention - he came the second time between eight and nine o'clock in the evening; I have always named that hour, and never said it was between nine and ten - Mr. Harrison, my master, said that; I heard the prisoner say at the office he would account for where he was between nine and ten o'clock; nobody said "Then we must provide for that, or any thing like it;" I said it was between eight and nine - I went to Taylor and Beaumont's factory to point him out; he was the third man who came out, I recognized him by his countenance and dress - he had a blue coat and corderoy trowsers; there were ten or fifteen men - he came into the box when he pawned it, and I saw him as he went out at the door; I have not advised him to plead guilty - he was advised, but said he was not guilty, that he never saw me nor the watch; when he came at night, he came to the private door, and there was a very strong light over the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Harrison present when the prisoner came a second time? A. No; I saw his brother at the office, and he is here - I have no doubt of the prisoner being the person.</p>

I know the prisoner, and recollect his being at the shop on Monday week; he was in the shop till one o'clock, when he went to dinner - he dines in Red Lion-street, Old Cavendish-street; the shop is in Brook-street, Bond-street - I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230106"/>there again when I returned, at five minutes before two - I do not know the precise time he returned; he complained of his head aching that afternoon - he staid till five o'clock and went to tea; I returned at half-past five, and found him in the shop then - he worked till eight o'clock - we went together across the square to Regent-street, and then down Oxford-street to the Middlesex-hospital; he turned to Tottenham-court-road, and I wished him good night; that was his road home - he lives with his father in Camden-town; it would take him about twenty minutes to go to his father's - he is very steady in his habits; I never was in the loft the watch was taken from; I know nothing of its being taken - I was not present when my master urged the prisoner to acknowledge having taken it; several of our men wear blue coats and corderoy trousers - I know nothing about an anonymous letter.</p>

            . I work in the same shop; I recollect seeing the prisoner on Monday week; he returned from dinner at twenty-five minutes past one o'clock - he goes to Old Cavendish-street with his father to dine, as it is too far to go to Camden-town; I should think it would take him half an hour to go to Cavendish-street, eat his dinner, and return; I think I may venture to say he could not have gone to Wardour-street and eaten his dinner and returned; I heard no offer made to him about this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What day was it that he returned at twenty-five minutes past one o'clock? A. Last Monday week; it is my duty to attend the front-shop while the men go to dinner, to watch when they return - I have my dinner at two o'clock; two other men came between one and two - they were Green and Burn; Green came first of these two - there was no particular reason why I should notice the time the prisoner returned; but he generally does come about that time - he never takes his full hour, not one time in ten.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you personally in the habit of receiving bills of exchange from Dickson or the prisoner? A. From the prisoner only; we received them from him for the purpose of being discounted. On the 1st of August, I saw the prisoner at our banking-house, in Lombard-street, in the City - he brought various bills of exchange with him for the purpose of being discounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this bill (producing one) and state whether it was among the bills produced to you on the 1st of August by the prisoner? A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any question to the prisoner on the subject of that bill? A. I had generally a great deal of conversation with him respecting various bills which he offered for discount - I even hesitated to discount them at all, and I desired him to explain the nature of the various bills which he brought to me, as they were upon persons with whom I could have no acquaintance; he replied that they were bills drawn by his house on the various parties in the country, with whom they had transactions, and if houses in London refused to discount that paper, they could not carry on their business; I called his attention to this particular bill, it being among the rest - I asked him who Mountain was - he said he was a person in business, with whom his house had transactions.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had gone through the several bills produced to you, what did you do with them? A. I took them into our discount-office and placed them in a box, which is appropriated exclusively to receive paper of that description; these bills would in the regular course of business, be carried through the various books belonging to the establishment that day; they would be first entered in the discount-book by Mr. Brackett, our clerk; the entries would all be made on that day, the 1st of August - after being entered in the discount-book they would be entered in the bill-book by Mr. Clunie, who had that department on that day; the bills are then tied together, and delivered over to the clerk who has the care of the bills of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you discount bills, do you give the money for them, or place it to the account of the person? A. It is placed to their account.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at this bill, and tell us if you made the entry from that? A. I did - it is the same bill; after making the entry, I put the bills on the top of my desk, under a lead, and another clerk takes the same bills away to enter them in the bill-book; this entry in my book puts the bills to the credit of the party - here is the entry; this bill of 162l.9s. entered to the credit of John Dickson and Co., the house of which the prisoner is a partner; only the amount and the date when due are entered; it was due on the 27th of October, (yesterday) - I presented it for payment myself at Messrs.

            . I am a Police-officer of Portsmouth. On the 7th of October I went on board a vessel called the Leeds, which lay at St. Helens, bound for America, New York; Forrester, a City officer, and Mr. Garnet, Mr. Gates' clerk, accompanied me; I found the prisoner in the cabin; I had taken a letter from Portsmouth which I showed to him - I did not deliver it to him; I asked him if his name was not Wilkinson, for I had a letter for him - he said it was Wilkinson; I then told him I was a Police-officer, and arrested him on a charge of forgery - there were several papers lying before him - he was in the act of writing at the time I addressed him; five or six letters were before him; I said, "Are these your letters;" he said they were; I then said, "I must take them into my possession;" I took them, put them into my pocket, and afterwards marked them (looking at document No. 2) - this is one of them; he was taken into custody and taken on shore.</p>
               <p>The document No. 2 was here read, as follows:</p>
               <p>To the Editor of the Times.</p>
               <p>Sir, - The account published in your paper of last Saturday, relative to Joseph Hunton, being incorrect in almost every particular, I beg leave to send you this statement, which, be assured, is strictly accurate. It is not true, as stated, that he was seen in London by several persons, on Saturday, the 27th of September; he left London on Friday afternoon, about four o'clock, and has not been there since. It is not true that he has a family of twelve or thirteen children - he has but ten. It is not true that he resided chiefly in the country; he regularly came to town soon after nine o'clock in the morning, and generally returned about nine o'clock in the evening. It is not true that he has forged the names of several eminent mercantile houses in the city; there is not a single one of that description. It is not true that he has committed forgeries to the amount of 12,000l. or 14,000l. - the amount is about 5,000l., and these he has paid when due with interest, till, for want of discounts, he was no longer able to do so. The whole of his property, of every description, is left for the creditors, as, excepting a very small supply of clothing absolutely needful, and his passage, he did not take away to the amount of 5s., except what was very kindly advanced him by a relative, expressly that he may not be utterly destitute in a foreign country. It is true that he might have obtained goods on credit to a much larger amount, but this was not his object; he was under engagement to supply the capital for his concerns, and being very much disappointed in the quarter from whence he depended for a supply, he had unfortunate recourse to this ruinous measure. He is a very melancholy instance of the mutability of wealth. Several years since, he was retiring from business, with an ample fortune, but unfortunately investing a considerable part of his property in the foreign funds, he lost to a very great amount, and the more he struggled to extricate himself the more he lost; and the greater his difficulties increased. Those who are acquainted with him know that his habits and personal expenditure were on the most moderate scale, and were it not for the law expences and destruction of property attendant on a Commission of Bankruptcy, there will be sufficient to pay the whole of his creditors in full. It is not intended to apologise for his late practices, but a desire that his fate may be a warning to others to avoid them, and not to engage in any concern of which they do not foresee the consequence; he expected to have been able very shortly to pay these acceptances out of the regular proceeds of his concerns, this disappointment has brought on himself, and on a most amiable family, irretrievable ruin and disgrace.</p>
               <p>The bill was then read, as sent out in the indictment.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his Defence, read as follows:</p>
               <p>My Lord, I beg permission to state respectfully to the Court, that I am wholly unprepared to take my trial now; I lately applied to the Court for the postponement of my trial untill the next Session, upon grounds which I then thought, and still venture to think, were, with reference to the justice of the case, sufficient to warrant that application: your Lordship was pleased to think that I had not established legal grounds for the postponement required, looking at the case merely in a technical point of view - of the impartiality of your Lordship's judgment I am fully satisfied - of its correctness as a mere dicision of law I entertain no doubt; but I can as little doubt, that if my prosecutors had consented to the application, the Court would have granted it; they, however, with an impetuosity of proceeding for which I can assign no adequate motive, arising from the mere consideration of public good, opposed the application: how public justice can be advanced by my being tried now, when I have not any means whatever of defence, instead of being tried at the next Session, when, by the inspection of my papers and books, I shall be better prepared for so awful a trial, I cannot see. I have only to say that, stripped as I am of all means of defence, by being denied access to my papers (which my assignees have promised to afford me, if the trial be postponed), I shall not do either myself or my counsel the injustice of attempting a defence, which must, of necessity, from the circum<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230110"/>stances in which I am placed, be imperfect and illusory; I shall, therefore, attempt no defence, under such circumstances, I shall not trouble my counsel to make an useless interference; I shall cross-examine no witness, nor at all interfere in the trial, which my prosecutors may have all their own way, and conduct it as they may think fit; I can submit to become their victim, but I cannot submit to exhibit the appearance of defence, while they exclude me from the means of rendering it effectual. The prisoner then added, "I make no remarks on the extraordinary conduct of my prosecutors, in taking papers from my private desk, during my absence; they have deprived me of several of them which are material to my defence. I would further remark that several of them were not finished, nor were they intended to be sent to any body, but merely written for my own amusement, and would probably, in a few minutes, have been destroyed."</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. Would you wish to call any witnesses? Prisoner. No, I adhere to my determination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you wish to call witnesses to character? A. I beg leave respectfully to state that I adhere to my former determination.</p>

In the course of last year and the present, the house of Dickson and Co. were customers of ours- I believe they resided in Ironmonger-lane; the firm consisted of the prisoner and John Dickson - the firm stood in our books in the name of John Dickson and Co.; we were in the habit of frequently receiving bills from them, for the purpose of being discounted; the prisoner exclusively carried on the financial department of the firm, at least as far as we were concerned; he frequently came to our banking-house with bills. On the 1st of September, he brought several bills, and brought this list with them - (looking at it) - there is some cash entered at the bottom of the list, but that did not come into my hands - this is a list of bills which were offered for discount; it is in the prisoner's handwriting - I saw him myself that day; I looked at the total amount at the bottom of the list, and ran over the bills - they corresponded.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a bill of exchange in your hand, was that among the number of bills brought by the prisoner on the 1st of September? A. It was, and it corresponds with the entry on the list - it agrees in the sum, the names of the drawer and acceptor, and where payable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner on that occasion? A. I can only recollect observing to the prisoner on that occasion, as well as on every other, when he brought bills to be discounted; I always expressed my very great objection to discount them - I perfectly recollect objecting to discount them on this particular occasion; he invariably made a reply, and on this occasion he told me, distinctly, that they were all bona fide legitimate commercial transactions, and upon that representation I discounted them; after having received them from him, I wrapped them up in this list, and took them into the discount-office, and put them into a box there - they would then be taken from that box, and entered by Mr. Thomas Brackett, the discount clerk, in a book kept exclusively for that purpose; it was then the practice for Mr. Brackett to put them under a lead on his desk - they would then be taken from there by Mr. Clunie, another clerk, who keeps the bill-book.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time after the 1st of September did you decline to discount any further for the firm of Dickson and Co.? A. Certainly; it was either on the Wednesday or Thursday prior to the date on which I received a letter from him - this is the letter (looking at it); I had told him distinctly I would discount no more for him; this letter is in the prisoner's hand-writing, and bears the Deal post-mark - it is dated the 27th of September, 1828; I received it on the Monday morning - I am certain it was on the Monday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230111"/>following the day I had declined discounting further for them; it was addressed to A. W. Robarts, Esq., M.P., 15. Lombard-street, London - it is above number, and of course the postage is charged [the letter being read was the same as was given in evidence on the former case, Page 995] - previous to the receipt of this letter I found, on coming to town on that Monday morning, his partner, Mr. Dickson, at our house - I immediately looked out the different bills, that they might be submitted to his inspection.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you happen to known in whose handwriting the body of this bill is? A. I do; it is the prisoner's - and the signature, J. Dickson and Co. is his; I have no knowledge whatever of R. Luck.</p>

            . I am clerk to Sir Wm. Curtis and Co. bankers, of Lombard-street. My department is in the discount-office - on the 1st of September I took from the box in the discount-office the bills and papers, and entered the bills in the discount book (producing it) - I found this list of bills in the box; I have written on it "1st Sept. Bills" - that is my hand-writing; I accurately entered all these bills in the discount-book - the entry corresponds with the particulars of the bills in this list - they are placed to the credit of John Dickson and Co. in this book; and at the same time I debited them for the discount - among the bills entered is one corresponding with the one produced(reads) "1st Sept. J. Dickson and Co. 94l. 13. on Luck, due 26th December" - that entry corresponds both with the bill and the list; the discount is charged for the whole amount of bills together - it was Mr. Clunie's business to enter the bills in the bill-book, and for that purpose I place them on the desk under a lead.</p>
               <p>The item from the list being read was as follows: "Dickson and Co. Luck, Spur Inn, 26 Dec. 94l. 13s." the total amount of bills was £1636 3s. 2d.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the banking-house of Sir William Curtis and Co. It was my duty in September last to enter in the bill-book bills which had been discounted, and had gone through Mr. Brackett's hands - on the 1st of September I took a number of bills from his desk, in the regular course of business; I have not entered the gross amount of the bills in the name of J. Dickson and Co. - I have an entry on that day, in my own hand-writing, of the bills corresponding with this list; the entry was made at the time, and is headed "J. Dickson and Co., September 1st (reads) "Luck, August 23d, four months, due December 26th, 94l. 13s.," and the letter D is put against it for discount; and on the bill itself I have written D 589," meaning the folio in book D where it is entered; the entry on the bill, and in the book were made on the same day, on the same occasion - I have no recollection of this identical bill, except from this entry; there is no other bill of the same amount, or at all corresponding with this entry - that enables me to say it is one of the bills I entered in the book that day.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the bill-book kept by the prisoner? A. We had a book called a bill-receivable book, into which all regular trade bills were entered - I have examined that book, to ascertain whether this bill is entered; there is no memorandum of it in that book - I have examined it attentively, and think I can swear no such bill is entered; I have not the book here - we had a correspondent named Richard or Robert Luck; he resided at East Peckam, Kent - he was indebted to us, but I think not to the amount of this bill - the list of bills produced is in the prisoner's hand-writing; I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>COURT Q. Are you acquainted with Luck's handwriting. A. No; I do not know whose hand-writing the acceptance of the bill is.</p>
