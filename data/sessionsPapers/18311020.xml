On the 14th of October, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, Mr. Drake awoke me; I had shut the warehouse up myself the night before, and had seen all my goods safe - when I was awoke I missed the articles stated in the indictment (enumerating them,) amounting in value to about 140l.; they were all taken from the warehouse; I sleep on the third floor - I am sure the warehouse was fast when I went to bed; when I came down I found the street door open, and two watchmen guarding it - the house had been entered by the cellar; they could get from the cellar through a trap-door in the floor of my shop, without opening the shop door - that trap door was shut down at night, but it does not fasten; I saw my goods at the watch-house about six minutes after I was alarmed - the prisoner Scott was in the watch-house, and the other prisoner was at another watch-house, but I did not see him till the next day, at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see all your goods at the watch-house? A. No, only eighteen sovereigns and some silver buckles- I have not recovered all my property; I have seen Davies several times at my warehouse, and think I have seen Scott.</p>

On the 14th of October, about a quarter after three o'clock in the morning, I saw two men come out of the street door of that house - I did not know them before; each of them had a bundle, and suspecting all was not right, I crossed over the way up to the door, and found it standing wide open - I perceived a dark-lantern with a light in it, on the floor, and at that moment Ganer, my partner, came up to me; we both went after the men about twenty yards, and as they turned the corner of St. Martin's-le-Grand, as we had left the door open, I turned back to close it - I rang the bell, and alarmed the house, but did not go in; Ganer returned to me, and brought the two bundles - the men had not been secured then; the two bundles were left with the constable of the night- I never saw the contents; I could not distinguish the men, only that one was taller than the other - I saw Scott in the custody of an officer coming down the street, but was not near enough to say whether he was the man, or not; when Mr. Drake came down I went into the house, but did not examine to see how the persons had got in.</p>

            . I am an ostler, at the Swan, at Hendon. On Wednesday morning, the 21st of September, the prisoner came to our house, about a quarter-past six o'clock - he had no horse with him; he asked me if he could have half a pint of beer, and asked if I had any stabling to put a horse in - I said Yes; I took the key of the stable, unlocked the door, and put a saddle and bridle in, which laid at the door, when he came- he said he was late, and had to get to town by six o'clock, but he must go to Highgate; I took a halter out of the stable, went down the road with him towards Barnet, and saw a horse there - I asked if that was his horse, and why he could not come on; he said, Yes, that the horse was knocked up, and had no shoes on, and he could get no further; I said there was a farrier lived near, who would shoe him; he said, "Well, the man must have him shed where he is going to," and he might as well have him shod there - I called the farrier out of bed; his name is Sutling - I took the horse to the stable, and while I was at breakfast it was taken out of the stable to the farrier's; the horse appeared very much distressed, as if it had been ridden very hard; the farrier lives two doors off - I afterwards saw the same horse in the farrier's shop, being shod; I saw it again when it was shod - I saw White coming up the road behind Mr. Warren, who is a constable; they came to the stable where the horse had been brought back to - the prisoner went away before White and Warren came, but returned before Warren went away.</p>

            . I am a special constable of Hendon. On the 21st of September, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went to a blacksmith's shop, kept by Sutling, and saw a horse there, which was just shod; I did not see the prisoner then - the horse had been very much beaten on the off-side, and from the appearance of its feet, and the saddle and bridle, I had my suspicions, and took it to the Swan; I had it locked in the stable, and took possession of the key - I remained there till the prisoner came, which was not till about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon; I opened the stable door when he came, and let him go up to the horse - I saw him pay the farrier for shoeing it; I heard the prisoner desire it to be saddled - I then asked him where he brought it from; he said, "Three miles on the other side of Barnet;" I asked him who from there - he said a man named Smith gave it to him as he was walking in the road, about three o'clock in the morning, to take over Westminster-bridge; I asked if he knew Smith - he said he had seen him before; I asked if any body had seen Smith give it to him - he said, "Yes, a hay-cart man; I asked if he knew the hay-cart man - he said No; I asked where he had been since he had left the horse at the farrier's - he said he had been to Vauxhall-bridge; I asked what for - he said to see the hay-cart man; I said, "You said you did not know the hay-cart<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200006"/>man;" he made no answer - I said, "I consider this horse to he stolen, and I shall take the horse and you into custody," which I did; he stood about a minute, and then said he was thirty, that he had had salt beef for dinner; I asked where he had dined - he said in Holborn; I said,"Did you not go to Westminster-bridge then;" he said No. - I asked where he came from; he said he had got no home that he went about with horses and cattle - I asked where he was on the Tuesday; he said at St. Albans - this was on the Wednesday, and that on the Monday he was at Hemel Hempstead fair; I detained the horse, saddle, and bridle - here is the saddle and bridle; I took him before a justice the same day - the saddle, bridle, and horse were shown to Mr. Hepburn that day week, at Edgware; he identified the horse as his property, but not she saddle and bridle - the prisoner gave his name as

On Sunday morning, the 9th of October, a little after six o'clock, I left my house, leaving nobody at home - nobody but myself and my housekeeper live there- I locked the house up, and took the keys in my pocket; I had fastened the windows - I returned at ten minutes after eight o'clock at night; I found the outer gate bolted inside - when I unlocked it I could not get in; I got over the wall into the yard - I had locked the outer gate and the door of the house; I found the door of the house had been burst open, but it was bolted inside at the top the same as the gate - I could not get in; I hallooed Thieves! and kicked at the door - I heard persons inside bursting open my bed-room door, and then heard more than one person running down stairs; I had locked my bed-room door - I heard them go to the wash-house, and then they got on the roof of the workshop. I am a carpenter. After that two or three young men came into my yard - the Policemen came in directly after them; I got a ladder, and Smith, the Policeman, got over, and found the prisoners on the roof of the workshop; I did not go on the roof myself- I afterwards went into the wash-house, got a light, and examined the house - I found my desk broken open, which stood in the front parlour - papers were taken out, and from a little tin box in the desk they had taken a guinea, a half-guinea, a 7s. piece, three silver tea-spoons, and four salts, two of them were silver, and two plated, with glasses, also a case of instruments, and a pair of spectacles and case; they were all taken out of my desk - I saw some of them at the Police-office the next day; an old knife and key were picked up - I found my spectacles and case of instruments thrown down in the wash-house that evening; persons must pass through the wash-house to get to the back yard from the house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe you cried Thieves! as soon as you found the premises disturbed? A. Yes; I was alone - it might be nearly ten minutes before the Policeman came up; two or three young men jumped over the wall before that, but they did not get on the roof; they scaled the outer wall to get to the front door, and after the Policeman got over more persons followed him; I saw nobody on the roof.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the Sunday in question I went to Waples' premises, hearing a cry of Thieves! I got there about four minutes after I heard the cry; I scaled the front wall, which is not above five or six feet - Waples put up a ladder, and I went over the roof of the workshop; I saw the figures of three persons running along the roof - it was dark; they dropped off the roof,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200007"/>which is about twelve feet high, into the garden of No.6, Taunton-place - I dropped also; they ran across that garden to No. 5; I followed, and saw three men going across the garden, but lost sight of one of them in the garden of No. 5; I ran some spikes into my hand in getting over to No. 5 - 1 saw the other two run into a passage from the yard at No. 5; it is a private house - I called out Stop thief! Stop them! and heard them say, "We are not the men;" I followed them into the house, and saw Letter, Captain Ruffley's servant, with a light in his hand, and at the same time I saw Kitching and Langley, and took them into custody; they said, "We are assisting you - we are not the men - we followed you;" they had not followed me; they were in front of me all the way - Captain

             and another gentle man came out of the parlour to my assistance, and some ladies followed them; the prisoners were secured - I searched them both, and found on Kitching two silver saltstands, and glasses belonging to them in his trousers pocket- I also found on him two plated salts, and the glasses, a key and a knife; I searched Langley, and found on him a latch and a door key - there is nothing remarkable in them- I gave them in charge of the gentlemen while I went in pursuit of the other one, but did not find him; I returned and found Twiss and some more persons in the passage with them - we took them to the watch-house, and on the road they said they would have a coach, they would not walk, they would be d - d. if they would; they held by the iron rails of the houses, and kitching said if he had his liberty he would punish my bl - y head; Langley called Twiss a bl - y Irish b - r; he abused him all the way to the watch-house - I went with Twiss about seven o'clock on Monday morning, and searched the garden of No. 6, through which they had passed; the servant girl went with me, and I saw her pick up a jemmy, or small crowbar; the servant at No. 5 gave me nine skeleton-keys that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CLARKSON. Q. When you got to the house, some persons had already got over, besides the prisoners? A. No - there was nobody in the yard but the prisoners; nobody was in Captain

            's premises but the captain, a gentleman, and Letter - I am sure both the prisoners said, "We are not the men;" I believe Kitching was the only one who said he would not go without a coach - I know he said so.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On Sunday, the 9th of October, in consequence of information, I went to the William the Fourth Public-house, in Exeter-street, Marylebone; it was very shortly after eleven o'clock - I saw Clayton sitting there, drinking; I knew him before - he was dressed in a fustian jacket, with a blue front, and black trousers; the sleeves of his jacket were fustain - I said, "Joe, I want you:" he asked what for - I said if he would come outside the room I would tell him; he came out, and I took him into custody, but did not tell him what I wanted him for - I took him into the parlour of the public-house, and searched him, but found nothing on him - he asked me at least three times what I took him for, but I did not tell him; I took him to the watch-house, and in Stafford-street he stopped, and requested I would tell him what I had got him for; I answered, "What have you done with the silver spoons?" he hesitated at first, and said, "Spoons? I know nothing about them;" there were three females following us, and on going up Harcourt-street one, whom he represented as his sister, said, "What have they got you in custody for, Joe, now?" he said, "For a burglary;" I directly turned to him, and said, "A burglary; how came you to know that I had got you for a burglary?" he hesitated and said, "I mean a felony. but I suppose they are both alike - I am not very learned; I don't know much about it; "I had not mentioned either felony or burglary to him - I searched him again, and found nothing, but observed that his trousers were torn in the seat, apparently by a tenter hook or spike.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The linings inside are not torn in the least? A. They are not, only the trousers are torn; it is just such a tear as I should expect to find if I hitched my trousers on a hook.</p>

I went to the field on Saturday afternoon, between twelve and one o'clock, and found twelve sheep only - there is a shed adjoining the field between that and the lane; I examined that shed, and found some blood and fat on a post, where I suppose the sheep had been hung up to be dressed - the blood appeared as if a sheep had been stuck there, and in a hedge, in the field where the shed was, I found the skin; it was quite fresh and marked like the twelve sheep which were left behind - I brought the skin to the Spaniards public-house, at Hampstead-heath; I left it there- Pegler fetched it from there; I saw it at Marylebone office yesterday morning - it was the same skin; Soper went to the shed after I first went there - I found him there on the same day as it happened; I saw the mutton at Marylebone-office - the knuckles were left on the skin, and we matched them to the hind-quarters; it corresponded as near as could be, and fitted - the tail had some wool left on the skin, and that corresponded; the mutton was dressed as if by a butcher; it was very well done - I do not know the prisoner; there were the marks of the footsteps of one person about the shed - there were no footmarks in the field to enable me to say how many had been there, as people are often walking about the field; Busswell saw the skin at Marylebone-office yesterday.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I went to the shed with Mr. Coleman; I saw some blood in the shed, and found two pieces of rag; there was fat on the post-I found one piece of rag two or three yards from the shed with a piece of fat on it; the other piece of rag was in the shed - one was a piece of canvas, and the other part of a shirt-sleeve; I compared the piece of canvas with one of the pieces in the small bundle; it appeared that one had been torn from the other by the seam - the piece of rag was the top of a shirt-sleeve, and the other piece in the bundle was the bottom part of the sleeve - they are the same quality, and corresponded; they fitted together - one had been taken from the other; I fitted both pieces.</p>

On the 30th of July, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I had occasion to go out to market, and left her in the house cleaning a stove; nobody else was in the house except my little boy, who is about ten years old, and he was down stairs, not in the same room with the prisoner - she was cleaning a stove in the parlour we usually inhabit - I was not gone above ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and on returning I found the parlour door locked, and the key outside the door, in the lock- my little boy was down stairs in the kitchen; I called to the prisoner to open the door, but she was gone - I unlocked the door, went in, and found the room all in confusion - the stove brush laid on the floor, and a large hammer laid at the corner of a chest of drawers, and a pair of scales were moved off a box, and I found the box broken open - I had left it locked; on examing it I missed a small leather trunk out of it, in which I had thirty-five sovereigns, a watch, and a ring, 29s. In silver, two purses, and some other things - I had seen the things in the trunk a few days before, and I saw the trunk in the box the day before; I made inquiry after the prisoner but did not see her for about a mouth afterwards, when I saw her at the George, on Snow-hill, kept by Percival; she was dressed very elegantly - she had a silk dress on - when she lived with me her dress was very mean and low; she was up stairs in a bed-room there, but not in bed - I said, "Oh, Esther are not you ashamed to be seen dressed as you are by robbing the window and fatherless?" I have three small children - she made no reply; a person opened her hand-box, in her presence, and took but of it my little trunk, and asked me if it was mine - I said Yes, I could take my oath of it was the trunk which had contained my money and other things - I brought it away with me, and afterwards give it to Aslett; she was not taken into custody at that time; she went out with me, as I asked her very particularly for my husband watch - she said she liad not got it, that she had pawned it for 18s., and she could get me the duplicate if I would go with her; I asked how far it was - she said not far; I went with her about three miles or more - she then turned back, and told me she did not know where it was; I did not know my way in the City-I followed her, expecting she would lead me back to Mr. Percival's house; she led me down by Hyde-park - I begged her to lead me straight to Percival's; as I did not know where it was I stopped and asked a young man if I was near Snow-hill; he said No, I was going away from it as fast as I could, and when I turned back to look for her she was gone - she came to my house afterwards; I asked if she was not ashamed of herself - she went away, after some conversation; I saw her again on the Sunday before the examination, in a house in Union-street; I had been directed to that house - I had heard she wanted to sell the duplicate of the watch; I begged of her not to sell it, but to give it to me - she then said if I would go with her she would get the duplicate; she told me to go and get my bonnet and shawl, and that it was not far - I said I would go without them, and she led me to the bottom of the Borough; I was afraid of being lost again, and said, "Is it much further?" She said No; I said, "Is it the next street?" she said No - I said."Is it the next to that?" the said No, and if I went with her I should see: the first Policeman I saw I desired him to ask her for the ticket of my watch, and he took her - that was Aslett.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not freely forgive me at Mr. Percival's house, and say you would not hurt me, and you took my clothes? A. I took some of her clothes - when I came to Percival's he asked what I intended to do with her- I said I was a window, and did not understand the law; he told me if I prosecuted her it would not me between 40l. and 50l., and I had not a farthing; I told her as it was not in my power to punish her, I hoped the great God above would, but I would forgive her freely if she produced my husband's watch, I would freely forgive her the rest.</p>

            . I am one of the inspectors of the Mist, and have had considerable experience in the examination of materials for counterfeiting coin, and of counterfeit coin; this pair of moulds are made of plaster of Paris for the purpose of casting a shilling; on the impression, on the reverse side, a portion of the plaster is come away, and I find, on an imperfect shilling, which has been produced by Edwards, precisely the same defect; here is the obverse part of the mould; that has also a trifling defect which is perceivable<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200012"/>on the shilling - here is the get, which fills the nitch in the mould; here are four counterfeit shillings, finished as perfect as the mould would make them, but they require to be filed where the get has joined them - they are imperfect, and could not be passed in the present state; they appear to have been cast in the mould now produced, for on the obverse side is a small defect in the beading round the edge, and on the reverse side is a very trifling defect in the mould, between the line of the shield containing the arms and the garter which surrounds it, and immediately above the figure 4, in the date 1824, is a small scratch - the mould and the shilling correspond with these marks; the date and the rest of the impression corresponds - one of the five good shillings I have no doubt at all has been the shilling the mould was made with, because it has on it the peculiarities I have before described; here are four perfect shillings - they have all been made in the same mould, and resemble the pattern shilling which I have produced, and correspond with the mould; the rough sprey is taken off the shilling by a file; this file would do it - the only part requiring to be filed is where the get is; this white metal on the iron plate has been fused - the tin band is used to form the mould, the plaster of Paris being in a liquid state at first; this spoon is Britannia metal, which the coin is made of - a tobacco pipe is used to pour the metal from some larger vessel into the mould, and there is white metal in it - I have known it used to fuse the metal; there is plaster of Paris in this bag.</p>

On the 20th of September, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner - he had a woman with him; he asked for coffee: I gave him a cup - he gave me a sixpence, and I gave him 5d. change; in about ten minutes they both returned - they had another cup; the prisoner gave me a shilling: I gave him a sixpence and 5d.; I put the shilling into my waistcoat pocket - I had no other money there; they returned a third time in about eight minutes - the prisoner asked for more coffee; I gave him a cup, and he gave me a shilling; I had it in my hand; my suspicions were awakened, and I told him it was a bad one; he said it was a new one, and a good one, and he could find me twenty-five more if I wanted them - I said it was bad; he said he would take it back; I gave it to him, and he put it into his pocket, keeping the good change which I had given him for it - he did not give me any other shilling: he then went away with the woman - I had looked at the shilling I had in my waistcoat pocket before he left me, and told him that was also bad; I described his person to Clarkson, the Policeman, about ten minutes afterwards, and saw him in custody in about twenty minutes - I saw Clarkson search him at my stall; he resisted violently - a shilling was found on him; I went to the station-house, marked the shilling he first gave me, and gave it to Clarkson; I received no payment for the last cup of coffee.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did the woman give you the shilling, or did I? A. He gave it me; nobody else was standing by the first time - I gave the shilling to a woman the third time, and told her to go over the way, and ask if it was bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200013"/>Q. Why not detain me then? A.You went away - I am sure the shilling produced is the one you gave me, because I put it into my pocket, where I had no other money - it was the last shilling that I gave the woman to look at; she took it across to a light, brought it back, and gave it to me- I offered it to the prisoner, who took it and kept it.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARKSON. I am a Policeman. In consequence of information from Ewart I apprehended the prisoner in Golden-lane, about four o'clock in the morning; I took him to Goswell-street, to Ewart - I searched one of his hands, which he clasped very tight - I suspected he had something in it; he resisted very much: I at last got it open, with great force, and there was a shilling in it, which I produce; I took him to the station-house, searched him again there, and found one shilling, one sixpence, and 7d. in copper, all good money, on him - I took the woman, and found 9d. on her; I received a counterfeit shilling from Ewart, which I have had ever since - he marked it before he gave it to me.</p>

I never had the razor in my hand with any bad intention; I only had it because I found my razor was spoiled by somebody - I never kicked the door so hard as they say; I only touched it, and it opened- I did not hit the man with any intent to use the knife; I only happened to have it in my hand when they asked why I opened the door so - I said because I liked, that was all.</p>
               <p>Caetano's Defence. I only came in to bid him farewell, because I was going away; I only went on a visit- this man came in, and they said, "How came you to come in, in such a rough way?" he said because he liked it; the prosecutor then jumped out of bed - I went to part them; I did not know that he had any knife in his hand - I only took him away to keep him back; I do not know the laws of this country at all.</p>

            . I live at No. 246, Shoreditch - I buy and sell clothes. The prisoner came to my house on Sunday morning last; I never saw him before - he asked if I bought old clothes; I said Yes - he said he had got some at his lodgings; I went with him to a public-house opposite Shoreditch church - he brought out two bags, and told me he would come down to my house, and I should buy them of him; he brought the bags to my house about a quarter to eight o'clock that morning - the first article he showed me was an olive double breasted coat, quite new, and asked 30s. for it; I value it at 4l. or 5l. - he then showed me two coats, and asked 20s. each for them; I asked how he came by them; he said his master gave them to him - I said, "I think they have hardly been worn, and I think them too good for your master to give you;" I told him to put them all into his bag, and I sent for the headborough, who took him to the station-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked me first if I wanted to buy any thing; I asked if he bought old clothes, which I had to sell - I asked him a price for them, and he offered me 2l.; and because I would not take that, I suppose he fetched the officer.</p>
               <p>ROBERT JONES. I am confident all these things are my master's - I have examined them; the bags are also his - he had a written character with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen, - I beg leave to assure you that so far from my being an old offender, or having and bad accomplices, I have only been five months in London, my native place being Market Overton, in the County of Rutlandshire. I had served two masters faithfully, and in all probability should have continued to serve the prosecutor with the same faith and industry, had I not been driven to despair by the bad usage of the butler, Robert Jones; it is true, I ought to have complained to my master, who I am sure would have seen me righted, but I was afraid to complain. I am, my Lord and Gentlemen, overcome with sorrow and shame- but I do trust that you will take into your consideration my youth, being only eighteen years old - that you will consider the respectability of my family, my father having been forty years high-constable of the County of Rutlandshire; my father died about three years since - my mother is alive, and will be heart broken when she hears of my disgrace. I do hope, my Lord and Gentlemen, you will consider these circumstances, and inflict as lenient a fine as the nature of the case can admit. My Lord and Gentlemen, I throw myself entirely upon your merciful consideration, in hope that my master will speak for me, and prove the character he received with me from Mr. Chapman.</p>

On the 3rd of October, about twelve o'clock, I was in the bakehouse, and saw the prisoner in the shop; the parlour is in a passage leading from the shop to the bakehouse - he might have been there before I saw him; thinking him a customer I went to serve him - he asked for a penny worth of buttered biscuits, which I gave him: he immediately threw sixpence on the counter- I was going to give him change from the till; he said, in a hurried way, "Quick now;" I took the coppers in my hand, and from his speaking so hurried I turned round to see if my watch was on the parlour mantel-piece, and missed it; I immediately collared him, pulled him into the parlour, put my hand to his side, and felt the watch in his side pocket; I scuffled with him, and called for assistance- he got his hand into his pocket, and threw the watch to the other end of the parlour; my neighbours observed me, and went for a Policeman - one who was passing came in, and I gave him in charge; he denied having seen the watch, or knowing any thing about it - it was laying on the floor at that time; I gave 4l. for it about two years ago, but it was considered worth 6l. 10s.</p>

On the 10th of October, about eleven o'clock at night, I saw Chambers in the Commercial-road; I gave her some porter at a public-house, and accompained her home - she asked for gin; I gave her sixpence to fetch some, and while she was gone for it, I took my four half-crowns out of my pocket, and put them into my fob - she returned without any gin; we went to bed together - I told her I must go out by two o'clock in the morning, and to call me if I should fall asleep; I was awoke between two and three o'clock by the prisoner Horncastle pulling me by the arm- I had not seen him before; he said I should go out of the house, for I had no business there - I then missed my money, and said I would not go till it was returned; my trousers, which I had put under the bolster, were on the floor; I asked for the woman - he said there was no woman in the house, that I had no business there, and he would turn me out; he attempted to turn me out - we had an altercation in the passage; the door was opened to put me out, and the Policeman came in - he brought Chambers into the passage to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q.How far from your home did you meet her? A.About a quarter of a mile; she took me to a room one street from where I live- I wanted to be called at two o'clock, saying I had a cow to attend to that was ill, but I meant to go home; I am married, and have five children - I was a little in liquor; I was heavy to sleep, but had my recollection perfectly.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not say at the public-house, "Come, mistress, give me my change, for it is my last shilling?" A. I do not recollect it - if I did say so, it was not the case.</p>

            . I was going along my beat, between two and three o'clock in the morning, and heard a loud talking - when I came to the door of this house I saw Horncastle, with a candlestick in one hand, endeavouring to get the prosecutor out; he said he had been robbed by a woman - Horncastle said there was no woman in the house; I searched the house, and found Chambers in the cellar, in her night clothes; she had no light, and said,"Oh, here you are;" she begged me not to take her, and she would do any thing in the world to make me a recompence - I took her to the prosecutor; she declared her innocence, but begged him not to press any thing against her - I found a sixpence and 15 1/2d. on her, and a half-crown and a sixpence on Horncastle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know her before? A. By seeing her in the street - I am given to understand the house is her own property, and believe it not to be a house of ill-fame; I did not know her as a prostitute - the prosecutor was tipsy.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 17th of September, at half-past ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner on Saffron-hill, with part of a cheese under his coat, wrapped in an apron; I stopped him, and asked what he had - he said it was two quartern loaves; I found it was 14 lbs. of cheese, and asked where he got it - he said he did not know it was cheese, but that somebody gave it him in Holborn to carry somewhere - he could not tell where, but said the people would come by and by.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you see him come into the house? A. Yes, he went into the tap-room- I did not see him go into the parlour; I could not see the parlour door from the bar, but I heard him go out - I would not swear that he was sober.</p>

When the officer came to me, he asked if I did not live with Mr. Woollard - I said Yes; he asked what I took from him - I said Nothing; he said,"I believe you did," and I must take you into custody -I said, "Very well;" Mrs. Woollard had often threatened that she would send me over the water - I owed her a few shillings, and I was afraid she would give me in charge; I left her - I did ask for this money, but not in any name.</p>
               <p>MRS. WOOLLARD. He did ask for it for Mrs. Kendall- it was a regular rule to take her women's beer at six o'clock, and at that time he asked me for 2l. 10s. for her to pay her women; I gave it him - he came back, and said she was very busy, and would send the gold by her little girl.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long did that woman live with the prisoner? A.About seven years, as near as I can recollect - I was intimate with them part of the time: she left him at the end of seven years, and it was said she went away with some other man - she returned, and the prisoner took her back; I do not know where she has lived since - I heard a report that the prisoner's wife died at Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How long ago did you hear that? A. About a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the person you saw last week was the person he married and lived with? A. If I saw her now I could tell - I cannot say upon my oath that she was the person: I saw a woman at the Police-office, who was the person the prisoner married.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If you will not swear the woman you saw in Oxford-street was the woman he married, how can you swear that the woman you saw at the office was the same? A. I will not swear without I saw her present - I saw the same woman both times; she was the woman - I did say I would not swear it; I was not quite clear of her that day - I did not speak to her; I was subpoenaed to go to Marlborough-street office - there is no other person living who was present at the marriage.</p>

A.No; I saw Phillips at the door - three of these shillings are what I marked and put into the till in the counting-house, which adjoins the warehouse; we do not close the door always - I was in the granary, taking in some corn when I saw Phillips, and watched him; Lightfoot and Best were opposite, and could have got in without my seeing them.</p>

I took the prisoner on the 23rd of September, from the information of her sister, in Church-lane, Whitechapel; I asked her how she could think of robbing her employer - she said she did it, because she wished to leave the country; I asked what she had taken - she said 4l. 18s., and 4l. was in sovereigns; she said she saw a young woman on Tower-hill, and she went with her to Cheshunt and to Coventry, where she robbed her of her money and clothes, and that she had walked back on foot; I believe she had the same dress on that she has now, but she did not appear so clean - she did not tell me where she got the money.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 17th of September, I was in the foot-path, near Mr. Dear's garden at Bull's-cross - I saw Alfred Hill and another boy coming out of his gate, between five and six o'clock; the other had a bag - I suspected there was something not right; I followed them - they walked at first, and when they saw me they made more haste - they dropped the bag; I took it up, and secured Alfred Hill; I found in the bag these three water-plates, this piece of carpet, and this bottle of wine; I gave information at the house, and we went up stairs with Amelia Hill - her master said to her, "How came you to rob me so?" she put her hands together, and said it was the first time, she hoped he would forgive her, and she would not do so any more - the plates were not mentioned then; there were three plates left in a kind of a hole in the attic - one of them corresponded with the three in the bag; Mrs. Dear produced a piece of carpet, which matched this piece in the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Mr. Dear say he had not seen the plates for eight years? A. He said, "Not for some time; the prisoner were admitted to ball, and have surrendered to-day - the other boy is sixteen years old: he is older than this boy - he ran away, but this one did not.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. The officer came to our house that morning before we were up- he asked if we had lost any water plates; we had had six up stairs, four of one pattern and two of another; the three he found were of the same pattern with one I had left- this piece of carpet was produced; I have a piece which corresponds with it - Amelia Hill had access to the room in which that cupboard was, and she asked me what was in it; I said a good many things, and among the rest some pewter water-plates; I had them in my hand a few days before - the three brought back were the same pattern as the one remaining - in my judgment, they are ours- the prisoner said she hoped for forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you brought, them yourself? A. No; I took them there when we removed from London twelve years ago, and they had been in my kitchen two or three years before; there is no private-mark on them - if I had seen these twenty miles off I could swear to them; I can only swear to the state they are in; they are very dirty and dusty.</p>

On the 14th of September a young woman, who passed as the prisoner's sister, brought this silk to my house to be spread; I know the prisoner - he has been in my shop once - he had nothing to do with my business, but at times two or three of a family come about business - he came on the 14th of September, between nine and ten o'clock; my wife called me down to bring the cane to him - I came down, saw him, and said"There is the cane;" I gave it into his hand, and he walked away with it - my wife called to me, in his presence, and said, "You must bring that came down, for it is not weighed" - that the young man had come for it, because it was not weighed; he went away with it in his arms - he said nothing, in my presence: I had no doubt it was right - I have never seen it since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell the Magistrate it was a fair young man who came? A. I did not - I said I could not swear to the prisoner; I have worked for his mother for two years at different times - he came once with her to pull on a came: I knew him by sight - I do not swear to him now: this happened about ten minutes after I received the silk - he was in his shirt-sleeves when he came.</p>

             on the Thursday after her death; she had died on the Monday night - I opened her scull; decomposition was going on very rapidly on the brain - the vessels were very full; none of them appeared to have been ruptured - there was no appearance of concussion, but the science does not enable us to discover appearances of concussion; we cannot decide that in any case if it is simple concussion - there was nothing to lead me to suspect it; I found the left lobe of the lungs perfectly healthy, but the right lobe was very extensively diseased - adhesion was passing from the lung; the pericardium contained much more water than is usually met with, and so much as to occasion the disease called hydxocardia - there was a bruise on the back of the right hand; I observed no other marks, but decomposition might obliterate them, for the body was in a very small room with a fire in it - I afterwards had the body disinterred, in consequence of something which had been said, and on examining the windpipe I discovered one of the rings had become ossified, which was most likely caused by some violence having been done at a distant period - that could not affect her life, but would very much affect her comfort, and undersome circumstances render her ability to sustain life less probable; upon the whole examination I certainly could not attribute her death to violence - if I separated my professional knowledge from what I heard, I should say there was nothing to enable me to say of what she died, although there was a mark of disease - it had not arrived at that state likely to destroy life, unless under peculiar circumstances - hastily altering her position; I mean the upper part of her body being brought much lower than its usual position by stooping suddenly - I cannot think of any thing else which would cause it, but altering the position of the heart, which was impeded by the presence of water.</p>
               <p>Q. Would going hastily up stairs produce that effect? A. That would cause syncope - she would be obliged to stop.</p>

             WHITTELL. I am a surgeon, and have been in practice between three and four years. I examined the body of the deceased, in company with Mr. Whitmore, and agree in the account he has given as to the appearance of the body - there was a slight contusion on the back of the hand, and also on the external part of the scull, but there was no internal mark corresponding with it; the upper part of the heart was much affected by the disease- the appearances were not sufficient to induce me to conclude she died by violence, nor were they sufficient to prove she died from natural causes - there were no marks to bring me to conclude that violence had been given; as such the conclusion I should come to was that she died from natural causes - I observed the water about the heart, and the auricle was thin and softened; a sudden change of position might cause her death - any violent shock or agitation of mind would have considerable influence, but would not alone cause death; sudden passion certainly would accelerate the action of the heart considerably, and in that way more or less cause this complaint, but it must be carried to a very great extent to cause death.</p>

            , JUN. I am Mr. Whitmore's son, and am twenty-one years old. I have just finished my hospital studies - I have been brought up under my father- I examined the body with my father and Mr. Whittell; I think great excitement, attended with a sudden alteration of position, might cause death; I could from no opinion as to the cause of her death from a view of the body.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BLANCH. I live in Glass-court, Brook-hill, Clerkenwell. The prisoner lived at No. 6 in the court, with Mary Bunyon; two woman lived in the same house -I am a bedstead-maker. On Monday evening, the 18th of September, about seven o'clock, I was at work in the court, taking a bedstead down, before the prisoner's window - I was at the top of the court, when the prisoner came to me and said, "Have you seen my old b-h?" I said I had seen her a quarter of an hour before, and I had scarcely spoken to him before she came down Mutton-hill with something in her apron; he said, "Where have you been?" she said, "I have been to fetch you something for your supper, my dear;" he asked if she had a halfpenny- she said she had; they went away together, returned in about five minutes, and went into their apartment, which is on the ground floor - they shut the shutters, and directly they went in the door was locked; the door was bolted inside - which of them shut the shutters I do not know; I heard the door locked and the shutters bolted - I then heard them beginning to quarrel, and there was a violent commotion; I heard a table thrown down with crockery on it; I heard her say to him twice, "For God's sake, Jem don't murder me;" I heard the sound of blows, and she screamed out dreadfully - I was nearly half an hour there at work; her cries at last got so low I could scarcely hear them - they had unbolted the shutters and thrown them open; one of the shutters struck me as it opened - I cannot say which of them opened them; the window was opened to unbolt them - the prisoner came, and shut it down directly; my back was towards them - I could not see who put the sash down; I saw nothing more that evening - I saw the prisoner next morning, about eight o'clock, and he said, "My Poll is dead;" that she died about ten; I saw him go into a broker's shop at the corner of the court- he came out, and told me Mrs. Bowden, the broker, had told him he had been killing his wife; he said he had not struck her, that he only gave her a violent slmking - he laid hold of a person who stood by me, and shook him by the collar to show me how he shook her; he said he had not struck her at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was he always in the habit of calling her his wife? A. Yes - whether they were married I do not know; I have heard him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200029"/>say they had lived together seventeen years - there was no quarrelling till they got into the room, and how it began I do not know; she had been very ill for a long time, and could not drink - I believe she had been in the habit of drinking; I have seen her a little intoxicated, but not very often.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she appear in liquor that evening? A. No great deal - I do not know that she was so at all; she could walk and talk well.</p>

On Monday evening, about nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner and deceased go out together; they went towards their own door - I think it was near nine; it was not quite dark - she looked at a book-case at my door, and said, "I wish I had money to buy it;" she seemed sober, and I thought the prisoner was rather in liquor - the deceased said at that time that her health had been better than for a long time; I saw the prisoner about seven o'clock next morning - he said, "My old Poll is gone;" I asked what he meant - he said, "She is gone dead, she died last night exactly at ten;" he said nothing about any body picking her off the floor.</p>
               <p>ANN DAY. I live in the same house as the prisoner. I never heard whether the woman was his wife or not; I saw the prisoner and her on Monday evening, about half-past six o'clock, coming home comfortably - they came into their room; I heard no disturbance - I live up one pair of stairs, but am very deaf; the prisoner called to me about eight o'clock for a light - I took him one down, but could not get into his room door; he unbolted the shutter, and took the light in at the window - he said, "Mother Day, my cream has fell down, do come and help me up with her;" he got the poker, wrenched the door open, and I found her on the floor - she did not speak; I took her by the heels, he took hold of her shoulders, and we laid her on the bed - she moved her legs to ease herself up in the bed: I did not see her move before she was put on the bed - she had been ill for eight months before, and I expected every night would be her last; I have been called up two or three night in a week to assist her, and found her very had - she would spit pint pots full at a time, and I expected she would be choked with it; the prisoner called me again about a quarter-past ten o'clock - I went down, and found her dead, laying on the bed, covered over: there was some raw liver and bacon in the room - the table was not upset when I went in, but the crockery was broken when I first went in: she was not the prisoner's wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How do you know that? A. I have heard them both say so - they had lived there nine or ten months; she has been eight months of that time ill - I have seen her intoxicated; she never took more than 1d. worth at a time, but she would often have it, and could stand a good deal - she appeared intoxicated when I helped her on the bed, and smelt of liquor; the prisoner was also intoxicated.</p>

            , come down, for I am afraid my Mary is dead;" we both entered the room together, and found her dead, laying on the bed covered over - she had her clothes on, and her stays, but there were no bones in them; her clothes did not appear torn at all - about a quarter to eight o'clock that night, I heard something fall down like crockery, and I found some crockery broken in the room; the prisoner was undressed, sitting on the bed, with a tinder-box in his lap - I saw no blood about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the woman given to drink? A. Yes - when the prisoner was sober he was very kind to her.</p>
               <p>MARY BLENCOW. I live in this court. I saw the deceased on Monday evening, about six o'clock; she appeared sober, and as well as ever she was, except having a bad cough - I was talking to her about her brother's funeral; I was in the habit of seeing her often - she had been in a very bad state of health for a long time, through a cough; I never saw her intoxicated.</p>
               <p>MR. WHITMORE, SEN. re-examined. Q.Would shaking or striking the woman in the state she was in, be likely to cause her death? A. Certainly a violent shaking would, and if a blow knocked her down or altered her position it might.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the appearances indicate a disposition to drink, or did the water in the pericardium account for drinking? A. I have had well-known cases of dropsy of the pericardium, when I have known the persons were not given to drink; I believe drinking is one of the causes of such appearances, but I certainly should not look at the pericardium for appearances of a person's drinking - I should rather look at the liver; her falling when intoxicated might cause her death, but under the stimulus of drink, she was more capable of bearing up with what might happen - a fall when intoxicated might be more violent, and from her inability to raise herself, her altered position might continue longer; there are certain sorts of violence which might produce death, and leave no trace - if she died from blows there would be marks.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Would lifting her on the bed injure her? A. If the feet were more elevated than the head it might.</p>
               <p>MR. WHITTELL. In my opinion a violent shaking, or knocking down, or blows might cause her death without leaving external marks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If she had fallen, and laid on the ground some time, would that be sufficient to account for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200030"/>her death? A. If she was in an horizontal position some time it might.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never touched a hair of her head when she fell, and have not hit her for some years.</p>

            . I am a pupil of the London-hospital. The deceased was brought there on Thursday, the 15th of September, about twelve o'clock in the day<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200031"/>for an injury in the ancle, in a quarrel with another man; on examination I found a large bone of the ancle joint broken - it was much inflamed and swollen; he became delirious on Friday night, and continued so at times till his death, on Monday, the 19th; the bone was set in the first instance, and during his delirium he kicked his leg about so as to force the bone through the skin; it became a compound fracture, and mortification came on - his death was caused by delirium, occasioned by the fracture- he had two black eyes, which he might have got in fighting; as he became delirious it would have been improper to take off the leg.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would not his walking on the leg tend to inflame it? A. Certainly; the mortification was very recent, and had not time to cause death; he died about twenty-four hours after it became a compound fracture - we were obliged to confine him in a straight waistcoat; it is not uncommon for severe delirium to take place in cases of fracture, with persons who drink much - when he first entered he had a tremulous motion in the eye, and I suspected delirium would take place.</p>

            , I am a Policeman. On the 30th of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners with another boy at Pentonville, loitering about a shoemaker's shop; I watched them for half an hour, and saw Hitchcock crawl into Offord's shop, on his hands and knees, and take this bacon out: Maginn had an apron on - Hitchcock gave it to him, and he put it into his apron; he was standing outside, about two shops off, and a third boy stood opposite; I crossed, and seized the prisoners.</p>
               <p>RICHARD OFFORD. I keep a chandler's-shop at Pentonville; King brought the prisoners in - he had the bacon in his hand: I am sure it was mine - nobody was in the shop at the time.</p>

            . I am porter to a carrier. I was with Toole; a mob had gathered - the prisoners were following several gentlemen, walking up and down; at last Mr. Beachcroft passed - they followed him up; I saw Walker put his hand into Mr. Beachcroft's pocket, take the handkerchief out, put it behind him, and give it to Preston -Toole told me to inform the gentleman; I went through the mob and spoke to one gentleman, but could not find the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Walker. You said at Guildhall that you went after the gentleman, and he said he had lost a handkerchief, but would not take further trouble about it, Witness. I spoke to a gentleman who had lost one, but that was not the prosecutor.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I am willing to go back to the gentleman" - he said I must go with him; I asked for his authority - he said he should not show it; he tore my shirt, and threw me down.</p>

On the 10th of October, at twenty minutes to nine o'clock, I looked at my watch in Long-lane, and am certain it was safe; I was walking behind the prisoners, who were strangers to me - a drover was passing, and struck Newman on the arm: she exclaimed that he had made her arm bleed, and that she had been bled that day - Walker turned round to me and said, "Did you take hold of that woman's arm?" I said, "I did not;" she looked me full in the face - I walked up Long-lane, and as I crossed Smithfield Walker laid hold of my arm, which I did not wish; I have a wife and children - I shook her off me, and turned up King-street; I turned up <placeName id="t18311020-74-crimeloc389">Salisbury Arms-yard</placeName>

I said Yes; she said, "What do you know of me?" I said,"No good;" she called out Joe! I saw several men; I ran, called a watchman, and told him to come, for I had a prisoner at the bottom of the yard - two watchmen assisted in taking her; she declared she had been at home for a week before, and was never out till that night - I have not a doubt of her; she was in the same dress exactly when I took her.</p>

            . I am a watchman, of West-street. I know the prisoners; I had seen them both before, but not together. About a quarter to nine o'clock I stood at the end of Salisbury-yard, and heard a scuffle - I looked round, and saw Walker running down the steps as fast as she could run; I am sure of her - I knew her before, and a few minutes after, Young came down stairs and asked me which way the woman had gone; I did not see Walker again that evening - Young said, "Stop, watchman, let us take her pal," and he gave Newman in charge; he said he should have secured Walker, but Newman had held his jacket - I was present next day when Walker was taken in West-street.</p>
               <p>Newman. Q. Did you see me standing listening to what was going on? A. No; the transaction was in the yard, before I came to the steps - directly I saw her, Young gave her in charge.</p>

I said, "No, I was not out last night;" he said he could swear to me by my blue gown, black bonnet, and red handkerchief, with yellow spots - here is the handkerchief I had on; he owned to the Alderman that he let me go the first time.</p>
               <p>Newman's Defence. I never spoke to the man; I was standing in the street, fainting away - the prosecutor stood at the corner of the street - he ran after some woman; he knocked against my bad arm - I laid hold of his coat, and said, "What are you about?" he ran on, and having lost sight of the woman, turned round and said, "Watchman, take this woman, she will do as well; we will keep her till we find the other;" as I went to the Compter he said,"Tell me where the other woman lives, and I will let you go" - I said I did not know her, or I would soon tell; I never saw Walker till she was at the office.</p>

The prosecutor sent for me: I saw the handkerchief found in the fire-place, behind some lumber, in a paper - we asked the prisoner how she came by it; she said she took it out of the shop, and she had taken several others, pawned them, and burnt the duplicates - no promise had been made to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was any promise afterwards made to her? A. I said, in going to the office, she had better tell where the rest of the property was; I saw her wages, 2l. 10s., paid to her.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were you examined before the Magistrate? A. Yes; I stated that the prisoner came out and went in - he then came out again, and went in again; if he had any money belonging to the prosecutor, he might have thrown it away, or given it to the other man- I looked at him attentively while he was in the shop; I did not see him do any thing.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Hamblin's-row. I assisted in stopping the prisoner, about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's shop - he demanded to see the officer's authority, and he pulled out his staff - the prisoner seized it, and then he took hold of his cuffs; he said he would not be searched in the street, but if he went to a public-house he would be searched quietly; when we got there he was very desperate, and fought with the officer - the officer overcame him; it took four of us to handcuff him: while the officer was searching him his expressions were very bad.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did not a man named Colton come up? A. No; the prisoner became violent when we attempted to handcuff him; he was walking when he was taken.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM CRAWFORD. I live in Quaker-street, Spitalfields. The prisoner is a material witness in a case of felony against John Brown, the husband of this woman; I had the prisoner in custody for offering a tool which his master sent him to sell, and which I lost from my premises- his master absconded out of the office; he had two examinations - it was said there was a person who could prove he bought it, and then he absconded on the 28th of September.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On the night of the 15th of September I met Dickinson, and in consequence of what he said, I ran up Belgrave-place, and stopped the cart with the two prisoners in it - I asked Jones had he got any soap; he said he had, and that a man put it into the cart - I asked where the man was, and he said he did not know; I took him back, and had him taken to the station - this is the soap; the cart was going fast, and was going from Mr. Crow's house, which is at Pimlico.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the horse galloping? A. No, trotting very quick - I swear that; I was not able to speak when I got up - it was a very small poney: I asked Jones had he any soap in the cart- I did not ask what he had got in the cart; that I swear- I had heard from Dickenson that some soap had been lost.</p>
               <p>Q.When you asked Jones whether he had any soap, did he not say Yes, and point out Johnson as the man who put it into the cart? A. No, he never pointed out Johnson - he said it was a man he did not know; Mr. Crow's son told me to take the soap, and let the man go - I said that was the way to encourage thieves, and I never let Jones go out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the cart, with the men in it, drive away from Mr. Crow's door with your consent, and did not you let it go? A. No - I did not let Jones go; he got out of the cart when we got to Crow's, and I had him taken to the station; Mr. Crow's man came to look at the soap -Johnson was in the cart, but Jones was on the road along with me, and I had him in custody; he did not go into Crow's - he went to the door; I did not see him show the soap to Crow's man - Jones did not go back into the cart; I had him by my side - the horse and cart were taken to the statibn-house in four or five minutes; I went back to Mr. Crow's for the soap; it had been taken into the shop- the person at the shop did not say he was quite satisfied.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WEEKES re-examined. Q. How long before had you seen the soap safe? A. I suppose half an hour, or three quarters; I met the officer in the road bringing back the cart, and the two prisoners in it; when it got to my master's door I looked into the rail of it, and asked what they had in it - they said there was a box put into the cart to be taken to Westminster; I can swear to this box, but not to the soap - the box had soap in it when I saw it safe, and soap in it when I found it; there were twelve bars in it - I believe Jones went into the shop to my young master; I was at the tail of the cart - he went towards the door; I am not certain whether he went in- I did not hear Johnson give any account of the soap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A. Were there twelve whole bars of soap? A. Yes, and so there were at the office - it was then put into the officer's care; there are only eleven and a quarter now - I cannot account for that; I saw Jones go towards our house - I supposed he was going to rectify his own cause, if he could - I saw the cart go, and Johnson in it; Jones went with the officer and his assistants - I did not see the officer let him go; the soap was taken into the shop, and remained there twenty minutes.</p>

On the night of the 15th of September I was passing by the wooden bridge, at Pimlico, at a quarter-past eight o'clock; I saw Jones conveying the box of soap towards a cart, about a hundred yards from Mr. Crow's; he was not above twelve yards from the cart- there was a person sitting in the cart, but who it was I cannot say; I am clear that the man who put the soap into the cart was Jones, and they went off, soap and all, at a middling pace: I heard of the soap being lost, and told the constable which way the cart went - I heard him say, when the cart was brought back, that he had been employed by a man to carry it who had run away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not point out Johnson as the man? A. No, he said the man had run away; I did not tell the Magistrate, but I mention it now, because my Lord asked me - I did not think of it when I was before the Magistrate; I did not know Jones before - I am sure he was the man; I did not notice his handkerchief - I think he had a blue coat on; I did not speak to him - the cart went off at a middling pace; I heard the officer say at the office, that when he got up they cut the horse to go on - I heard the gentleman at Mr. Crow's tell the officer to let them go, and the horse and cart, and Johnson did go away - I saw Jones get into the cart, turn it round, and he was in the act of driving it away when the officer brought him back.</p>
               <p>COURT to JOHN SARSFIELD. Q.Do you hear what he says? A. He means at the time he put the soap into the cart.</p>
               <p>JAMES DICKINSON. Jones got into the cart at Mr. Crow's.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200039"/>Jones' Defence. When the officer called to me, I turned round, and met him; he said, "There is a bother about this, what have you got in the cart?" I said, "Here is a box, which a man put in, I don't know what is in it;" I said, "What is the matter?" he said he did not know - when we got to the shop the young master told the man to go and see what was in the cart; he said soap - it was taken out. and he said, "Go along about your business;" I got into the cart, and got about fifty yards - the officer came and took the cart; I got out, and he led the cart to the station - I followed it, or I need not have been taken.</p>
               <p>Johnson's Defence. I was coming from Chelsea, and saw Jones; I asked him to give me a ride - the soap was in before I got into the cart.</p>

On the 5th of October I arrived from the country- I took a hackney-coach at the Bull and Mouth, to take me and my family home; the prisoner was the driver - I put a small parcel in, and took the number of the coach; I had two cloaks on my arm - I put them on the seat of the coach- when we arrived at home I took my wife and children out; I then took the luggage from the prisoner, and handed it to my young man, but I did not receive the cloaks - I forgot them for about ten minutes; I then went to see for the coach, but could not find it; it was then about nine o'clock in the evening - I went the next morning to the office in Essex-street: they gave me the address of the proprietor of the coach - I went there, and saw a lady, who said she should see the man in the morning, and no doubt my cloaks would be forthcoming, but I have not seen them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was it in the evening that you arrived? A. Yes, by the Shrewsbury coach- I had not seen the prisoner before; I waited four days after I made the inquiry; there were four boxes in the coach, and one paper parcel, and I believe an umbrella - they were all given out but the cloaks; I am positive he is the person - the gas was burning in the shop when I paid him his fare; they were two blue camblet cloaks, one lined with scarlet and one with blue.</p>

            . I am horsekeeper to Mrs. Halfpenny - she is the proprietor of the coach; the prisoner drove it - he had been in her service two or three weeks; he went out between nine and ten o'clock on the 5th of October, and was to return between one and two o'clock in the morning - when I went to the yard the next morning the coach and horses were safe, and the prisoner went to work the next day, as usual; this was on the Wednesday, and he worked on the Thursday - as he came home with short money my mistress sent him out again.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you tell the Magistrate that he did not come back the next day? A. No, Sir, I did not; I was examined- I can write - this is my signature; what I stated was correct.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what did you mean by this - (read) - "The last day the prisoner was at work was last Wednesday week - he did not come next morning?" A. He did not come without being fetched; I went for him - he came on the Thursday, went out with the coach, and did not return- I did not state, to the best of my knowledge, that he did not return.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he did come? A. Yes -I told the Magistrate he was short of his fare on the Wednesday, and on the Thursday he did not return; he would have had to make up the money which he was short; that is the usual way with those who have been but a short time - I was present when the prosecutor made his last application to my mistress, and I went for the prisoner; I found him standing against the first coach in Aldersgate-street - I did not know the business rightly; I asked him for my mistress' key and money, and said a gentleman wanted to speak to him; he, I, and two or three more then went and had something to drink - we then went back, and the prosecutor went and spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman came and said, "I left two cloaks in your coach;" I said it was more than I knew, and I would go where he pleased; he then went into a shop - I could have got away, but I knew myself innocent.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. BALDWIN. Q. Did you go to the coach-stand and speak to him? A. Yes - I told him I left two cloaks in his coach - he said he knew nothing about it; I said he certainly had them, and if he did not give them to me I should give him in charge - I went into Mr. Matthews's shop, close by, to inquire for an officer, but I looked through the window at the prisoner all the time; I was there while Mr. Matthews sent for an officer, perhaps ten minutes - he made no attempt to go away, but I told him I would take care he should not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How was the coach left when the prisoner came into your house? A. The coach door was shut, as I believe.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Who is Hemming? A. My cousin; he had been out all night with me- I was never out all night before; I had been at a public-house, and had a pint of beer - I was only in one public-house; when I awoke the coffee-shop was quite full of people - I found my watch-glass on the ground.</p>

            . I was at the William the Fourth coffee-shop on Sunday morning, and saw the prosecutor come in with Hemming - the prisoners sat opposite me; I saw the prisoner Murphy there first - Percival came in a good while after him; another man was in their company - the prosecutor was asleep; I saw the one who is not in custody shift a stool up in the corner - he moved it again, just by where Harrison sat, and then Murphy was moving about from one place to the other; Percival was leaning over the next box - I heard Percival ask Murphy for a knife; Murphy gave him one, and Percival gave it to the other man, who cut Harrison's watch-guard, and in taking his watch out, the glass and key fell on the ground - I saw Percival give the knife back to Murphy, who said it was a pearl handle and steel blade; I saw no more of the watch- the man who took it went and sat on the stairs, and shortly after they all three left the room and went away together; several other persons left at the same time - I awoke Harrison, and told him what had occurred; Hemming came out with us - I met the prisoners and the other man by Spitalfields church, almost immediately after, with several others who had been in the shop; I directly went to the Police station, and told what had occurred, but before I got assistance they were gone - I knew Murphy before, by his living at the top of the street where I do; he was not acquainted with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you sleep that night? A. No where - I live in Charles-street, Curtain-road; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200044"/>and a few friends generally go out on a Saturday night -I had been drinking, but was not intoxicated; I staid with my friends at the coffee-shop - I am a chair-maker; I was a afraid to mention it in the house - after I did mention it a man told me to hold my tongue; Harrison went out after losing his watch, and came in again - I then mentioned it.</p>
               <p>Q.Were there as many as twenty persons in the shop when Harrison awoke? A. Yes, but all that were in the place were of one company, laughing and joking together - six persons were in my company; I was there not an hour and a half before Harrison - the prisoners were sober; I never quarrelled with Murphy - I had two pints of porter, and drank with several friends besides; I was not the least intoxicated.</p>

I was going home between two and three o'clock in the morning, and went into the coffee-shop, alone; I had my knife to my hand, spreading some butter - I showed the persons near me what a curious knife it was; it was handed round to be examined - there were thirty or forty persons in the shop; the prosecutor and witnesses were asleep - I had no connection with the party - I never saw them before, except Knight, whom I have abused for abusing his mother in the street, and for that reason, I believe, he picked me out; seven or eight persons went out at the same time as me.</p>
               <p>Percival's Defence. I went there for a cup of coffee, and returned directly, as I was sitting up, watching my brother, who lay dead.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 20th of September, at seven o'clock in the morning, I was on duty opposite the prosecutor's shop, and saw the prisoner come out of the shop; he began to clean the window, then beckoned to a boy who stood in a court, and pointed down Charles-street; the boy took the hint, and went down that street - the prisoner directly left the shop, and went down that street, towards him; I followed, and seeing me he went into his master's shop again - he went through the shop, and was going out at the back door; I followed, and took him, and in his hat found this tea, in paper, covered with a handkerchief.</p>

I went into the shop about seven o'clock, and saw the prisoner at a tea-canister - I saw him put his hat on his head, and then put the lid on the canister; he afterwards took his hat off, and appeared to be smoothing something in it - he then went out to dust the windows.</p>

I told him I had seen him pick a gentleman's pocket - he gave me no answer; I took him to the station, and asked if he had any mark on the handkerchief - he said there that it was his own; he said he did not know of any mark on it - I found the centre of it marked, "A. J. West, Durham, No. 7."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you had many charges for stealing the property of persons unknown? A.Never before; I have been a Policeman since February, 1830. and before that was in a tallowchandler's service for thirteen years; I was about twelve yards from the prisoner; I should think there were fifty persons between us - I could see very well what he was doing, as when the crowd crushed towards the barrier the mob was not pressed together, and being elevated I saw this; I was at least a foot from the ground, and saw over the heads of the people - the people passed from barrier to barrier, which opened at certain times; the prisoner was pointed out to me by a gentleman, as having attempted his pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was admitted to half? A. Certainly, and has surrendered to day - the paper was on a shelf in the shop; all of it, the whole marchant quires; there was none on the counter when I went in - the paper on the counter was of quite a different description; he keeps a respectable shop - the top of the paper was covered; the sides could be seen by any body.</p>

No, not on my oath; I have not told a lie about this - I said I was taking the paper to Williams', but I was not on my oath; I took the whole nineteen quires to the prisoner's at once, and was only once in his shop that day - I was not there so late as between eight and nine o'clock; I took no single quire there - I saw nobody in the shop but him; I never stole any thing before - my mother did not know it was stolen; I often took parcels<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200048"/>there - she saw the paper, but went down stairs directly after; she said nothing to me about it - the prisoner only asked if it was all right; he did not say he did not want any - he weighed it; I asked 2d. a lb., which he gave me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was no wrapper to it - the boy came, and asked if I wanted paper; I said not particularly - he said it would suit me, and said, "Master always sends me to sell it at 2d. a lb., when it is cut at the end, and not fit for our use;" there was a quire on the counter; when Jolly's son came I pointed it out to him - he said, "That is right, give it us all."</p>

            . I was in the prisoner's shop, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, when Finch came with the paper - there was no wrapper, except the outsides, but there was no Excise stamp, or any thing on it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Should you know the Excise-stamp? A. I think I should; I am not conversant with paper - the outside paper was like that produced; I was standing close by the parlour door, at the further end of the shop, and think he could not enter the shop without seeing me- there was nothing to draw his attention to me; I did not take sufficient notice to repeat what passed - I did not hear Harris ask him about his employer; it was not Mr. Harris that was in the shop - it was Mrs. Harris; Mr. Harris did not buy it - I believe I heard Mrs. Harris say afterwards, that he was gone out; I swear he was not in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.What sum was asked for it? A. I do not know - if there was any bargain it must have been between Mr. Harris and the lad; that is, it did not take place with Mrs. Harris - I should suppose there was a previous hargain, but Mr. Harris was absent when the lad brought the portion of paper which I saw; it was rolled up, and there was not so much as is now produced - this could not all have been brought at one time; I reside in the home, and leave at nine o'clock, to attend an office in the City - I did not closely examine the paper, but will swear there is more here than I saw brought; I looked at it on the boy's arm - this would make a bundle double the size; it was perfectly clean paper, as it is now, without any cover - Harris told me the quantity produced at the office, and I told several people that was not all brought at once, and Harris told me it was brought at different times on that day, a day or two after it happened.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it possible to roll up that paper as you saw it rolled under his arm? A. No.</p>

On Saturday afternoon, the 10th of September, I saw the prisoner at his house - he took some chairs out of the house, and put on a truck; he then took a bed on his back - the prosecutor's wife went after him, and told him to bear a hand, and come back for the rest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. At what time was this? A. Between six and seven o'clock; there were other things in the truck, but I did not see you put them in - I did not see the truck go away.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BLANCHARD re-examined. Q. Had you given any authority to the prisoner or your wife to remove these things? A. No, they were removed without my consent; the prisoner came to my house at twenty minutes before six o'clock that morning - my wife came down stairs, and let him in; I was in the coal-hole - my wife and the prisoner went into the front parlour; I heard her pull the window-blind down, and thought it was the prisoner shut the door, but I went up, and he was standing inside against the door, with his arm against it - I heard the rumpling of my wife's clothes - [the witness here detailed a conversation which he over heard between the prisoner and his wife, after which he deposed that he entered the room, and discovered them in the act of adultery] - I went to the fire-place, and took up the poker, but my hand being in a tremble it jinked on the fender, and they heard it; they had not heard me before - I struck at the prisoner with the poker, with the intention of striking them on the head and killing the pair of them, but in the room of hitting him on the bead it struck his shoulder, and he flew out of the room and locked me in, as the key was outside - I opened the window, and got out, but as the front door was fast, I could not get in that way; I then got in at the window again, knocked at the room door, and a man up stairs came down and let me out - my wife still remained in the room.</p>

            . I am a constable, and live in King-street, Lambeth-walk. I had known the prisoner previous to the 14th of June, and had made appointments with him, but none had been made for the 14th of June; on that day I went with Lawrence to the prisoner's lodgings, in Wentworth-street; I stood in front of the house, and called Jem - the prisoner put his head out of a window, and told me to come up stairs; Lawrence went up with me - there was a man and a woman in the room with the prisoner; the prisoner said, "If you had come ten minutes sooner, you would have found me making;" he then asked me what I wanted - I said a few bobs, meaning shillings; he said he had been just making fourteen for himself and his old woman, and I might have them if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200050"/>I liked - I said I would take five of them; I gave him one good shilling for them - I then handed them to Lawrence to look at; Haines said they were very good ones- Lawrence gave them to me again; we returned to the Archer's public-house - I there marked them, and gave them to Miers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Pray, what are you? A. A constable of Lambeth, and have been so upwards of six years; the prisoner did not know I was an officer - he lives three or four miles from our parish; the first time I had seen him was on the 13th of May - I had been in his company three or four times; I did not go to tempt him, but to detect him - I did not offer him money till I got the base coin of him; I went to buy coin - I am not regularly employed by the Mint; I am sanctioned by them - I expect to be paid, as a witness, for my loss of time, and no more; I have been the means, with others, of detecting several persons - I received about 1l. 8s., three years ago, for detecting two persons in Surrey; I never have been settled with but once by the Mint, and that is three years ago -I make a minute of the days I am employed; I cannot tell what the Mint owes me now, within a few pounds, without I had my books here - I have sometimes been employed day and night for them; I have only been at work for them since December, and not before for three years; I should think, take one thing with another, they now owe me 40l. or 50l. - I have not asked for it, because I know the Mint officers have been busy in going the circuits and other things, and I did not want; I do not know that I should be satisfied if they gave me 60l.; I think I should with 80l. - my wife is a laundress, and I attend to that; I have been on board a man-of-war.</p>

            . I am a fishmonger, and live at Lambeth - Gollocker is a neighbour. I went with him to the ARchers public-house, in Wentworth-street - Gollocker went down the street, to the house where the prisoner lodged - he called out Jem! the prisoner put his head out and said, "Come up;" he went up, and I followed him - the prisoner said, "Is it all right?" Gollocker said,"It is;" the prisoner said, "If you had come ten minutes sooner, you would have caught me making;" he said he had been making fourteen, and he might have them if he pleased - Gollocker said he would take five, and he gave him five; he gave him one shilling for them - we then went to the Archers, and I saw the money given to Myers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you repeated exactly the words that passed between Gollocker and the prisoner? A. As near as I can recollect; he said he and his old woman had put off fourteen on the Saturday previous, and if Gollcker pleased he might have them all - he then gave Gollocker five shillings - Gollocker said, "I do not want the whole, I only want five shillings," and he tendered him a good shilling for the five - sometimes they call shillings bobs; I cannot say whether Gollocker said bobs or shillings - I have only given evidence in three different cases; there were five cases, but there were three at once, at Maidstone - there was one in the Old Court last Session; I have given orders for counterfeit coin three times, not oftener.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear, last Session, in the case of Bagley, "I have not given more than six or seven orders for counterfeit coin?" A. No, I did not swear any thing about how many times; I believe it is not more than five times - I never had a halfpenny for these jobs; I work for my living daily, and am selling fish at my shop - Gollocker employed me in this business; I do not make a stipulation for what I am to have, but I make a rule of losing very little time - I keep a book; I leave it entirely to Mr. Gollocker; I could not tell how many days I have been employed in the last six months, without looking over Mr. Gollocker's book; I do not suppose I have been half fifty days - I should be satisfied if the Mint pay me 5l.; I never got any money from Gollocker - I think my account begins on the 9th of June; Myers paid my expences to Maidstone - I may have been five times with him, buying counterfeit coin.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were you with Lawrence at the Spring Assizes, at Maidstone? A. It was the last Assizes- I will not swear that I did not say, at the last Session, that it was the Spring Assizes; I cannot swear, within 50l., how much I have received, within the last two years, from the Mint - I was not asked to bring my books; I said if you wanted them I would bring them; for what I have done, within the last twelve months, I should not be satisfied with twenty guineas, nor with fifty, without I had my books here - I have been employed for them about ten years; I cannot tell how many times; I have been examined for the Mint, and for other cases; I was an officer.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Perkins a convict? A. I understand he had been convicted, but I do not know it - he had not been paid by me, but he had given us information, and sometimes had a shilling or two.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then Cooper never denied that he had chopped up some? A. NO.</p>

            . I am a master-builder. Cooper, Cutler, and Green were in my employ - I had to take down and rebuild those premises, using the old materials as well as I could; the men are not to cut up the materials, but to use them again - this piece is an architrave, that goes round a door or a window, and being cut, it is now useless; when I went to Snelling's, he said he considered he had given the value for it - that he had given 3l. or 4l. in liquor or beer - it was brought in in the day time, and he thought it was all right; he showed it very readily, and in a yard I saw my own baskets, with wood in them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Mr. Snelling went to the Police-office, I believe, expecting to be called as a witness? A. I did not tell him to go - I gave the others in charge, but not him; when I saw he was to be committed I asked the Magistrate if he might be admitted to bail, as I felt for him.</p>
               <p>Cooper's Defence. It is impossible that three loads of wood could go from there; I am compelled to use an axe and a saw, as a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Cutler's Defence. The time that the officer saw me look out was when some carts came to take away some rubbish, and I called two or three of the men to load them.</p>
               <p>The prisoners all received a good character.</p>

When the prosecutrix came in she sat down under the window - I was sitting with the child in my lap; the prosecutrix said, "My husband has given me 2s., and they have got my bacon and the keys of my room;" I said I had some money, which I had been obliged to sew in my gown, and when she heard that she knocked against the door, and said I had robbed her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. There was an Irishman in the watch-house, and he said if I did not take off the stockings he would give me a good thumping all round; the stockings were wet, and he said, "Put on him my dry ones." Witness. There was a pair of stockings there, but they were much worse than mine.</p>

On the 3rd of October, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me, and asked what time they opened the coal shed next door; I said exactly at seven o'clock - she said by husband lodged there, and asked if she might sit down at my place till it was open; I let her come into my room - I went out for a short time: when I returned I missed a shirt and two combs - I taxed her with having them; she utterly denied it, with many oaths and imprecations, and called me all the old husseys she could; I offered to search her, but she pushed me away - I sent for the officer, and he took her to the station; a door or two before we got there she dropped the shirt from under her petticonts - this is it; I had not known her before.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. The prosecutrix sent for me, and I found the prisoner there, accused of stealing a shirt and two combs - she denied it; I took her to the station-house, and as we were going along I saw her put her hand into her pocket-hole, and I directed the prosecutrix to keep watch - I saw her drop this shirt, and when she had been a short time at the station I found these two combs behind her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The property is my husband's, and the prosecutrix washes for him; the people at the next house are the means of keeping me from him - he ill-uses me, and says if he cannot transport me he will get some other person to do it.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR DEATON. I do not wash for her husband - this shirt belongs to a man named John Johnson, a navigator.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I asked her to go to my husband, and ask him for a trifle; he has kept me in prison two months; I did not take it to steal it - I asked the Policeman who first came to search me, but he would not take me; he fetched this man because he knows my husband.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I went to the prosecutor's house last Monday morning, about seven o'clock - I was in pursuit of another person as well as the prisoner; I went to the prisoner's house, which is a cottage with one room, in Nova Scotia-gardens, Crabtree-rew, Bethnal-green - I got there about halfpast seven o'clock in the morning; I found a woman there, who was said to be Mrs. Stocks - I found under the bedstead, these nine staves, and these six pieces of wood; the two staves which have been identified were among them - a person mamed Grubb was taken, and the prisoner came down to the office, and I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.There was only one room? A. No; there was no other convenient place to put the wood- some part of these appear to have been out; it might have made legs of bedsteads, perhaps, but I do not know- I never saw oak bedsteads; the prisoner was not at his house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Grubb asked me to make him a bedstead - he said he could find stuff; I said I would at my leisure time - he said he was in no hurry; I said he might take the stuff to my house at any time, and if my wife was not in the way, he might lay it down on the premises; he brought this wood at twice - I did not know it belonged to my master; I thought it was his own - when my wife said they had been and taken it, I was astonished, and went to the office.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. ROSLING. Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of handling any of these staves? A. That laid more with the foreman than myself - he was jobbing about, and had access to them; there were twenty thousand staves there sometimes.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARDSON. He sometimes had to remove staves from one part to another - he was an odd man, doing anything; wood in this shape is used almost exclusively by coopers - some part might be convered into a bedstead; Grubb had no right to take it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 20th of October, in consequence of information, I went with Vann to the prosecutor's premises, about seven o'clock in the morning - I saw Grubb in a cart; he drove it down Crabtree-walk, from Cambridge-heath way; Grubb stopped the cart, got out, took these six staves now produced, on his shoulder, carried them down a passage, through a garden, and from there to Stocks' house, but he did not go into the house - I went up to him, and said, "What have you got there?" he said some wood which he had brought to Stocks', and at the same time he pitched it, and said, "Mrs. Stocks, I have brought some wood for you;" when I had handcuffed him, he said he was all right, that the wood was bought by Stocks, and he had brought it there - these are the stares.</p>
               <p>Grubb's Defence. He asked me how I came by the staves, and I said that Stocks bought them of master; I used to have staves from the docks, and they sometimes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200058"/>gave me more than my tally, and I put them in the bayloft - Stocks was going to make a bedstead, and he said I might take them there any time I liked.</p>

             - I became acquainted with the prisoner, slightly, about a fortnight after I came to this country; I was courting his sister, and do so now. On a Monday morning, about eight o'clock, I met the prisoner in the neighbourhood, and went with him up the street to Whitechapel; we went into a public-house, and there had two quarterns of gin together- we then went back to the prisoner's lodging: before we got there he asked me if I had my notes about me, and asked why I did not change them, as I could get English money for them; I said that at present I was not in need of money, and thought of saving them a little longer - I had them in my pocket at the time; they were two Amsterdam notes, for three hundred and two hundred guilders- he asked me to come home, and I went to his lodgings in <placeName id="t18311020-149-crimeloc799">Gulston-street, Whitechapel</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the prisoner against your marrying his sister? A. I do not know - I have three names in Holland, but since I have been in England I have only been called Michael Hart, and here is my hawker's licence in that name; I was so stunned with fright I could not follow the prisoner down stairs - I am sure I did not give him the notes to change - he took them out of my hand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did he say when you asked him about the notes? A. I asked him for my money - he said nothing, but that he had been badly handled.</p>

I was in the prisoner's room when he and the prosecutor came in, between eight and half-past eight o'clock in the morning - they spoke in Hebrew, which I understood, but did not notice what they were talking about; I saw Hart open his pocket-book, and take out some papers - the prisoner snatched them out of his hand, gave him a push, and ran down stairs; I could not see what the papers were, but Hart called out in Hebrew,"I have lost five hundred guilders;" I had seen him in possession of a three hundred and two hundred guilders Amsterdam notes; I have not seen them since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who was in the room? A. My wife, the prisoner's wife, his sister, and children: he being an intended brother-in-law, I did not like to interfere - I did not call Stop thief! my wife was alarmed - the prosecutor was standing up; he could have followed him down stairs if he chose - I had merely called there because the children were ill with the measles; I saw two men carrying the prisoner home, drunk, about two o'clock; the prosecutor went to Brighton, and my son went with him as an interpreter, and I wrote to him, directing my letters "Lewis Cohen," which was my son's name - the prisoner was to inquire at the post-office for a letter in that name; my wife is too ill to be here.</p>

I was at the station-house on Monday, the 19th, when the prisoner was brought there by Walton - he appeared to have been drinking, but was capable of knowing what he was doing and saying; the prosecutor brought an interpreter, and as they were all Jews I asked the prisoner if he understood what the interpreter was saying; he said Yes, he understood every thing, but knew nothing about it, nor had he ever seen the notes; I am positive of that; I was before the Justice next morning - what he said was taken down by the Magistrate.</p>

I prevented his throwing it out - he made no answer, but laid hold of the bed; I laid hold of it, and said, "Rick, are you mad?" he said,"D - n my bl - y eyes, I will heave out every hit in the place - I will smash them all;" I prevented his throwing the bed out - his wife then came into the room, and exclaimed, "My child, my child!" the bed was then at the foot of the bedstead, on the floor - the prisoner made an attempt to strike her; I prevented him, and stamped my foot, thinking the child must be under the bed, smothered - I said, "D - n you, pick the child up;" she turned over the bed two or three times, but did not find it, and then she screamed out, "My child is thrown out of window;" the prisoner was present - he made no reply that I heard; she directly ran down stairs, and I after her with a light - I saw her pick up the child; she said it was dead - it did not cry then; two Policemen came up - I gave one of them the light, and he went up stairs; I saw the child after it came from the doctor's - its head was grazed and swollen, but there was no blood; I thought the prisoner very much in liquor.</p>

The child was brought to me by the mother and two Policemen - I examined it, and found a very large tumor on the head, and a fracture of the skull - this unquestionably caused its death; I ordered leeches, as the only resource, but entertained no idea that it would be of benefit - I have not a doubt that it died of the fracture on the head.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not pass close by him at twelve o'clock that very day? A. I did not - I have not asked any body what kind of a person he was - he had blue trousers and a blue coat on; I had no quarrel with him that night; he did not throw a piece of tobacco-pipe at me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you succeed in getting him in? A. I got him in about two o'clock, and it was near half-past two when I came out, leaving him dreadfully intoxicated - he had not any sense in him.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On Thursday, the 29th of September, I received information respecting the prisoner - I went next day, and found her at her own house, in London-terrace, Commercial-road - she keeps a house of ill-fame; I took her into custody - she asked what it was for; I told her for some shoes which she had pawned, and asked where she had got them - she said she did not steal them, but a young man named James Rankin had shirked them, and that he gave them to her to dispose of - I asked where she had pawned them; she said she pawned one pair at Williams', Cable-street, Wellclose-square - that she took them herself; I asked if she sent young Stubbs to pawn a pair - she said she did; I asked how much he got for them - she said 2s. 6d., and that they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200062"/>were pawned at Hale's, late Anderton, Commercial-road; I asked where the remainder of them were; she said she did not know - I did not mention how many pairs had been lost till afterwards; I went with her to Williams', who produced a pair, but said he was not present when they were pawned - she told him she had pawned them herself, and what they were pawned for, and described them; I took her to the station, and asked if she knew about any more - she said there were four pairs stolen, she knew, but she knew nothing of more than two pairs; I have one pair, which I got from Laws, and another from Nock.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM STUBBS. I am going on for fourteen years old. On Wednesday, the 28th of September, the prisoner sent me to pawn a pair of shoes, and said she would give me a halfpenny - she told me to take them to Anderton's, to ask 3s., and not take less than 2s. 6d.; I received 2s. 6d. for them, took her the money, and got her change for the half-crown - I was with her at the top of Morgan-street, when a young man named Joseph Sheplierd came and asked her how much I had got for them - she said 2s. 6d.; he said,"How much did he ask?" she said 3s.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Have you brought your books here? A. Yes; I am a diamond merchant - I think I have been about three years and a half in the wadding business; Middleton had been with me the whole time - he was never in partnership with me, and I never said so to any one; I could not say it; a gentleman named Day and his lady called on me - I never told them that he was my partner; he, at first, had a guinea a week as wages, then 25s., and, from the 2nd of May last, he has had 30s. - there is an entry in my book of the bulk of the wages of the whole of my servants - he used to put it down on a state; I sent him the money - he paid the men, and took his own wages week by week; I never told him he should have half the profits, nor that if the trade made a crown he should have half of it - I have lived in White-street, and in Wentworth-street, before I went to George-street; I had the misfortune to be burnt out of two places - my landlord warned me out of two places - this machine had been standing unemployed below for six or eight months; it could not be brought into work - there was no carding on it; it was merely the wood work; I had not mentioned any wish to sell it - we could, at any time, bring it into work- it is very large, and would weigh 14cwt. or 15cwt.: my clerk entered it in the book, on the 19th of July, as if it had been sold; it was not to his account, but to mine - here is the entry of it in this book; I have a wages-book in which the wages of each man is entered; I have sometimes eighteen or twenty men at work in the factory, but at that time there was but little work, and I probably had not more than two boys and a man; I used to see the book from time to time, but I was not there regularly; I have not probably gone there for a month or five weeks; I have seen that the entries were made from week to week - Middleton bought and sold what was wanted; here is the entry of the machine to Snape at 3l. 10s.; it was put down on the 19th of July, in Burrell's hand-writing- it is carried into my journal; I sent for Middleton, and took him up - I took Stultz and

             the next day; I preferred a bill at the September Session - the Grand Jury threw it out; I was examined as a witness, and so was Burrell and Leonard; but Snape, the principal witness, was kept out of the way - I have every reason to suppose so; I can swear he had removed, and no one could tell where he was gone - when the bill was thrown out I did not make any application to the prisoners to forgive me for what was past, and say I would take no further notice about it - I went before the Grand Jury again the next day, with the same witnesses and the same charge; Snape<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200066"/>was not found - I never said that it was not the value of the machine I cared about; that it might be removed over and over again, for what I cared, but I felt sore at Stultz taking the concern to my prejudice - he had set up business in Spicer-street, five hundred yards or half a mile from my place; it appeared that Jones had gone to work for him, as I found him there - Jones had worked for me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.Had your attention been called to the entry before the 1st of August? A. No; I had not attended there.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who are Mr. and Mrs. Day? A. I do not know, except that they called at my house one Saturday, and asked about Middleton; it appeared that Middleton had gone into the country for the purpose of marrying Mr. Day's daughter; they said he had represented to them that he was carrying on an extensive business in the wadding-manufactory, and they thought it adviseable to come to me - I said he was a trust-worthy servant, and I had every confidence in him, but he had not one shilling except what he received from me; if they thought proper to give their daughter to him, and she had any fortune, I would give up the business to him, as I was tired of it - that was all that passed; I think that must have been in the month of June - the conversation, between me and Middleton, took place on the 18th of July; it was stated he had sold the machine six weeks prior to that - he had no authority whatever to deal with any machinery or plant of mine, without my direction - it was his constant course to sell the wadding, to attend the factory, to make the wadding, and give account of it; here is no entry of the sale of the fly-wheel, or tub, or carding - they are quite distinct from the machine; the fires, at my former premises, were accidental - our premises are not insurable.</p>

            . I was, in June last, in the service of the prosecutor. I remember the carding-engine being in the cellar - it was removed six or seven weeks previous to the prisoners' being taken; I helped to put it into the truck, by direction of Middleton - Snape was there, and assisted; I did not go with the truck. On the 4th of August I went to Mr. Stultz's premises - I saw the machine and the fly-wheel; they were the same as had been at the factory, but as to the carding it is impossible to say - sixteen or seventeen sheets of carding had been missed from the factory about three weeks before; they are about two feet and a half in length, and sixteen inches wide - there was only a piece here and there found on the machine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.What time in the day did you remove this? A.About two o'clock in the day; I did not see Burrell there - there were five or six of us present; I did not tell my master of it - Mr. Snape and Jones were there; a lad named Conner, and another named Miller - we were not desired to keep it secret; the machine could not be used without the fly-wheel and trough; there was some old carding on the machine when it went - I received 12s. a week, and there might be seven or eight at the factory in July, receiving wages- Middleton paid us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Were you in the service of the prosecutor, when he removed from one place to another? A. Yes; I do not know whether Snape was employed to remove his articles then - Middleton lived on the premises, and used to pay the men; Mr. Mellingen came every morning to the factory -Borrell kept the books.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean you saw Mr. Mellingen every morning? A.Sometimes he might miss a morning or two, or a week.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Mellingen. About the middle of July I had some conversation with him about a carding-machine - I had not then missed it; I went to Middleton, and told him that Mr. Mellingen had been inquiring of me about the sale of a carding-machine, and if it was sold it had not come to my knowledge - he took no notice, but turned round, and walked out; I went into the cellar, and missed the machine - I spoke to Middleton again in a day or two, in the counting-house; I said, "That machine is gone, and you have not made me acquainted with it;" he said the reason was that he had not got settled with for it - it would have been his duty to have mentioned the sale of it to me whether it had been paid for or not; on the 19th of July, which was after the conversation, I entered it in this day-book, by the direction of Middleton, "One carding-machine, sold for cash to 
               <persName id="t18311020-166-person1150">W. </persName>
            Snape, 3l. 10s.;" Middleton is charged with it by this entry - I went to Stultz, and saw the machine on the 1st of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you and your wife reside on these premises? A. Yes, in a dwelling-house behind the factory; I cannot tell how many men were employed on the premises - there is a wages-book of the men who are employed, but that is at the factory; the wages are entered here in a lump - here is a running account with Middleton in this book; on this page it appears he had a balance of 1l. 11s. 6d. in his hands - he had always paid the men their wages, and perhaps did not like his name to appear; Mr. Mellingen is my master, but I call many a man my master - I may have called Middleton so in a joke; I swear I never considered him my master, and he never was so - I do not recollect whether I have ever called him so; Mr. Mellingen sometimes came every morning, and sometimes not for a week - he was very uncertain; I have known him stay away longer than a week - in July, to the best of my recollection, he made it his business to come every morning; I do not think I ever knew him to stay away a month or six weeks together - he might stay two or three days, or a week; it was my duty to go out to travel - Middleton did not go away till August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you make the entry on the 19th of July? A. Yes, and I told Mr. Mellingen of it, I believe, the next day - I do not recollect that Middleton knew I had told Mr. Mellingen of it; I kept the books, by Mr. Mellingen's direction - here is one of them, marked at the edge

            Mellingen; I have made out bills of parcels in the name of Middleton - I cannot say how many; it was done by Middleton's direction- I thought it my duty to tell Mr. Mellingon; I said,"Do you know, Sir, there are bills of parcels going out in the name of Middleton?" he said, "Very well, it is all right, I gave direction so while this business of Owen's is in litigation."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long did you continue issuing bills of parcels in the name of Middleton, when, as you repre<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200067"/>sent, he was not a partner? A. I cannot say; they were in the name of Middleton only.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MR. MELLINGEN. Q.Can you explain the statement of the last witness? A. In consequence of an indictment against two persons, named Owen and Riley, who were in my employ, of which they were convicted, for a conspiracy to defraud me of about 1200l., and as Owen had been to my customers and received money which I sent for again, the customers would not purchase any more goods from the factory, as they said they did not know what they were about, and I directed Middleton to send what goods did go out in his name.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How came you to keep Middleton in your employ after what you found out? A I was told if I let it rest a few days, I should find out such things as would astonish me.</p>

            . I am a machine-maker. In the latter end of June, or the beginning of July, Middleton gave me a carding-machine to repair, for which I was to have 5l.; I saw it in Mr. Mellingen's cellar, and it was removed from there to my house, by Middleton's directions; in about three weeks after I received from Middleton some carding- I cannot tell how much, it was about forty or fifty feet; I cannot say where he took the carding from, but I was to put it on the machine - Middleton told me he should book the machine to me, as if I had bought it, for 3l. 10s., but I am quite sure he gave it me to repair; I was to have 5l. for it - I did not buy it at all - I repaired it, and put the carding on it which I got from Middleton, and he then directed me to take it to Stultz's premises, which I did - I remember Stultz being apprehended, but I cannot tell the day; Stultz came by my house the day he was apprehended - I do not recollect his saying any thing to me that day about the machine; Middleton paid me for repairing the machine, to the value of 5l., as I asked for it - I do not recollect having any conversation with Stultz about this machine after his apprehension.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had you any conversation with Stultz about the price of this machine? A. There was something, but I do not recollect what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Be careful - did he say any thing about the machine? A. I do not recollect what he said - I do not know what passed; he might mention the machine - I think there was something he said, that I was to say he bought it of me for 10l. - he had not bought it, nor given me any money.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it after the machine had been removed that Middleton told you it was to be booked? A. Yes, three weeks after; I said it made no difference - I had paid nothing, but was to have 5l. for repairing it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Have you always given the same account of it? A. I believe so - the purse was made of linen; I never said it was made of leather - it was about eleven o'clock at night; I never swore it was nine - I said I did not know the time, as there was no clock; the prisoner was taken facing the door of the General Elliott - the landlady was in the bar, but the passage is but narrow, and I turned my side to the bar to drink the beer; she was perhaps two yards from the prisoner - she did not say, in my hearing, that he was not the man; I was perfetly sober.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. The prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him of a purse and some money; I took him to the station - I was surrounded by three women, and thrown down with the prisoner in my hand; we were all down together - in going along the prisoner said he would be d - d if it was him that robbed him, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were you on the spot? A. I was passing by; I took the prisoner ten or twelve yards from the house - I cannot say that the prosecutor said before the Magistrate, that he had seen the prisoner give his purse to a woman, but he said so after he came out of the office; the office was so crowded, I did not hear what he said there.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prosecutor sober? A.He had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200068"/>been drinking, but knew what he was about; I did not hear any of the women call the prisoner by name, but he lives with one of them named Dockerty.</p>

            . I am an officer. I passed the two prisoners in London-street - I then met the prosecutor; he was drunk; he said he had lost his watch - I looked, and his fob was cut off; he said it was two women, and described which way they had gone - I told him to come with me; I took the two prisoners, and one of them(but I cannot say which) threw down this watch and fob- I believe Watkins said they or she had been tempted to do it by a shipmate of his, who had been drinking with them; I found nothing on the prisoners, but the fob seems to have been cut - they said, "Don't hurt us;" I said, "It don't rest with me."(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the 22nd of September, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming along Holborn-hill, and saw the prisoner and another boy following two gentlemen, who turned into Furnival's Inn; they then followed two other gentlemen, and when they got to Turnstile, the prisoner took this handkerchief from one of the gentlemen's pockets, and put it into his breast - I seized him, and dragged him some distance; I left him in custody, and went for the gentleman, who came and gave his card; he attended at Bow-street, and identified his property; but he is now gone to Paris - his name is Dr. John Murray, and his initials are on the handkerchief.</p>

I was sent for, and went up to the prisoners' apartment - an old man, who I believe is McKelvin's father, was in the same room; there was only one bed in that room - when I went in I met Cox; she went up stairs - Dyer charged her and Barry with it; I took Barry to the station - I afterwards returned, and found McKelvin laying down in the back room - Dyer gave charge of her; she pretended to be asleep - Johnson said, "Mr. Dyer you had better look for your hams;" McKelvin immediately made a blow at him with the hammer, which fell from her hand - Dyer afterwards produced some suet, which I fitted to the beef, and am convinced it belonged to it; when Mrs. Johnson came into the station-house, McKelvin strock her - I heard Barry say it served her right.</p>

            . I occupy the same room as the prisoners. I opened the door, when Dyer came, and he gave me in charge - I said I was not the girl, and was discharged - I was asleep in the room at the time - I heard a great scuffle, and got up; I saw McKelvin out on the tiles, and Barry in the room; McKelvin chucked the meat into the room- I did not see Johnson struck; I saw him take a hammer out of McKelvin's hand - he showed me his forehead, which appeared hurt.</p>
               <p>Barry's Defence. I went to have a pint of beer, and met the female prisoner - I went to see her home at one o'clock; it was too late to go home, and I remained there; I was awake, got up, and saw her on the tiles - I never made use of the words they state; it was her father, who was at the window, when I awoke.</p>
               <p>McKelvin's Defence. My father lives at this place -I met Barry, and was much intoxicated; he came to see me home, and threw himself on the bed - I was undressing- my father got up, and asked me a question; I answered him very sancy - he swore he would kill me, and I jumped out on the tiles; he dragged me in by my hair - the meat was found in an unoccupied house - it was very dark, and rained; this woman could not have seen me - some young men in the yard used to throw us pieces of pudding and fat, and in that way the suet must have got there; I struck<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200078"/>Johnson because I was naked, and he thrust his hand into my bosom.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Alders, a pawnbroker, in Berwick-street. I have a plough, pawned by the prisoner on the 1st of October, and an adze, pawned, I believe, by him on the 27th of September - they are both in the same name and same address.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sitting in a coffee-shop - a person came in, dressed like a carpenter, and asked if I had any thing to do; I said No - he took me to the pawnbroker's, and told me to pawn this plough for 3s.; I asked him why he did not like to go in with it himself - he said he had pawned something there just before, he showed me the duplicate, and told me to put it in the same name; three days afterwards he sent me to the same place with a rule, and I was stopped.</p>

            . I live in Bull-court, Aldgate, and deal in clothes. On the 19th of October the prisoner came after me in Holborn, and said, "Will you buy this coat?" I turned round, and said, "I am sure you don't want to sell that coat;" he said Yes he did - I looked at it, and it was full of moth holes in the back; I said, "What do you ask for it?" he said 8s.; I said, "How did you come by it?" he said, "It is my own;" I said, "It is too large for you;" a boy came up, took hold of him, and said he had stolen it- I said, "Hold him fast - where does your father live?" he said in Dean-street; I took the coat up in my arms, and said, "Go, you don't;" I ran to Dean-street - the prosecutor stood at the door, and I took him to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>RICHARD JOHNSON re-examined. Q. Where had you your conversation with the prisoner? A. In the back parlour of the house where the saw was; Fletcher was not in that room, to my knowledge - I used the saw about half-past three o'clock, and did not see it afterwards; the prisoner was there after that.</p>

            . I live with my father, in Calmell-buildings. I was in the buildings, and the prisoner came and said he had a cap, which he put into his pocket; he then gave it me to mind for him - I took it to Mrs. Sarsfield, and left it with her; the prisoner afterwards asked me for it, and I took him to Sarsfield's - she asked him the price of it; he said 2s., and she bought it for 1s. 6d.</p>
