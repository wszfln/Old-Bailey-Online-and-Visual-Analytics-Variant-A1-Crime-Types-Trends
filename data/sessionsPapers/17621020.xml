The two prisoners at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176210200003"/> bar were standing by the side of the street. They called us to come in to the house. Dempsey is the mistress of the house. They said we should have a good fire to dry ourselves. We went in and sat down by the fire, and called for some beer to drink. They told me, I had better stay and sleep there all night. Walker went to bed along with me. At going to-bed she took my buckles and put them under the pillow, and my watch and sleeve buttons into a little paper bag over the head of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this with your consent?</p>
               <p>Ferdinand. It was. I took them out and delivered them to her to take care of them for me while I slept. I waked in the middle of the night, and found no girl, no watch, no buckles, no nothing at all. The door was shut and locked when I went to sleep; Dempsey locked it. I broke the door because it was locked. I made a noise, and Dempsey came with the key. I asked for the girl, and said I had lost my watch and things. After that, I went to sleep again, as I could get no candle. The mistress told me, she knew nothing of the girl.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your messmates?</p>
               <p>Ferdinand. They went away after I was in bed. I never found my things since.</p>

            . I was with the prosecutor when the two prisoners called us in. I cannot tell the day; I believe it is about five weeks ago. We went in, and sent for some beer. Walker told the prosecutor he had better stay in the house along with her all night. He went to-bed with her; I saw them in bed together. I saw her have his buckles, and put them under his pillow, and put the watch and buttons, which he took out of his sleeves, in a paper bag at the head of the bed. I shook hands with him after he was in bed, and bid him a good night, and went away. When I went away I left Dempsey sitting on the bed-side by them. The next morning I went to the same house to him, and found he had lost the things mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner Walker?</p>
               <p>Crocket. No; she was then in Newgate: she had a husband or a man that she kept there, and was gone to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give the watch and things to Walker, or how did she come by them?</p>
               <p>Crocket. He delivered them to her, for her to take care of them for him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I had a warrant from Justice Berry to take up the prisoners for stealing the things mentioned to in the indictment. I went to Dempsey's house, and asked for Walker. Dempsey said she did not know. I carried Dempsey to Justice Berry; he ordered me to lock her up in the watch house: this was the Saturday, the day after this thing happened. Then I went after Walker; there came a man to me, and told me, she was gone to Newgate. I went and found her there: she swore a great oath, and said, I thought what it was for when the turnkey called me down. She asked where the man was. I then had only said I had a warrant against her; I had not said what it was for: after this, I said it was for taking a man's watch and buckles. I said, if you will tell where the things are you shall not be hurt. She said, if I would carry her to

I went and took him, and brought him to my house. He said, he had left eight-pence on the board for his tea when he went away.

            . I was in the palace-court at the time. We were talking about Lutwicke that was taken some time ago, who broke out of prison. A person said, here are many of the family-men here, they do not seem to do any business. I said I would observe them. Just as the prince's coach came, I saw them hustle Mr. Planch up against a place, and saw Turner's hand under Mr. Planch's waistcoat; after which I said to him, have you lost any thing? He said, Yes, I have lost my watch. The prisoner was then making off; we took him and Turner, and searched them, but found nothing upon them.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is Turner?</p>
               <p>James. He is bail'd out. I observed the prisoner at the right-hand of Planch, and Turner at his left.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to them?</p>
               <p>James. I was within two yards of them, and nobody between us. They were on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in the prisoner's or Turner's hands?</p>
               <p>James. No; I did not. I observed they endeavoured to slip away. This was all done in a minute's time.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Fisher, a cutler in Leicester-fields. On the 29th of August I went to see the royal family go to church. The duke<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176210200006"/> York's coach came up. I was with the croud to see it. Mr. Planch was at my back; he called out he had lost his watch; some men were laid hold on; one of them took out his handkerchief, and said, earch me; I have got no watch. I put my hand into my pocket to see that I had not lost my handkerchief, and felt a lump in it. I had my wife with me, and my child in my arms. I said to her, They have put the watch into my pocket; let us go home. I went and asked advice what to do in it, and the nextday I advertised it. [He produced the paper in which it was advertised. The watch produced in court.]</p>
               <p>Q. to Planch. Look at this watch. [He takes it in his hand.]</p>
               <p>Planch. This is the watch I was robbed of; it is Mr. Hart's property.</p>

               <p>Macloclane. No; I did not, only to my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not?</p>
               <p>Macloclane. Because I was a stranger, and was affrighted, and did not know but I might be used ill by the people.</p>

On the 1st of September I had some shirts tied up in a handkerchief, and on the 2d, my servant going up stairs, came down again, and said a quantity of my linen was gone. I recollected that the day before in the afternoon, between three and four o'clock, I saw a man come out of my house, as I was standing over the way, discoursing with a neighbour about some business, and the man's foot took the step of the door, and he tumbled into the street. I did not know him at that time; he had a bundle in his hand tied up with one of my handkerchiefs, a very remarkable one; I immediately knew that: it was a white handkerchief, with a single stripe of crimson wove in it; it was a French handkerchief: I imagined it had been somebody that the washerwoman had sent for the linen. He went away with the bundle. The next day, or day after, I advertised the things. There were seven shirts, that handkerchief, and a pair of leather breeches missing. By virtue of the advertisement, a person came and informed me of having seen such a man as I saw with the bundle, go into the prisoner Barber's house with such a bundle. I got a search warrant, and found five of my shirts. The officer went with me. I found four of them at the house of one Parker, and one at the house of one Wells, and the officer took Barber to the Counter. About a week after the prisoner Dixon was taken [The shirts produced in court, and deposed to, marked M. H.]</p>

            . I live next door to Mrs. Barber. I saw Dixon bring some linen in a handkerchief, such as described, about ten o'clock in the forenoon, on the 2d of September. There was a sleeve standing up in the parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a shop does Barber keep?</p>
               <p>J. Munrow. She keeps an old cloaths shop. He went into the shop, and I saw them go backwards to a little parlour, and the window curtains to the parlour were drawn. I saw the prisoner go out again without the bundle, and Mrs. Barber come to the door. He came again on the 3d. with another bundle: I saw them but slightly. He went out without them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you near enough to know what passed between them?</p>
               <p>J. Munrow. No; I was not. I saw him again on Saturday the 4th. He carried away the handkerchief, with one of the shirts in it; and Mrs. Barber was gone out to a house near; she was called back again. The handkerchief was not 'tied; the shirt lay loose in it, and he held it by the corners. Her daughter that forenoon had seen the advertisement. I went to her for the paper; she took it up, and followed me out, and said, What a sad thing this is for my mamma to buy these things this gentleman's linen, part of it is in the house now. She said, some of it was carried to Mr. Parker's, and some to Mr. Wells's.</p>
               <p>Q. What are Parker and Wells?</p>
               <p>J. Munrow. Parker is a butcher, and lives going into the Minories, by Rosemary-lane. Wells is a butcher, and his wife deals in the millinery way. I went and gave the gentleman information of what I had seen.</p>

            . I am a butcher; I live near Little Tower Hill. My wife bought four shirts of the prisoner Barber, but I was not at home at the time. When they came with the search-warrant, they said they were informed my wife had bought four shirts very lately. I said, she had of Mrs. Barber. I delivered them to Mr. Hamilton. Then we all went up to Mrs. Barber's. They asked her, if she did not sell my wife some shirts? She said, yes, she sold her four. Mr. Hamilton said to her, You bought more than four of the man that brought them. She made use of some bitter oath, and said, she bought but four of him, and that the man looked like a gentleman's servant; that he said, his master was a captain in the army, and was killed in battle, and he had got his shirts to sell. Mr. Hamilton said, he had a strong suspicion some of the shirts were disposed of to some other butcher in the neighbourhood. She was taken up. Then we went to Mr. Wells's: I asked the girl if her mistress was at home? she said, no, I said, I am come to ask about some shirts your mistress bought of Mrs. Barber. The maid said, she bought but one of her. I went in the evening; then Mrs. Wells fetched down the shirt. She is here in court After this, I having had Dixon described to me, stopt him as he was coming by my door. He seemed to loiter, and had nothing to do. I tapt him on the shoulder, and said, I should be glad to ask him a question. I got him to sit down and eat a bit of beef, and sent my man up to tell Jane Munrow I believed I had the man in my house that brought; the things to Barber. She came: I asked her, if she knew that man? She said, yes, that is the man that had Mr. Hamilton's shirts. Then I sent for a constable, and took him up. He had a woman with him, whom he said was his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your wife give for the four shirts?</p>
               <p>Parker. She gave 26 s. for them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hamilton. What are your shirts worth?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. I suppose they are worth a guinea a piece. The cloth is worth 4 s. or 4 s. 0 d. per yard.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to be so particular as to the time?</p>
               <p>A. Clark. Because I was to be in town on the 18th day of the month; I came to Holyhead in the packet on the 1st of September, and travelled through all Wales to Chester, and reached that on the Monday by two o'clock, that was the 6th day of the month.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to remember this to be the man?</p>
               <p>A. Clark. Because he told me he was scanty of money, and he was lame and not able to walk; I left him behind; he came to me the day he came to London; I think that was the 15th or 16th day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he know where to find you?</p>
               <p>A. Clark. I told him he would find me at the Royal Exchange; I sell fruit there; and if he did not find me there, he would find me at the Horseshoe and Magpye in Plumbtree-court; I had lived there about two years ago: he told me he had lived in East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to six upon the 10th of September that you saw him at Coventry?</p>
               <p>A. Clark. I went in there at Mr. Kirkman's; he asked me to stay and work there; but I told him I must be in town on the 18th. I had worked there before.</p>

I was standing at my door when a man came (he was near six feet high) in ruffles, a gentleman's servant, his hair was tied behind; he cheapened a handkerchief of me, and asked me, if I bought any thing, and said, he had some shirts to sell; I said, if he would let me look at them, I would buy them if I could; he had them in a blue and white cheque handkerchief; he asked 30 s. at that time for four; I told him they were too good for my shop; but if they were his own property, I would give him a crown a-piece for them; he said, that was too little; I asked him how he came by them? he said, he appeared like a gentleman, why should I dispute him; I said, I should be very sorry to be brought into trouble; he told me, his master was killed, and he had made him a present of them, and he wanted some cheque shirts as he was going abroad: he took 20 s. for them. The next day he came again; I am out from nine till five or six in the evening; I cry things about the streets, and deal in what God sends me from pawnbrokers; he had a cheque shirt on when he came the last time; I gave him a crown for the shirt he brought; it was the only one brought then.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was the box?</p>
               <p>Cleive. That was at a cooper's in Hays's-court by Newport-market; the things mentioned in the indictment were all found in that box, and they are all my property. I have missed them since, though I did not before: When Powell was taken up, he owned that he had them of Parry; he said, Parry brought them there, and said they were his own; then the Justice sent for Parry, who was with the regiment at Northampton, who, when brought before him, in my hearing confessed to his taking them; he said, he was very sorry, and it was the first fact.</p>

               <p>Q. What is Powell?</p>
               <p>Cleive. He draw'd beer at a publick-house in Shugg-lane, and had lived next door to me at a public-house about four years ago, and knew that I carried on the trade of a cutler.</p>

I went to Kingston to the sister's mistress; she was called into the parlour; I asked her with respect to parcels sent her by her brother; and upon examination found she had got several things with our own marks upon them, which I can swear to, and several not marked, which I have great reason to believe are our own property.</p>

            . I was acquainted with Mr. Jeffery<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176210200012"/> Henvill, the person that appears to be the testator to this will. [Holding the will in question in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him write?</p>
               <p>Heusch. I have several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the name of Jeslery Henvill, is it his own hand writing?</p>

               <p>Heusch. I do not believe it is.</p>
               <p>Sparry. I object to his testimony. The time he came to me at Greenwich, he told me, he carried on the prosecution at his own expence. Pray, how far are you interested in this cause?</p>
               <p>Heusch. Not a halfpenny. I have no benefit whatsoever. I told him it was not carried on through anger to any party, but for the sake of justice. It has been a most intricate thing, and what I have had a great deal of trouble about, and what we found out by chance.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sparry. How much money have you given to Frankland your witness?</p>
               <p>Heusch. I never gave her a farthing, nor she has never had a farthing yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Farr any way related to Jeffery Henvill the deceased?</p>
               <p>Heusch. I have heard he married Mr. Henvill's daughter.</p>
               <p>Farr. I married his only child.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Farr live, when Henvill died?</p>
               <p>Heusch. I believe Farr then lived at Crookhorn in Somersetshire; the next post or post after Mr. Henvill's death. I sent down a letter to Mrs. Farr of my own hand-writing, signed by Mr. Brown, to let her know her father was dead, and inclosed I sent her a copy of the will; I believe this was about the 25th or 27th of November last, three or four days after the testator's death; he died on a Monday, and I believe I sent down on the Tuesday or Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner and his wife live together there?</p>
               <p>Heusch. They did; she sent word up, that her husband would soon be in town; he came up and called at Mr. Brown's house in Charles-street; and said, my father has not been so bad a man as the world took him to be. I said, I was sorry he has not done better by you: He said, he has made another will in my favour. I said, don't make things worse: He said, have you been served with any citations? I said, no. He said, then you will be, for there is another will in the Commons.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Heusch. This was on the 10th of December, the first time that I saw him after his father-in-law's death. Immediately after that, citations were served. It rested for some time, to, I believe, the 22d of last June. Mr. Bellas's clerk sent a person to our house to let us know, two witnesses had been in the commons and examined on the execution of this will. I I went to Mr. Bellas's to know who they were, which I found to be the prisoner Biddle and 
               <persName id="t17621020-18-person194">

            , and that the attorney concerned was Sparry. I found Frankland had been a servant to Sparry, but then resided with one

             in Blackfriars. Then I went to Mr. Bellas's to get his clerk to see Frankland, to know whether she was the same woman, that had been in the commons; he said, she was the very same person. After that, I and Mr. Hamlen went to Greenwich, and took Sparry in an alehouse, and brought him to town; it was very cold weather; we came up by water, and went to a tavern and dined. I do not now recollect whether it was in the boat or in the tavern, but he declared to us that very day, that Farr was taken by Oliver, who was going to carry him to the Marshalsea-prison, at the suit of Mountstephens, that then he should have given us notice that we might have taken him up, and he believed it to be a'bad affair, and if I would admit him a witness, he would give me all the assistance in his power; he said, Farr brought him a draught of an old man's will, (I will not be sure to the time when he said he brought it) and desired him to dictate a will to him for his father-in-law. That Farr told him, that the testator had an utter aversion to a lawyer making a will; and that he, at Farr's request, dictated a will, which Farr wrote; I think he said this was at the King's head in Broad St. Gile's, that after the will had been wrote by Farr at that house, he went with him to the next house, called the Robin-hood, at Farr's request, in Charles-street; that Farr desired him to wait there, while he went in to the testator his father-in-law, and upon Farr's not returning immediately, he went away; nor was he at the execution of the will; and that it was the same will that was produced in the commons. As we were in Guildhall-yard, just before we went before Mr. Alderman Blunt, I said to him, As you say you are innocent of this affair, I should be glad to know who wrote the will? He said, as Mr. Farr wrote the body of the will, you may easily guess who wrote the name; he likewise declared, he did intend to let us into the secret, and did send his brother once or twice to have given information; that he had a letter wrote by Mountstephens, which he said was either two or three sheets of paper, and Mountstephens had no concern in the affair, and desired to know if I had any thing against Mountstephens; I told him, I had not, and that instead of desiring Mountstephens to keep out of the way, I desired him to get him to come to me, that I might know what he had to say on that affair.</p>

               <p>Q. Is Mountstephens a witness?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176210200013"/>Heusch. No; he is not. I am informed he is a man that they have had a great deal of money of. I always had a good opinion of him, and believe he has been much imposed upon: he was afraid to come to me; he wrote a note to me by a woman for me to sign, which note Sparry declared he wrote for him; but I would not sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Sparry say before Mr. Alderman Blunt?</p>
               <p>Heusch. I believe he there acknowledged the will was a forgery. He likewise declared that he, Mr. Farr, and Mountstephens, went down into the country, in order to mortgage an estate which Farr had there, in order to carry on the suit; and that they did raise 300 l.; 150 l. in money, and 150 l. in a note payable in a month; and I think he said, he was to have had 100 guineas with Mr. Farr's son as a clerk. Mr. Hamelen was with us in all this conversation. I think he said Farr should say, he should get possession of this estate on the 6th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. from Farr. Did you never promise Frankland any money?</p>
               <p>Heusch. No; nor ever gave her a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. from Farr. Did you never hire any body to do it?</p>
               <p>Heusch. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from Farr. Did you not carry her in a coach to justice Fielding?</p>
               <p>Heusch. I did, as soon as she discovered this affair to me, in order to get an information; but, upon speaking to Sir John, he said I had better take her to my lord mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. from Farr. Did you not make her very drunk that day?</p>
               <p>Heusch. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you carry her before my lord mayor?</p>
               <p>Heusch. I carried her there the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. from Farr. Did she not always refuse coming into your terms?</p>
               <p>Heusch. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from Farr. Did you not keep her out three days from her lodgings?</p>
               <p>Heusch. No. My lord mayor's clerk was not in the way; one of the judge's tipstaffs had her some time in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. from Farr. Did you not threaten to hang her if she did not do as you bid her?</p>
               <p>Heusch. No; I did not. I said it was a bad thing; and she said she was totally ignorant, and was forced to put her mark to it: that she could neither write nor read, and she had 5 l. for doing it. When she was brought to me at Sam's coffee-house, I asked her, if she knew Mr. Henvill? She said she did. I said, what sized man was he? She said, he was a large man. I asked her, who was present when she put her mark to it? She said, Mr. Sparry and Mr. Biddle were. I said, was nobody else present? She said, no, sir. Then I observed she began to hesitate a little: I said, I believe you are ignorant of this affair; I apprehend you have been deceived in it. If it is fact, stick to it; and if it is not, I hope you will think of what you may meet with here and hereafter. Will you speak the truth? Then she said, I'll speak the truth. Then she said, she was sent for to a room where Farr was, by Sparry's instigation. He asked her, if she could write or read? She said, she could do neither. Said he, I have some money left me by my father-in-law, and you shall be rewarded; and she did it at his instigation; and after that, Sparry directed Farr to write,</p>
               <p>"This is the mark of Hannah</p>
               <p>"Frankland." And after that, she was sent for to an alehouse, called the Cock in the Corner, and there Biddle signed to the will.</p>
               <p>Q. from Farr. Do you know how she came by the cloaths she has now on?</p>
               <p>Heusch. She declared to me one day, she had a piece of stuff in pawn, and Sparry went with her and paid the money for her, and she went in it to Doctors Commons to see the will proved; and Sparry did acknowledge to me he paid Mr. Mountstephens for making it up into a gown.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sparry. Whether I did not say, when you came to me at Greenwich, you need not have a constable; I'll go with you quietly; let my brother go with me?</p>
               <p>Heusch. I appointed your brother to meet us at the King's Head, opposite Woodstreet Counter. We went there and had some dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sparry. Whether I did not say, the pretended forged will, before the alderman?</p>
               <p>Heusch. You said, the forged will. Sparry told me, he never saw the will after he left it in the house, till he saw it in the Commons, but it will appear to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sparry. Whether or not you did not hear me, at the time I was committed, say, Sir, I beg pardon; I see a scene of iniquity going forward, for we had three wills.</p>
               <p>Heusch. No; Sparry did not say any such thing. He told me, the first time he suspected it to be a forged will, was upon

               <p>Q. Did Sparry say, himself or Farr got her to set her hand to it?</p>

               <p>Q. Who is she?</p>
               <p>Heusch. She lived with the testator two or three years before his death, and kept his house.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he make his will?</p>
               <p>Huesch. He made it on the 28th of August 1751.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sparry. Whether you did not advise Mount stephens to move away?</p>
               <p>Heusch. I told him, I always had the best opinion of you in point of character: - I find you have been concerned in this affair; it is not proper you should live in the house of this woman. And advised him to take his goods away.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sparry. Where is he now?</p>
               <p>Heusch. I do not know. I used all the means I could by Mr. Oliver that he might exculpate himself in this affair; but I could never get him to come to me. I remember the testator told me, three days before he died, he had no other concern in life but to make provision for this woman,

               <p>Q. Where did he die?</p>
               <p>Heusch. He died in Charles-street, in his own house.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sparry. Whether he had not an utter aversion to a lawyer making his will.</p>
               <p>Heusch. As for that, he made a will two years before, and I was sole executor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a lawyer?</p>
               <p>Heusch. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sparry. Did not Hannah Frankland declare she saw the testator execute the will, and that Farr and Biddle were there?</p>
               <p>Heusch. She did; but after that she denied that she ever saw the testator, and that every word was put into her mouth by Sparry.</p>
               <p>Q. from Farr. Did you or any body, to your knowledge, promise her 100 guineas?</p>
               <p>Heusch. The woman never was promised a farthing, no otherwise than I told Mr. Hamlen, this woman has had a great deal of trouble, and I certainly will satisfy her for her trouble.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember what conversation you had with him?</p>
               <p>Hamlen. I do. After we took him we had him before a magistrate. The magistrate ordered us to take him to London: he was a little obstinate at first, and wanted to go home; but the constable said, he should go before a magistrate. We brought him from the magistrate's by water to London. Coming along, he said, he had no occasion to come to London to throw himself into our hands; that he had kept at Greenwich some time, and if we had sent to him he would have surrendered: and if we had not come down to day he intended to have surrendered himself; that he knew the will to be a forged thing himself, and that he dictated the will at a public house in St. Giles's and Farr wrote the will; he said, Mr. Farr said to him, I should be obliged to you if you will do this thing for me, because my father-in-law always said no lawyer should make his will; and that he dictated it, and Farr wrote it; then they went to the

            , and there, at Mr. Farr's request, he staid some time, in order for Farr's coming back to let him know whether his father-in-law was ready for him to come to be a witness to the will; finding him not coming immediately, he went away; he said several times, he was concerned for Mr. Farr in such an affair, and that Farr had such an estate left him by his father-in-law, a taylor in Charles's square, and he was going to mortgage an estate which Mr. Farr had at Crookhorn, in order to carry on this affair, and he had no manner of doubt but they should succeed. And coming along, and afterwards at the Queen's Head in Tower street, on Tower-hill, where we dined, he mentioned it; and there he begged we would admit him an evidence, and he would give us all the assistance he possibly could; that he knew it to be a forgery, and had several papers relating to this will, and if we would call at the Counter in a day or two after, he would deliver the papers up to us. While coming by water, he several times said, he knew the thing was forged. We asked him, if he knew who signed the name Jeffery Henvill? Said he, Mr. Farr wrote the body, and who do you think signed the name? He said, he hoped we would be as favourable as we could to him, and he hoped we would not take up Mr. Mountstephens: he said, he had a letter from him as long as my arm, wherein he sets forth the thing; and said, he as well as myself knows it to be a forgery. He said, Mr. Farr had given him a note of 50 l. and he was to make out a bill of cost for the business he had done to that amount.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him before Mr. Alderman Blunt?</p>
               <p>Hamlen. I was. First of all there he said, he was a man of property, a man of fortune. When the alderman came to ask him again, he said, he was not worth a penny. After that, he said his wife was worth 8 or 900 l. but he was not a farthing the better for it.</p>

               <p>Hamlen. I have been in company with them several times. I have heard him say, Come, Hannah, come, the thing will come round soon for your examination; then we will get some money, and then every thing will be satisfied. He acknowledged he went to the pawnbroker, and took a piece of stuff out of pawn for her, and paid seven shillings for it, and afterwards got Mr Mountstephens to make it into a gown, and he paid him half a crown for making it.</p>
               <p>Q. How often may you have been in Sparry's and Frankland's company?</p>
               <p>Hamlen. It may be near twenty times.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sparry. Do you remember before the alderman I begged his pardon, and said, I mean the pretended forged will?</p>
               <p>H amlen. Sparry absolutely acknowledged before the alderman, he knew it was a forgery. The alderman catched it at once, and bid him hold his tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sparry. Did Frankland swear I was by when she subscribed the will?</p>
               <p>Hamlen. She did; and will do the same now.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sparry. What were her words?</p>
               <p>Hamlen. She said, Sparry was present at the time she witnessed the will. This was before Mr. Alderman Blunt.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sparry. Did not she say, I owed her 13 l. for wages?</p>
               <p>Hamlen. She said he did; and he said he did not owe her any thing at first; but at last he said, he might owe her a trifle. She said, he owed her for six years wages; that she had lived with him seven years, and never received but one year's wages.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sparry. When you came to me to Wood-street Counter, did not you say, you came to treat me, and say, you was my friend, and should say much less when you came on the trial than you had said?</p>
               <p>Hamlen. No; I never said any such thing. I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176210200016"/> once there when I had a bowl of water thrown upon me, and two or three people came and used me very ill at Sparry's request, so that I thought I should not come out of the place alive.</p>
               <p>Q. from Farr. I want to know how you live?</p>
               <p>Hamlen. I have been clerk to an attorney many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was you with?</p>
               <p>Hamlen. I was with Mr. Craycraft in the city, and I lived with one gentleman seven years within two or three months.</p>
               <p>Q. from Farr. How much money have you given Frankland?</p>
               <p>Hamlen. The woman never had a halfpenny of me in her life.</p>
               <p>Q. from Farr. How much have you had of the prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Hamlen. No more than my expenses; we were at a great deal of trouble and expence, in order to find out the people at the bar.</p>

               <p>H. Frankland. This mark upon it is my mark, Mr. Farr wrote my name by it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to set this mark here?</p>
               <p>H. Frankland. Mr. Farr asked me to do it.</p>
               <p>H.. When?</p>

               <p>Q. Was it before Christmas or after?</p>
               <p>H. Frankland. I can't say whether it was before or after justly; Mr. Farr called me down stairs one morning, and we had some purl; he asked me to make a mark? I told him. I could neither write nor read; he said, then I could make a mark; I asked him, what I was to make a mark for? he said, he had some money left him by his father-in-law, and desired me to make my mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any seal upon it?</p>
               <p>H. Frankland. Mr. Farr pulled out a seal and put it upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was by at the time?</p>
               <p>H. Frankland. There was only him and I together.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there with him in that room?</p>
               <p>H. Frankland. I staid but a little while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come into the room at the time you was there?</p>
               <p>H. Frankland. No; nobody to my knowledge: I went out, and left Mr. Farr there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Sparry in the room when you made the mark?</p>
               <p>H. Frankland. No, he was not; he was then in the fore-room, but Farr and I went into another room to do it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Biddle there?</p>
               <p>H. Frankland. No, he was not; but when we went into the next room, Farr shewed the thing to Sparry.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what conversation passed?</p>
               <p>H. Frankland. No, I do not; I did not stay but a very little while.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing this thing after this? [ meaning the will.]</p>
               <p>H. Frankland. Yes; that was two or three days or a week after; then I saw Biddle sign his name to it; that was at the Cock in the Corner, the house of Mrs. Stone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present then?</p>
               <p>H. Frankland. Three was only I, Mr. Sparry, and Mr. Biddle in company then; we went in all together?</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the paper in custody then, before Biddle signed it?</p>
               <p>H. Frankland. I believe Mr. Sparry had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any application made to you, in order to go to Doctors Commons?</p>

               <p>H. Frankland. Biddle and Farr bid me say I saw Mr. Henvill sign it, and to say he was a very lusty man: Mr. Biddle said, he had been in the house, and had seen what was in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. to Heusch. What size man was Mr. Henvill?</p>
               <p>Heusch. He was a very lusty man.</p>
               <p>H. Frankland. They said I should be asked but three questions at the Commons.</p>
               <p>Q. from Farr. Did not you live in that neighbourhood?</p>
               <p>H. Frankland. Yes, 14 or 15 years ago.</p>

               <p>Biddle's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was there with Mrs. Frankland and Mrs. Farr, at Mr. Henvill's house, when he signed it. Mr. Farr left the house, and went to the Black Horse in the Haymarket. Mr. Henvill made use of a viol with ink in it, and I pulled out my own pen and ink from my pocket, and signed it with my own ink.</p>
               <p>[ This was to account for the different sorts of ink the will was wrote and signed with which was observed by the court and the jury.]</p>
               <p>Sparry's Defence.</p>
               <p>My acquaintance with Mr. Henvill was about the 12th of March was twelve months. He came and asked me when I had heard from Mr. Farr, I said, he was in town and that I heard he had had something sell to him. He said, Mr. Sparry, I am desirous they should be settled; he is a little stupid, and strong headed; I wish you would speak to him; I have a great regard for my daughter, and she has the guest boy I ever saw. Said I, Mr. Henvill, I will do any thing for either him or you: I thought Mr. Farr's affairs had been a little unhappy, and he may want some of your assistance. He said, he had lent him 100 l. I said, he is now discharged from debts under the fugitive act in 1755, and if you was now to put him in a little way of business he is a low chandler and soap boiler) it would be of service to him. He desired me to call upon him and tell him he would be his friend. I called and told him. Then Farr said, at the death of his mother-in-law Mr. Henvill had made him a suit of mourning cloaths, and what shall I do to pay my father-in-law for them? If I do not pay him I fear I shall lose his favour. Said I, I have a draft of my wife's which she gave me leave to take. I went and discounted it with a wine-merchant at Temple bar, and let him have the money, and he paid for the mourning, here is the bill and receipt. Some time after that, I met Mr. Henvill coming along Covent garden; we stopt at the Plough in Drury-lane: Said he, Sir, I find my son-in-law is going to settle in the country; if he will but come to me, and put his affairs to right, I will be a friend to him; for he is obliged to pay his sister 500 l. and I am afraid he will be obstinate enough not to pay it; I will do something for him if he will but settle upon my daughter 500 l. Frankland said, she knew Mr. Henvill very well, for she had carry'd beer to his house. Mr. Henvill told me, he heard she was a good sober girl. I said, while she was along with me she was as honest a creature as ever was: I had trusted her with my watch, money, and rings; but I am told now she has no way to get her bread but by drinking, whoring, and swearing. She came to me into Newgate, and swore, d - n her soul, if she would hurt me: She said, I had no occasion to spend my money; I was as innocent as the child unborn. Mr. Henvill said, I have been very unhappy with Mrs. Freke; she has endeavoured to prove my daughter a thief. He gave me this will, all of his own handwriting, and told me how he had been threatened for having criminal conversation with this Freke; for she is the wife of

            , lately broke out of Dorsetshire gaol, and I am afraid I shall be punished with an action. Said I, you cannot do any thing better than to amuse her, as if you intended to do well for her. Said he, I am very desirous to live praceably. He called upon me about the 26th of last October, and desired then that Mr. Farr would come to a resolution to make some memorandum in writing, that he might send it down to Dorsetshire, that this money might be raised, that was 300 l. to pay his debts, and set him up at Crookhorn. He had a freehold estate of about 120 acres of very good land, but it wants manuring. A memorandum was drawn; a copy of it I have here. I was desired to dictate to Mr. Farr nothing more than the preamble<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176210200020"/> of this will. Mr. Henvill said, he should not desire me to give any directions about the will, and that he would be buried at Shaftesbury; he said, he did not desire Mr. Farr to come to his house, for when he comes there is nothing but wrangling; and said, he was in a very bad way, he had got a mortification in his thigh, and did not know whether he should go out of his house any more. I read it to him, and he wrote it. I wrote down nothing more than the preamble of it, and directing his body to be buried at Shaftesbury, near his father and mother. Farr told me, Mr. Biddle, Mr. Mountstevens, and Mr. Hussey, should be witnesses to the will. I did not know there was so much as a legacy for me. This Frankland has swore most falsely. I saw her come home as drunk as possible; I saw her drinking at the Robinhood, at the Black Horse, and in the Strand; I never saw a beast so drunk. As to this story about

             and Frankland, it is the vilest story ever invented. When she was going to be examined in the Commons, said I, here you have been almost a fortnight; what is the reason you do not go to be examined? She said, I have been a great deal out of pocket; I must mind my business; she would not go unless some provision was made for her. I said, you show yourself to be a bad woman. I have affronted my wife in what I have done for Farr. When Frankland came into the Commons, she told the proctor she saw Mr. Henvill sign, seal, and deliver the will; and that Mr. Farr wrote her name to her mark in her presence; and that Biddle objected against Mountstevens being a witness to the will, because there was a legacy left him in it. When I heard the talk of this, I sent my brother up to Mr. Brown's in Charles-street, as he very much wanted Farr. Mr. Heusch desired that I would take care to let him know where Farr was. The message was brought me by my brother, that if Farr would come alone, he would be glad to see him; but he would not if he came with any body else; that was the reason that Farr did not go.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Saunders. The prisoner came into our shop on the 24th of July in the afternoon, and asked to see some black ribbon; I shewed her of several sorts; she stayed some time over them, and then asked for some figured ribbon; I shewed her some; she did not like either of them. Then she desired to see some black ribbon again; as she was standing over them, she desired me to weigh her a quarter of an ounce of black thread, which I desired my partner (the witness to the last trial) to weigh; she took an opportunity of taking a piece of black sattin ribbon, and concealed it under her arm; I saw her do it. She went out of the shop; I followed her, and brought her back, and we found the piece of ribbon under her arm.</p>
