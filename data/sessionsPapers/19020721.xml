When I found we had got 20s. we were coming back, but we were met by a man when I saw these gentlemen," indicating my brother officer and me—I searched Rider—I found on him 10s. gold, 8s. silver, and 11d. copper, all good coins.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—I was out with him on Easter Monday—about 11.40 p.m. we were crossing King William Street, when we were both knocked down by a hansom cab—I did not see it coming, it came so suddenly—we were knocked down in the pulse; of the moment—the cab was going very fast—we had no warning that it was coming—we were about the middle of the road—I was unconscious after I was knocked down—I was taken to Guy's Hospital—I was un<lb/>conscious until they were undressing me in the hospital—my side and leg were bruised—I left the hospital that night—my husband remained till the Sunday—he left because his father died in there two or three years ago, and he was under the impression that he was going to die himself there; and he asked me and my brother to take him home.</p>

Knight was on the opposite side of the road—he jumped on to the spring of the cab as it was passing him, and I ran behind—Knight could not stop the horse till after it had gone about eighty yards—I got up to the cab when it came to a standstill—the prisoner was the driver—he was drunk—I took him to the station where lie was charged—he made no answer to the charge—he was drunk then.—he was charged with drunkenness as well as with wanton driving—his horse was not heated or distressed—the Fitzgeralds were not present when the prisoner was charged—I made the charge having seen the accident—the cab was going about ten miles an hour—the road was somewhat crowded.</p>

                  </hi>, L.R.C.S. I live at 20. Addington Road, Bow—I was first called to see the prosecutor on April 7th, at his house—he was suffering from a fracture to the base of the skull—he remained under my treatment until June 7th, when I had him removed to the workhouse, and he was committed for fourteen days by the magistrate because he was insane—I think that might have been one of the after effects of the fractured skull, or it might be connected with his having left the hospital too soon—he is better now—he is deaf in one ear and deafer <hi rend="italic">now</hi> than he was when I first saw him—I also saw Mrs. Fitzgerald—she was suffering from con<lb/>tusions on four of her ribs on the left side—there was blackness on the right hip and a contusion on the right knee—she is progressing now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard that the prosecutor had come out of the hospital the day previous to that on which I first attended him—it was an imprudent thing to come out too soon—it was about three weeks after I attended that insanity supervened—it was two months from the time that he left the hospital till he went to the workhouse—he was not in bed all that time—I have read of epilepsy, it may be traumatic or hereditary, it is very insidious and mysterious in its forms—one of its premonitory symptoms is headache or giddiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had a case about three weeks ago where the patient suffered from epilepsy, and he went off suddenly while I was talking to him—if a man smelled of drink I should expect to find alcoholism, and that would make him dazed and unsteady in his gait.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence on oath, said that whilst coming over London Bridge he had a fit; that he had had them before; that they were brought on by hot weather and excitement; that he did not remember running over the prosecutor or hearing any shouting; that he was not drunk, as he had only had one glass of beer, which had been given him by a fare who had engaged him and then disappeared without paying him; that epilepsy was in his family; that he had never been charged before, and that he had had a fit at Holloway Prison, and had been attended by a warder and a doctor.</hi>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I am surgeon-registrar at the Middlesex Hospital, assistant surgeon at the London Hospital, and formerly medical officer at the Middlesex Hospital—I examined the prisoner last Wednesday—his heart is extremely weak—you cannot feel the impulse at all when the hand is laid on the chest—I asked him a number of questions to try and find out his condition—he told me that he had had, I think, about eight fits in about eight years—he called them faints, not fits—I came to the conclusion that they were not faints, but one of the minor forms of epilepsy, what is called petit mal—it assumes a very great variety of forms, and it is very easy to mistake it for faintness, drunkenness, or extraordinary eccentricities—it is often extremely difficult to diagnose drunkenness—the prisoner did not seem to have any idea that epilepsy was the proper word to use—doctors often mistake it for drunkenness, and sometimes it is not recognised for years that a person has epilepsy, and they do not know that they have it themselves—he said he had a headache all day, and just before the fit a swimming in his head—that was when he was in the middle of London Bridge—that would be con<lb/>sistent with petit mal—he was not in a state to drive a cab—he would not necessarily fall off his cab—he could hold the reins, but he would be quite irresponsible for what he did—there is no doubt that he was suffering from petit mal at the time—he said that after the fits he felt very dared and his head ached—he said he had not passed water, but one of the wit<lb/>nesses</p>

               <p>said that he had once—that is one of the signs, and is a strong con<lb/>firmation—he told me that he had once fallen forward out of a chair—that might denote ordinary epilepsy or an ordinary fit—hot weather, disappointment, or worry would tend to bring on these fits—he said they had started on a very hot day—I did not put any leading questions to him—I left it to him to give a frank and full description—he said that he sometimes woke in the morning with a confused mind and a headache—a weak heart is one of the conditions of epilepsy—his mother seems to have had attacks of this nature—it is very hereditary, and would be called congenical.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I made a careful examination of the prisoner on June 9th—I find he has an irregular, intermittent, and weak heart's action—a heart like his would hurry on epilepsy—I asked him about the attacks—he called them fits—I asked him if he passed water, and he said no—epileptics do not always pass water, but in this pettimal patients do do so—if the prisoner did it would be confirmatory—excitement or worry would tend to bring on one of these attacks if he had a weak heart—there is what is called the grand mal—people recover from that sometimes in less than a quarter of a minute—it is the petit mal which is so insidious—the patient may not know that he has it—I have heard the evidence given by Dr. Baldwin—it is correct—I examined the prisoner before Dr. Baldwin did—he knew I had examined him but did not know what I said about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> You cannot say for certain if the prisoner could carry on his business the day after one of these attacks—he might run about and stick somebody—it is impossible to say what he would do—I do not think a glass of bitter would have made any difference to him—I think the exictement he had with regard to his fare would be much more likely to disturb his heart—he has, at any rate, got a functional disease of his heart—he did not tell me that he was not right on the day following this attack—I heard the evidence of the police with reference to his condition when he was stopped—that would be consistent with a fit or faint or an attack of petit mal—even in severe head injuries men are brought into the hospital and sent away because they are thought to be drunk—in my opinion, I think the police have been honestly mistaken—they are not capable of judging one way or the other—even a doctor might have been mistaken if he saw him some time afterwards.</p>

               <p>last I was out with a party in a van. I got out of the van at the Cheshire Cheese, Mount Pleasant. We all got out of the van at the same time. We had all been friends together. A man named William Collins came to me and gave me 3d. towards buying another drink all round. I said to him, 'I have not got enough,' and in game he poked me in the stomach and kissed me afterwards. We were sober enough. The van then went away from the Cheshire Cheese through Gough Street. The deceased, Maloney, was driving from Mount Pleasant Some rode and some walked to the White Lion, Little James Street, and it was about half past five. Then I saw Maloney pull up the van and say to Cooper, 'Who is going to take the van home.' Cooper said to him, 'I am not.' Then I see Maloney take his coat off and he went up to Cooper. I see no more. I did not hear nothing. I saw Maloney make a blow at Cooper. I walked right by it up towards Great James Street. I crossed Great James Street, got into Chapel Street, when Cooper came up to me and asked me to lend him a knife. I had one. Having no knowledge of what Cooper was a going to do with my knife he left me. I lent him my knife. Cooper then left me, crossed Great James Street, and turned into Little James Street. I was at the corner of Little James Street when I see Cooper go up to the deceased man. Whether he had or not the knife in his hand I did not see. He made a punch at Jack Maloney. He then passed me by, turned round, and come back. I afterwards see Cooper in Chapel Street; that was about two minutes afterwards. I said nothing; to him and did not see any more of him till his arrest. <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">CORONER</hi>. I did not notice anything about Cooper or his appearance when he passed me. I did not say anything to Cooper about taking off his coat and doing; for Maloney. I have known Cooper about two months. I have had no quarrel with Cooper. We had all been drinking to a certain extent. Cooper did not return the knife to me. I did not ask him for it. It was a one-blade pocket knife, and the blade was about two inches long. I had a suspicion of what had been done. I afterwards told a man named Brown that I thought Cooper had stabbed Maloney. Brown got injured the same evening by the horse of the van, and went to the Homoeopathic Hospital. The same evening, about seven, I heard from Miss Newman, of North Street, of the death of Maloney. I said to her, 'Cooper must have stabbed him She told me that Collins was at her door crying and wanted me. I went to Collins, asked him what was the matter, and he said, 'Maloney is dead.' I said, 'It cannot be; come with me to the hospital wherever he is gone.' William Collins, his young lady, and me were going to the hospital when I was arrested.'—<hi rend="italic">Sidney Herbert Ersser. Henry George Cooper</hi>, after being duly cautioned, on oath, deposed: 'I am a carman, aged 19 years, and live at 27. Devonshire Street, Theobald's Road. I knew Maloney as a friend, also Ersser, and the other men. On Thursday last we went for a drive round. There was Maloney, myself, Newman, Brown, Bill Collins, Ersser, George Thompson, Joe Thorogood, Ross, and another man as far as I remember. We all got out of the van at the Cheshire Cheese. Some went in the Cheshire Cheese and some kept out. Ersser was crying and said someone had punched him in the</p>

               <p>belly. With that me. Ersser, and Muden walked away. We left Muden at the corner of Gough Street, and we walked into James' Street, and Maloney followed up with the van. We stopped at the White Lion. There had been something said about fighting, and I said we were in the wrong neighbourhood for fighting. Maloney took his coat off and struck Ersser in the mouth and made it bleed. Maloney came up and struck me. Me and Ersser walked away, and we got as far as Chapel Street. I asked Ersser for something to hit with. It was no good me trying to fight him being a pugilist; Ersser gave me the knife. I went down towards Maloney. He said, 'Are you going to take the van home,' and I said, 'No, why should I. I never got it.' and then Ersser was about a yard behind me. Maloney made another blow at me, and in self-defence I struck him with the knife. I did not do it with the intention of killing, but just to defend myself.

                  </hi>. I have offices at 52, Queen Victoria Street, and I have the letting of the ground floor of No. 60, Queen Victoria Street—on January 2nd, 1901, I let by agreement a room on the ground floor to a person named Thomas Field, of South Road, Southgate—I recognise Mills as the person I let the room to—the rent was £25 a year payable monthly in advance—I saw him there from time to time—I also saw Stanley there</p>

               <p>—I do not recognise Beards or Simons—the name on the door was Field and Son—I understood Mills and Stanley were father and son—they occupied the premises till about the middle of August—the rent was paid fairly regularly, but there was one month's rent owing in August—I did not give them notice to quit, and did not know that they had gone till about August 12th—I used to collect the rent—sometimes Mills paid it and sometimes Stanley—when I went into the office I saw samples of goods there, also a piano—I think Stanley was with Mills when the agreement was signed—Mills signed it in my presence.</p>

Son and Company—there was furniture in the office, and I also noticed two pianos—I remember the second piano being delivered, the father was there when it came—I noticed "Leipsic" on it—I had a con<lb/>versation with the young Mr. Field and he told me he had lost a lot of money, I am not sure as to the amount, but it was either £200 or £400—they left about August 10th—I did not know that they were going and they did not leave any address to which any letters could be sent.</p>

I am a manufacturing jeweller, and carry on business at 16, Northampton Street, Birmingham—I received a letter from Taylor, Sons and Company, asking for calalogue and prize list, and I instructed Mr. Mirams, a traveller of mine, to call upon them—I after<lb/>wards got an order from them for three dozen rings—they were packed up "in my presence and were handed to a messenger with instructions to take them to Messrs. Hale and Co., who are forwarding carriers in the jewellery trade—I have the receipt by Messrs. Hale and Co. for the parcel which shows they left Birmingham on the 16th—in addition to those rings my traveller supplied further jewellery to the value of £48 12s. 0d., £29 10s. 0d., and £41 15s. 6d., the total amount being £143 5s. 6d.—I wrote several times for payment and then instructed my solicitor to write—I got back four rings value £29 10s. 0d., and that reduces the amount owing to £113 15s. 6d.—when I got their letters I thought they were a genuine firm—the words "Government Contractors" did not influence me in any way, but I enquired at Chatham and had a very favour<lb/>able report of Taylor and Sons.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 80, Maxey Road, Birmingham, and am a traveller in the jewellery trade—at the end of last year I was in the employment of Mr. Marsh, and on his instructions I called on September 11th at 26 and 27, Imperial Buildings, Holborn Viaduct—I saw Beards, and he told me to call again as the buyer was out—I called again the same day and saw Simons and Stanley; Beards was in the outer office—Simons selected £40 worth of rings and showed them to Stanley—they then arranged to keep them, and I left an invoice—Simons told me in Stanley's presence that they were in a very large way of business at Hight Street, Chatham, that they did a lot of business with men in the dockyards, and that they were contractors to the Admiralty—when I left they gave me a fresh order for three dozen rings which I sent on to Birmingham for execution—the value of those rings was £23 8s.—on October 17th I called again upon Taylor,. Son and Co., and saw Simons and Beards—Simons told me that he had just received the three dozen rings from Birmingham—when I asked for payment Simons told me that Mr. Taylor, meaning Stanley, was at Chatham, but would be back the next day, and if I called then I should have a cheque—on the strength of that Simons took some more goods from stock to the value of £48 12s.—at the same time Simons told me he wanted an engagement ring, and would I let him have two or three for the lady to choose from—I left four, value £29 14s., and I charged it to the firm at Simons' request—I understood the lady to be Miss Taylor, the step<lb/>daughter of Stanley—I called again for the promised cheque, but Simons told me that Stanley had not come back from Chatham, and that he would send it on to Birmingham, but it did not come—On November 8th I called again on Taylor, Son and Co., and found the bailiffs in posses<lb/>sion for rent—I saw Miss Spinks there, and she gave me the address of Brandon and Co., at Hatton Garden—I went there but did not see anyone—I also went to an address at Marylebone and saw a lady there, but the lady I saw was not Miss Taylor—on November 9th I went again to Imperial Chambers and saw Stanley—I accused him of carrying on a long firm fraud, and told him that he kept no books—he said he had, and produced some, but the entries were all torn out, and he said they had been torn out by Beards and Miss Spinks while he was on the Continent—he then told me that his wife was a wealthy woman, and that he had made an arrangement to meet his creditors on the following Tuesday—I spoke to Stanley about the gem rings and he admitted that Simons had got them by fraud, but that he knew where they were, and that Mr. Marsh should have them back—I saw the four rings when they were returned to Bir<lb/>mingham—at the time I parted with the goods I believed the statements made to me.</p>

I am a widow—my husband died on June 14th, 1900—the business carried on at Chatham is that of a boot shop and ready-made clothing—it ceased to be mine two years ago—it now belongs to my daughter Frances—I do not take any part in it, but I occasionally buy goods for her—I sometimes live in the High Street, but I have a villa in Stroud Hill—the business at Chatham has no branch in London: it has nothing to do with Taylor. Sons and <hi rend="italic">Co.</hi>, of High Holborn—it has' nothing to do with exporting jewellery, typewriters, or bedsteads—I never dealt with the Admiralty—I never sold jewellery to men in the dockyard—on June 13th, last year, I went through a form of marriage with Stanley under the name of Field—my husband had then been dead twelve months—we went on the Continent: Simons and my daughter Edith accom<lb/>panied us—amongst other places, we visited Berlin, and went into several piano places—Simons did all the talking as he could speak German. And</p>

               <p>'Stanley could not—Stanley did not seem to have anything to do with it—I never gave Stanley any interest in the business at Chatham—Simons wanted to marry my daughter Edith, but wanted money with her—I did not know he was a married man.</p>

I do not know whether it was after June 13th that Stanley took the rooms at Imperial Chambers—I went there on three or four occasions—at that time I had every belief that Stanley was an honest man—I did not notice the name of Taylor on the door at Imperial Chambers—my daughter did, and told me of it—I asked him what he-put that name up for, and he said it did not matter—I said, "Whatever you do, do not keep that name up there; I do not like it"—I remember Simons coming down to Chatham, but I never mentioned anything to him about my property—I have, in fact, a little money and a little property—I did not know that Simons was manager, of the firm of. Taylor, Sons and Co.—they seemed to me to be all sharing alike—if one would not do anything the other would.</p>

I am a daughter of the last witness—in October last year I accompanied my mother to Germany with Stanley and Simons—whilst there we visited a piano factory in Berlin—Simons did not want to marry me, and I was never engaged to him—I have had correspondence with him, and I have met him by appointment after he has written to me—I have never seen him write—I cannot say whether the initials in Exhibit 7 are in his writing—Exhibit 14 looks like his writing, but I could not swear to it—"J. W. Brandon" and the address in Exhibit 15, and Exhibits 21, 34, and 35 are in his writing, I think.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective-Sergeant</hi>). On May 24th I received warrants for the arrest of the prisoners—on the 31st I went to Rowton House, Newington Butts, with a warrant for conspiracy and saw Mills—in answer to the charge he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "You are alleged to have carried on bogus offices as Field and Co. in Queen Victoria Street, and Taylor, Sons and Co. at Imperial Chambers. Holborn Viaduct"—he made no reply—I found some letters upon him—on the same day I went to Kepple Street, Russell Square, and there saw Beards—I said, "I am a police-officer, and hold a warrant for your arrest"—he said, "I went to Taylor, Sons and Co.'s offices to buy goods on my own account as a job buyer or to sell them for Taylor"—that is Stanley—" on commis<lb/>sion; I always went there to a great extent, because I knew him in a friendly way. Some of the correspondence found by the police may be mine and other people's; all that is in my own name is my own. With regard to the gold brooches they were taken out of pawn; I bought the ticket from a man named Bernard; Stanley gave the opals to Mr. Knight, a furniture dealer in Beauchamp Street, who sold them. I took Taylor to a man named Michaelson to sell them, but he refused to buy them; I sold two pianos to Myers, a furniture dealer in Houndsditch; I think it was October, 1901. I got £14 each for them, and gave the money to Stanley, and he gave me £2. Stanley was the head of Taylor. Sons and Co.; Simons was manager"—the prisoner was then charged, and made no</p>

V—I said, "Yes"—he said, "He is wanted for getting goods as Eldon Murray and Co., Leadenhall Street, from Morton, Son and Co., Harp Lane, and £100 worth of sardines from a Mr. Brewster, Mansion House Chambers"—he then referred to the prisoner Field, and said, "He is a wrong 'un; he owes me £20. Is he to be further charged with bigamy?"—I said, "I do not know"—then he said, "Matheson was clever when Field was arrested; he changed coats with him, and took charge of some very incriminating cheques and letters that Field had; he changed the coat in front of the detective. Matheson knows all about Field"—I was enquiring into a firm of Crookshank and Co., of 434, Strand—Crookshank is at present in custody on a charge of obtaining money by false pretences.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Most of the wounds were quite superficial—I cannot make out any fracture—I think that if the prisoner had liked he could have made much greater injuries—I should have expected to find that one wound from such a man would have been fatal—I have read of cases where persons have suddenly, and without any apparent notice, attacked those to whom they are most nearly attached—I have heard of cases, where there has been melancholia, where one of these apparently inexplicable acts of violence has been perpetrated by the sufferer upon the victim.</p>

I am the resident medical officer at Holloway—I have had the prisoner under observation since June 16th, when he was received at Holloway—when he came in he complained of pains in his head—he was in a depressed mental condition—that has passed off, but he is not in a stable condition of mind—he is better than he was—I regard his actions as those of a person who is not responsible—I think that at the time he did these acts he was insane and not responsible for his actions—I think his condition was such that he did not know the difference between right and wrong within the meaning of the act.</p>

I am an assistant in the post office at High Road Knightsbridge—on May 16th this requisitoin for a money order for 1s. payable at Dundee to William Christophan, was handed in—it is supposed to be signed by Mr. Wharmsley, of 22, Stockdale Road—I filled up the original order, and handed it to the person who had signed the request—when I parted with it the amount was 1s., it is now £6 1s., the "6" has two dashes underneath it—it is the practice to put two dashes in the vacant column when there is one, and they would be similar to those now in the pence columns—the letter of advice was sent to Dundee, that is for 1s., and is a reproduction of the original letter—a carbon sheet is placed between the requisition and the letter of advice, so that whatever appeared on one would appear on the other—the letter of advice shows the two dashes on the pound side—I do not recognise the person who came for it.</p>

"I daresay I can," and I asked my wife for the money—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the order, but it was not crossed like this; I suppose my banker crossed it when it was passed through my bank—it was already signed "James Harley" when he brought it in—he asked me not to let his friend see as ii he did he would have to have half of it and would spend it in drink—he said, "Tell him you have only let me have half a sovereign on account" which I did—he turned round to his friend and said, "Mr. Leftwich can only let me have half a sovereign on account, and you can have 5s. of it"—the friend said, "Well, 5s. is better than nothing to a man that is broke"—I believe the prisoner gave him 5s., but I cannot say for certain—he received six sovereigns and 1s. from me—he paid for the drinks previously—I believed the order was all right because I had changed orders for him previously—at the time he showed me a form from some drug stores at Knightsbridge with something about "Enclose balance of account" on it—he had previously given me to understand that he was</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner at the Lambeth Infirmary—the deceased was admitted into the Infirmary on June 13th in the afternoon, suffering from injuries to the head—I saw her on Saturday. June 14th—she was semi-comatose, and suffering from a fractured skull—there was a wound beneath the right eyebrow—she gradually became unconscious and died on June 17th, about 10 p.m.—on the Coroner's order I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—she had a wound about half an inch long beneath the centre of the right eyebrow, which led in a downward, inward, and backward direction and communicated with a facture at the interior portion of the base of the skull from just behind the socket of the eye—the wound led backwards about <hi rend="italic">aft</hi> inch and terminated in the fracture at the base of the skull—on opening the skull the whole of that side of the brain was inflamed and covered with matter—some small fractures of the skull had actually pene<lb/>trated the brain substance—I found a further fracture just above and behind the left ear, extending towards the base of the skull on that side—I do not think these fractures were caused by a fall—I came to the con<lb/>clusion that the fracture by the right eye was caused by some pointed instrument, not necessarily sharp—the wound by the ear was a suppurating wound—it might have been a clean cut—it had festered—there was no bruising—there was hemorrhage into the eye-ball—if the wound had been Caused by a fall there would have been necessarily found a bruising of the external surface—the wound could have been caused by falling on a pointed instrument—the fracture over the left ear could have been caused by a fall—it did not appear to be a recent fracture—if it had been caused at the same time as the other injury I should have noticed it—the fracture on the left side was, in my opinion, of later date than the fracture on the right side—death was due to high temperature, forming blood poisoning, and causing inflammation to the coverings of the brain, or septic menin<lb/>gitis, which was due to the fracture over the right eye—the symptoms were consistent with the injures inflicted on June 8th—the other fracture had been inflicted previous to June 8th, and had nothing to do with the two wounds.</p>
