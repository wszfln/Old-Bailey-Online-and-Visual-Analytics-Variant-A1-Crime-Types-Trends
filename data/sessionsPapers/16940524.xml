That the Turk's Members were shanker'd, and much bloody, and a great hole upon the fleshly part of his Yard.

            </rs>. The Evidence for the King and Queen deposed, That they were all seen at work; Whittingham clipping money, S - H - Filing of it, and A - H - rubbing it upon a Leather to make it smooth. They made their Escape once from the Officers at first, but were taken sometime afterwards. Peter Whittingham was taken at the Salmon and Ball in Moorfields, and H - and A - in Mugwell-street. This was very clearly proved against them, and the clipt money was produced in Court as corroborating Evidence against them, which was shewed to the Jury. The Prisoners denied the Fact, and called divers of their Neighbours to justify their Reputation, urging, That one of the Witnesses for the King had malice against them, and did not prosecute, till they had took him up with a Warrant for suspicion of robbing the Prisoners of 50l. But yet the Court directed the Jury, That People that are Clippers, are commonly of good Repute, because they get their money easier than other men, therefore acted fairly with their Neighbours; that a man might have a fair Character, and yet be an Offender in such a Case; yet it was left to their Consciences, whether they did believe the Evidence against them; if they did, they must find them guilty of High-Treason, otherwise acquit them.

When he was in the Field, a great Rabble was running after him, throwing Brick-Batts at him; upon which, Mr. Smith the Constable coming along the Field, met the Prisoner, telling him that he was a Constable; and if he would surrender himself to him, he would preserve him from the Insolencies of the Mobb: But he refused it, and drew his Sword, swearing he would kill any man that should come near him, bidding Mr. Smith keep off, or else (he swore) God Damn him <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16940524004"/> he would shoot him, and made a Pass at <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note>put by with his Staff. Upon which Mr. Smith, being a    man. Closed in with hi, and clasped him about; and having his Constables Staff in his Left Hand, and a Pistol in the Right, he immediately discharged his Pistol upon the ground, directing it from the Prisoner, that it might not hurt him. After which, Mr. W. shot Mr. Smith into the Thigh, who fell back and Cry'd out, the Rogue has kill'd me. It was   proved that Mr. Smith shewed the Prisoner his Authority as a Constable, by producing his Staff, and very mildly desired him, in the King's Name, to yield and surrender himself quietly to his power, he would protect him; but he would not yield, swearing he would shoot him, as aforesaid. And if the Constable had not put the said W's Pistol downwards towards the earth, he had shot him in the Belly. There were several Witnesses for the King, who all agreed in the matter of Fact, as aforesaid, &amp;c. Mr. W. declared in his Behalf, That he was afraid of Bayliffs arresting him, and therefore made that defence for himself; and that Mr. Smith came without a Staff or Warrant to seize him, therefore he thought him not to be a Constable, and that he never told him he was one. He called some Witnesses that were in the Field at the same time the Murder was done, who could not confirm what he asserted, but only declared in the general, That they saw the Prisoner and Mr. Smith struggling together; that there were two Pistols shot off, that Mr. W. went off last. The first Witness against him further declared, That the Prisoner desired him not to inform the Court at the Trial, that he had any Society with Bernard, and the rest that Robbed Sir Richard Pigget's House, for that might be a prejudice to him, &amp;c. The Prisoner urged further, That what he did, was in his own defence: But was told that could not be for all the Evidence agreed viva voce, that he killed him maliciously and basely, being unwilling to be taken, lest he should be prosecuted for the Burglary at Sir Richard Piggets.

The Doctor swore that he was robb'd at the time aforesaid of the Sum of Two hundred Pound, but that it was done by the Prisoner, but said he always suspected him.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his defence alledged, That Johnson immediately upon the committing the Robbery, fled, and that he was put into the Gazette by Dr. Littleton with a Reward of 20l. to any Person that should take him; and that he the said Bradshaw never remov'd from his Business, but took all possible care to have Johnson apprehended; and proved that he had caused 2000 Bills to be printed, described the said Johnson, and had distributed the same to all Watches, &amp;c. That he had also caused Hue and Cries to be be made, and sent to all parts of England, for taking the said Johnson, with the Reward aforesaid, by the said Doctor; and that afterwards Johnson was taken up for the Robbery. The Evidence for the Prisoner, who took the said Johnson for the Fact, did testify, That there had been by Johnson's confession, a Correspondence between the Doctor and the said Johnson, which the Doctor did not deny; and that he had received a Letter from the Doctor (whose Hand he said he knew very well) wherein the Doctor had promised a Pardon to the said Johnson in case he would swear against the Prisoner; and that Johnson declared it was the Doctor's whole Design to lay the matter upon the said Mr. Bradshaw, for that he was in a condition to pay the Sum he was robb'd of; but saith Johnson, this I cannot, nor will not do, for Mr. Bradshaw is innocent and I believe he is as honest a man as any one living; further Evidence for the Prisoner testify'd, that the said Johnson had been seen to have 100 or more Guineas at one time, and that since the Robbery he had paid several Debts, particularly  the King's Tax, that he run away with 12l. and that the said Johnson had built a House that cost 20l. or more. Further Evidence for the Prisoner testified, That the said Johnson had committed several Robberies by several Names, one of which was on Sir

The Prisoner, to take off the suspicion the Doctor had of him, proved by the Doctor's Confession in Court, that he had employed him in all, or most of his Affairs, since the time of the Fact being committed; and by his Letters, not only with his moneys, but with his Mistress also; which Letters were produced by the Prisoner and read in Court, the Prisoner lost 20l. of his own money.</p>
