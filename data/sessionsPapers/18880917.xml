I live at 20, Westcott Street, Bermondsey, and am a porter at 11, Cullum Street—about Lady Day, March, Harris came to 11, Cullum Street, and took some offices there—my master, Mr. Crawley, let them—Harris took this agreement away, and brought it back signed, and after that Harris occupied the room there; he traded under the name of Harris and Company—he gave me as references Thomas Harris, 24, Sandmere Road, Clapham, and C. Deacon, 107, Fenchurch street—I made inquiries there—I asked Deacon if he knew a party of the name of Harris, he asked me what for, I said because he wanted to take offices at 11, Cullum Street, and was he worthy to be trusted—he said, "I have done a great deal of business with Harris," and he mentioned Ludgate Hill, and said, "he has always paid me"—I said, "You can give him a good character, and recommend him?" and he said, "Yes"—after that Harris brought back this document signed, and gave it to Mr. Crawley in my presence.</p>

                  </hi>. On 10th January Deacon and Harris called on me, saying they had been recommended by certain customers I knew to buy some German bronzes—I said "Certainly, you can look at the book and at the patterns, but before you go any further tell me for which market those are"—they told me the London and American markets—I said "These will suit you; I will give you a book and price list, and choose for yourself"—at that first interview Deacon presented Harris to me as his partner—he said "Mr. Harris is my partner"—Harris heard that, and so did a young lady in my employ—I believed that; I had no cause to disbelieve it—in consequence I handed over a book of patterns that they might take it away and select—they sent me an order two or three days afterwards; it was for the Canadian or American market they wanted it—I received this letter on the 11th or 12th from Charles Deacon and Company, returning the book of patterns, with a list of things likely to suit the market—at their first visit they had looked at my stock, and I pointed out things to them—they selected things, between 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., perhaps not quite so much—they took nothing away then—on the 13th I received a further letter, with an order for the bronzes, which would be required by the middle of February, and were to be packed in best pitch paper—when they came next day I said goods for the American market were lined with tin; they said they would take the risk—I received this letter of the 14th, and then on the 16th they called, and left a considerable order for china goods; that was never executed—I had a glass case in my shop with ivory goods—they said "We have a customer over from Toronto, who wishes to purchase such goods"—I said "I tell you what; these goods run into a great deal of money. I know every man worth knowing in Toronto; you had better tell me who he is; I will do business with him, and give you commission"—they mentioned the name of Carter, of Toronto, who is a very good man and worth thousands—I said "You can have the goods on approbation, to be returned to-morrow or the cash"—they agreed—I sent</p>

               <p>them the goods the same day; they returned one or two samples they had at the time, and came and said "Our customer does not like them, but wants to look at some more"—I supplied 128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of goods; some were returned, and that left the goods supplied and never paid for at 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were supplied under my invoice of 18th January, "Bought of Sellinger Brothers; terms, goods on approbation; what sold to be paid; others to be returned on Friday at 8 o'clock"—they should have been returned on 20th January—on the day before that they came and said they wanted more goods for the same customers—on that day I parted with goods of the value of 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a pair of vases, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to them: "Goods on approbation; what kept to be drawn for at 70 days"—in the meantime they gave me references to two or three firms, and they turned out very satisfactory—I knew nothing of the references; I inquired of them; one was a Limited Liability Company—the goods were parted with on approbation, sale or return; they were never returned—I have never been paid one penny with regard to them—I never executed the large order for china—after they had the goods I went to them, and they gave me a bill at 90 days, payable at Fenchurch Street first—I said I must have it made payable at a bank—I made inquiries, and found they had never had an account at the bank—the bill matured towards the and of April, and came back dishonoured—I received these letters. (<hi rend="italic">The letters contained the passages:</hi> "I have not heard this morning from my partner." "The vases are under offer, so I cannot return them." "I shall nut return them until my partner returns. You shall be advised the moment Mr. Harris returns." "I am waiting my partner's return back to town.") I had asked for the vases to be returned—there is a letter of February 15th, signed Harris, on paper headed with the lithographic address of Charles Deacon, 107, Fenchurch Street—up to 15th December I believed the people were in partnership, and that it was a genuine firm—I have since seen my goods at their place—afterwards I had to go into liquidation—it was connected partly, not entirely, with the loss effected in this manner.</p>

On August 3rd, about 1.40 a.m., I was in New Street and heard a crash of glass—I went in that direction and saw two men leaving the the Three Tuns public-house, East Harding Street—I gave chase and saw the prisoner leave the private door of the public-house—I chased him and caught him in Gough Square, 100 yards from the public-house—I said "What have you been doing here?" he said "Nothing," I said "You must come back with me"—I took him to the house and found a large plate glass window smashed, and the door forced at the bottom, as if a heavy body had been forced against it—I called the landlord, he found some difficulty in unbolting' it—if it had not been a very large bolt the door would have been forced open—the plate glass was broken through straining the door—I said to the prisoner "What do you mean by this?" he said, "Nothing, because I laughed you want to bring this on to me," and he laughed again and said "They can't give me much for this"—I took him to the station and on being charged he said that he knew nothing about it, the police-man had made a mistake, meaning me.</p>

I keep the Three Tuns, Great New Street, it is my dwelling-house—I went round at 11.30 and saw that my private bar was closed, it was bolted at the top and the glass was perfectly sound—I was called up about 2 o'clock and found the door pushed in 2 inches from the bottom, and in trying to spring the door they broke the glass—there was property in the bar.</p>

I live at 125, Judd Street—the prisoner with her husband lodged with me for about four mouths—the deceased child Frank was born shortly before they came to our place, and was then about a month old—I have often seen the prisoner attending to it; I saw her every day—on 8th August I saw her with the child in her arms—she seemed rational then; she had not seemed rational for some time previously—I noticed it particularly on 21st June—she would knock the top of her head, and say "It is here" without any apparent meaning—on 7th August, at supper, she came into the kitchen, and said They have all gone to bed"—my wife said "Mr. Reynolds, too?"—the prisoner clutched her by the wrist, and said "What do you know about Mr. Reynolds?"—on 9th August I was awoke about 5 o'clock in the morning by a loud knocking upstairs—I went up, and saw Mr. Reynolds supporting his wife, and he asked me to go for a doctor—he told me that the child was dead—I fetched Dr. Smith, and ho attended to the prisoner and looked at the child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to Her Majesty's Gaol, Holloway—the prisoner was under my constant observation there from the 11th August—she was suffering from delusions when she came, and in my opinion was of unsound mind—she was not in a condition to know the nature of the act she had committed—after some time the delusions passed away—she was brought to me with a letter stating that she was violent in the hospital; that drew my attention to her—she was under the delusion that her husband was then in the ward—she was sleepless and restless, and complaining very much of her head—she improved, and is perfectly rational now, so as to know the nature of the present proceedings.</p>

On 4th September I went to Mr. Eagle's premises, and saw two boxes of sultanas and a parcel addressed to"—Goddard, Esq., Bourk Road, Wood Green," and the next afternoon I saw these boxes and the parcel delivered at Wood Green—Goddard received one box and the parcel from Carter, Paterson, and Co.'s carman—I told him I was a detective sergeant, and came about those parcels which were by his side—he made no reply—I asked him again, and he asked me if I had any card—I showed him my warrant card—he said "I don't think it is any business of yours, and I shan't tell you"—I said "If you don't give me a satisfactory account of how you became possessed of those goods I shall take you in custody for receiving them knowing them to be stolen"—he made no reply—I asked him if he had the invoice—he said "Yes"—I asked him how much he had given for them—he did not answer—he took some slips of paper from his pocket—I said "These do not refer to these goods at all; you will be charged with receiving these goods well knowing them to be stolen," and asked him who he received them from—he said "From Carter, Paterson's"—I said "I know that; I want to know from whom you bought them"—he made no answer, and I took him in custody—it was a private house—there is a stable and coach-house in the back yard, where there was a quantity of fruit and spices, which I showed to one of the prosecutors' buyers—we have a list of them; among them were 8 lb of cloves, a parcel with blue pencil writing on it, 7 lb. of ginger, 19 lb. of ginger, two parcels of tea, 6 lb. each, a 2 lb. tin of ground nutmegs, four sacks with the prosecutors' initials, and two bags—I searched Goddard at the station, and found three cards marked A, B, and C, and addressed to "C. Wren, at Goddard's, at Wood Green"—I saw no one named Wren there, only Goddard—I also found on Goddard three cards marked E, F, and G, containing lists of goods with prices, such as 6 lb. tea and 56lb. tapioca—on a subsequent search at Goddard's house I brought away six empty bags and 38 large papers, in which samples had been done up; there were a great many more there—on 5th September I went to Snow's house with Mr. Lamer, and said I had called respecting two boxes of sultanas which had been taken from the warehouse yesterday—he said "I know nothing about that; I will tell you the truth; I did take them; I went yesterday and saw Massey, and he asked me to bring the boxes out"—Mr. Lamer said "You know very well neither you or Massey have a right to take parcels out in that way"—he said "I am very sorry"—I said "There was also a large brown</p>

Wren, Sussex House, Brook Lane, Wood Green," the same address as is on the other label—Snow said at the Mansion House "Massey introduced me to Goddard about March last, and Massey and I went to Goddard's house and had a drive; I have had dealings with him about a dozen times; I took out for him the parcel I took out for myself."</p>

I live at 25, Church Street, Islington—the prisoner is my husband—I have been married to him eight years and a-half—I had five children by him—on the night of 18th May we went to bed as vsual—we had a few words—he called me fearful names—up to Easter we had been very happy and comfortable, then he seemed very strange in his manner—he complained a great deal of his head—he consulted Dr. Stevens—one week he said he could not work—on the morning of the 19th May he got up at his usual time, about 6.30, and proceeded as if he was going to his work—he had pretty well dressed, and he kissed me and said "Good morning" as usual—he asked me to come down to the shop and meet him—he is a blacksmith—I said I would meet him—I said "Shall I come down straight to the shop?"—he said, "No, stop at Old Street comer, and I will see you there"—I said "All right"—up to that time there had been no words between us—I then laid down on my bed to rest—he was walking about the room, and I felt a blow at the back of my head, and I do not remember anything more—he seemed quite sober over night—I was taken to the hospital, and then to the infirmary, where I was confined on 18th July—I beg of you to be as lenient as you can to my husband.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> About a fortnight after Easter he went and saw a doctor about his state of mind—I wished him to go; he had been sleeping very badly—he started up in the night, and said he saw faces in the room; I think that was a week before this occurred—he was very strange the day the doctor was fetched to him, he did not seem to know in the least what he was doing—he called me fearful names, raving dreadfully without any cause—he was under a delusion with regard to me, thinking cruelly that I had done something that I had not done, and he was very violent both in his actions and words—up to that time he was very good and kind as a husband and father—I heard his mother say something about two cousins in a lunatic asylum, but I do not know it—he drank a great deal during the winter months, but he was not a drunkard as a rule.</p>

               <p>brought him to my house and called me up—he was in a very wildly excited condition—he told me among other things that his wife had been taking chemicals to enclose herself with other men—he produced a small bottle, and said she had been taking some of that stuff—there were a few drops of discoloured fluid in it, and he seemed to associate that in his mind with what he said—he said that when he went out he saw men standing about the street corner, and he had an idea that they were watching for an opportunity to come to his wife—he also told me that he believed his wife was unfaithful, and that he had caught some foul disease from her—on Monday, 7th, I saw him again—he was in bed—I was called to him in the after part of the day at his lodging in Church Street—he was then in the same excited condition, and repeated all those expressions I have mentioned—his wife was then present—I asked her if there was any truth in those matters, and she denied them with tears in her eyes—from my observations on those two occasions I formed a certain opinion, in consequence of which I recommended his wife to apply at once to the relieving officer and get him removed to a place of safety—my opinion was that he was insane, and I recommended that he should be put under restraint; I thought he would commit a violent act either upon himself or some other person—he had these delusions, and he was violent, agitated, and excitable, causing very great alarm in his family; his eyes were suffused, and his whole countenance was that of an excited person; his manner was so violent you could hardly be safe with him, I felt that myself—I considered it necessary that he should be put under restraint.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were no signs of drink about him when he came to me; in my opinion he had not been drinking—his delusion was all about his wife and this stuff she had taken—he made many other statements which I do not recollect, harping on the same thing, his wife's infidelity—I do not recollect having seen him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer at Holloway Prison—the prisoner was admitted there on 21st May, and has been constantly attended by me ever since—when he came in he was excited and restless, walking up and down; when you spoke to him he glanced about furtively, and when questioned he said he had injured his wife because she was unfaithful to him, that she was in the habit of having connection with a dozen men a day; that she used to stand at the window and beckon tham in, and used to tie the curtain of the window up so that they could see that she was prepared to receive them; he was full of various ideas of that kind, also that she had given him the venereal disease—I afterwards had him removed to the hospital because he was very violent—he had an attack of what was almost mania, shouting and declaring that they were hooting and yelling at him through the window—that was about a month after his admission—I was called to him on that occasion—that continued for two or three days, it then passed away, but he still persists to a certain extent that his wife is unfaithful to him, and in the same delusions, although he is very much better—I have heard the evidence of Dr. Stevens, and I concur with him that the prisoner is a proper subject to be put under restraint—just after the attack of almost maniacal passion, it took about five men to get him into the police van.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188809170024"/>
               <p>prison rules perfectly—he could understand what I said to him and answer rationally on some subjects; he has sufficient understanding to know perfectly the nature of the crime with which he is charged—he is now in a condition to take his trial, so as to know the proceedings that are going on—he has no other delusion but that about his wife, except on the one occasion when he spoke of hearing them yelling and shouting at him outside—that was the maniacal attack—he was very excited then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If there was insanity in his family that would strengthen my opinion, hereditary insanity would do so—the time when it took five men to get him into the van was about two days after the violent attack—his calmness afterwards is not inconsistent with his having had an attack of fury when suffering from mental disease—a calm often follows the paroxysm, and in that calm a person would be able to understand what is passing, although the disease may still be present, only dormant—I formed the opinion I have expressed, from his delirious and his other symptoms.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the Children's Hospital in Hackney Road—the deceased child was brought there about 9 o'clock on the night of 8th July—he was practically dying; the heart could just be felt; there was a very large tumour, 6 inches by 4, under the left side of the head, and there was a graze as if caused by the wheel passing over it—there was a groove three inches long on the left side behind the ear, into which I could get my finger—the skull was fractured, and the boy died from those injuries.</p>

I am the prisoner's brother-in-law; he married my sister—on 26th June they lived at 19, Grove Street—I was in a public-house that evening between 7 and 8 o'clock—the prisoner and his wife came in—they left together to go home—the prisoner was drunk; hit wife had had some drink, but was not quite so drunk—I was perfectly sober—I went with the prisoner, his wife, and a little boy, and the prisoner knocked at 19, Grove Street, and a little girl came to the street door—the prisoner went in, I followed, and his wife followed me—when we got in the room where they were living, the prisoner's wife started telling me what he had done on the previous night, the 25th—she said "You flung a paraffin oil lamp at me last night; it was alight, and if it had caught my clothes I would have been set on fire"—she had a cut on the forehead, and showed me the sticking-plaster on the cut from the lamp—I said "Well, if you wanted to hit her you might have used your hand and not have hit her with a paraffin oil lamp"—he did not answer—he was sitting on a chair against the front room window, and I was sitting on another—he drew a knife from a cloth—I stood up and said "What have you got that for, Dick?"—he drove at me in the jaw with the knife—his wife screamed, and he stabbed her—I said "Dick, do you know what you are doing?"—he kept driving at one and then the other—I received eight wounds—I was taken to the London Hospital; I</p>

I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—on Tuesday night, June 26th, I saw Barry about 8.30 p.m.—I found a wound on his left shoulder about three inches long under the skin and going lower down—it was dangerous because it narrowly escaped the larnyx—he had another wound near the left ear, an inch in length, and extending downwards 21/2 inches, and another wound on the left cheek about 21/2 inches, extending to another wound on the left side of the lower lip through an opening about an inch and a half in length—there was also an incised wound on the centre of the forehead two inches long, and about a quarter of an inch deep, and another on the left hand between the thumb and finger 21/2 inches in length—the wound could not have been caused by grasping a knife, because there was a scratch at the back of the hand as if the knife had slipped—there was also a punctured wound on the inner side of the right wrist half an inch deep—he was under surgical care in the hospital about four weeks—he has some marks on the left side of his face, which are likely to remain permanent—the same night I saw the prisoner's wife, who had been brought to the hospital about 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour before the prosecutor—she had four wounds—her jaw was splintered and her arm punctured—all the wounds were such as might have been inflicted by a carving knife or instrument of that description—the wife was in the hospital about a fortnight.</p>

I am unmarried—I live at 25, Rhodes Street, Barnsbury, Islington—I made the prisoner's acquaintance about Christmas last, and before August last had been friendly and walked out with him—the acquaintance ceased on Bank Holiday—I saw him between the 6th and 11th August—on the 11th I went to the Alexandra Palace with Mr. Bovington—on returning to London, about 10.30 p.m., I went into the Brewery Tap in Holloway Road with Mr. Bovington—I saw the prisoner outside—he followed us into the same compartment—he stood at the bar for about 20 minutes and then went out—in about 10 minutes he came in with five or six young men—he asked me whether I was going out with him or with the other one, meaning Bovington—I told him I did not want him—he said "I'll cut your b——throat"—he took his hand out of his pocket, and struck at my throat—I put my hand up to stop the blow, and cut my finger on the right hand—I saw blood, and fainted—I found myself in, Mr. Sworn's surgery; the prisoner was brought in—I next saw him at the police-station.</p>

On 30th August, about 7 p.m., I was watching in the Grand Hall at Euston Station, and saw Peacock sitting on a seat, looking at some luggage—Smith was walking about the hall; they joined one another and conversed—at 7.10 Johnson joined me—the prisoners continued to watch the luggage, and about 7.45 a porter brought a barrow of luggage, and a lady and gentleman followed him—the porter left to get some labels, and the prisoners walked about, and returned to the hall again, and sat down—a gentleman placed his coat and bag on a slab—Smith walked up to it, looked at it, and went into the booking-office—Peacock placed his hand on it, but seeing a policeman in uniform he walked into the booking-office—they then returned to the hall, sat down, and remained till 9.10, when Smith got up and walked to a barrow of luggage and picked up this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Peacock walked close behind him—they were leaving the station by a side gate—I stopped Smith and asked him what he was going to do with the bag—he said "It is mine"—I said "You have stolen it"—he said "I have not"—Johnson took Peacock, and they were taken to the inspector's office.</p>

               <p>penal servitude, which was passed on me by the Recorder at this Court on July 7th, when I was convicted of stealing a gelding, van, set of harness, and other property of John Gibbon in May—about a fortnight before I went with my pony and cart to Mr. Davies's in Bond-street, I saw Lyons for the first time and spoke to him—I did not see him between that and the occasion when I went with the pony and cart—the first time I saw Shuttleworth was at Smithfield, Market, about a fortnight before he came and hired me; I had no conversation with him, I only saw him up there—on Thursday, May 17th, he came alone to my stables, 4, James Street, New Cut, Lambeth, where I had a pony and cart—I was hawking flowers—Taylor was with me at the time, I had met him one day at Covent Garden, and, knowing him by sight, I asked him to come and give me a hand—I was 20 last October—I and Taylor were coming from dinner, and we met Shuttleworth in James Street between 2 and 3 p.m., he was waiting for me in front of my stable, where he had been inquiring for me—he said "I want to know if you would mind shifting some things for me"—I said, "No. When will you want me?" he said "About 6 o'clock to-morrow morning"—I said, "All right, I will be at the stable ready for you; instead of going home I will sleep at the stable for you, to be there ready for you"—Taylor heard that—I and Taylor slept in the loft of the stable that night—next morning I heard some one Knocking at 4 o'clock—we got up and let Shuttleworth in, he said, "Are you ready?"—I said "No, I aid not know you were coming so early"—he said, "All right," and walked up the yard with me and Taylor, and helped me to harness the pony—we put the pony to and all three drove off in the cart, Shuttleworth directing me where to go as we went along; he said, "I want you to drive towards Bond Street"—and as we got to Bond Street, he said, "Down here," that was Avery Row—I drew up in front of No. 3, Mr. Davies's warehouse—Shuttleworth got down first, and ran up the steps and first gave the door a shove and it seemed as if it was opened inside—whether it was or not I cannot say, I did not see anybody—I should say the door was locked and then unlocked from inside—I and Taylor followed after him into the warehouse—Shuttleworth walked into the office, just inside the door, and got a book and opened it, and said "I want you to put these seven boxes of eggs up and that box of butter"—he pointed to some boxes which stood on the top of one another just round by the side of the door, near it—I said "All right"—I took my coat off, put the nose bag on the pony, and came back—in the meantime Taylor had got another hat on, a brown one, such as this; he had a black one before; I don't know where he got it from—after Shuttleworth told me to load up he walked up the street; he was outside when I was loading up the boxes—I and Taylor loaded up the eight boxes on to the cart—after we had done so Shuttleworth came and said to me "I want you to take them round to your stable until I come round about 4 o'clock this afternoon"—I had taken the nose bag off the pony, and Taylor and I drove off, leaving Shuttleworth standing on the shop step; the door was then open—I took the eight cases back, and left them just inside my stable—at 1 o'clock that afternoon I was with Taylor in the stable when the prisoners came in together—I had not seen Lyons for about a fortnight—I had had no conversation with him before this afternoon about the matter—Shuttleworth said "I want these names taken off the egg boxes, the red marks"—the egg boxes had only</p>

               <p>red marks on; the marks were the same as these black ones on this butter box, I think—he produced a bit of glass, and all four of us tried to take off the marks with the glass, and some sand paper too he had; that did not take off the marks quickly enough—he asked me if I would go and get a plane—I said "No"—he said "All right," and went out, and bought a spokes have or something—when he came back he used it, and Lyons the sand paper, and me and Taylor the glass—we then soon got the names off the seven egg boxes—I do not think he saw the butter—Shuttleworth pulled out a bottle of ink stuff and a brush, and a letter in the form of "A," and he put three "A's" on the ends of the boxes that we had taken the names off—he then said he wanted the boxes taken to Mill Row, Kingsland Road—I cannot say if he lives there; it was the first time I went there—I said "I don't know where it is exactly"—he said "The first turning before you come to the bridge"—I said "I don't know where that is"—he said "At any rate Lyons will go with you, and Taylor will go with me on a'<hi rend="italic">bus</hi> "—I loaded up the boxes in the cart, and went to a public-house, and Shuttleworth and Lyons paid for some<lb/>thing to drink for the lot of us; it was between 4 and 5 in the afternoon then—then Lyons and I drove in the cart to Mill Row—the only thing we left at the stable was the box of butter, off which the marks had not boen removed—we got to Mill Row about a quarter of an hour before Shuttle<lb/>Worth and Taylor—when they came up Shuttleworth said "I want you to unload and take them to the back of my house"—then I and Taylor unloaded the cases, and put them in the yard at the back of the house; Shuttleworth and Lyons were talking together—after we had done it I came back to them, and Shuttleworth gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said "I forgot all about the box of butter; I have left it at your stable, and I will give you that too"—I said "All right," and I and Taylor drove back to my yard—next day I was arrested; I had a stolen pony in my possession—the box of butter was found in the stable by the police at the same time as the pony—while we were waiting for Shuttleworth outside his place for a quarter of an hour Lyons took me to a public-house, and asked me if I wanted to buy a pair of opera glasses; he showed me a white pair—I said "No"—he said "I only want 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them"—I said "No, they are no use to me"—while we were driving to Kingsland Lyons said "I hope there ain't no <hi rend="italic">tecs</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I was quite surprised, and said "What do you mean?"—I did not think at that time there was anything wrong in moving the property, I thought it was a perfectly honest transaction from beginning to end—Shuttleworth did not pay Taylor; he gave me the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was like master and Taylor my man—Shuttleworth knew nothing about Taylor</p>

               <p>I have mentioned before to-day that Shuttleworth said "I forgot all about the butter"—there was no using of glass or spokeshave on that butter box—when I was convicted in 1885 I gave my age as 22; that was my first conviction; I was in custody then three months—since then I have been in the navy; I enlisted as a sailor—I was only out of it six weeks before I was arrested for this affair—I came out on leave; instead of going back I was in prison—White was no friend of mine; I don't know what has become of him—I last saw him at the Old Bailey, when he was let off because he was only like having a ride with me—he stood by my side in the dock—1 never lived in Stamford Street; I never had premises there—I told Mr. Bowley, of Brixton, when I applied to him to let me the stable in Lower Marsh, that my name was Thomas Wood, and that I lived at 62, Stamford Street; that was not true—I got the key on 7th May—I did not steal the pony from Mr. Gibbons on 23rd April; I bought it at Smithfield Market; it was the only pony found in my possession—he says a tarpaulin, six baskets, two sacks, a shovel, a fork, collar, and traces, all belonging to Mr. Gibbons, and stolen with the pony on,23rd April, were found in this stable which I took on 7th May; I don't know if they were stolen between 23rd April and 7th May—when I took the stable a man lent me a barrow with those things in—I don't know the date I bought it; I bought the pony directly I took the stable almost—Shuttleworth knows who I bought it of; he was standing alongside the man; I have said that before—I bought the pony at the market, and all the other things were in—I never stole a pony from Warren, a costermonger, of Notting Hill—I bought that at Smithfield Market—I know Edge Street, Notting Hill—Warren said he knew me six or seven years ago as Jockell—I did not rob him—he did not say I did—I heard his statement before the Magistrate at Brentford—they found a pony, bridle, traces, collar, loin cloth, dog, rabbit, and hutch in my possession; they turned out to be his—they were in my stable—I don't know if they were stolen—I did not steal them—I won't say Shuttleworth knew of my buying that—that was bought at Smithfield, and the barrow, not till after 7th May—I had the stable before for the other pony—I did not steal any pony, I reckon I have been improperly convicted—I did not know anything was stolen when I was convicted before—I did not know the pony came from Warren; I know nothing about breaking into his place and taking the things—I did not steal on 4th May a waggon and other things belonging to Hewitt; I had no waggon in my possession—a sack of wheat which he identified was found by the police at my stable; I bought straw and this sack of wheat off a man who came round to me in a waggon; I can't exactly say the date—I first had a stable just opposite the one in the New Cut; I left it because the wet came in—I had got the use of that stable a fortnight before 7th May—I moved across to the stable in the New Cut the tarpaulin and Gibbons's and Hewitt's property—I told Mr. Bowley I had two ponies in my possession at the same time; both turned out to be stolen—I did not know it—I have been convicted innocently—I don't know if Mr. Baker lived at Notting Hill near the costermonger—I have not seen the costermonger for six or seven years-the police never said they saw me with Baker's cart—the man I bought the barrow of brought the cart round to me and took his barrow back—I, White, and Taylor were seen in the cart, with a shaft broken; it was</p>

               <p>found at my place on the 9th and identified—I had only had the cart three or four days—the cart White was driving when taken into custody, and out of which I and Taylor had just got, was another little cart—I only had two carts—I had 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I came out of the navy—the cart with the broken shaft was only lent to me by the man when he took the barrow away—I cannot say how many hours I was driving about on the Thursday before I was arrested—I might have been out once or twice in the cart with White and Taylor—I and Taylor did not agree that we would tell the Jury that White knew nothing about it; I said the truth—White knew nothing about it, he only came for a ride—Taylor was convicted—I don't suppose White is here—I first had a statement written down in my presence in Pentonville by Inspector Stroud; it was read over to me; I don't know the date; it was in August—that only happened once—I suppose I was brought up to give evidence against Shuttleworth on 4th August, a day or two after my statement was written down by Stroud—I was at the police court twice; I don't think Lyons was there the first time—I was there on 7th and 15th, I think—Stroud did not that I know of say to Taylor in the cells in my hearing "Have you got your paper?"—I did not hear Taylor say "Yes, sir, I can sing it like a bird," nothing like it, if he had I should have heard him——I was in the adjoining cell to Taylor; I could talk to him perfectly freely—he had not got a paper to my knowledge—I did not hear Taylor say when Shuttleworth was brought out "Pay for a pot of coffee for us, governor, and we won't make it hot for you"—Taylor said he was hungry, and I heard Shuttleworth say to Taylor "I will buy you as much as you can eat if you will only say what I want you to"—he did not know I was in the third cell, and he thought he could get over Taylor—Taylor said nothing to him—I don't know exactly what time it was when I got to Shuttieworth's place with the cases on the Friday six guineas were not paid to me by Shuttleworth in the presence of four or five persons—he did not require me to sign a receipt which his wife wrote—I did not mark, nor was I told I must sign, nor did I sign "Wood"—a bit of dirty paper was first passed by me at the police-court; I did not take any notice of it—a paper was shown to me and I swore it was not my writing—the word "Wood" was not written by me—I carried the whole seven or eight cases at the same time—Lyons rode with me to show me the way, and Taylor was left to come with Shuttleworth.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LAWLESS</hi>. I might have seen Lyons about three times before—I did not say at the police court that he was a stranger; it was the first time I had seen him in the egg business—he was a stranger to me in the egg business—I had spoken to him before—only Shuttleworth came in the morning at 4 o'clock, Lyons did not come—Shuttleworth knocked at the stable door—I did not see Lyons at the place in Bond Street, but Taylor heard somebody moving downstairs directly the door was opened, I and Taylor heard a noise down below—I don't know that I ever said a word about that before, I have not been questioned about it—Shuttleworth made the appointment to meet at 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I was then with Taylor, and the two prisoners came together and knocked at the door and asked for me; a woman lived over the stable—then I saw Lyons for the first time in the egg business—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188809170039"/>
               <p>Lyons spoke about the detectives on the ride, and about the opera glasses while we were waiting for Shuttleworth—I said at the police court he said, "If you happen to thieve at any time we will buy it"—I told the detective he said "Anything from a diamond to a pin"—I said before the Magistrate "Anything from a diamond to a pin," and I remember now they did not write it down—the deposition was read over to me and I signed it—White had nothing to do with this robbery—he was convicted of it wrongly—he merely came for a ride with me the day we were caught—I passed under the name of Wood at the stables I rented—I have passed under the three names of Swaine, Smith, and Wood—the reason I don't go under my right name is that I don't want my friends outside and those in the service to know—the four of us scraped the names off the boxes—I said at the police court Shuttle<lb/>worth took some glass out of his pocket and said, "I want you to get these names off; Lyons, Taylor, and I then scraped the names off"—Shuttleworth began to take part too.</p>

Shuttleworth was present at Smithfield Market when I bought the first pony—he stood alongside the man I bought it of praising its good qualities—I did not see him between that time and the time he came to my premises—he knew my address by hearing me tell the man I bought the pony and borrowed the barrow of where I lived, so that he might come for the barrow—I had had that first pony about four weeks—in my address to the jury on my trial, I told what I said just now about Shuttleworth—I heard Shuttleworth say to Taylor, "I will buy you as much as you can eat, if you only say as much as I want you to," that was when I was first put against him—I was in the cells at the back of the Court—I heard nothing more pass between Shuttleworth and Taylor—at that time I heard no mention of Lyons by Shuttleworth, only I saw Lyons go past with Shuttleworth into a cell on that occa<lb/>sion—I could hear them talking; quarrelling, I think, with one another in their cell; I did not hear what they said, but Taylor did—I gave no receipt at all; he merely gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the doorstep, and said there was the box of butter left at the stables, and I drove away satisfied—I cannot write; you will find that if you go to the service.</p>

My warehouse was looked from without with a key, it has two doors—the outer ones have bolts on the inside top and bottom, and by drawing back the bolts the doors fly open; in addition to the bolts and a catch lock there is a key which is used from the outside—if locked from the outside by drawing the bolts inside it can be opened; those outer doors are taken off during the daytime—inside the outer doors are a pair of plate glass doors, which are fastened by two bolts inside and a lock on the outside, both pairs can be opened by dropping the bolts—they could not open the doors from the outside—the duty of locking the warehouse up is entrusted to my clerk Roberts—he has since left me and is in Wales—it would not be the duty of the person who locked up to go round and see if anybody was concealed on the premises before he left—boxes were piled up about the place—if a person were in the warehouse we should see him, but if he had gone down in the cellar we should not—there is a cellar leading by a wooden staircase from the back of the warehouse—Roberts</p>

I am a widow, living at 4, James Street, Lower Harsh, Lambeth—there is a stable at the back of that house—I remember seeing in the stable-yard and near it last May Smith and Taylor—on the Friday before Whit Monday I saw Shuttleworth between 4 and 5 o'clock at my house—I opened the door to him—Lyons, who was with him, said "Are there persons in the name of Wood living here?"—I said "I am sure I do not know; there is no person of the name of Wood living here"—he said "There's young men who occupies stabling at the back here"—I said "There is young men, but I am sure I don't know their names"—I said I would make inquiries, and I asked my sister, Mrs. Bennett—afterwards I came back and said to Shuttleworth and Lyons "There is young men at the back of the yard, but they have gone out"—Lyons said "If they come in before I come back, tell them they ought to be over at Whitechapel by 5 o'clock"—Shuttleworth heard all the conversation, and stood beside Lyons, who spoke—they went away, and came back in about half an hour, rang the bell, and asked if the young men had come back—I said "No; I have not seen them"—about that moment I looked down the street and saw Smith and Taylor, and said "They are the young men"—on that the prisoners went and joined them, and had some conversation with them—I could not tell where they went—shortly after that on the, same day they harnessed the pony and cart, put some half boxes of eggs into it, and drove away with Smith and Taylor in it—that was about half an hour afterwards—I next saw Shuttleworth at the station after he was in custody, on the August Bank Holiday—I identified him from among other people—about 15th August I saw Lyons in the police-court—his appearance was not the same—his moustache was off, and he had a different coloured dress.</p>

Shuttleworth at Marlborough-Street, where I identified him from many others without difficulty—on 18th May, when he was in the yard, I did not see a pony and cart—afterwards, about 8 p. m.

All I had to do with the matter in May against White and the two Woods was that I and Stroud made inquiries as to the property found in their possession—I visited them at Holloway with Stroud—I was present when Stroud wrote down the statement—I took Shuttleworth with a warrant, after the convicts had made their statements, about 4th August—I did not know between 4th August and 14th that Shuttleworth had subpœnaed Lyons as his witness—there was a hearing on 7th August against Shuttleworth only, and the next hearing was on the 14th—Lyons did not attend at the police-court to give evidence, because we saw and arrested him there—I did not know what he came for—I found on him the subpoena that Shuttle<lb/>worth's solicitor had served on him—he was charged on the 15th—on the 4th August Shuttleworth told me that the Wood brothers had been introduced to him by Lyons in consequence of Lyons bringing the half case of eggs—the receipt was not shown to me before it was shown to the Magistrate—we knew nothing about it till it was produced—something was produced in the shape of a receipt before the Magistrate—I went to see Shuttleworth a week before his arrest at the house in Went<lb/>worth Street—I had been to see him between 19th May and that date, and I kept observation there night after night, but I did not see him—I asked his wife where he was—she said "In the country," but did not know when he would be back, or where he was—that was after May—I did not ask her to make an appointment with him for me to come—I know the man well—he has got several children—he has a son-in-law living at Mill Row—I do not know if the son-in-law manages that place; I have left the neighbourhood for some time—I believe the place at Mill Row is principally kept for storing eggs and butter—some member of the family lives there—I believe Shuttleworth lives in Wentworth Street—I had nothing to do with making the charge against Smith and Taylor—the wife allowed me to search when I went there before Shuttleworth was in custody, when it was said he was in the country—I know the wife very well—there was no obstruction to my making a thorough search of the premises.</p>

I am shopboy in James Shuttleworth, junior's, employment at 4, Wentworth Street; I have been there two years—at first I was shopboy to the prisoner—on 17th May Shuttleworth's back parlour was being made into a store room, and for that purpose the furniture had to be moved upstairs into the back room—during the whole of that day I was on the premises, and Shuttleworth was at home helping to move the things upstairs—I slept there every night in the back room, in the room next to where Mr. and Mrs. Shuttleworth slept—I got up at 6 a. m.; the milkman called me; I generally heard him; if I did not Shuttleworth called me—no one can get into the house from outside without being let in from inside, because there is no key outside and there is a bolt to one of the doors—on the Friday morning after the alterations Shuttleworth was just coming downstairs when I got up; he was dressed except his coat—I remember that time, because on the following Monday I was to have my day's holiday—on the Friday Lyons came and asked me whether Shuttleworth was in, and I told him no—I did not see him again afterwards.</p>

I live at 21, Orwell Place, Edinburgh—I was confidential clerk to Mr. John Barry Russell, at 15, Hope Street, Edinburgh, a wine merchant—in (September, 1887, Mr. Russell advertised for a London agent, and eventually engaged Fearns on commission—Fearns procured the orders produced from Wells and Co., amounting to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and from Goodwin and Co., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4 guineas, 2 guineas, and 4 guineas; and from Lewis and Co., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and other orders, amounting altogether to 149<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—of that amount only 10 or 12 guineas were paid—we supplied the goods in the ordinary way of trade.</p>

               <p>by—the words used were such as "Don't you have any more of this"; "I have you in my mind"; "I will fix you"—Chapman said "Perhaps I will be able to fix you, if you was to try"—there were a lot of other words, amounting to nothing—the prisoner said "Mind, I will make this vessel a hot-bed for a lot of you"—after that we turned in—Chapman said "I might be as good a man as you, "something like that—at 12 o'clock we were on watch again till 4 o'clock—nothing particular took place during the watch; we all turned in again; we had to go to work again at 8 o'clock—we were called at 20 minutes past 7, but 8 was our time to go on deck; I went to sleep at 4—I did not know at the time that the prisoner went to his bunk, but he told me afterwards, at New York before the Consul, that he was up at 6; it was just merely a remark that he made; he said nothing more about it—about three or four minutes before 20 minutes to 7 I was aroused by hearing moans or groaning—I thought perhaps some man was in a nightmare, and I hastened to turn out to rouse him, and to my surprise I saw the prisoner standing over the bunk of Chapman; I also noticed that he had his left hand on Chapman's forehead or hair, and Chapman's face was covered with blood—the prisoner had his right hand at Chapman's left breast; he was still crying" Oh, oh!"—I did not thoroughly understand what the prisoner was doing at the moment; but while I saw this, Parry, who slept between me and Chapman, awoke; he turned his head to look in the direction of the prisoner, and saw what he was doing, and he uttered a terrified cry—the prisoner then drew his hand away from Chapman's breast, and I noticed that he had a knife in his hand, and the blood gushed from the wound a distance of four feet, to the paint work—he then made a sudden move towards the bunk where Parry was, seized him by the throat, and plunged the knife into his breast—I stepped back two paces—at that moment Harris awoke; he slept on the port side—he said "Whatever is the matter here?"—I said "There is stabbing going on here; can't you see?"—he said "Oh, dear! oh, dear!"—the prisoner was at that moment standing by the bunk of Parry—he picked up a shirt out of Parry's bunk, and coolly and deliberately wiped his knife on it—I can't say that it was Parry's shirt; he took it out of Parry's bunk; it might have been his own shirt—he held the knife up to the light, and I then recognised it as belonging to him—I had seen it three or four times a day (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), that is the knife; there is a stamp of the Sailors' Home, Well Street, upon the blade; I also marked it privately at New York by direction of the officials there—after the prisoner had wiped the knife I stepped back two paces, and placed a table between me and him—he never spoke a word, but walked up the ladder, which was alongside of him, to the main deck with the knife in his hand—at that moment able seaman Hunt was coming down to call the watch, to give us time to wash and get breakfast—he stopped midway on the ladder—I said "You had better go back," and I sent him to the officer—the prisoner had gone from my sight then—the bunks are in two tiers, one above the other, on the starboard side—on an upper tier, right over Parry, the prisoner slept—I slept in the next bunk to the prisoner; my head came to his feet—Parry and Chapman slept in the same bunk on the lower tier, further forward, and Harris on the port side, opposite—I went over to Parry's bunk, and called his name; I got no answer; I put my hand on his head; I found a slight pulsation, then I heard a gurgling come</p>

               <p>in his throat, and I knew that he was dead—I left him, and went to Chapman, and repeated the same there—he died in a few seconds; they both died in a few seconds—I prepared the bodies for burial; I saw the wounds; I saw a wound on Chapman's left breast, about an inch from the nipple, and the same on Parry, but one was inside and the other out, one was on the right side and the other over the left nipple—I also saw a cut on Chapman's lip, and his face was covered with blood—I gave an account to the captain of what had occurred, and I saw the prisoner in irons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was two days after we went out that the prisoner said "I will put something into you that will make you sleep a long time"—he never did that—I made no complaint to the captain; I gave an account to the captain, when an entry in the log was made; I was examined as a witness before the Consul at New York—I don't believe I said a word then about the prisoner having threatened me two days after leaving England; it was at the Commission at New York, the examination before the Consul was only a repetition of the examination before the Commission—I said before the Commission that the prisoner was as friendly with me as he was with anybody on board, I consider that he was; he had no trouble with anybody that I am aware of, prior to the occasion on 8th July—he was a peculiar man; one of the most peculiar men on board; he was morose and unsociable, he very seldom spoke to anybody except in a very abrupt manner, and not more than answering questions; he did not complain in my hearing of not being able to sleep well—I think he was under the impression that everybody in the ship was against him—I said before the Consul-General he seemed to think every one was against him somehow or other, although no one scarcely spoke to him; there was no ground for such a sup<lb/>position, it was totally without foundation; he performed his duty as well as anybody—neither I nor any of my companions annoyed him in any way, we treated him with consideration and kindness—he was a perfect stranger to me when he joined the ship, and, as far as I know, to everybody on board—the altercation on 8th July was between Chapman and him, Parry took no part in it—on 9th July, at the time I awoke and saw what was taking place, not a single word had occurred, I heard no provocation whatever—he appeared quite calm and collected—I was astonished at the calmness he exhibited—he did not appear to be in any passion—directly he had killed the two men he went to the shirt and coolly wiped the knife, and coolly and collectedly walked up the ladder—the knife is one they give out at the Sailors' Home for their work; it is not one that opens, it is a sheath knife commonly used by sailors, we all carry them.</p>

I am surgeon at Holloway Prison, and have had experience of lunatics there—I have had the prisoner under my control—I found him suffering from delusions and hallucinations—he is under the delusion that stuff enters into his system, causing him burning and painful sensations, also causing things which he looks at to shimmer—he is also under the delusion that he is annoyed by people following him in order to hurt him, and he hears voices, and there are many other signs—he has a constant pain in the head, gripping pain in the forehead; he is sleepless, and takes but little notice of his surroundings—he is under the delusion that every man on the ship, including the passengers, wore against him, and that they used to cause him this annoyance; that he used to hear them talking about him, saying "Give it</p>

               <p>the son of a bitch," and he states that he was sleepless the whole time he was on the ship—he has been restless while with us; he has had sleep, but he has not slept well—he has been in the infirmary from the 6th August to the 19th—these delusions and hallucinations are common symptoms of insanity, the belief that everybody is engaged in a conspiracy against you, and that you are being injured or annoyed by poison and the hearing of voices—he told me that six or seven years ago he had been before Lunacy Commissioners in San Francisco from an attack of delirium tremens, and as a result of that attack he laboured under the delusion of persecution, that he was followed by men who were employed by certain boarding-house masters to prevent his getting a lodging at any other boarding-house, and that they wished to hurt him, and so he applied to the police in San Francisco for protection, that they kept him one night in the police-station, and he was placed in a cell with six other men, and that during the night he was very much annoyed by these men, who blew stuff from their nostrils, which entered into him, and turned him quite black, and gave him horrible sensations of burning and pain; that on that occasion he was taken to what he described as a home for inebriates, where he was kept for 10 days that on two occasions he was taken before Commissioners of Lunacy, and at the expiration of that period he was discharged—I formed the opinion that he is insane—I have been in Court and heard the evidence—I think he did not know the nature and quality of the act he committed; I think he was not conscious that he was doing a wrong act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have no doubt that he believed in the statements he made to me—he now knows the nature of these proceedings, that he is on his trial for murder; he is able to appreciate his position—when I first saw him in the prison he appeared to know that he was detained on a charge of the murder of two of his shipmates, Chapman and Parry—in my judgment his is a case of chronic lunacy; I think he has been a lunatic ever since the matters occurred at San Francisco—notwithstanding that, I should think he was able to do the ordinary work of a seaman.—he understands what is said to him, and can make himself understood in reply—I believe he can read and amuse himself by reading—with the exception of these delusions he has conducted himself in a rational way in the gaol; he has always obeyed orders, and conformed to the prison rules—after the 10 days' detention at San Francisco he was released, and resumed his ordinary avocations as a seaman, and has maintained himself ever since—I think his is a case of alcoholic insanity; I mean by that that he has been drinking to such excess for years as to produce absolute disease—I think absence of an adequate motive is one great reason for his not knowing the nature and quality of the act that he did—I have known many prisoners commit crimes without any adequate motive—I think that the coolness and deliberation with which, after stabbing the men, he went up to the officer in charge rather shows that he did not appreciate the wrongfulness of his act—at that precise time he might have known that he had committed the act, but I do not think he knew he was doing wrong at the instant when he killed these men; that is my view—while he was actually committing the act he told me that he found himself doing it—he then appeared to have a memory that he had killed them—he said that all on board were against him—he</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188809170078"/>
               <p>that he had been suffering since 1881 or 1882, worse at times—he spoke of this persecution in almost all the vessels he had been in with the exception of one, in one he was very comfortable, and not persecuted at all; I imagine he had been worse just before joining the <hi rend="italic">Erin</hi>—he had been drinking hard; of course there would be an aggravation of his symptoms after that; he confesses to having been drinking hard before he joined the vessel—the fact that he had hallucinations when he joined would point to the fact that he was then rather worse than usual—I have been in Court and heard the evidence as to the acts committed. <hi rend="italic">Q,</hi> In your opinion, at the time he committed those acts, was he aware of the nature and quality of the acts he was committing? (<hi rend="italic">This question was put to Mr. Gilbert in the preceding trial, and after some discussion was admitted on the ground that the facts being undisputed it came within the decision of the Judges in McNaughten's case; it was therefore permitted in accordance with that decision to be now put to Dr. Bastian.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not, certainly not the quality of the acts he was committing, he was not capable of comprehending their moral quality; if I may be allowed I would say that the fact of his saying he had provocation would only show to me that he acted as a consequence of his delusion, the fact that he was in no passion proves that there was no provocation in the ordinary sense of the word, but that he acted from provocation as the direct outcome of his delusions I think his perfect coolness and calmness after the committal of these acts is strong evidence that at the time he was insane to an extreme degree; that is the sort of thing that we very frequently meet with in association with these insane acts; insane persons very frequently confess the crime immediately, and give themselves up. (<hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. So do plenty of sane persons.) The absence of motive is a very strong indication of insanity; in this case there had been no quarrel with Parry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think the prisoner is very much better now than he was at the time these acts were committed—I think that he now under<lb/>stands the nature of these proceedings, and that he knows he is being tried for his life for the murder of these men—he recollects that he stabbed them, although he can assign no reason for it—my opinion is that he killed them acting under many delusions; I do not think that one of those delusions was that he had received provocation, I do not think that was his meaning when he used that expression, what he meant was that all this blowing of stuff and those delusions constituted the provocation—there is nothing in such delusions that would prevent his getting his living as a seaman, in the same way as a multitude of other lunatics who are very dangerous—at the time he gave himself up to the chief officer he knew, doubtless, that he had stabbed two men, and that in a certain sense it was a wrong act, but whether or not he knew it adequately I would not say; there are a great many degrees of completeness of knowledge—one of the blows he received 11 years ago was in drunken row, when he was struck over the head by a policeman—his memory was good as to that, I don't say that his memory was affected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have not the least doubt that he is insane; I believe that at the time he did this he was not aware of the quality of the act he was committing.</p>

               <p>I engaged the prisoner through an advertisement which he answered; he said he was past sixteen—I asked him particularly, because I am not allowed by the Post Office regulations to have anyone under sixteen—his duty was before 4 o'clock to take all the surplus stamps I had on the premises in this box, and my cash takings, gold, notes, and cheques in a canvas bag to be deposited for safe custody with the City Bank, Fore Street—the bag the money was in was about four or five inches long I should think—on Friday, 24th, I was out of town—Miss Coxon and Miss Marriott, my assistants, were there—Miss Marriott was the clerk in charge—I never saw the prisoner again till he was in custody about a week after—I got this post-card on the following Monday—to the best of my knowledge it is in his handwriting—I cannot swear to it—I had a letter from him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was in my service fifteen days—the previous boy I had to discharge for an act of irregularity; it may have amounted to dishonesty—the prisoner had taken the stamps and money to the bank for fifteen days—I went with him on the morning of the first day to introduce him to the bank—he would have every day money in the banker's bag to pay in, varying in amount—Friday was one of our heaviest days—the money would be given to him behind the counter and behind a screen by one of my clerks—people were in the shop—the box containing the stamps has been returned to me through the Metropolitan Railway intact, with stamps to the value of 136<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the boy said in his letter he had put the box and the book on the Metropolitan Railway, hoping they would be returned—the pass-book has not been returned—the box came back to me through the police making inquiries on the day of the robbery—I have examined the contents of the box—the 136<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stamps is made up of stamps from one halfpenny to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I know what money was in the bag from what I have been told—it was an ordinary red bank bag four or five inches long; it would contain 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—there was no silver in it or postal orders, but there were three crossed cheques amounting to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the balance was made up in Bank of England notes, some of which have been stopped—the highest value of the notes was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes—155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—the box would be locked by my clerk before it went away, and the key retained in the office.</p>

               <p>the office, and behind the desk, at the other end of the shop—the desk has a frosted glass, through which you cannot see—he left at 10 minutes to 4—I know his writing very well; I should think this was his writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sent the money and stamps between 3.30 and 4 every day—the stamps were always in this box—any person about there between 3.30 and 4 would see the boy with the box going in the direction of Fore Street every day—we have been doing it for years; nobody has been touched before—people would be in the shop between 3.30 and 4, but they could not see that—the wire-blind looks on to Coleman Street—if persons stood up on the other side of Coleman Street they might see behind the desk, I think—there is a blind to the window from the top; it is not drawn when we are working—the desk is at right angles to the window—a wire railing separates my desk from people in the shop—persons could not see it from the street, unless they went up steps on the other side, because we are elevated from the ground—some of them said before the Magistrate they did not believe there were steps on the other side—you my take it is in all probability impossible to see in from the street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman D</hi> 152). About 12 o'clock at night on Wednesday, 29th August, I saw the prisoner in Bell Street, Edgware Road—he had a peculiar way of looking at people that attracted my attention—I watched him for some little time—he walked across the road, took off his coat and his hat, and hung the hat on some railings outside a shop in Bell Street; he went towards Carlisle Street with his coat on his arm—I took his hat from the railings, and followed him—I overtook him in Carlisle Street, and said to him "Where are you going?"—he said "I am going to bed"—I said "Where?"—he said "56"—I said "56 where?"—he said "Grove Road"—I went with him to Grove-Road, St. John's Wood, to see if he lived there—he rang the bell; that is where his father lives—I rang. the bell at No. 56—his father looked out at the window, and said "All right," and came to the door—I said</p>

               <p>"Is this your son?"—he said "Yes, you know what he is wanted for; he is wanted for absconding with some money, about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from a post-office in the City;" he said if I would wait a minute or two he would come to the station with me; I waited, and we went to the station, when the prisoner was detained—the father asked him where he had been staying, and he said he had been living on his pocket-money, and the father said "You must have been a very foolish boy not to have come home or written"—he said "I couldn't help it, <hi rend="italic">Dad</hi>"—on the way to the station the father and the son had a conversation; I could not say what they were talking about exactly, but I heard the father say "The least said the better"—I took him to the station, where Sergeant Downes, who had charge of the case, came and took it—the father did not give me the letter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I saw the boy he appeared dazed and stupid he did not appear so when he told his father where he had been stopping—I did not search him, but I know a halfpenny was found on him—his father got him something to eat—he ate with a good appetite; he appeared to have been without food for some time—when I saw him he was looking round and turning his eyes on people passing—I was struck by the peculiar way he had of casting his eyes on people—he would walk up in front of persons, stop and look at them, and then fall back.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). The prisoner's father handed in this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the office, and it was given to me—on the 30th August in the early morning, about 4 o'clock, I went to the police-station in Molyneux Street, Edgware Road—the prisoner was given into my charge; he was awaiting my arrival—I told him I was a police-officer from the City, and that he would be charged with stealing a box of money to the amount of about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "I did not steal them, but, as usual, was entrusted to take them to the City Bank in Fore Street; when by some new buildings a man said 'Give me a match?' I was feeling for one in the small pocket of my coat when he snatched the bag of gold from my right hand trousers pocket, and ran along a short street by the side of a railway. I said 'Halloa, what are you doing?' and ran after him; I ran some distance, and I suddenly thought I had left the box and the stamps at the corner of the street; I came back and secured them; by that time I had lost sight of the man; I became bewildered, and did not know what to do; I went to Moorgate Street Station, and took a ticket for Baker Street; I afterwards altered my mind, and went on to Aldersgate Street, thinking I might meet the man. I got into a train there, and purposely left the box and the stamps and the bank-book in the train"—he said he took the ticket from Moor<lb/>gate Street to Baker Street; he said "I should know the man again, I have seen him before," and he gave a minute description of a man—he said he was about between 30 or 40, taller than me, he had a long black coat on, and a hat dented in at the top, he thought it was a hard felt hat; a moustache darker than mine, a rough, red face, and a circular scar round the right eye—I asked him how he supposed the man knew he had money about him—he said he did not know, unless he saw the end of the bag out of his pocket; he said he saw an account in the paper of the robbery, a ad he had written to his father and Mr. D'Arcy telling</p>

               <p>them how it happened; at that time I searched the prisoner—I found a halfpenny only—on the way to the police-court I took him along Fore Street, and asked him to show me the spot where the alleged robbery took place, and he showed me the corner of Fore Street Avenue, that is a new thoroughfare now; it used to be called Maidenhead Court; it is a street leading to the railway station; it leads to the court alongside the station running into Moorfields, but this was at the corner of the avenue; they have just erected new shops and warehouses there; there are a number of workmen there; it is a very busy thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The distance from the spot he pointed out to the Metropolitan Railway is about 50 yards—Abbott of the City Police was with him when he gave this description—Abbott recognised a man of that description—I would not be sure that that man had been in custody—Abbott is a very experienced City officer—Abbott said a man answering that description had been in custody—he said the box had been left in the Metropolitan Railway—it was found under the seat before the in<lb/>formation arrived; in that instance his statement was correct.</p>

In 1876 I was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude and seven years' police supervision, and no officer can say I have not fulfilled the conditions laid down for me. About two months ago I was in the Foresters public-house to look after my son, and Policeman 173 was there in uniform drinking with come persons. He called out "Halloa, Cook, how are you?" That is the name I was convicted in. I went to the station and reported him, and I found that he had told the people he was with, that I was a convict. The inspector told me to come next morning; I did so, and he said to a policeman on the point" Do you know 173?" He said "No. "I said "If it is not 173 it is 73." He said "I will send for 173.

On 10th August, from a communi<lb/>cation made to me, I went with two officers to Finch Lane, and saw the prisoner hand Butler a piece of paper—Butler and the prisoner then went to the Albion public-house, Threadneedle Street, as arranged; Butler left the prisoner there, and went into a suite of offices opposite—I followed, and saw Butler on the staircase, and took the bill from him, and found it corresponded with the one stolen—I went to where the prisoner was standing, and said to Butler "Where did you get this bill from?"—he made no reply—I repeated the question, and Butler said "This man gave them to me," meaning the prisoner, who made no reply—I said "Holloa, Kitsell, it is you, is it? how do you account for this? take him down to the station, and take care he does not destroy anything on the way, I will follow with Butler"—when the charge was read over to him at the station, he said "I know nothing about it, I can account for the bill of exchange; as regards that man, Butler, he is perfectly innocent of any offence respecting the bill, and I think I can prove my innocence in the matter; that is all I have to say to you, you two-faced b----s; I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> you last time, and so I shall this"—he refused his address—I went with Detective Bacon to 5, Haydon Square, Minories, and searched the upper part, where the prisoner and his wife and family</p>

He contended that the robbery must have been committed by some one well acquainted with the habits of the house, and stated that he had had the wine since March, and got it from a house in Jermyn Street, where it had been pledged; that any tools in his tool basket would produce the same marks as the pliers found on him; that the detectives had got him out of three situations by persecuting him, and that he had written to the Police Commissioners about it; that he found the three bills in an envelope at the King's Arms Tavern, and that two men who saw him find them said that he had better keep them, as there was sure to be a reward for them, and in the evening he took them to Butler, who said that two of them were useless, but that he could obtain</hi> 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">advance on the other, for which he promised him</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">not</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and that if he had obtained the money he should have returned it to the owner if he had appeared, and that it was not likely he would have thrown away his liberty by such a crime, having borne a good character for nearly</hi> 60 <hi rend="italic">years.

I am a potman, living at 2, Dyott Street, Blooms<lb/>bury—on 11th August I was at the Coach and Horses, Strand, and left at 12.30, soon after the house was cleared—when I got to Shortt's Gar<lb/>dens I came across some young men, and the prisoner attacked me with a stick, and dealt me two blows—I got away, but I either stumbled or was knocked down, and the prisoner held my head down while others took my watch and chain—one of them said "I have got it," and then they ran away—I got up and went to the corner of Broad Street, and reported it to the policeman on duty, who took me to Charing Cross Hos<lb/>pital—I afterwards picked the prisoner out from a number of others, and know he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was a sudden attack—I saw a man named Crawley at the police-court, and said I was certain he was the man who took my watch, and I know he was, but he was discharged, as two ladies at Brighton swore that he was sleeping at the house of one of them—I have made no mistake, but Sir James Ingham differed from me—I picked Crawley out from other men, and Smith also—I don't believe one of the men had whiskers; there were some with moustaches—I don't know that some of them were policemen in plain clothes—I am quite as certain</p>

I am a butcher, of Whitecross Street—on Wednesday, 18th July, I bought one of these saws of Connor—he had been serving me with sawdust for two or three years—he brought me a sack, and while he was there my little boy dropped a saw and broke it—the prisoner said "I have got a little saw I will sell you"—I said "What sort?"—he said "Something like the one you have got broke</p>

On the morning of 24th July, I took Connor into custody at 2, Rodney Buildings, Hoxton Market—I found this black coat hanging in his room—I found him in a bed made up on the floor with the woman Casey—I said "Is your name Mike Connor?" he said "No, my name is Roach"—I said "We are police officers; we are going to take you into custody for stealing a coat and a large quantity of carpenters' tools from a warehouse, No. 2, Phipps Street, between the 7th and the 9th"—when I found the coat hanging behind the door, the prisoner said "That coat was given to me by a <hi rend="italic">bloke</hi>, a man that did work at Hare's," a well-known furniture warehouse in Great Eastern Street—I said "What is his name?"—he said "Now you have done me; Polly will show you where he lives; I was with a watchman on the wine stores on the Saturday night up till 2 o'clock on the Sunday morning"—after taking the prisoner to the station I went with Casey to a common lodging-house in Nichol Street to try and find the man, but could not—she did not take me to any man, she went away then and I went after Hawkins.</p>

I am a pork butcher and wholesale sausage maker, 3, St. John Street, Smithfield—I have a large number of shops in various parts of London—on July 26th, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, I was with a friend in the Hope Tavern, Cowcross Street—after being there a little time I noticed the prisoner in an opposite compartment—he said "Mr. Harris, will you please come round here and speak to us?" I said "I am engaged," I believe there were three other persons in the compartment with him—he repeated the request to come round three or four times, and each time I made him a similar answer; on leaving the house shortly after I parted with my friend at the door—after parting with him the prisoner came up to me—he said "Mr. Harris, you refused to speak to me just now, I will make you speak to me; I will make you keep me; I am broke, you salesmen, mentioning the names of two or three, have plenty of money"—he produced some papers and said "I have sent bad meat to market, these return notes or bills, are proof, and you have purchased it, and unless you give me the money I want, I will expose you"—he also said that he would get</p>

On 26th July, between 5 and 6 p.m., I was on duty in Cowcross Street—the prosecutor called me and gave the prisoner in charge for attempting to extort money—the prisoner heard that and he said "I did not ask him for money"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him these three bills—when the charge was read over to him he said that he in<lb/>tended writing to the papers to let the public know the bad meat Mr. Harris bought and made up into sausages.</p>

When Mr. Harris went outside me and Mr. Hall followed out a minute later. Mr. Harris was standing on the pavement. We had a few words concerning meat, and that brought up an argument about a man named Williams. I said a lot of filthy muck was sold as meat. Mr. Harris said 'What do you want to hurt old Jim Williams for?' I said 'I have seen you have meat out of</p>

               <p>there with skin over it, and I intend writing to the papers, so that there shall be an inquiry into it.' Harris then said if he could not have me any other way, he would lock me up for attempting to extort money."</p>

I am a butcher, of 289, Wick Road, South Hackney—I know the prisoner—I saw him on 26th July, and was with him at the Hope Tavern—I and another buyer were having a few words there—we then came outside—I did not hear what passed between him and Mr. Harris; I was 5 or 6 yards away—I saw Mr. Harris give him in charge, but I knew nothing at all about what it was for.</p>

This prosecution is nothing but spite and fear, because they cannot get me to hold my tongue, and they are afraid if I get a Commission of what I shall be able to prove against them. It was a well-known fact for some days previously to my being given into custody that I intended to get a Commission to inquire into the bad meat. What I was intending to do was for the benefit of the poor people in London; it was for no pecuniary benefit to myself. I have lost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. already on the transaction, and I have had eight weeks' imprisonment waiting for my trial. I have been in business for myself for the last eight or nine years; I have had shops in Hoxton and Dartford, and have been entrusted with large sums by the county authorities. I have likewise bought and sent a great deal of meat to market. My only object has been to get inquiries to stop the traffic in diseased and bad meat.</p>

I afterwards met her, and asked her for my boots and handkerchief, and she called me all the names she could lay her tongue to. I saw her again at night in the East India Dock Road, and gave her a smack on her face, and her head came in contact with a corner of the wall; that is how it was done. She says that I stabbed her a long while ago, but I never stabbed her before. I was charged with a common assault, and got six weeks for it. I never broke her home up; she did it herself.</p>

I live at 21, Randall Street, Plaistow—on 21st September, about midnight, I was in Victoria Dock Road, and saw the prisoners running towards me, and about fifty people behind them, calling "Stop them"—I said to Andrews "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, what is the matter?"—I did not know him, but I thought he was a shipmate of mine—he made no answer—I picked a knife up in the road; I did not see any one drop it, but the prisoners had passed the spot—I followed them about 50 yards, and told Comb to stop, but he did not—he had a knife in his hand and used it in a threatening manner, and I stepped away and then caught hold of him and took him to the station.</p>

               <p>among other things was half a chest of tea, to be delivered at Mr. King's, Broad Street, Stratford, and other goods for other customers—I saw the prisoner leave Half Moon Street with the van at 5 p.m.—there was about 35 cwt. of goods in the van—it was a four-wheeled van covered with a tarpaulin on hoops—the tarpaulin went right round all four sides, and was tied down at the back, the front being open—the goods were in boxes, and there were some parcels—there was not room for any one to sit down inside on the boxes, unless the seat was taken away, I think—before he left he said "I ought to have a boy with this load"—I said "There is nobody I can send with you"—occasionally we send a boy; it depends on the load and many things—I next saw the prisoner at 10 the same evening at Half Moon Street, when he came to me and said "I have bad news for you"—I said "What is that?"—he said "I have lost the horse and van"—I said "Have you delivered all the goods?"—he said "No, only half a chest of tea for Mr. King; my horse started away once; I went after it, and brought it back to the door"—I said "Did not you hear it start off again?"—he said "No, I was engaged in receiving Mr. King's money"—that was all that transpired—I took him to Mr. Baker's house—on the way he said it was a serious loss for Mr. Baker, and it looked rather serious against him, as he was under notice to leave—he was under notice—we saw Mr. Baker, who asked the prisoner if he had any one in the van—he said "No"—Mr. Baker said "Well, you know, Stephens, you have often been seen with men in your van"—he said "That has only been my brother, who occupies a respectable position, and sometimes has half a day off, and comes round with me"—next morning the van was brought to Half Moon Street—I examined it, and missed some of the goods; the heavier ones remained in the van—the value of those missing was 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—the prisoner said when he lost the van he went to the police-station and reported it.</p>

I am a hairdresser's assistant at 29, Martin Street, out of which Broad Street runs—on this afternoon I saw the van come round from the Broadway, and stop alongside the Commercial Hotel, which is very nearly opposite King's shop in Broad Street—it was there about a minute, and then I saw it going round towards the station—it had got to about the varnish shop when the prisoner came out, stood against the baker's shop and shouted to it, and it turned round by itself—it came along and drew up alongside our shop in Martin Street, and I saw the prisoner speak to a man who sat in the van on a box, he read two bills—I am certain I saw a man in the van, his legs were inside—I had some conversation with the prisoner on August 28th, he questioned me about the van.</p>

I am a greengrocer of 36, Harley Road, Lower Kennington Lane—on Saturday, 8th September, the prisoner came and asked about the rent of some stables for a horse and trap—on Monday morning, about 6.30 a.m., I was knocked up by the prisoner—when I came down about 7 o'clock I found the pony, harness, and cart in the yard—the prisoner was cleaning the pony.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 25 years of age; I was 19 when I first made the prisoner's acquaintance—I went to assist him in the business of an upholsterer and furniture dealer in Well Street, Camberwell; his wife had left him and gone to America—I had 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and board and lodging, and I also took charge of the children—he after<lb/>wards moved to Wilson Street, Finsbury, where I filled the same position—in August, 1883, I went with him and the children to Ramsgate, where, for the first time, connection took place between us—the result was that I became in the family-way—he knew that—in March, 1884, we moved to a private house at Walthamstow, where we resided as husband and wife, and I gave up the best part of my duties in the business—in February, 1887, I received this letter from him, by post—prior to that I had received a ring from him as a present; that was when we lived in Wilson Street; I always wore that ring from that time, he bought himself a new ring and gave me the old one—from that time to this year he never made any claim to that ring—he also gave me a George the Fourth sovereign, that was when he went back to his wife, when he was living at Leyton; some time in February or March; he was away three months—he gave it to me in the train coming from Liverpool—he never made any claim on that sovereign, it was never mentioned between us—after the letter in 1887 I occasionally saw him—he left me altogether about three months ago; he did not leave me then, but he treated me so badly that I could not live with him; I told him on Monday I should move my goods, and I fetched a van, and on Tuesday I told the man what things belonged to him and what to me, and when the man attempted to move my things he shook the man and frightened him—I had a cash-box, of which I kept the key, it contained a lot of jewellery and this ring and sovereign; it was in a drawer in my bedroom—on Sunday, 22nd July, he was in the bed<lb/>room, dressing—on the Monday I missed the ring and sovereign from the box, it was still locked, no one else had a key of it but myself, and I had the key in my dress-pocket—he continued to sleep in the house with me after that—I consulted my friends, and I told him "You have stolen my ring and sovereign from the cash-box"—on 14th August I went to him with Mr. Miller, and again charged him with stealing the ring.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He had the ring a great many years, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is the sovereign—he never told me that the ring was given to him by a friend; as to the furniture, the things when brought into the house were given to me as my own and sole property—a Chancery suit was commenced when I wanted to move them; I have not the date, I believe it was on 31st July—the ring and sovereign were stolen on Sunday, the 22nd, I believe, and on the Monday I told him he had taken them—I did not think of giving him in charge then—Mr. Miller is my brother-in-law—on the Tuesday morning, the 24th, I had a van there, the prisoner also had a van there later in the day—I did not smack the prisoner's face that day—I struck him three times—Mr. Baker was there, and Mr. Miller; I believe he asked the prisoner not to charge me, but I did not hear him—I said "You are a thief, you have</p>

               <p>stolen my ring and sovereign;" he said "Yours! yours! we will see about it"—I struck him with my left hand because he insulted me; he wanted me to strike him with my umbrella, but I would not—I went to Mr. Nicholls, my solicitor, some days after that to ask him to get my ring and sovereign, and Chancery proceedings were commenced—I took out a summons for the ring and sovereign when he told me he would not return them—no one told me to take out the summons—I did not think that would force a settlement about the furniture—Mr. Nicholls did not tell me to take it out, he appeared for me at the police-court—I do not think the prisoner took these things on account of their intrinsic value, I am sure of that, he merely took them to annoy me; he would have taken my teeth out of my head if he could—he never said that the ring had a value to him on account of the person who had given it to him—I had about three or four interviews with him between the 23rd July and 17th August—I never knew that Mr. Baker or any<lb/>body else knew anything about the ring.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I consulted Mr. Nicholls the next morning after the furniture was removed; that had nothing to do with the ring or the sovereign—I then left it to Mr. Nicholls to take whatever proceedings he thought proper—the proceedings were at Stratford—I did not mention about the ring and sovereign to Mr. Nicholls until some time after the affair of the furniture arose.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">By this, dated</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">rd May, the prisoner agreed to hire two horses, two carts, and harness, at a rent of</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a month, and to keep the horses well fed, and they and the carts in good condition, and not to underlet or part with them without the owner's consent; the owner to take possession if these condi<lb/>tions were not fully performed</hi>).

I live at 40, Forest Drive, and am the last witness's son and a builder's improver—on 23rd August I saw the prisoner about half-past 7 with another man standing in Mr. Harrison's front porch—my father asked them what they wanted; one of them said they were begging—my father said they were not, that they were trying to break into the house, and then one of them asked for Mr. Rouse—my father shouted "Stop thief," one ran away and escaped, and I ran after the prisoner and did not lose sight of him till he was caught by a gentleman who came in front of him—we led him to the house and sent a boy for a policeman, who came after half an hour, and took him into custody—I do not know any person called Rouse.</p>

               <p>Greenwich—on 30th June, between 1 and 2, the three prisoners came to my place—Cocks said "I come to hire a tricycle for three weeks"—he asked how much it would be—I said "Have you had any machines here before?"—he said "No"—I said "Have you any friends who have had any machines here before?"—he said "You know all my family, if you like to go up to speak to them to ask about my character; my mother-in-law lives next door; you can speak to her about it; and my brother has a shop not far off from my place, a tailor"—he said he wanted the tricycle to go for three weeks' holiday—I said "If you call back in a couple of hours' time I will think it over"—he gave the address, 17, Winforton Street, Greenwich—the three prisoners were all standing close together; one could hear what the other said—they all three came back in an hour and a half or two hours afterwards—I found the people he mentioned lived there, and I let Cocks have a tricycle when he came the second time—he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the three weeks' hire—it was a second-hand Cripper tricycle, of the Coventry Machinists' Company, value 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the value new is about 20 guineas—he rode the tricycle away—I don't know what became of the other two men—on the 14th July Cocks and Muskett came to my workshop, and Cocks said "Mr. Lewry, I want another tricycle for my friend, Mr. Muskett, to finish the three weeks' holiday with me together"—he asked me how much it would be—I said "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the week; I have not a machine here in stock at present, but if you call in in two or three hours' time I shall have one in"—they said they would wait in the public-house—when I went to the public-house to tell them there was a machine just come in I saw Shiers with them—they all three came across the road to my shop—Muskett paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the week's hire, and I let him have the machine, which Cocks rode away—I did not see those machines again till I saw and identified them at Sprunt's, the pawnbroker's—before I saw them I kept going day after day to Cocks's and Muskett's, and they kept promising to bring the tricycles home—I asked where they were—Muskett told me they had lent them again to some friends of his, and that they expected them home every minute—about a week after the hiring time expired Cocks came to my place, and told me I should have the machine the following morning—at last he disappeared, and I could not find him—I saw Muskett, and told him if I did not get my machines back I should have to take legal proceedings against him—he kept sending me to Cocks, whom I could not find.</p>

Muskett and Cocks came first on 30th June—I did not see Shiers with them then—they agreed the hiring price then, and selected the machine, Shiers not being present—everything was settled then, except the paying of the money and the taking away of the machines—when Shiers came all that was to be done was for Cocks to ride away on the bicycle—Shiers did not say a word to me about the first transaction—Cocks made certain statements about his mother-in-law, which I found correct—I met the prisoners at the White Swan on 14th July, before that I had seen Cocks and Muskett; they spoke together, and said Muskett wanted a machine—I saw them first on the 14th by themselves, without Shiers—they were waiting three or four hours for the machine—they mentioned at first the kind of machine, and the amount of money for the hire, so that all that was left on the second occasion was to pay the money and take the machine away—I did not see Shiers before I went to the public-house—he said nothing on either occasion—they all left my shop together, but outside my premises Shiers went away and let the other two go away—I attended the police-court about five times—August 11th was the first hearing, and the last 31st August—I saw the police before 11th August—Cocks and Muskett were the only prisoners on 11th August, 18th, and 24th August—I did not see Shiers in the dock till the 31st—I saw him outside the court on 11th, 14th, and 28th, where the police could put their hands on him—I cannot say I saw Shiers called and sworn as a witness for the prosecu<lb/>tion; he said he would go as a witness to give evidence, as far as he knew—it was through the information he gave that Cocks was arrested—he went into the witness-box on 24th August—he was brought before the Magistrate by summons—I believe I saw Mr. Scard, the solicitor who conducted the case at the police-court, speaking to Shiers—the only information Shiers gave me was where I could find Cocks—what passed between Shiers and the solicitor, Mr. Scard, I don't know.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is a police-station at Upper Grange Road—to go there he should have turned down Raymouth Road, he was going towards the Old Kent Road, he could get to it down the next turning—the barrow was pointing in that direction—that would be the nearest way to the Upper Grange Road station, and that would be as near a station as the other—he was going in the direction of a road that would have taken him to the Upper Grange Road Station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber—I live at 31, Ashbury Road, Rye Lane, Peckham—on Saturday night, 28th July, about a quarter past 8, I was in the High Street, Peckham, standing on a "rest," in the middle of the street, opposite Rye Lane, where the '<hi rend="italic">buses</hi> and cars stop—while there, I saw a tram car come from Westminster to New Cross—I saw a lady get out on the near side of the car—she came to the off side of the car on the down line, and stood on the metals—at that moment a Hansom's cab, driven by the prisoner, came from New Cross, going towards London at a very rapid pace, as if he was going to run into the car—he knocked the woman down, driving her about 10 feet—her right leg laid on the off side metals of the down line, and the wheel of the cab went over it—I made for the lady to pick her up; finding the cab did not stop I at once gave chase—the lady was, I think, about 3 feet from the back of the tram car—the cab was going in the direction of London—the prisoner did not seem to be keeping the direct course; he ought to have been on the side nearest the "rest;" he seemed to drive on the down line, and drove into the car—the "rest" stands in the middle of a very wide opening—the distance between the tramcar and the pavement, on the side on which the Hansom was driving, is about 60 feet—I made this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) the day after the affair, and the police plan was made afterwards; they have seen my plan.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 432). I have made a plan of the place (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is an accurate one—the distance from the pavement to the tram is 16ft. 11in., from the near side to the down trams width of tramway 4ft. 8in., space between the tramways 4ft. 6in., from the "rest" to the up-rail would be 19ft.—that cabstand is called a triangle; the distance from the triangle to the scene of the accident is 124 yards, from where the accident occurred to where the cab was stopped was 118 yards.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). The prisoner was driving at a pace of, I should say, nine miles an hour—I saw two gentlemen in the cab after I stopped it—I cried out to the cabman to stop, and ran after him, holloaing as loud as I could—I was within almost touching the rail of his "dickey" to lay hold of it—I was nearly done up—I said to him "Mate, stop! you have run over that woman"—he turned round to me and told me to go to b----y—I thought he whipped the horse, but he must have slashed it with the reins—after I spoke to him the horse went about the same pace—other people joined in the chase through my holloaing—he was stopped by the mob—I got up to him and held the horse's head—he was stopped about 165 yards from the accident—I asked him for his number when he was brought back—he would not give it to me, but waved it about—I did not see his number—he had got his badge in his hand—he was drunk, and his fare also—the woman was afterwards put in the cab and driven off—his fare urged him to give his number and get away—by the force of the mob the woman was got into the cab and taken to a doctor—I took the number of the cab, 12,711—as far as I could see there was nothing in the way to compel him to go so near the tramway; the coast was perfectly clear, not even a second car was in the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see the prisoner slash the horse, but he struck it with something—he was on his right side, near the Adam and Eve—the tramcar was coming towards him—the lady got out at the tail end of the car—as the prisoner was driving, the tram car was between her and him—the "rest" where I was standing is almost opposite where the tail end of the tram stopped—I was standing 28ft. from the car—I looked at the car before the accident happened—the matter occurred in a second of time—I know the neighbourhood perfectly well—on Saturday nights there is a great market held higher up the street—in the direction the prisoner was driving he would leave this market 60 yards behind him—he had passed the crowded part of the thoroughfare—there are a great many costermongers' barrows on one side of the road, and also on the Adam and Eve side—on the prisoner's near side there would be shops and people—if the prisoner had driven to the middle of the road he would have done right and would have avoided the accident—a butcher was celebrating the opening of his shop by a band of music—that was about 100 yards from where the accident was—I measured it by striding my legs—the butcher's shop is on the left hand side, going towards London—the band was playing loudly—the horse was going along very fast; I should say it was galloping at the rate of nine miles an hour—I say this man was drunk—I do not say he was incapable—I do not think he was a fit person to be with a cab—the length of time between the accident and the time the lady was put in the cab was about thirteen minutes—that was not long enough for a drunken man to get sober—there were no police to be found; they were not there—the mob forced the lady into the cab, and they forced the prisoner to take her—she was driven to Dr. Shillingworth's—I went to the station to give information.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 69, Rye Lane, Peckham—I am a mason—on the 28th July, about quarter past 8 o'clock, I was in Rye Lane with my daughter—I put her into a car from London to New Cross—it was standing still—I had not seen the lady who was killed—I saw a cab coming from New Cross towards London, driven by the prisoner—it was coming very close to the car, so that it nearly touched me—I was by the side of the car handing my daughter into it—I was on the off side of the car, standing at the back part of the car towards London—the cab crossed the up line in the direction of the down line—the cabman shouted out as he passed me "Get out of the way," or something of that kind, in a roughish sort of way—I turned round and looked at the cab, and I saw a lady lying across the rails, and I saw the wheels pass over her leg—I shouted after the cab—I said "Stop him, he has rode over a lady"—he did not take the slightest notice—he was chased and brought back after some time—he appeared to have had some drink, but I should not like to swear that he was drunk; he was excited—the lady was put in the cab and driven away, and I gave information—the prisoner said to a man who got on the step, "You stick to me and see me righted"—he whispered something else first, but those words I distinctly heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The horse was trotting very rapidly; it was too quick for the place—I said before the Coroner "The horse was trotting quickly; if it had been a clear neighbourhood the pace would not have been too quick"—there was no traffic at all on his near side—the tram car had steps which go up to the roof—you can get to the steps from either side of the car—the steps would be on the left side as you got in—I put my daughter in the car on the off side—I did not see which side the lady got out till I saw her knocked down—I fix the pace as a good pace—my reason for saying he had been drinking is because he was excited as he came back—he came back with a great crowd of people; they were all holloaing at him, and there was a great deal of confusion and excitement—my other reason for saying he was the worse for drink was his general conduct—he refused to turn the fare out, and assist the lady into the cab, and this put the people out—I believe the fares were pulled out—I just caught sight of him driving the lady away; he was then driving quietly and in a proper manner—that was about thirteen minutes after the accident.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 41, Hardcastle Street, Peckham—I am a cab driver—this cab, 12711, is the one which I drive—I drove it on the 28th July—on that day I went home to tea about 6.10 in the evening, leaving my cab on the rank in the Triangle, Peckham—about two hours later I returned and found the cab was gone—I did not give permission to the prisoner or anybody else to drive it—about 11.50 that night I found it at the Greyhound public-house, Hill Street, Peckham—I found the prisoner inside the house—a constable came up, and took him to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him in the Greyhound about 11.50—that is about 10 or 12 feet from where my cab put up—it is a house used by cabmen—as far as I know he had driven the cab back from Charing</p>

               <p>Cross—he then appeared to me to be sober, but he was excited over the affair—he is a licensed cabman—the police asked me to come to the station; they detained the prisoner there for three-quarters of an hour—they wanted me to charge him with stealing my horse and cab—I saw he had only used it, and I declined to charge him.</p>

I said, "Yes"—he said, "Do you charge her?"—I said "Yes"—we then went to the police station, the constable, Harcourt, myself, and my friend—I gave</p>

Up to the 15th June I was living at 24, Oakley Street—I have pleaded guilty to this indictment—on Friday night, 15th June, I was at the Empire Theatre; I left there with Mr. Rolls and went to the Alliance Hotel, Oxford Street; we did not stop there, but went to Oakley Street—before I went out that night Wallace said something to me—when we got to Oakley Street I and Mr. Rolls went upstairs into the front first-floor bedroom; about ten or five minutes afterwards I took his watch; then I think he shouted "Thieves" and "Murder"—Mr. and Mrs. Wallace rushed upstairs, and I opened the front room door, and Mr. Rolls said "She has taken my watch"—Mrs. Wallace said "She could not do such a thing," meaning me—I had the watch in my hand at the time; I gave it to Mr. Wallace—then the policeman was called in and I went to the station with him, and Mrs. Wallace followed—I confessed—it was my intention to give it back again—I put the watch in the flower-pot—I gave the watch to Mr. Wallace, who put it in a flower pot; then he trod on my foot and indicated to me not to leave it there, and I took it from that flower-pot and put it in another flower-pot on the landing while the prosecutor was fetching the policeman; afterwards I took it in my room and put it in another flower-pot—I know nothing more about it.</p>

I am single, and live at 207, Romany Road, West Norwood—I have known the prisoner eight years—on the evening of 23rd August I saw the prosecutor; he was drunk, and could hardly walk straight, and was using most obscene language—he went straight up to Mr. Leach's door, and kicked it three or four times with great force—he had two boys with him, one with a whip and the other with a stick—Mr. Leach opened the door, and the prosecutor said "Your b----boys have robbed my boys"—the prisoner said "Man, you must be mad; I have no boys; my sons are all grown up"—he said "You are a b----old liar and a b----old thief," and caught hold of Leach, and challenged him to fight, and Leach struck him in the face, I think—the boys used the whip and stick on the prisoner, and not hitting him then, but hitting Mrs. Leach on her forehead—Mr. Leach had nothing in his hand—after the prosecutor was struck he remained there about 20 minutes using bad language—some persons took him across a field, and bound a handkerchief across his face—a constable came up, and I told him my story, which is true.</p>

Rainbow said "You are, and a b----old thief, and if you come out here I will fight you"—he struck my father, and my father hit him in self-defence—while the blows were being struck I heard blows from a stick and a whip—I did not see the two boys—my father had nothing in his hand, and he did not strike till he was called names.</p>

On August 30th I went to Mr. Richards' works, called the prisoner into the shop, and Mr. Voysey said, "I will give you in custody for stealing a sovereign out of my pocket, and also for attempting to poison me by putting spirits of salts into my gin"—I said to the prisoner "Now this is a very serious matter, be careful what you say, for what you do say will be used as evidence against you"—he said "I confess to putting that into his gin, but it was done in play, I am a teetotaler myself, and I don't like to see him drink spirits"—I took the words down—I said "Well, what money have you got about you, it is a very serious matter, and I am going to search you"—he said "I have none"—I searched him on the spot, and found three boxes of lucifer matches, in one of which was a half-sovereign, in another two separate shillings, and in the third 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then said "I did steal the sovereign, and I am very sorry and beg his pardon, please don't lock me up"—I took charge of this bottle, and also another bottle containing spirits of salts—my inspector sealed them down, and I took them to an analyist, who retained them."</p>

I am an analyst of the firm of Wright, Layman, and Umney, and have been so upwards of eight years—Sergeant Partridge handed me two bottles, but one of them has been broken—I marked them 331 1 and 338 2—one was a quartern bottle, and contained nine drachms, which I found to consist of a mixture of gin and hydrochloric acid in a free state; the other contained strong hydrochloric acid, but not so strong as it should be, because it had been imperfectly kept—if the whole of this mixture was taken on an empty stomach it would be injurious to health; it would produce irritation and inflammation.</p>
