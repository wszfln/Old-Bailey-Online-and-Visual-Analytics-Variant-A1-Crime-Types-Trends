I am a tailor, of 51, Bedford Row, St. Andrews, Holborn—I was a witness against Paul at this Court in March last when he was convicted of misdemeanour—in May, 1882, I let a room to Paul and Williams on behalf of the firm of Merrick, Williams, and Co.—they gave me a reference to the prisoner—I called on him and received this letter, dated 1st May, 1882. (<hi rend="italic">In this Langridge, regretted that he had been out when Rogers called, but would be pleased to attend any appointment.</hi>) That is written on paper with a printed heading, "R. H. Langridge, 15, Holborn Viaduct"—I subsequently received these letters of 2nd and 3rd May from Langridge. (<hi rend="italic">The first stated that Merriek, Williams, and Co. would be found desirable tenants, who would carry out what they undertook, and that he would sign an agreement if one was required; the second acknowledged the receipt of a letter stating that Williams was out of town and would not return till Friday, when he would see him, and advised that in the meantime Mr. Rogers should close with the other gentleman treating for the office.</hi>) On several occasions the rent was paid by cheque drawn by Langridge—Mr. Williams has since died.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The deposition of the Rev. George Robert Clack was here read as follows</hi>:—"I am a clergyman living at Dunholm Vicarage, Richmond, York<lb/>shire. I saw an advertisement in a newspaper, which advertisement purported to emanate from Merrick, Williams, and Co., of 51, Bedford Row. In consequence, in October, 1882, I communicated with them. I received from them a price list of bonds. I produce a letter dated the 12th October, 1882, received by me.

I was tried here in March last and am now under<lb/>going a sentence—I have known Langridge for about 20 years—about May last he spoke to me, and he and Williams jointly employed me—the firm was Merrick and Williams—Williams took the office at 51, Bedford Row—Langridge was the reference—these letters to Rogers are in Langridge's handwriting—I was employed to keep office and do the correspondence—I did not receive any of the profits on the business; I was paid weekly, sometimes 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Saturday, and small sums during the week—it was irregular—after the office was taken the prisoner used to come there—these printed headings were prepared by the prisoner—advertisements were put in the county papers to induce people to buy stock—I remember letters coming from a Mr. Williams—I received them and took them unopened to the prisoner at 15, Holborn Viaduct—I saw him open them—I remember one con<lb/>taining a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I wrote all the answers to these letters at the prisoner's dictation—the prisoner paid the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque through his own bank; it is endorsed "Messrs. Merrick, Williams, and Co.," and "Merrick, Williams, and Co." in Langridge's handwriting—he had an account at the London Trading Bank, through which it seems to have been passed—he told me it had been returned by the bank because the word "Messrs." was there, and he endorsed it again—the cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is endorsed "Merrick, Williams, and Co.," and "R. H. Langridge," in the prisoner's handwriting; that also passed through the bank—the contract note of 12th September is in my writing; it is on one of the printed forms of the office—I copied most of the answers dictated to me to the letters at the office in Bedford Row, and took them back to him at 15, Holborn Viaduct for approval and postage—he read them and he posted them—I might now and then have put the stamps on, but I nearly always left them with him for postage—this letter of 11th September is in Langridge's writing, and he added the postscript—I remember Mr. Clack's letters coming—I took them un<lb/>opened to the prisoner at his office on Holborn Viaduct, and saw him open them—he sketched an answer and I wrote it, and afterwards took it to him for approval, and he posted it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter from Mr. Clack of 16th October, enclosing a cheque for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner had it; he asked me to endorse it "Merrick, Williams, and Co.," and I did so—he paid it through the London Trading Bank—I had none of the profit of either of those two transactions—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the sketches of an answer made by the prisoner—the prisoner got the headings printed—I and Williams were present when he gave the order—most of the printing was done at the Old Bailey, and some at a firm in</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was sentenced in the March Session for unlawfully appropriating a cheque for 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to live years' penal servitude, which I am doing now—I was not guilty of that, I was unjustly convicted—two years ago I was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for obtaining about a dozen 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. subscriptions to a book which was not published—I was not guilty of that, I had not time to complete the book; I pleaded guilty—I have never been in Warwick; I have been to Manchester; I do not remember anything happening there—I have at times gone under several different names besides that of Paul—I made a clean breast to the Treasury solicitors of what I have said to-day about a couple of months I should think after my conviction—I was asked for a statement and I gave it—I have no hope whatever of getting my sentence lessened or remitted—I had known Williams since I was a boy—he was an agent under me in years gone by—we had been connected in business for 10 or 12 years—Williams was an illiterate man, he could not write well—I can write pretty fairly and am a man of fair education—I was present with Williams when the office was taken of Mr. Rogers—I went alone the first time, and then with Williams, and it was agreed to take the office that day in my presence; William Rogers and I were there, nobody else—the prisoner was secretary to the Corporation of Land Financiers, and afterwards was appointed by the Court of Chancery as clerk to the liquidators—I was at the office at Bedford Row every day, or practically every day, and Williams was there nearly every day—he died suddenly in November or December last year—I always understood Langridge was Merrick—I believe I gave the name Merrick and Williams to Mr. Rogers—I do not know a man who sometimes went under the name of Bevan and sometimes under that of Merrick—I know a Mr. Bevan—he only went there once or twice—I never consulted him as to the letters I was to write—I had authority to endorse the firm's name on cheques—except in the instance where the prisoner's name appears on the cheque, and where the Messrs. Merrick, Williams, and Co. is crossed out and Merrick, Williams, and Co. written in, I have written the name—I don't suppose there were half a dozen cheques altogether—I know Williams and the prisoner had been friends for many years—I believe the prisoner has given Williams money on several occasions—I don't think he advanced him so much as 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—according to William's statement he had not received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know that Williams repaid him money advanced on or about the first of every month—I never saw the prisoner's books—I saw the correspondence of the firm; I did not write the answers out of my own head—I consulted the prisoner every morning when I took the letters down—Williams came to the Viaduct and I took the letters down there—when Williams was at the office I did not consult him and then write the letters—nobody was authorised to write the name of the firm, Merrick, Williams, and Co., except myself and Williams—I took the letters to the prisoner unopened and he opened them—Field, a friend of the prisoner's, used occasionally to be in his office when I went there—I believe nobody else was there—I used to go to the office between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, and Mr. Williams about 11 o'clock—if he did not come to the office he went to the Viaduct, and I used to bring them on there—during the eight months</p>

               <p>the office was open the prisoner was there perhaps a dozen times altogether—as a rule when I went to the prisoner's office he and Williams were talking on friendly matters and on business matters as well—the endorsement to Mr. Clack's cheque is mine—it is dated 16th October—I took the letter containing it unopened to the prisoner, and endorsed the cheque in his presence—Williams was away at that time—I did not open the letter and take the cheque endorsed as it is now to the prisoner—I was present when the postscript was written to the letter of 8th September, and saw the prisoner write it—I am not aware that anybody else was present—Williams was in the country at the time—the initials to the postscript, "M. W. and Co.," are in the prisoner's writing—he did not request me to, nor did I say it would appear strange if there were three handwritings, and request him to do "so—I believe the prisoner to be a good man of business—I did not take the letters to him and get him to suggest answers—I believed it to be a genuine firm and that the letters were genuine business letters throughout the whole of the period when the letters were written, and during all my interviews with the prisoner—I believe the endorsement on the cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is mine—he opened the letter—it was endorsed at his office on the Viaduct—I did not put the "Messrs. Merrick, Williams, and Co.," on the other cheque—both the endorsements on that one are in the prisoner's handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I was tried and convicted Merrick, Williams, and Co.'s letters were put in evidence, and shown to be in my handwriting—after Williams's return, on my telling him what amount the prisoner had received, he was very angry, and said he would see the prisoner about a settlement, and gave orders for any future letters to be given to himself, and I took no letters to the prisoner after Williams's return—I have had money from the prisoner for wages; I was paid irregularly—this letter of 5th October, "Dear Captain John," is in the prisoner's writing; this passage appears in it: "No business at 51, Bedford Row. We have sent out the October circulars; nothing comes of it, the office appears a dead letter"—circulars were printed and sent out—this order for the printing is signed by the prisoner, the matter is in my handwriting—I was instructed to draw out a circular—I cannot say I was present when it was signed—I handed it in to his office.</p>

The office was open eight months—there were other letters besides those from Clack and Williams from the country addressed to the office; they were handed to the prisoner every morning, and were answered—they were about the business of the office—I never saw any bonds at the office; one was bought and delivered in London, and one the prisoner bought and sent away—that was the only one during the eight months that I know of as having been delivered in compliance with any orders.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper at 51, Conduit Street, and assistant to Mr. Burden, an outfitter—on the morning of 21st June I returned home about 1 o'clock, opened the door with a latch key, and heard footsteps on the stairs—thinking it was my wife I called out "Ann, is that you?" I received no reply, and instantly went down and turned the gas up, and found the place in the greatest confusion—I looked into the scullery and saw the two prisoners under the cistern—I saw Payne's face by the gas light, but not the other so distinctly, but I swear they are the two men—I seized Payne by the collar and said "You scoundrel, what are you doing here?" he made no reply—knowing that there was no back entrance, I went outside the street door and held it by the knocker and letter-box with my foot against the door poet—they tried to pull the door from me—I called to Mr. West who was passing with a lady, to help me, and instantly there was a smash of glass and the prisoners immediately jumped off the shop next door—they had broken the first floor landing window—I seized Payne under a gas lamp and the other ran back past the front door—I afterwards saw him at the station—I missed a little box, a workbox, a watch which was found on the kitchen stairs, four walking sticks, a coin, a box of pens, some studs, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money—some coats were removed—the door required a latch-key to open it.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—on 20th June, about 12 p.m., I fastened up the house, leaving the front door on the latch—it was necessary to have a key to open it—I was in bed about 1 o'clock and heard a cry of "Police" and steps on the stairs—I got up and went to the front door, trying to open it, but found my husband was outside it holding it and crying "Police"—one man passed me on the stairs, and I saw one coming upstairs—I did not see their faces—I went down to the kitchen and found a watch belonging to my boy, on the stairs—it had been in a little drawer with 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some coppers which I also missed—the coats which had hung behind the door were found in the kitchen with my workbox—the landing window was fastened with a catch—it did not break till I got to the street door—I found it open—I had left it shut—it leads to the leads of the next shop—a pane of glass which shows light into the shop was broken by their walking across it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner</hi>). I was in Messrs. Buxton's employ, and was charged with stealing this wool—I have known Sait three or four years—at the end of March or the beginning of April we were talking of Martin, who was in custody for receiving stolen wool, and Sait knew that Charles Cross, who I worked with, had dealings with Martin—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188307300021"/>
               <p>I said "Of course, that is all stopped now, and a good job it is, as it is a great load off my mind"—he said "Why don't you give me a turn and send me the wool you have? I can do with as much as you like to send"—I was surprised, as I intended to have left off this bad practice, which I have had cause to be sorry for ever since; but he induced me all he could and said "Send me the wool and I will pay you as much as Martin did, and will send a carman to fetch it away any time you like to name—I said "Well, I did intend to have given this up and have no more to do with it; but I will see about it"—my good resolutions were broken, and I sent word to Sait that the wool was ready, and next afternoon, Saturday, 14th July, after everybody else had gone, I packed up the bale of wool—that was in consequence of what he said to me—we had been in the habit of doing unlawful business together—I hired that man (<hi rend="italic">Hipson</hi>) to take the goods to the booking office—I did not direct them at all—I saw them afterwards at the police court—Hipson brought me the ticket which the clerk gave him—I took it to Mr. Sait in Roman Road and gave it to him—on the Wednesday morning, the 17th or 18th, the detective arrested me and took me to Moor Lane and accused me—Sait paid me at the rate of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for wool which was worth 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Jewry, and asked him if he could give any further explanation in reference to the possession of the sack of wool—he said no, a man asked him to mind it—I said "There was a ticket in connection with that bag; do you know anything about that ticket?"—Sait said "I shall decline to answer that question"—I said "You will be charged with receiving this sack of wool knowing it to be stolen"—he made no reply—he was taken to Moor Lane Station, and made no answer to the charge—Sait shook his head at Nash in the dock, and Nash said "No, no, all right."</p>

On 14th July, from, instructions I received from Sergeant Wright, I kept observation on the Wool Exchange, 24, Basinghall Street, and saw Nash leave shortly before 12 o'clock, walk up Basinghall Street, and return with another man who is a witness—they both went into No. 24, and the other man came out carrying a heavy weight—Wright and I followed him to Moorgate Street Station, and saw him leave the bag in the cloak-room and receive a ticket from the booking clerk—on Tuesday, the 17th, I saw a man go to the cloak-room door, tender a ticket, receive the sack, carry it out to a cart, and drive away—I followed him to Roman Road, Old Ford, to a marine store shop—I saw the prisoner in the shop, and when the carman left I went in and told the prisoner I was a police-officer, and wanted him to account for the possession of the sack—he did not answer for a minute, and then said "A man asked me to allow him to leave it here"—I said "Can you refer me to the man?"—he said "No, he is a stranger to me"—I said "It is not very satisfactory to me, you will have to go to the City"—he said "The shop belongs to my brother and I work for him"—he sent for his brother, who said that he knew nothing about the sack—I said to his brother "Do you allow him to buy this wool?"—he said "I don't know anything about it"—the prisoner said "I buy and sell things as if it was my own shop"—I waited till 7 o'clock and then took the prisoner to the station, and he was charged—I took Nash on Tuesday morning, the 17th, and charged him with stealing the wool.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the wool when it was lying at Moorgate Street Station, and told the booking clerk that I believed it was stolen, and to let me know if anybody came for it—I examined it and Wright marked it—it was lying outside the counter at Sait's—I took Sait on my own responsibility, as his answers to my questions were unsatisfactory—I would not have asked him questions after he was in custody.</p>

Walker and Gibbons, 85, Queen Victoria Street, mantle manufacturers—John Walker is one of the partners—on 5th July the prisoner called there—I had not seen her before—she asked if Mr. Bennett had been there—I said "What Bennett?"—she said "Bennett of Blandford"—I said no, he had not—Bennett of Blandford is one of our customers—she then said she wanted some skirts to send down to Mr. Bennett—I took her into the costume room and she selected three mantles—I gave them to her because she said she came from Bennett of Blandford and I believed her—there was nothing said about paying, because he runs an account—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the mantles—she was wearing it when in custody—the value of it is 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or the value of the three would be about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I live at Turner's Hill, Cheshunt, and was a sales<lb/>man at Walker and Gibbons's up till last Saturday—on 5th July I was serving at their house in Victoria Street with Edith Basnett—she brought the prisoner to me; and the prisoner asked for some skirts and a costume for Mr. Bennett of Blandford, and also asked if Mr. Bennett had been as she expected to see him—I said "No"—she said "Never mind, I want to take one away, and the others can be sent"—I gave her four costumes and 14 skirts—she took with her one skirt and one costume, and I then took her to the mantle room, where Basnett served her—the value of the skirt was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the costume 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the others were to be sent to Bennett of Blandford by rail, and were sent—I parted with the goods because the prisoner told me she came from Bennett of Blandford—she also told me she used to live there some years ago and had gone back to live there again—if I had not believed she came from there I should not have let her have them—when in custody, she was wearing one of the costumes she had from me—she signed for the goods in the name of Mary Anderson in the signature book—we charged the goods to Mr. Blandford's account.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of the Rev. John Burton Norman, of Little Stanmore, near Edgware—about 9.30 on the night of the 26th June I saw the prisoner come to the schoolroom window—he asked me for protection, and said some woodmen were going to kill him—I told him to go away—he came back again to the same window—I shut the shutters—he kept asking for protection; I took no notice of him—I was outside the schoolroom door and heard a smash of glass—I went upstairs and cried for help, and Mann came to my assistance—I went out to the frost door and let him in—this tea kettle and stand (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were fronting the dining-room window, eight yards from it, on the sideboard—when I went in there was a pane of glass broken in the window, and the tea-kettle and stand had been moved from one side of the sideboard to the other—before I saw the prisoner these napkins were in the side<lb/>board drawer; after the prisoner was held by Mann I saw them outside the drawer; there was some blood on them—the prisoner's hand was cut slightly.</p>

I live at Edgware, Burnt Oak—on the night of 26th June I heard cries for help, and in consequence went to Mr. Norman's house, and when I got up to it noticed that one of the windows was smashed—I did not see the prisoner, I only saw the cook upstairs—I spoke to her—I was going past again about 9.20, and heard screaming out of the window—I came hack and drove my horse and cart to the door, and in consequence of what the cook said I went round to the front of the house, where I saw a window broken—I heard some one in the house—I shouted "Police!" and the prisoner came out of the window directly after—when he got outside I said "Who is with you?"—he said "I am all alone"—I did not notice his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Charles Brider; he is a bricklayer—we have been living for some time at 21, Cottage Lane, City Road, with my daughter, Sarah Ann—she was 22 years of age on Monday, 18th June—she was working for De la Rue, the stationers', in Bunhill Row, for nine years and a half, and used to go day by day to her employ<lb/>ment there—another daughter was living with us, younger than Sarah—the prisoner has been lodging with us a little over a year—he became acquainted with my daughter, and they were married at St. Luke's early in June—after the marriage they returned to 21, Cottage Lane, and both of them went to their employments—in the evening they both slept at our house, but not in the same room; they did not sleep in the same room at all after the marriage—they continued to go regularly to their respec<lb/>tive employments—on Monday evening, the 18th, she came home about 8 o'clock, and brought a small parcel with her—she spoke a few words to me, and went out to meet her husband on Pentonville Hill—I think I have made a mistake about this; on the Monday the prisoner came home first—she went on business in the Hackney Road for her father, and she was late when she came in—she said she was very ill—the prisoner was there; he never attempted to go and meet her as usual—she went into the front parlour and sat in an arm-chair—he stood a few minutes when he heard her sobbing; he went in and pulled her out—I went in to him and told him he must not do that—he rushed past me and flew to the table-drawer—she heard the noise of the knives and she flew past me and flung her arms past her own neck and said, "He is either going to murder me or himself"—I begged of him to lay the knife down; he had taken a large carving-knife out of the drawer—I then felt faint and fell back in a chair—he fixed the carving-knife to her breast and said he would run it through her if she did not tell him where she had been—she said she had been to Fox's in the Bethnal Green Road to fetch some bark to gargle his throat—he then sat down on the sofa and cried bitterly—I cannot tell what became of the knife, whether he laid it down; I think it was placed in the drawer again by my daughter—she wanted me to give my word not to tell her father, and I did so—the prisoner said, "I am mad"—I said, "I think you are"—this was about half-past 9 to 10 o'clock—on Thursday, the 21st, they had been at work as usual during the day—the prisoner came home first between 8 and 9 o'clock, his usual time—he was very fidgety as she had not returned—he said, "I can't think where she has got to"—she came home about 9 o'clock, her usual time was 8—I am a little confused, I was thinking of the Monday; on the Thursday she came home at 8 o'clock; the prisoner was not there at that time—she laid a small parcel on the table and went to meet her husband—she was in the habit of going to meet him—she was away about an hour and a half—the prisoner came in about 9 o'clock while she was away—he asked if Sarah had returned—I said, "No, have you not seen her?"—he said, "Yes, coming down the hill, but she was walking in such an upright style I did not cross directly to her"—he said that no woman should master him, and he went out—he was perfectly sober—he was out about 20 minutes, and returned with my daughter—they both</p>

               <p>Walked into the kitchen coolly and quietly—she left the kitchen hurriedly and rushed into her bedroom; that was the left-hand parlour—it is a double-fronted house—the parlour is on the same floor as the kitchen—the lock of the door springs twice; she sprang it twice; she shut the door, and locked it—that seemed to arouse the prisoner, and he rushed and burst the door open, and went into the room—I heard them talking very loudly—I did not hear what was said—I then went in—my daughter was sitting by the bedside crying very much—the prisoner was standing up—she held her hand up, and said "You will have something to answer for before your God"—he snapped his fingers in her face, and said "And so will you"—she said "You have called me a whore"—he said "I did not"—she repeated it a second time—he said nothing then, but he gave a jeering laugh—she then removed her seat, and sat on an ottoman at the foot of the bed—he said "I will stop you from going to De la Rue's"—I said "You can't, her character is too well known"—he said "We will see"—she said "You are cruel and unkind; oh, mother, you can't tell what I have had to go through; I wish I had taken your and Mr. Machonicie's advice; I will not live with him; did I ever tell you any<lb/>thing of James, mother?"—I said "No, that has been your fault"—I don't think he said anything then—she threw her hands away from him, and said "Go away from me, go away, I never want to see you any more"—she said to me, "Did you ever catch me out in one lie, mother, until I knew him?"—I said "No"—she was a most truthful child—he then sat down by the side of her, and begged of her to forgive him—he said "Pray forgive me, Sarah, do forgive me"—she said "I can never forgive you for the name that you called me"—she told him to go away, she never wished to see him any more—he said "Will you forgive me?"—she said "No, I can never forgive you for the name you called me"—he then moved his position from the front of the fireplace, and sat by her side—for one minute he seemed to sit still, and then in an instant I saw the poor creature on the floor, and he digging something into her—I thought it was his thumb, but she halloaed "He is murdering me, mother; he is murdering me"—I rushed and pulled him off by the hair of his head, and said "You villain, what are you at? what are you doing?"—he never spoke—he threw me over the bed, which injured my arm, and ran out at the door—my daughter got up and fell on her wound by the side of the bed—after I recovered consciousness, she threw up her head and said "Mother, I am dying"—I afterwards saw that she was wounded—I rushed to the water, but got a towel and wipe her face—I then rushed into the street and got assistance and spoke to the police, and a doctor saw her—I went with her in a cab to St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I was present when the police came and picked up the blade of a knife—it had blood on it—I did not see any knife in the prisoner's hand—I never saw this brown-handled knife till it was found by the police—he had a white-handled knife, this produced is it—I found this on Friday, 28th July, on the top of a safe, just outside the kitchen in a small lobby, I had to get a chair before I could reach it—it was shut up as it is now—I had seen the prisoner using that knife in his work, but I had lost sight of it for two months—I went to the hospital and saw my daughter there; I was there on the 23rd when the Magistrate came, and the inspector, and the prisoner was brought there—my daughter was sworn and her deposition was taken in my presence—she died on</p>

My dear Wife,—Through the trouble between your father and mother and I, I feel I can never live with them more. You and I must leave them soon, and to do so we want money. When you read what I am going to do, do not fret, as it will only make things worse. I am going down to Liverpool to see the solicitors, but shall come back late to-night. Dear Sarah, don't fret, but be quiet and let them all at home see how you can trust me. God knows that they have distrusted me, which is one of the things which has upset us. Dear Sarah, it is hard to go away from you, but it is for the best; rather let me be away from you one day than for ever. Dear Sarah, if you have not been examined to-day do not be so. I say again, it will make no difference between you and I. I am afraid the friendship between your mother and I is ended. Dear Sarah, it is strange, but before I married you I thought it would turn out like this; I shall always believe your mother knew you; but never mind, we shall both be happy when living alone. The fault is not yours. Dear Sarah, believe me, I love you with all my heart, although I have acted funny at times. Remember, allow no one to come between us. Dear Sarah, I cannot say more at present. I go at 9.30. Please not to go near Smith's. I shall telegraph to you when I arrive. Dear Sarah, believe me to be your ever loving husband, James K."—"From James Kelly, H. M. Prison, Clerkenwell, 24th June, 1883. My dear Wife,—I scarcely know how to write a few lines to you, I feel so wretched, and have such pains in my head that I have no power to think, so if I omit anything you must forgive me. Dear Sarah, before I say more, I must ask you to write and let me know how you are; tell me if you are getting better. Dear Sarah, I am so sorry and repent to the utmost for what I have done, and I want you to write and say that you forgive me and love me still. I love you, dear girl, and I never meant to stab you as I sat by you asking you to forgive me and you answered no. I took out my penknife and meant to frighten you, but something seemed to come over me and I went mad and stabbed you. Dear Sarah, we have both been mistaken; I thought you did not love me, and you seemed to be sure that I did not love you. Dear Sarah, if it had been so, would not I have taken the opportunity to leave you when you told me to go? but, no, I could not leave you, Sarah. I loved you too much, and you drove me mad. Dear Sarah, I shall be tried next Wednesday. I shall not mention your faults, not even to save myself; you are too good for the world to know you. My dear Sarah, if you had trusted me and given way to me for a few days I feel sure this awful affair would not have happened. Dear Sarah, I am obliged to finish my letter now as I am wanted at Court. So good<lb/>bye for the present. Believe me to be, my dear wife, your ever loving and affectionate, but unfortunate, husband, James Kelly. ******** P.S. Dear Wife,—Please send Mr. Stan ton to me; I should so like to see him, and also your father." Envelope addressed, "Mrs. Sarah Kelly, Bartholomew Hospital."—"From James Kelly, H. M. Prison, Clerkenwell, 9th July, 1883. Dear Mrs. Brider,—I feel I must write to yourself to say that I forgive you from my heart for any words you have said or anything you have</p>

               <p>done to satisfy yourself, and as you thought my poor wife Sarah, but which to me did and has made me unhappy. I know I have been very gay and reckless, but for what I have done to my dear wife I can say truthfully I never have or wished to ruin any girl's life. My dear Sarah and I had many troubles, and although I was a stranger and at liberty to do and go as I pleaded, my love for your daughter was such that I could not leave her. Dear Mrs. Brider, concerning my darling's illness, I did often ask Sarah to go to a doctor for her own sake, but she would not. I got wild and asked her to speak to you, which she did; then after Mr. Brider spoke to me, and I said more than I wished about Sarah because I thought you had deceived me at the risk of making Sarah unhappy. I always felt more for her than myself on that point, and I never did or would allow myself to think that it was her own fault (I shall say no more), but I can see now I had not the sense to inquire in a quiet and proper manner, because I was out of my mind. I had no one to comfort or advise me, not even my only love Sarah. My dear wife seemed to me like a dead person, she either could or would not speak. I cannot say more, as I wish you to get this to-night, Tuesday. I should much like to know how you are all getting on. I have seen my solicitor this afternoon, but I would give no statement, as I wish to hear from you first. Please write soon. I hope that you and Mr. Brider and all at home will accept my best wishes for your happiness, because I sincerely wish it. I remain, Mrs. Brider, your forgiving but unfortunate son-in-law, James Kelly. P.S.—You have been much mistaken in me concern<lb/>ing a certain thing." Envelope addressed. "Mrs. Brider, 21, Cottage Lane, City Road, London." "From James Kelly, H.M. Prison, Clerken<lb/>well, 13th July, 1883. Dear Mrs. Brider,—If it would not be asking you too much, I should much like to speak to you privately here; (if you will) please say when you can come. If you are going to the Clerkenwell Court to-morrow, I should thank you much if you would bring with you those slippers dear Sarah worked for me. Please send them to me in my cell. Hoping that you and all at home are bearing up, I remain yours sincerely, James Kelly. P.S.—Dear Mrs. Brider,—I am terribly afraid I shall have to tell all I know, but if you come and tell me any words my dear wife said which will comfort me, I will, with God's help, do what I think is right. I feel I would rather die than say a word against poor Sarah and cause you more trouble. I cry often and say to myself 'What shall I do? is there nothing to save me, and shall I have to tell all?' I have seen the solicitor again this afternoon, but I will not write out my defence till I have seen you. As you know, I gave poor Titty 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which she put in the bank, and as I shall want all the monies as I can get I am asking my solicitor to get it. I should be very thankful for a letter from you, so good-bye from your sincere but unfortunate son-in-law, James Kelly." My daughter never got the letter of 24th June; it came to my house—she had nothing the matter with her so far as I know—before Christmas the prisoner told me that he had the upholsterer's itch, and he had medicine and ointment—he had a great many marks round the hips and between the fingers; I did not particularly notice his throat—on one occasion I saw things in his bedroom that were used for an immoral purpose, a syringe, a small phial, and ointment, with direc<lb/>tions—a lodger slept in the room, but never washed there—I used the washstand—the prisoner spoke to me about those things—I can't tell the</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant surgeon to Her Majesty's prison, Clerkenwell—the prisoner was in that prison from 22nd June up to the present time—I have seen him from time to time about three or four times a week—during the whole of the time I have seen him he has always conducted himself as a rational and sane man—I have not noticed any symptoms of insanity about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had conversation with him for five or ten minutes at a time; I never heard till to-day of his suffering from abscess in the head—an abscess in the head before bursting might probably cause pain—I suppose in the interior is meant—a running abscess might discharge through the ear if in that region.</p>

I am a shipping clerk, of 3, Tredegar Square, Bow—I wrote the body of this note on 28th June—it is a seaman's allotment note for the Ibex, on a voyage to the Baltic, dated London, 6th July, 1883—it was 28th June when I issued it to George Williams—it says "15 days after date pay the sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., part of the wages of George Williams, engaged to serve as fireman in the above-named ship," and is drawn on Messrs. Jackson Brothers and Co., 6, Crosbie Square, E.C.—when I had drawn it up it was signed by the captain of the Ibex, and at that same time by George Williams—I cannot swear that the prisoner is the man—the ship would probably sail that day or the next—these notes are issued the day the man is signing articles—the alteration of the date is so visible I should say no one would cash the note—I imagine the Ibex would sail the next morning; I do not know; these steamers that go round the coast to Burnt Island invariably sail next day—these notes are generally cashed the very day they are issued by the boarding-house keeper or clothier—it would not be in accordance with the usual practice to alter it from the 28th to the 6th.</p>

I am shopman at 31, Moorgate Street, the booking-office of the London Parcels Delivery Company—on the 30th June, Hipson brought a bag of wool there, and afterwards Carvosso came and put on it a label with the address Woolf, of Shadwell, and I believe Cable Street—the same thing happened on the 5th and 13th July—I handed the bags over in due course to the carman of the Company, Sharp.</p>

At 9.20, on June 30, I saw Carvosso come out of the Wool Exchange, speak to Hipson, and take Hipson in shortly afterwards, and I saw Hipson come out with a bag on his back—Hollowed him—he went to Rate's booking-office, in Moorgate Street—Carvosso remained in the Wool Exchange for a short time—the porter waited in Moorgate Street, and Carvosso came and paid him some money, and I followed him back to McGlew's office—I marked the bag, which was on the pavement at the parcels delivery office before it was put into the van to go the head office at Bolls Buildings—I marked it in red ink, similar to these other bags—the bag of the 30th June was not found—on 5th July I saw Carvosso come out, and take Hipson into the Wool Exchange—Hipson came out of the second-floor with a bag on his shoulder, which he took to the same booking-office, and left it there—this is the bag I marked on the second occasion in the street—on 13th July the same thing happened—I marked that bag—it has not been found—I afterwards saw the three bags delivered at 348, Cable Street, on the afternoon of each day—the bags were all this size, and were sewn along—they were quite full, and between the strings I could see the wool—I had one weighed, it weighed 2 quarters 16 pounds—the other two might, have been a little over—on 24th July I went with Wright to Woolf's house, and searched it—in the cellar, under a quantity of rags, I found this bag, which is one of the three I marked—I showed it to Woolf—before that Wright had told him he would be charged with receiving a quantity of wool in bags—he denied receiving any wool—he said "You have marked that bag yourself just now"—when charged, he said "I have not had any wool, I have not dealt in wool for years"—I, said "This is one of the bags that I marked"—he said "You have just</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Charles Messenger Major, and trade as Lyon and Field at Red Lion Wharf—Shephard was the ledger clerk for some years, and latterly he was employed at the inquiry desk—I have known Anderson some years, and have seen him at the wharf from time to time—I knew him some time in the employ of J. and F. Mordan—after he left there I frequently saw him at the wharf—he used to see Shephard, and I have complained to Shephard about his coming and casting his time—when goods are landed and weighed and stored at the wharf, and the bill of lading is given, we give the agents a dock warrant—we make a landing-book, which we keep, and send another to the merchants; that shows the weights—the delivery warrants are made out</p>

               <p>at the wharf, end go into the merchant's hands; they can then he trans<lb/>ferred from one person to another—when warrants are sold they are sometimes endorsed for the delivery of the goods—at other times we make out new warrants, and sometimes we transfer them to another person's name if they require it, and the old warrant would be registered or cancelled—in September, 1878, a quantity of ingots of tin were landed at the wharf from the Sinbad, consigned to Redfern, Alexander, and Co., for which four warrants were made out and handed to them—two of those warrants came to the wharf in the ordinary way; the goods were delivered and the warrants cancelled—the other two, 77946 and 77947, came to the wharf on 26th November, 1878, with this note. (<hi rend="italic">From Straus and Co., of</hi> 16, <hi rend="italic">Rood Lane, enclosing the two warrants for</hi> 408 <hi rend="italic">ingots of tin, ex Sinbad, and requesting two fresh warrants to be sent instead, deliverable it James and Shakspeare</hi>)—this is signed "C. P. S.," which are Shephard's initials, showing that it came into his possession—this "19642," and the reference "S. 2-248," and the clerk's name, "Jallard," are all in his writing—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two warrants we issued to James and Shakspeare in the place of the two cancelled; they are identical with them—they came in the ordinary course in December, 1879, and the goods were delivered on them—that completed the delivery of the whole of the tin from the Sinbad—the last was delivered on 16th December, 1879—I have searched for the two warrants which these replaced—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is No. 77947—No. 77946 has never been found—on 4th June this year I was at the wharf when Mr. Howell came there from Mr. Wiseman and presented this inspection order in an envelope—Shephard was away ill—I read it, made some inquiries, went to 92, Gracechurch Street, and saw Anderson—I said, "I want the warrant you have been endeavouring to raise 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on"—he said, "I don't know anything about it, I am acting for a friend"—I said, "I want the warrant, it is a stolen document"—he said, "I cannot say anything about it till my friend comes, and he has gone to Charing Cross; you astound me, Mr. Jones"—I said, "Give me the warrant, you know where it is"—he said, "I do not know"—I replied, "I don't believe you; who had the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. raised on the warrant in March last?"—I may have said "the warrant for 179 ingots of tin," I won't be positive—he said, "Not Mr. Shephard, I got it for another person"—I said, "I shall take my own course," and left—I then went to Shephard's place, and did not see Anderson again till he was in custody—I have examined the books, but find no entries of rent paid for the tin or for stamps for the warrant—this is the cargo ledger; it contains an entry of two warrants, 84699 and 84700, in Shephard's writing—we stow the tin in five-ton piles, and mark the particulars on the side of one ingot—this ingot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is marked "<hi rend="italic">ex</hi> Chimbray" on one side, and "<hi rend="italic">ex</hi> Sinbad" on the other, so that if a person went to look at the tin the ingot had only to be turned round—I discovered that a week or 10 days afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I persist in my statement that he was the first who mentioned Shepherd—my deposition says "I mentioned the name of Shepherd to the accused first"—it was read over to me and I signed it, but I called Mr. Wontner's attention to it and asked him to get it rectified, as it was incorrect; I left it entirely to him—I have known Anderson five or six years—I have never threatened him, and I do not think I ever said that I disliked him—the warrant I asked him for</p>

               <p>was for 229 ingots of tin—he said "I do not know anything about it; I am acting for a friend," or "I do not know much about it; I am acting on commission," at this distance of time I cannot say which—he did not say that the friend who was coming from Charing Cross was Mr. Shaw; he did not mention any name—the inspection order was in an envelope unsealed; and addressed to Mr. Low—it is very fortunate that I saw it, because it led to the discovery of the fraud—it might have fallen into Low's hands—he is one of our foremen and one of my witnesses—he would have to show the tin at the wharf to any person who came to look at it—the warrant marked "B" is signed by Mr. Charles Major, and properly countersigned by a clerk like a perfectly <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> document—it is a genuine document, and goods have been delivered on it—the number of it is 84649—warrant C, No. 32700, is also properly countersigned—those are the two genuine warrants issued to James and Shakspeare—I signed the charge sheet—Mr. Major instructed me to charge them—brokers frequently raise money on warrants without disclosing their principals' names—they are common negotiable documents in the City—Mr. Attenborough's document is perfectly genuine, but is not the original—we have not found the original warrants—warrants 77946 and 47 are sent out with a request to issue two warrants to James and Shakspeare, and I have 8469 and 8700 cancelling them—we have pawned 77947, but 77946 was pawned with Mr. Attenborough, lodged by him at the wharf, and handed to Shephard, who issued this 84097, which was signed by Mr. Martin, a member of the firm, just as a person would sign a cheque put before him by his confidential clerk—Shephard was a confidential clerk; he was the leading clerk at that time—I believe Anderson is a commission agent—Mr. Attenborough brought this document to the wharf, and I obtained this in its place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The one Mr. Attenborough produced was given in exchange for a cancelled one, which was stolen, and the one Mr. Atten<lb/>borough delivered up cannot be fond—Mr. Wiseman showed me the other; that was a cancelled document which ought not to have gone out again—I am sure the letter was addressed to Low—the envelope most probably went into the waste-paper basket—Low was on the wharf, but at some distance—it is the ledger clerk's business to sign inspection orders—they are written by the owner of the goods and initialed in our ware-house, signifying that the person may go and view the goods—this is a request to inspect; it would require initialling—such papers are not usually addressed to Low—it is quite out of the common to address to a foreman—they invariably come down open and addressed to the superin<lb/>tendent, Red Lion Wharf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, of 11, Greek street, Soho—I first saw Anderson on 19th December, 1879, he came into my office and gave me this card, "Chas. M. Anderson, 20, Navarino road, Dalston"—the address is in writing; it is the prisoner's writing—he said that he wished to borrow some money on a warrant for tin, which he produced; it was for 229 ingots—I said it would be necessary</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188307300056"/>
               <p>for me to send to the wharf to inspect it, and also to have the warrant representing the tin entered in my name and deliverable to me or my assigns, or to my order, and further, that as I did not know the value of tin I should have to ascertain it—I asked if it was his property or if he was borrowing it for anybody else, and I believe he represented himself as the principal; if he had been an agent he would have signed the document as such—he thoroughly convinced me that he had a right to deal with it—it is four years ago—terms were mentioned, and he subse<lb/>quently signed this contract. (<hi rend="italic">This was for the loan of</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">at</hi> 20 <hi rend="italic">per cent. interest on</hi> 229 <hi rend="italic">ingots of tin, with power to dispose of the same in default of payment of interest, dated 20th December</hi>, 1879, <hi rend="italic">signed by Anderson.</hi>) The interest was payable every three months—I paid the rent at the wharf, but I should charge him what I paid—he did not show me a receipt for rent, he merely produced the warrant—the payment of the rent would appear on the face of the warrant—the interview was on the 19th, I sent to the wharf next day, and found that the tin was worth 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him he could have 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it, and he signed the contract on the 20th—he left the warrant with me on the 19th, I sent it to the wharfinger on the 20th, and exchanged it for the one produced—I got the property in my own name before I advanced the money—the description of the weight is the same; it is a five-ton parcel—I did not have a sample—I paid him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and notes, less 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the wharfinger for the new warrant and stamp, which is signed by Shephard, and the expense of going into the City—I believe he called and paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. interest at the end of the three months, as I find it was renewed on 20th March—there would be no fresh contract—when he paid the interest he gave up the counterfoil and received another—on 22nd June he renewed it again, and on 12th October again, and on 11th February, 1881, again; on 23rd February he had another advance of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave a new contract note—I retained the original, and he had a duplicate, which was given up and filed—I have had no notice to produce it—on 5th September he had a further advance of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 12th August, 1882, bringing it up to 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and three days afterwards he came back and had 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, making 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the agreement is dated 12th August, 1882—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the receipts—I paid for the rent at the wharf—the wharfingers are empowered to sell in 12 months unless the rent is paid—the first receipt is dated 18th September, the day of the landing the cargo—I did not see him every time he called—I saw him about three times—I believe he had an office in the City—I have two letters from him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this one of May 31 refers to my letter informing him that the last year's interest was overdue, and unless it was paid the goods would be sold; no interest had been paid since August, 1882.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He never made the slightest objection to my making the fullest inquiries—I am quite willing to lend him 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—agents fre<lb/>quently receive instructions only to obtain a certain advance, though the pawnbrokers are willing to lend more; they only carry out their instruc<lb/>tions—he said "I only want 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—agents do not always say that they are agents—I sent down to the docks, and my warrant clerk brought me a warrant signed by the wharfingers themselves; what more could I do?—there was nothing in Anderson's conduct from first to last to show that he knew he was dealing with stolen property; he seemed to be a <hi rend="italic">bond-fide</hi> agent or principal, or at all events dealing with goods which</p>

I am Mr. Attenborough's clerk—on 20th December, 1879, he sent me to Red Lion Wharf with a warrant relating to 229 ingots of tin—I saw a clerk and ultimately saw Shephard; I showed him the warrant—he took me into a warehouse, where I saw some tin marked "Sinbad" in four places—I handed him the warrant, he after<lb/>wards gave me another, and I paid him 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went back and handed Mr. Attenborough the warrant I had received—I waited nearly an hour for the signature of the firm to the new warrant—I went to the wharf on different occasions and saw Shephard—I paid him the rent three times, and got his receipt each time—I never saw Anderson in my life.</p>

I carry on business in Nicholas Lane, City—Mr. Wiseman is interested in some of my transactions—I have known Ander<lb/>son about fifteen years, but not at his private residence till about a month age—I believe he is a commission agent—on 7th or 8th March I met him in the City, and he asked me if I could get him an advance on some metal—I said if he contemplated selling it no doubt I could, and a day or two afterwards he came to my office, and two days afterwards I gave him an advance of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by these two cheques (<hi rend="italic">For</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 136<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>), less the accustomed charges, after Mr. Howell of our office had been to the wharf and reported upon the tin—I produce the warrant; it is 77942 for 179 ingots—two or three months afterwards he wished to raise about 420<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on another tin warrant, and gave me the order to view; I asked him how much metal there was; it was under consideration, but we decided not to do it—he said that he objected to Mr. Major knowing it at the wharf—I said "Why?"—he said "He will say, 'What is my boy Charley doing with tin?'"—I knew that he was connected with Mr. Major in some form, and there is a similarity of name—he was going to close up the envelope with the inspection order, and I said "It is similar to a letter of introduction; you had better leave it open," and I did so—I do not think he said who Low was—I gave it to Howell, or it was given to him on my behalf—this is it: "Please allow bearer to inspect 289 ingots of tin <hi rend="italic">ex</hi> Sinbad.—Yours truly, H.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner</hi>). I have been 11 years in Mr. Major's service—these two warrants were given out in place of warrants 77446 and 77447 for tin by the Sinbad—I had this cancelled warrant 77496 in my possession for about two months, and gave it to Anderson in December—of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he got from Mr. Attenborough I got the same amount as the first advance—I supplied over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for interest; 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a quarter—I gave it to Anderson, and sometimes he sent some one else for it—I did not know that he got any subsequent loans till I heard it at the Mansion House—the last money I gave him for interest was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in November, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. first and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a man he sent down, as he was pressed for money, and wanted to pay it into the bank at once—I was not certain whether he had paid the interest—I had several conversations with Mr. Attenborough with regard to the pledging of the warrant with him—after Anderson first went to Mr. Attenborough he said he had arranged that the warrant would be deposited with them for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or more if re<lb/>quired, at 20 per cent, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the ticket, and that he had to make a declaration—he afterwards suggested selling the ticket—I said "You cannot possibly do that; the warrant must not go into the market, because it must be kept quite secret"—Mr. Wilson, from Attenborough's, came down once to see the tin, and of course I showed him some tin—he came three times—I know nothing of the word "Sinbad" being put on it; I suppose that was done when I was ill in bed—I supplied him with no money for interest after September—I gave him the second warrant, 77447, at the beginning of last December, and said if any one wanted to see the tin they were to ask for me, and some one came early in December—I got 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that warrant; I wanted 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not aware he had got 188<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. till the detective told me—some few days elapsed, and Anderson brought down a blank promissory note—I was to draw on him; it was purely a matter of confidence between us—I suggested it, and he filled it up and said "How much money do you want?"—I said "I want the whole of it"—he said "Can you do with 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I said "Yes, but I must have the other by next Tuesday"—we went in the train together to a house where he wanted to see a friend—he gave me 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said "You will have another 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to come," but I have never seen it, though I have worried him day by day till I was locked up—I signed two bills, which I have never seen since—these two receipts for rent are fictitious—I made them out, and gave them to Anderson to satisfy Mr. Attenborough—there really was no rent due for tin <hi rend="italic">ex</hi> Sinbad—I gave these other two receipts for 80 weeks and 53 weeks to Anderson—Mr. Wilson came down one day, and said "Mr. Shephard, I want to pay up the rent on that tin"—that nonplussed me at the moment—I did not want to take any money from him, but I made out this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and took the receipt—he gave me the money, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I kept it—the other two receipts I gave to Anderson, and got no money at all—I have not noticed any of the transactions in the book; I could not.</p>

A. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—that would not go into the ledger at all—the business had commenced months before I went: I went to assist in an agency which he had just got—my salary was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, not 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I used not to take it all, and these sums of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. are on account—there is no entry of the transactions with Mr. Attenborough—I am the Mr. Dickson who carried this letter to Mr. Attenborough on 12th August—I do not see here that I got the balance of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between the 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know from memory whether it was 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is Mr. Anderson's signature for the 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had to take the balance of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

               <p>Attenborough the very day before the letter, and was chargeable against the persons pledging the goods—I believed they had paid it to Major and Field—I took it back because Mr. Anderson got the advance for Shephard, and having paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Shephard had to make it good—this is the only entry I can show you with regard to that transaction—this is my own book; it has my private memoranda in it—I do not know A.

I am in Mr. Salmon's employ, at 157, Kentish Town Road—on Saturday evening, 30th June, I received instructions from Mr. Baker, and went after and watched Wright—I went up as far as Mr. Daniels's shop, about 100 yards from Mr. Salmon's shop—Wright crossed over Patshull Road, which is on the opposite side to our shop, and the same side as Daniels's—he then started running, and then slipped a little blue polo cap out from under his jacket, put it on his head, and started running again—he came up to the top of Patshull Road, looked round, and turned to the left, and I did not see any more of him—I turned back to the shop and told Baker what I had seen.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant Y</hi>). About 6.30 p.m. on June 30th I was in Kentish Town Road and saw the three prisoners walking together near the Prince of Wales, about 60 yards from Salmon's shop, and on the other side of the road—they were going towards the Midland Railway Station, away from Salmon's shop—I followed and watched them—after a while Christmas left Dellar and Wright and walked on the other side of the way—the other two stood opposite Daniels's, the draper's, conversing together for a few minutes, and passed up the Patshull Road together through Bartholomew Villas into Bartholomew Road—Dellar was carry<lb/>ing this black bag—I saw Wright take this felt hat off his head, hand it to Dellar, who placed it in this black bag, and close the bag—Wright placed this pen behind his ear, and went into Kentish Town Road, closely followed by Dellar, and entered Salmon's shop without a hat, and the pen behind his ear, Dellar remaining about fifty yards behind, at the corner of Keely Street, on the same side of the Kentish Town Road, with the bag in his hand—Christmas was standing on the opposite side of the way, right opposite Dollar's—shortly after I saw Wright leave the prose<lb/>cutor's shop hurriedly, and pass up the Kentish Town Road followed by the other two prisoners, one on each side of the way—Wright turned up Patshull Road, the other two followed about 20 yards behind him—he started running when he got into that road—I saw the manager and the boy running, and also the other two prisoners, after Wright, and I saw him turn at the top of the road to the left, into Bartholomew Road, then I lost sight of him—the other two prisoners turned sharply back into Kentish Town Road—at the corner of the Patshull and Kentish Town Roads Dellar handed the bag to Christmas, and Dellar went first up the Kentish Town Road, walking fast, and looking up every turning as he went, followed by Christmas close behind—I followed them till they got to Leyton Road, where they turned up, and went 300 or 400 yards and joined again, and turned back to come into the Kentish Town Road—I got assistance and took them in custody—I said "You will be detained on suspicion"—Dellar said "What for?"—I said "I don't know what for until I have made inquiries what you have done"—I went to Mr. Salmon's shop, ascertained from Baker what had occurred, and went in search of Wright—I found him in the Junction Road, about a mile from Salmon's shop, wearing a polo cap—I told him the charge and took him to the station—6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, and this pen and penholder were found on him, and on Dellar 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze; 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on Christmas, and he had this bag and a stick—they were all searched in the same room at the station and at the same</p>

I did not address myself to any one; another officer in plain clothes was in the room—when Dollar was taken he said "What am I charged for?" and when he was charged, and they were all together, he said he did not know the other prisoner Wright—after he was charged Dellar asked me to go to Mr. Evans, a draper in Oxford Street, to make inquiries as to his character—I went there and in<lb/>quired, and found he had been working there, and Mr. Evans gave a satisfactory account of him; he left of his own accord; Mr. Evans had no charge against him—Dellar gave his address—I went there next day, on the Sunday, and searched his room—I do not produce anything—when I first saw them they were walking together, they did not join one another—there was a large heap of paving stones alongside the road, and they went behind that to change the hat—any one coming along the same side of the road must have seen it—it was Bartholomew Road, leading into Bartholomew Villas—there were houses on one side and the garden of the public-house on the other—they were fifty yards from the public-house—Wright walked 50 or 70 yards bareheaded, a little in advance of Dellar—I did not see Christmas till I got into Kentish Town Road, and then I saw him on the opposite side—he remained there while Wright and Dellar went round together into the Bartholomew Road—Wright was in front after he had taken his hat off.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, King Square, Goswell Road, and was in the public-house business—on 29th May I inserted this adver<lb/>tisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, and received two answers—I went in consequence of one to 63, Finsbury Pavement, the office of the British Provident Association, Limited, and saw the defendant—I told him I had called in reference to the letter I had received from him, and asked him what the situation was—he said to be a clerk in the office, that they were doing a very large business and should be doing more very shortly, and that I should have to pay a deposit as security, as I should have a certain amount of money through my hands every day—I asked how much I was to deposit—he said about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that my salary would be 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week, payable every Saturday—he said there was going to be a Board meeting on Friday—I then left and wrote to him, and received this reply: "May 31st. Kindly call here to-morrow morning (Friday) in reference to the situation"—I called on June 1st. and the prisoner said that it rested entirely with myself, as he thought the other applicants were not suitable—I asked if he could make the deposit 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "Yes"—I paid him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">Signed "H. Graham, Manager"</hi>)—he said that he had several collectors over London and the suburbs—he asked for references, which I gave, and entered on my duties on 4th June—there was no business, no sales, and no cheques for me to receive or cash—the prisoner handed me this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I remained six weeks—I only got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of my salary—the office was not closed while I was there, but a petition was filed and I received it—I asked him several times for my salary, and he said he would settle it next day, when he expected a gentleman to come—I spoke to him about the petition, and said that if I had known that was going on I should have had nothing to do with the affair—he said that I was not to take</p>

               <p>any notice of it, as it would be put on one side and settled, and I should get my money in full—he asked if I could induce any of my friends to put money in—I said that I could not think of doing that till I got settled with myself—I looked at the company's books, and nothing had been done since April—adding up the amounts that they took, including 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit from different people and myself, their takings amount to about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never got my money back—I believed his statement with regard to the company, and parted with my money because I thought I was going to get into a good situation.</p>

Von Roemer</hi>)—I handed him the parcel of diamonds, and he took them away—he was there about a quarter of an hour—I paid the cheque into our bankers the same afternoon—he came again the next afternoon, and asked if we had the cheque in our possession still, as it would not be met, he had no funds at his bank; that he bought the diamonds for a man named Mainzer, and handed them to him, and he promised him a cheque next morning, but he had not seen him since—I did not know Mainzer—he said that he was going to his private address to find him, and try and get the money—I told him to call at my</p>

               <p>private house in the evening, 9, Duchess Street, Portland Place, and he came and told me that Mr. Mainzer had left his house, and he had not found him—I told him to come next morning at 10 o'clock to my office—he did not turn up, and at 11 I went to my solicitor—when I came back I found him there—he said that he had not found Mainzer, and had not provided for the cheque, as he had no money whatever—my brother and I went with him to Dispeck and Co.'s office, on Holborn Viaduct, to make inquiries about Mainzer—before going up, Von Roemer said that he had met Mainzer, who declined to give up the diamonds, he owing Mainzer money, he meant to stick to them—there was no such name there, and when I came down I found the prisoner Mainzer talking to my brother—I did not hear the conversation—the cheque came back from, the bankers marked "N.S."—we have never seen the diamonds since.</p>

We have had four or five dealings with Von Roemer and for other people 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one single dealing, but not on his own account—I do not know that he has waited for other people to pay the money to him before he paid us—we do not bank at the same bank, ours is the London and Westminster—our books are here—we had a transaction with him on 21st September, 1881, for 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in the same year one for 615<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I most likely paid that cheque into the bank the same day, but it is two years ago—I do not know whether it was the prisoner's cheque—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the prisoner's cheque for 615<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; referring to my book, I see that it was paid in the same day, September 30th—I do not know that that was a transaction depending on the purchase of a customer of his—I think he bought the diamonds for himself—I do not know that he is a kind of middle man buying goods ordered of him for third parties—on 3rd October we had a transaction with him of 322<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was paid by his cheque; it was paid into our bank on the 4th, and we got the cash—we had a trans<lb/>action with him on the same day, 3rd October, for 794<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never heard of middle men buying from us and waiting till the money is paid in by a customer before he lodges the money to meet the cheque—there was a transaction on 3rd August, 1882, of 226<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was paid by his cheque—a cheque has come back marked "Effects not cleared"—we continued to do business with him after that, and the amount was paid—both the prisoners wore charged at the same time before the Magistrate.</p>

I was present on 12th June when Von Roemer came—he said he wanted to buy some diamonds; it was bargained I out, and it was said that it was a cash transaction—he did not mention Mainzer—he gave a cheque before the diamonds were delivered—we should not have parted with them without the cheque—next day, or the day after, I walked to Messrs. Dispeck's and stood outside with Von Roemer; outside Mainzer came up, and Roemer said "This is Mainzer"—they spoke together and I was drawn into the conversation—Mainzer said "Roemer, you have got me into a nice mess; I have given a cheque for those diamonds and you have not paid me"—he said "Well, what has that to do with me? you owe me money, and I bought those diamonds from you, and I intend to get covered;"—I said to Mainzer "You have no right to take those diamonds, they belong to us"—he said "I am very sorry, but I wanted to get covered; Roemer owes me money"—he took me aside and I said "How much?"—he said "About 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—my brother then came down and we left—I heard Mainzer say before the Magistrate that he gave Roemer a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the day of the purchase of the goods.</p>

I am a stage carriage driver, and live at 5, Idonia Street, Westminster—on 19th July, about 25 minutes to 1 a.m., I was in Victoria Street, and asked a gentleman whether I was in the direction of Westminster Bridge—he directed me, and the prisoner volunteered to escort me—we came to a by-street, and he said, "That way, that is the nearest way"—I declined to go that way, as I then knew where I was—he said, "You will have to come"—I refused—he took me by my arm and neck, and being the worse for liquor he dragged me about 30 yards into a court, where he threw me down and struck me—I struggled, and he kicked me on my back, and put his hand in my waistcoat and trousers pocket—I called out, and found a hand over my face—I saw another man, but cannot recognise him; I heard his voice, and caught hold of his leg—I heard two voices; one said, "There is an old <hi rend="italic">copper</hi> on the point"—a man came to help me, and I saw the prisoner strike at him and then confront him—the prisoner's back was turned to the man kneeling over me—a policeman came in sight, and the two men went away—I missed 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; there were two half-crowns, three florins, and the remainder in shillings—it was six days' wages at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day—the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a joiner, of 71, Horseferry Road—on 19th July, about a quarter to 1 a.m., I was in Horseferry Road, and round a by-turning saw the prisoner and another man—they had Bush down—I said, "What is the matter?"—he said, "They won't let me go"—I said, "Where do you live?"—he said, "At Deptford"—I said, "I am going to the Old Kent Road, I will see you part of the way"—the prisoner and the other man left go of him—the prisoner said, "What has it to do with you? we are going to see him home"—I clung to the prisoner, and he made a stroke at my cheek—he tried to edge me away—I kept him at arm's-length—he then tried to kick me, and they both run away—two policemen pursued them, and I saw the prisoner brought back.</p>

On the morning of 19th July, about a quarter to 1, I was on duty in Victoria Street, and saw the prisoner and another man whom I knew well—they had got Bush down and were trying him about—I saw the prisoner strike Morgan and kick him—the prisoner ran through Pear Street—Bush said, "That man has robbed me"—I went after him, caught him in Peter Street, and said, "You are wanted at the corner"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "I have received information that you have robbed a man"—he said "No"—I took him to the station—his pockets had no bottoms to them—the other man got away.</p>

I had had a drop of drink, but knew what I was about. The other man offered to fight me, which was the reason I stopped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman, living at 17, Bennett Road, South Lambeth Road—on the evening of 23rd June I was standing outside a urinal near St. James's Park Station, waiting for a friend—I was wearing a watch and chain attached to my buttonhole—Kelly came up, snatched the watch and chain away, and ran away—I ran after him about 150 yards, about six yards behind him all the way—I sang out "Stop thief!" just before he was apprehended—he ran up the street towards the Aquarium, crossed the road, and was apprehended right opposite the place where he took the watch from on the opposite side of the road; he had doubled back—I did not lose sight of him till he was stopped—I charged him with the theft—he said "You have made a mistake," or some<lb/>thing to that effect—he was taken to the station—there was some trouble going there, but Bunce did not lose hold of him—I have not the least doubt Kelly is the man—he did not hit me.</p>

I have not got your watch and chain," or something to that effect—I am not aware that I said "Oh, he has thrown it away"—he said to the policemen "It is a nice thing to run and see what is the matter and get charged with the theft," or something to</p>

I am surgeon to the M Division of police—on 5th January last, in consequence of an order from the relieving office I went to see the prosecutrix at 3, Queen Street; that is close to Duke Street—it was a house in which several people were lodging—I think the prisoner was there and a young woman; I could not say whether it was Saunders, it is so long ago I forget—I examined the woman—I found that the eye was very much injured; the eyeball had a wound in it, and she seemed suffering a great deal—I believe she was blind in the other eye at the time—it was a serious case, and I ordered her immediate removal to the infirmary—I have no distinct recollection of anything that was said by her at the time—my attention has only been recalled to the case within the last few days—I think perhaps I ought to say in justice to the prisoner, that if he had been accused of having done it I should have considered it my duty to have commui<lb/>cated with the police—it was hardly such a blow as could have been Inflicted with the whole fist; with the knuckle probably—it must have been done with some pointed instrument, some projecting instrument, something projecting into the eye—she had not what might be called a black eye—the injury was to the eyeball and the eyelid—it was such an injury as might be caused by falling against the corner of a table or against a mantelpiece.</p>

I lived at Ivy Cottage, 395, Kennington Road—I am now living at 20, Park Road, Hanover Gate—I am not in business at this moment—George Cripps made a communication to me, and on 3rd May I wrote a letter to the prisoners and received in return this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), a book, and some questions and instructions how to answer them—in consequence I called upon the prisoners at the Medical Hall on 7th May—Hancock opened the door and showed me into a room very elaborately furnished as a surgery or consulting-room, with pictures all round of people in various stages of syphilis—George was not there then—I told Hancock "I have come to consult you with reference to this letter which I have received from you," and produced the letter—he said "I will call the other doctor down"—he called George down and I said to them both "I have come to consult you with reference to this letter"—they both said "What, is the matter with you?"—I said "I have felt very ill and depressed," that I was about to be married, and did not think I was in a state of health to go through that ceremony—I was married and had a family; I was not about to be married, and I was not feeling ill or depressed—George said my case was a very serious one, unless I was very careful my case would end very seriously, perhaps in death—I asked him what the charge would be—he said 10 guineas—I said "I suppose both you gentlemen are members of the Royal College of Surgeons?"—they both answered that they were—I said "I am not in a position to pay you the 10 guineas now"—he asked me what I could pay—I said "I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a bottle of medicine," which I did, and it was produced at the police-court in the same state in which I received it—I have not taken the cover off—I believed they were both members of the Royal College of Surgeons, and that induced me to part with my money—they told me to see them again in three or four days time, and then I left—I was not examined in the course of that interview by either of them—on 12th May I went again with George Cripps and saw them both in the same room—I said that I still felt very queer—they gave me another bottle, for which I paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I still</p>

               <p>Have seen his proper name, Henry Clifford Smith, in the book there—he attended for four years; each student has to attend for that time before he can pass the examination—I have passed through the same career—on 19th January, 1870, he went up for the examination at the College of Surgeons, and was referred for three months—he can go up now whenever be pleases and take the minor at the Hall by giving seven days' notice; he would then be in the same position as a chemist and druggist—you can take that up at any time so long as you can prove that you have attended and passed this examination—he was my assistant from the beginning of 1880; I had known him some time before that—he remained so about eighteen months—he went and saw patients and dispensed medicines in my absence, or went with me when I went to see a case, did post-mortems, and attended midwifery cases under my directions—when he left me he was competent to dispense medicines and prescribe as an assistant—I knew him at this Medical Hall—he has consulted me as regards nervous and skin diseases and syphilis, as to what my treatment was; we discussed the matter together—he would come across to me about specific cases—I have been to the Hall lately and seen patients—for some little time lately my name has been up there with my consent, on a brass plate and on this glass also (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is a red lamp, but no name on it.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Gutteridge, a letter-carrier, of 160, Stamford Street—on Tuesday, 10th July, about 6.30 a.m., I went into a public-house in the Cornwall Road, at the end of Stamford Street, Blackfriars, with my little girl, Ada Alice, aged 2 years and 4 months old—I stood her down near my lap and called for a small quantity of brandy—I had a giddiness over me—I had not drunk it when I missed the child, and ran outside and could see nothing of her—I ran to Bow Street Police-station and gave information—I saw her next three days afterwards at the police-station crying very much; she had no boots or stockings on, and none of the clothes which she had on when she was missed—she had the same frock and petticoat, but no boots, stockings, or hat—I never saw the prisoner before.</p>

I am landlord of the Southwark Arms, Tooley Street—I was awoke by Wakeley, and went through a glass door on to the leads, and there saw the prisoner looking through a glass door—I un<lb/>bolted it, and he ran away—I stopped him—he had this knife in his hand—I struck him with this whip—he fell down on the roof against the chimney—I caught hold of his arms—he had this knife in his hand—Wakeley struck him, and he dropped it—I got him down over the roof and into the bar—he said he had had a lot of money and spent it, and wanted to get a little more—I said "I suppose this is the place you wanted to come to?"—he said no, it was next door—I said "Perhaps I had better give you a food thrashing and let you go"—he said "I should be glad if you did—I gave him in custody—I found some putty had been taken from the window—it was all right the night before.</p>

I was at Bermondsey Police-station at 2.30 a.m., when the prisoner was brought in—I examined the window—some putty had been removed, and I found some putty on the knife—there is some on it now—when I told him the charge he said "Attempting, sir"—he was searched, and this piece of paper found on him—it has on it "152, Tooley Street, back entrance Magdalen Street"—there is no entrance from Magdalen Street to the Southwark Arms—there were two keys on him, wrapped up in paper, and a box of matches.</p>
