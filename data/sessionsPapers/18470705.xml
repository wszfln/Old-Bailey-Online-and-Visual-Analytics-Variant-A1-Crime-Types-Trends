The prisoner Christopher was in my service—I have missed a sovereign weighing-machine, a pair of scales, a lancet, some marking-ink, and other things—the lancet and other articles produced are my property, and what I missed—the female prisoner was in the habit of coming occasionally to my house—articles were frequently missed from my establishment—the pri<lb/>soner Christopher sometimes acquainted me of the fact himself—he has come for<lb/>ward, and said such and such a thing was gone, or was stolen off the counter—I said to him one morning, in a pettish way, "It is a very extraordinary thing that these things were never stolen till you came into my place; I never missed so many things as I have since you have been here"—the female prisoner was in the habit of coming at that time—the articles were missed at different times.</p>

On Saturday night, the 12th of June, I applied for a man to take charge of my house, No. 4, Manchester-street—the prisoner was appointed—I gave him the keys—I told him I had a cellar of very fine old port, and cautioned him to take great.</p>

               <p>care of it—I went away at seven o'clock—all appeared safe then on Monday morning I went again, and found the house was not opened—the prisoner was standing at the door—I waited till he went in—I then knocked, and he let me in—we then opened the house, after which I said if he would call again about twelve o'clock I would settle with him—I had agreed to give him a crown, if he took care of the property from Saturday till Monday—I then went down stairs, and found the back kitchen door, leading to the back yard, and the front door, unbolted—the padlock of the wine-cellar was torn off, and the Bramah lock was cut out to let the bolt up—I went to the police-office to acquaint Sergeant Rumball, who came with me and inspected the premises—I then found two or three cwt. of lead gone, and afterwards some brass bolts and six finger-plates, some brass hooks, some wire, and some of the old port gone—Sergeant Rumball found ten bottles hid on the premises—I know them—my name is on them—they ought to have been in my cellar—I have one burgundy bottle here, the same as one that was afterwards found in the prisoner's dust-hole—I had in the cellar burgundy, champagne, claret, and old port—I had been in the cellar, I think, about three or four hours before I gave him possession.</p>

                  </hi> I am a butcher, and live at Enfield-highway. The defendant is also a butcher, and lives at the same place—on Monday morning, the 24th of May, about four o'clock, I was coming up to Londan, to attend Newgate-market—the defendant asked me to take up a body of beef for him—I agreed to do so—he told me to give it to a porter in Newgate-street, to deliver to Mr. Cotterell, a meat-salesman, in Newgate-market—the meat was wrapped up in four cloths, in four parcels, which is the usual way with meat sent to market—I brought it up, gave it to a porter, and instructed him to take it to Mr. Cotterell's—it had taken me about an hour and a half to come up—I arrived in London a little after six o'clock—I heard something from Mr. Cotterell, and I went to him—I found a small portion of the cloth was opened from one of the parcels of beef in Mr. Cotterell's shop—the other three parcels were hanging up in his shop—I examined the parcel that was opened—I saw the meat was not sweet—it was green—it was bad, and unfit for human food—I did not tell the defendant of it when I got back, not till night—the clerk of the market had been down, and told him before I got there—when I told him, he said he was very sorry indeed that he had sent it, and that he had sent it by me—I am not certain whether there was any thunder and lightning that day—it was excessively hot—it was Whit-Monday—I saw a small portion of the beef perhaps about ten minutes after I brought it up—it could not have got into that state in an hour and a half, I think.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Staines, and am a coal-merchant—the pri<lb/>soner was in my service. At a little after six o'clock in the morning of the 30th of June, I heard something in my lane which leads to the coal-wharf—I looked out of the window, and saw the prisoner and the policeman in the lane—I put on my clothes, and went down and found the prisoner and the policeman, and about 100 yards lower down in my yard I saw a barrow with a sack and some coals in it—the sack was mine—the coals I do not know—I deal in such coals—the prisoner was my agricultural servant—he had nothing to do with the coals—he, of course, had to go down the yard occa<lb/>sionally—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of John Watson, and live in Mary Ann's place, Shadwell. On the 7th of June, about six o'clock, I missed two suits of clothes, with the exception of one waistcoat, all the property of David Watson, and a pair of trowsers and handkerchief of John Watson's, which I had seen safe on the sofa in my dwelling-house, between ten and eleven in the morning—I found a key in the parlour when I came home, and the things all gone—I have not seen any of them since.</p>

                  </hi> I am a solicitor, practicing at Kelvedon, in Essex, and was so in 1843. I was employed by the defendant to defend him on an indictment for an assault—Mr. Smoothey was associated with me in the defence—previous to the trial the prisoner paid me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for counsel's fees, and so on—I have here a memorandum in a book, which I made at the time—it was in two payments of 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 18th and 19th of July, 1843—the trial took place on the 20th of July, 1843—I was in Court during the trial, and after the Jury returned their verdict—I was there at the time they returned their verdict—the prisoner was in the dock—I had no communica<lb/>tion with him in Court after the verdict—I do not recollect that I had any communication with him whilst the Jury were deliberating—directly after the verdict was returned he beckoned to me—I stood under the dock I think—be merely called to me—there was no conversation—I think he touched me on the shoulder, or beckoned me in some way—I approached him, and he handed me over a little canvass bag—I directly put it into my pocket—I do not think I examined its contents before I put it into my pocket—I ex<lb/>amined it as soon as I got back to the inn—that might be an hour and a half after—I then found in it twelve sovereigns—there was nothing else in it—Mr. Smoothey was in the room when I examined the contents of the bag—I cannot say whether he saw me examine the contents—I communicated the amount to him—I made a memorandum of the contents when I got home that day—I have it here—about two months after, I received this letter from the prisoner—it is his handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Springfield Gaol, Sept. 6th, 1843.—Friend Bickmore, Sir, I have one favour to ask you, will you oblige in sending me two sovereigns in few day; for when I delivered my purse left me with only few shillings. The reason I ask you this favour, my father intended to send for me with a carriage and four horses, and there</p>

I hop to pass through Kelvedon between the hours of one and three o'clock on Saturday, the 16th of Sept. If you inclose that money, do not write that way that I have written to you, for this letter is sent out by a friend. Sir, if you think you will be at home about that time, I will call on you, friend Bickmore, and I hope you will oblige me with that little sum. Sir, you know that I wish to make Mayhew ashamed of himself. These few lines leave me middling, according to the situation I am in. I will make all things right when I come home, and long laugh at my enemies. From yours, Joseph Willett."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first see Willett next after the trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think it was about two months—he was imprisoned for two months, and after the expiration of that period, I have a recollection of seeing him return home from Chelmsford—that was after I received this letter—I think that was the first time I saw him after the trial—perhaps I might have seen him once be<lb/>fore—now I come to recollect, I think I saw him in Springfield gaol in the early part of Sept.—I do not think anything passed then as to my account against him, or as to the sum of money that he had handed over to me—I do not think I ever made any demand upon him for my bill after he came out of gaol—he made nodemand upon me for any money given me by him; none whatever, either by letter or by word of mouth—I had a very small balance due to me, taking into account the 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the first I heard of the 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was by a communication from the official assignee in Nov., 1844, I think—I answered that—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—this is the second answer I made to the official as<lb/>signee—it is dated 4th Dec.—my first answer I think was on 4th Nov., about a month before—I was present on three or four occasions at the Bankruptcy court while the defendant was passing his examination—I think I was present on 5th Dec., 1844, but I am not sure, or whether I was there on 21st Jan., 1845—I was examined there twice, once in May. last year, and once in 1844 or 1845—it must have been in 1845 that I was examined the first time, I think—I do not think I was present at any time when the prisoner was being examined and when I was not examined.</p>

On the 11th of June I was in my own place, facing where this matter happened—I saw the prosecutor when he was thrown down backwards by the prisoner—he was bleeding profusely—I ran out to assist him—the prisoner was a-top of him—I got him off at last and he went away—I went over to my place</p>

               <p>again, and he came and seized me in the same manner, and threw me back<lb/>wards—I am afraid I shall not get the use of my shoulder again—he has been in the habit of doing it before—he did not say a word while he was doing it—it was done in a tremendous spiteful way—I do not think he is altogether right in his mind—he gets into this savage cross disposition—after he had thrown me down, a parcel of boys in the yard came and assisted in getting him off me, and got him away from me—he got away from the boys and escaped over the wall, but the neighbours turned him back again—the doctor and the officers then came up, and finding he was in that tremendous manner they ordered the jacket on him, he was brought in that way before the Magistrate; and even then he plunged a good deal, so that they could not get him along the streets.</p>

We have a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Kestell</hi>—the prisoner is not chief mate of it—he was not employed by Mr. Smith—I know nothing about him, except that he came home in a vessel some months ago—he never paid any of Mr. Smith's men—he had nothing to do with it—he was not authorized to act as an officer, or in payment.</p>

The prisoner was in our employ for about three years, to assist in taking in and giving out work—he was foreman of the cutters—my brother sent a pair of trowsers to be repaired—they would find their way into the prisoner's department—they were lost—I asked the prisoner several times about them, he said they were lost, that they were gone from the warehouse, and had got mixed amongst the goods—he said he had looked for them, and could not find them—these now produced are the trowsers—I was with the officer when he went to the prisoner's lodging—he found in a drawer in the pri <lb/>soner's bed-room, a duplicate corresponding with this duplicate of the trowsers.</p>

On the 26th of June, Johnson was brought to me with a wound on the left side of the face, near the eye—it seemed an incised wound by its bleeding so freely—the edges were very clean cut—it was quite on the ridge of the bone—it might possibly be done from some other cause—it was a kind of cut—it healed kindly, and a wound from a bruise does not heal so kindly, it gener<lb/>rally separates—the skin was separated about an inch—it appeared to be rather deep—it bled very freely all over her clothes—they were saturated with blood from the top to the bottom—a bruise would not have that effect—there was a bruise independent of that, and a black eye.</p>

                  </hi> I am the superintending President of the Inland de<lb/>partment of the Post-office—the prisoner Thacker has been for some years in the service of the Post-office, first as a letter-carrier, and afterwards as a sub-sorter—he was a sub-sorter in the Inland-office on the 23rd of June—Ringrose was a letter-carrier in the 10th division, in which Lower Thames-street is in<lb/>cluded—the walks are distinguished by numbers—Lower Thames-street is No. 106 or 116, I cannot exactly say which—in the forenoon of the 23rd of June last, an East India mail arrived—according to the practice of the office the letters coming by that mail would be in the course of sorting for the different divisions in the mid-day of the 23rd of June—as the letters arrive in the mass, they are first of all divided into fifteen divisions, numbered from one to fifteen—they are divided by sorting—the letters belonging to each division are sorted to each division—all the letters of the 10th division would be transferred to Thacker, and he would then re-sort those letters at his table into the letter-carries' walks—I cannot say exactly how many walks there are in No. 10—I should say from ten to twelve—it would be the duty of the sub-sorter to divide the letters which he had previously sorted to his division, to the separate letter-carrier's walks of his division—Thacker would stand those letters up on his sorting-table which bears the names of the different walks of which the division consists, printed on the edge or back of the table—he would be on one side of the table, and the general sorters on the other—the letter-carriers did not act as general sorters on this occasion—it is the duty of the sub-sorter to place a docket bearing the number of the letter-carrier, and the name of his walk, in front of each parcel of letters—he puts the letters for each walk separately, and when the letters have accumulated to as many as can con<lb/>veniently remain there, he places them upright, with a docket on them—they are then handed to the teller, who sits at another table within a short distance—it is the duty of the sub-sorter to take them, but occasionally in the press of business a messenger is employed, and frequently the President himself does it—the teller would tell up the amount of postage charged on that batch of letters, and enter the amount on the docket—they are then taken away from the teller by a messenger, with the docket, to a box appropriated to the walk to which they belong, in the letter-carriers office, which is the adjoining office; but previous to the letters being placed in the box, the messenger hands the docket to the check-clerk, who enters the amount of postage in his book—the messenger leaves the docket with the check-clerk, and places the letters in the box—at that period the letter-carrier does not see the docket—in the course of sorting the East India mail, it frequently happens that there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050072"/>
               <p>is more than one <hi rend="italic">charge</hi> of letters taken to the box—the letters on which the docket is put are called a <hi rend="italic">charge</hi> of letters—I do not know how many <hi rend="italic">charges</hi> there were that morning of the East India mail for the Lower Thames-street division—supposing there were two, the same ceremony would be gone through in each, the letters being taken away from the table as they accumulate—when the charge is complete in the letter-carrier's office, the duty of the carrier begins—it was then the duty of Ringrose to take the letters from the box, tell up the amount of postage, and report it to the check-clerk—he has no knowledge of the amount till he tells it up—he tells it up on each occasion when there is a charge to his box—if there were two charges, he would have to make two tellings to enable him to know for the first time the amount of the charge—it is the duty of the letter-carrier when he has ascertained the amount of each charge, to report it to the check-clerk, to call it out to him—if the amount is correct as it appears on the docket returned to the check-clerk, the check-clerk would hand the letter-carrier the docket, and he would sign it, and return it—he generally puts his initial—he then places it in a small box close by, in front of the check-clerk, appropriated for that purpose, and that docket is afterwards retained as an official voucher—if the amount does not agree, another clerk is called, who is denominated the re-teller, and he would be a sort of umpire between the telling-clerk and the letter-carrier—he decides the amount, and then the carrier signs it, if it is wrong he alters it—if there were two batches of letters carried in the course of the sorting of the mail to the Lower Thames-street-walk, the letter-carrier would have possession of two dockets, which he would place in the box—after he has arranged his letters he may have some letters mis-sorted to him, which he would hand to the charge-taker and get an allowance for, and other letter-carriers may have had letters mis-sorted to them intended for him, which they would bring to the charge-taker—the charge-taker is the person who ascertains the aggregate amount of the different charges of letters that fall in his department—if there are two charges of letters, they are put together, and the whole amount is remitted to the charge-taker, and then, if a letter-carrier has had any letters mis-sorted to him, he gets credit or debit on them, and having ascertained the amount of the whole, and the balance for which the letter-carrier would be responsible, the carrier then proceeds to his delivery—the postage by the Indian mail is considerably higher than on ordinary letters, and if people were mischievously disposed, that would be the most convenient opportunity—the East India mail postage is very heavy—on this occasion the letters came through France—that makes the amount still larger—the newspapers are charged 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, by way of France, by way of Southampton they are free—the letter-carrier pays to the Treasurer, or his representative, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday—in consequence of something that came to my knowledge whilst the letters were in the course of being sorted from that mail, on the 23rd of June, I placed myself, accompanied by Mr. Kelly, another inspector, and by Mr. Playle, an assistant-inspector of letter-carriers, in a part of the Inland-office from whence I could see what Thacker was sorting—we were about fifteen yards from his sorting-table, and could see it—I saw Ringrose there that noon—he was en<lb/>gaged at the newspaper business—he had nothing to do with the letters at that time—he was in the same room—I believe he was dividing the news-papers, all I can say is, that I saw him at work at the newspapers, what he was doing with them I do not know—I should say he was about three yards from Thacker—at about a quarter to one o'clock I saw Ringrose leave his</p>

               <p>newspaper business, and go to Thacker's sorting-table—he leant over, and spoke to Thacker—he then left Thacker, and went into the letter-carriers' office—I afterwards saw him go to Thacker a second time, and saw Thacker pass some letters from the left-hand side of his table to his right, which Ringrose took up, and carried into the letter-carriers' office—the Lower Thames-street-walk is at the extreme left-hand side of the table—Ringrose would have nothing at all to do with letters at that time—I afterwards saw Ringrose leave his newspaper duty again—he had a newspaper in hand—that was the third time I saw him—he took nothing away the first time—I could not see what became of him when he went into the letter-carriers' office the second time—it was impossible, he was out of my sight—I saw him go into the letter-carriers' office—the third time, when I saw him with a newspaper in his hand, he went to Thacker's table again, and just at that moment Mr. Playle called out, "Good God, he has given him them plainly enough"—Mr. Kelly made the same observation, and they put their heads together before me, so that I did not see this transaction so plainly; but I saw Ring-rose's hand rise with pretty well a handful of letters under the newspaper—the exclamation was not made loud enough for the prisoners to hear it—I have no hesitation in saying that they were letters in Ringrose's hand—I saw them—the newspaper was not spread out, it was not larger or so large as the letters, it was a doubled up newspaper—Ringrose took the letters and the newspaper into the letter-carrier's office—I did not see Thacker give the letters to Ringrose in this case as I did in the former—I lost sight of Ringrose for about half a minute, I should say, or it might be a minute—I then saw him come from the letter-carrier's office with apparently the same newspaper and the same letters into the Inland-office—he went to the President on duty, Mr. Partridge, and spoke to him, and afterwards to a clerk named Whiting, who took the news-paper from him and opened it—he gave it back to Ringrose, who doubled it up again, and then went back to the letter-carrier's office with the newspaper and letters—I saw no more of Ringrose till he was in custody—it was in con<lb/>sequence of directions that I gave, that both Ringrose and Thacker were taken—it was after their duty closed—that would be after three o'clock, but I cannot exactly say of my own knowledge—it was certainly before four o'clock—Ringrose was brought into Mr. Kelly's room—Thacker was sent into my room—I had not then ascertained the amount of the charges of letters that would have properly come to Ringrose's hands, but I accused Ringrose of having more letters than he had been charged with, and directed his letters to be told up; Mr. Kelly and Mr. Playle were present, and several other par<lb/>ties, but I do not remember who they were—I asked Ringrose the amount of postage he had been charged with, and he handed me this pencil memoran<lb/>dum—I believe it is in his handwriting—he did not hand the paper to me—I cannot speak as to the gross amount of letters found on him—I can only speak to the letters that he had in his possession more than he was charged with—when I accused Ringrose with having more letters than he had been charged with, he denied it—I had the letters told up, and the postage marked on the letters also told, and I found the amount was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more than had been charged against him—I knew what had been charged, by having the book by me, and from his own admission—I am prepared to swear that he had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more than he was charged with—I know that by the book which was at my side, and which will be produced by another witness—Ring-rose named a certain sum, but what it was I cannot recollect—there was a book before me which contained certain amounts with reference to the prisoner—I</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HORRY.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The letters come from the general sorters to the division sorters, of whom Thacker was one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the letters which Ringrose took, were laid flat in front of Thacker, at the right hand side of his sorting-table, not in the usual way, on end—I should say this was a docket (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—when he sorts the letters, he puts them up, takes the docket out of a little box, and puts in front—that is a signal that they are ready for the telling-clerk—the docket being placed before them is the signal, if you call it so, not without—it is the sorter's duty to take them to the telling-clerk, although when pressed, a messenger will do it, or the Pre<lb/>sident himself—the sorter goes on with his work, and the proper person or anybody that may have to take them to the telling-clerk comes by and takes them—if we are pressed, myself or any of the Presidents, or anybody would take them to the telling-clerk—I do not mean "anybody"—if there is a press of business, the messengers, or the President, an inspector, or a clerk may do it—in the press of business, an inspector might even direct a letter-carrier to do it—it might be so, but I question it—they never have done so, to my knowledge—I swear that positively—I have heard of it being done since this transaction—a letter-carrier ought not to be employed to do it—when we have press of business, we are glad of anybody to assist another, undoubtedly, but they should be employed in their respective duties—if one had nothing to do, we should be very glad of him to help another, but not to do this—I was not aware of its being done until since this transaction.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050075"/>
               <p>have you heard about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard that an inspector, having a press of business, occasionally directs a letter-carrier, under his own eye, to take the letters—the inspector standing by would say, "Put over those charges to the tellet"—that is not giving him a general roving commission—the inspector says to the letter-carrier, "You may take it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HORRY.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the press of business, does not a sub-sorter some-times, when he has a number of letter before him and is wanting to get rid of them, tell a letter-carrier, or anybody coming by, to take them to the telling-clerk? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> No—I positively say I am not aware of such a thing—I do not know of it—I might have said that at such times we are glad to get. the assistance of anybody, but I never referred to a letter-carrier, most assuredly—there is a division between each sorter—there may be about thirty inches allowed to each sorter—I have never a known a man, when he has so many letter as to impede his sorting, call anybody that may be passing by, to take some of his letters away, that he may have the table cleared—I never knew anything of that sort occur—the Thames-street walk, on the arrival of an Indian mail, is rather heavy, so that the tenth division would have a heavy morning's work—I really do not know that anything is meant by putting the letters flat—I have not risen from the ranks—I have not been an inspector—the imperfectly directed letters should be placed in a box in front of the sub-sorter—there is a box for that purpose—they are not laid flat, to my know<lb/>ledge—he place them in the blind box in front of him—he does not place them flat beside him on his right hand side, to my knowledge—I do not know that his laying them flat on his side is a signal for them to go to the blind sorter—the practice, according to my belief, is, that the sorter on the opposite side of the table takes the blind letters to sort—we call those "blind letter" that are imperfectly directed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The blind sorter is the man that has to receive the letters that the sub-sorter cannot make out, or addressed to firms such as "Messrs. Allen and Co., druggists, London?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—my impression is, that from Thacker, or from the district sorters, the letter are taken by the general sorter gene<lb/>rally—I am not aware of any blind man—I have described the practice according to the best of my belief—I am not aware of any blind sorter in the sorting of the town letters in the first instance—there is not such a man as the blind sorter among the general sorters, that I am aware of there is not a blind sorter in the London delivery—there is, I believe, for the letters passing from London, and I believe there are blind sorters in the letter-carriers' office, but I am describing the Inland-office—what passes in the letters-carriers' office is an after process—I think there is a person of the name of Sims in the Inland-office, but I really do not know him—I have 762 men under my control, and it is impossible for me to know them all—I think there is a man of that name, but whether he is a letter-carrier or a sub-sorter, I really do not know—there was a clerk of that name, but he has left—I cannot say that Sims' duty is to sort imperfectly addressed letters—other witness will give you all this information—my duty is the superintendance of the others—I cannot enter into these minutes points.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The letters that come to Thacker's table have been previously sorted by the general sorters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they would detect the blind letters—still occasionally some might slip in, which Thacker would put into a box in front, and the general sorter standing on the other side if the table, would take them out—they are in fact the blind sorters.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050076"/>
               <p>a letter is addressed merely "London," what does he do with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He sorts it to the book-officer in the letter-carriers'-office, and he looks to the book to see what the address is—I do not know that the letters laid flat are for the book-officer, or for the blind sorter—I am not aware of any letters being laid flat on the sorting-table—I do not think that letters called <hi rend="italic">callers</hi> are put down flat by the sub-sorter—If a number of letters come to one firm, I do not think they are laid flat for convenience, and kept out of the general charge—the telling-clerk sits a little way from the subsorter, and, according to the ordi<lb/>nary course of business, these letters will pass over to him—he tells there up rapidly, makes out the amount, and hands it to the check-clerk, who sits above him, the letters are placed in the letter-carriers' box, and the letter-carrier puts his initials to the docket—if he finds out an error, after he has gone out of the office, and after the delivery, it is his duty, if he is an honest man, to come back again and rectify it, but I am not aware that I ever heard of such an error—if he has letters mis-sorted to him he brings them back, and has the allowance made for them—these letters are handed over to the proper letter-carrier, and the proper letter-carrier is then charged with them—he is charged with the letters delivered to him from other letter-carriers, and discharged from these which he has delivered over to others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose the carrier has got his letters, he has to go over then hurriedly, to check the telling-clerk, and having done that, in going out of the office, he finds that all three parties have made a mistake? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware of such a thing—I thing such a fact, if it ever happened, would come under my notice—it would be a most extraordinary case—there is a letter-carrier of the name of Hodge—I know him very well, he is a very honest man—I have no knowledge of a mistake being made with him a long time ago, and his coming back an accounting for it—there are papers for the President to rectify such errors when the man comes back next morning—this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is not a President's paper, but it is very similar to it—this is the charging of the mis-sorted letters—it is a very similar docket to the one to which you are alluding—a carrier has no opportunity whatever of correcting that error till the next morning—Hodge might, there would be opportunities, but I should say the next morning would the be the time—it would then be his duty to come back, and to claim back the reckoning if it was under; or if he had received too much, to pay it over to me—I have know knowledge of the Pre<lb/>sident making a memorandum to that effect in any case—such an occurrence would be most extraordinary—I never heard of a mistake being made by the check-clerk, telling-clerk, and letter-carrier—I know Hodge perfectly well, but am not aware of such a circumstance happening to any one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe there have some rather heavy charged preferred against yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been charged with tyranny, and something of the kind, but nothing beyond that, that I am aware of—I have had a copy of the charges against me, but they applied more particularly to Mr. Kelly, I be<lb/>lieve, then myself; if you will describe the charges I shall be most happy to answer them—they were preferred by some disaffected men in the office, section—the charge came from the letter-carriers—I know a man of the name of Gallin—he is subsorter to Brandon—the charges applied to Mr. Kelly rather then to myself—one cause of complaint was the Post-office Directory being in the office—the men in the office have never complained to me per<lb/>sonally that they were worked improperly on account of the Directory—they presented petitions for the Postmaster-General—I have forwarded their peti<lb/>tions—they have complained that I had not done so, but I deny it—it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050077"/>
               <p>not a general complaint in the office that the letter-carriers were obliged to work excessively on that Directory—it was the complaint of a section—it was left to the option of the letter-carriers whether they would work on it or not, and I think only eleven out of a body of about 300, declined working on it—a section of them have complained of being oppressively worked on the Directory—I am not aware of fifty or sixty—I should think 160 were ex<lb/>amined on the subject—there is no investigation going on at the Post-office into my conduct—a charge have been brought, but it has never been investigated—I unhesitatingly swear that my conduct has never been investigated—I will not swear that my conduct has not been impugned—I was charged with using foul, and I think abusive language to the men—I was charged with the having threat<lb/>ened to punish those who would not work on the Directory, and I would have punished them, because it was part of their duty, by the Postmaster-General's order, and I would have carried it out precisely the same as I would any other duty—the Directory is now entirely a private speculation—it was demi-official—it was acknowledged by the Postmaster-General—it has been so ever since Mr. Kelly has had it—I really cannot tell you when it ceased to be so, but I think within the lost three months—since this investigation Govern<lb/>ment has ordered it to be removed from the office—it has been discontinned—I have been ordered many times to make a return of the persons em<lb/>ployed in the office—I might have been ordered to do so about the 7th of August, 1844—at that time the Directory was considered a demi-official publication, inasmuch as the Postmaster-General ordered the men to work at it, the same as they would at any other portion of their duty; Mr. Kelly, when he entered office, was compelled by the Postmaster-General to purchase it of the previous inspector—I was in office then, but I was not Mr. Kelly's superior officer—Mr. Critchett was the previous inspector—I did not know that he paid every one of the letter-carriers employed on it—I know Mr. Kelly has paid them precisely the same as Mr. Critchett did—I cannot say when the Government order was made for discontinuing the Directory—it was about three months ago, before the 22nd of June—I was present at a portion of the investigation when the parties were examined—my name was not men<lb/>tioned in the charged that was gone into—I did not say that Mr. Kelly could do nothing without me—in common fairness I beg the charge may be read—an investigation was ordered by Government at my request—charges were brought forward against me in conjunction that had taken place at my request—Grapes said, "I can prove that Mr. Kelly's Bokenham has threatened to punish those who neglected to attend to Mr. Kelly's instructions respecting his work," and I would have done so, but that charge has never been investigated—some persons said that the Directory was an impediment in the way of public business—I did not think so myself, that is a point I never admit—my im<lb/>pression, is that the delivery of letters was never delayed five minutes by the Directory, but rather accelerated.</p>

               <p>them up, and so on—Ringrose was engaged with the newspapers that had arrived by the Indian mail, but I do not know whether he was sorting them, or what he was doing with them—I thought he was dividing the town from the country—he was arranging them in some way—that was his duty that morning, it was part of his duty as a letter-carrier—it is generally done, and it was his duty that morning—sorting and arranging is part of a letter-car-rier's duty—they are occasionally employed in sorting newspapers and letters to learn the sorting, there are a certain number of letter-carriers who are ambitious of becoming sub-sorters; and they take every opportunity of learn<lb/>ing the sorting—it is by permission that they are put in—it is not any one that can walk in and do it—I employ them in sorting newspapers for the purposes of the office—it is part of the ordinary duty of a letter-carrier who may be directed to do it, to sort letters for the country, not for London—it is not done as part of his ordinary duty—he is directed to do it by his superior officer, most likely by the clerk who has the direction of the letter-carriers—if he refused to obey, it would be considered a breach of his duty—he does not do it unless specially directed, and I do not specially direct all of them—there is no special direction in writing—letter-carriers are also employed as stampers, to sort newspapers, tie up bags, and carry them out of the office—I do not recollect anything else—they work hard enough, they have quite enough to do—there is no skylight in this room—there are windows at each end, but it is badly lighted—errors are frequently made in calculating the potage of letters—I saw Ringrose go into the letter-carriers' office, and return from there—I was not close enough to see what letters he had—that was about a quarter to one o'clock—I did not afterwards lose sight of Ringrose for two hours—I think it was about a quarter to one that the first transaction took place, and it was about twenty minutes after one that the second took place—I then lost sight of Ringrose—I was called away, indeed I left the place altogether, upon other business; but I gave directions for him to be stopped, and did not see him again till he was in custody—the third time of his going out was twenty minutes after one, and he was in custody about half-past three—he went to Mr. Partridge, the President, on duty, and also to Mr. Whiting, the clerk—Mr. Partridge was directing the general business—the superin<lb/>tending-president's is a distinct office—he has the control of the President—I do not think Mr. Whiting was acting as a teller—it would not have been an impropriety in him so to act—to a stranger there would appear to be noise and bustle in the room, but in reality there was none—there was a good deal going on, moving of arms, gestures, and people passing to and fro—I should say, from sixty to 100 persons were engaged on the Indian mail—I was not conversing with Mr. Kelly while I was watching—we were anxi<lb/>ously looking—my attention was disengaged by some exclamation made by Mr. Kelly—both Mr. Kelly and Mr. Playle spoke to me in whispers, while we were watching, and Mr. Blott came and rapped at the door, and said Colonel Maberly wanted me—no one else knocked at the door, or called my attention off in any way while I was there.</p>

                  </hi> I am an inspector of letter-carriers in the Post-office, I was there on the 23rd of June, when the Indian mail was being sorted for delivery—I was with Mr. Bokenham and Mr. Playle, stationed in a part of the Inland-office where the letters were sorted—Thacker was at that time sorting the letters of the tenth division—I was so placed that I could command a view of the position that Thacker was occupying—I observed the other prisoner, Ringrose, employed in dividing the town newspapers from the country—that was at quite a separate table from Thacker, three or four yards from it—I began to watch about a quarter to twelve, or from that to twelve o'clock—about a quarter to one o'clock I observed Ringrose leave his duty and go to Thacker and speak to him—he then went away, and re<lb/>truned to his own duty—in a few minutes he went up to Thacker again—he stood at right side—at the moment of Ringrose's coming up, Thacker was sorting letters, he had letters in his left hand, and was sorting them with his right—I observed his right hand pass from before him to the end of the desk where Ringrose was standing, and put some letters into</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050081"/>
               <p>Ringrose's hand, which Ringrose immediately took into the letter-carriers' office, that is perhaps six or eight yards off—he was out of my sight when he got into the letter-carriers' office—it is a compartment of the same office, but is separated by a wall, and you have to pass through large door-ways with arches—he went through the arches quite out of the place—the inland office is a long office, consisting of several divisions, called the sorting office, the inland office, and the letter-carriers' office—the letter-carriers office may be considered part of the inland-office, but we call them distinct office—when I speak of the inland-office I mean the office in which the sorting takes place—Ringrose went into the letter-carriers' office, and went out of my sight—I should say he was absent two or three minutes, three minutes would be the very utmost—I them observed him return, and immediately go up to Thacker, speak to him for a very short time, and then go away to the newspapers again (when he went out, he had the letters in his had which he had received at Thacker's table, when he returned he had nothing); he remained at the news<lb/>papers some eight or ten minutes, I did not notice the time particularly—he then went into the letter-carriers' office again, as well as I remember, but my attention was particularly on that spot where Thacker was; and I saw Ringrose then come up to that place; the same place where he had had the other letters, at the right side of Thacker, with a newspaper in his left hand—it was folded up—I then observed Thacker give him several letters, which he immediately put under the newspaper—I cannot say positively that it was a newspaper, but I have no doubt that it was, it had the appearance of one—he then left Thacker and went into the letter-carriers' office—he returned, I may say instantly—on his return, he walked about the inland-office with what appeared to be the same letters and paper—I saw him with them in his hand; he spoke to Mr. Whiting and Mr. Partridge, who was the President on duty—I think both of them took the newspaper out of his hand, I know Mr. Partridge did—he opened it—I cannot say positively whether he gave it him back—after that, he went into the letter-carriers' office with the newspaper and letters—the table at which the sorting took place has a board under the sorter, marked with lines, and inscribed, so as to show where the letters belonging to particular walks should be placed—the Lower Thames-street walk would be on the left hand side of the sorter—the end of the table at which Ringrose was sitting was about three feet, or less than that, from the spot appropriated to the Lower Thames-street walk—I was present when the prisoner Ringrose was brought into my room—that was between half-past two and a quarter to three—I asked him whether the letters then in his possession were those which had arrived by the Indian mail of that day—he said they were—he had them in his hand, tied up in a bundle, what we call <hi rend="italic">set</hi> for delivery, so that the letters would follow at the houses as he would arrive at them—I asked him what his <hi rend="italic">charge</hi> for the day was, and he produced a piece of paper, and read from it the amounts which I at the time took down—he said there had been two amounts charged to him, making 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is the paper he produced and read from—having the paper in his hand, he read 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him as to the "changes," as they are called—he said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. had been added for letter that had been mis-sorted to other letter-carriers, and which were found to belong to him—he did not explain that at the time, because that was what we understood, that made 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. had been allowed to him, making his net charge 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him whether the letters in his possession would amount to that, and he said he believed so—the letters were then re-told in my</p>

               <p>presence, and found to amount to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not tell them myself, the amount was told by Mr. Brodie, I think, and Mr. Playle—Ringrose him<lb/>self looked at what was going on—it was dome quite in his presence—the amount was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. over the amount that he had been charged—he was asked to account for that, and he said he could not—he was then told that the circumstance I had mentioned had been he witnessed, that Thacker had been seen to give him these letters, and that he had been seen to take them away—he said yes, he was very sorry for it, but he did not think that what be had taken amounted to so much—he was asked whether he had taken all these letters in that way to the inland-office, and he said yes, he had, unless it might have been a shilling or so mistake in his charge; meaning too large amount—he said he would never do so again—I cannot speak of my own knowledge as to whether the letters which had been <hi rend="italic">set</hi> for delivery were letters all within his own walk—he said nothing about it—there is a postage of 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on newspapers arriving from India—there were some newspapers among the bundle of letters he had to deliver—I made no calculation to see whether the postage of any of letters or newspapers would amount to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was no one letter the postage of which amounted to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot say positively, but I am quite certain, from the size of the letters, that no one letter was charged that amount—still I did not look them all through, and cannot speak positively to that—Ringrose was then sent away, and Thacker was brought in—he was told that he had been seen giving these letters to Ringrose, and that on telling Ringrose's letters a sur<lb/>plus of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. had been discovered—he said he knew nothing about it, he had not given any letters to Ringrose; that if Ringrose had taken the letters it was without his knowledge, and that he should have permitted Ringrose, or any one else in the office, to have taken any of his letters unquestioned; if he had observed it he should not have prevented it—it would not be possible, according to the regular mode of proceeding, for any number of letters intended for Ringrose's walk to be properly at the right hand end of the table—I have been in the Post-office twenty-eight years—according to the practice and mode of doing business, it could not happen that the letters intended for the Lower Thames-street walk could be at the right hand extremity of the table, if the sorter had sorted them according to the labels to the properly appointed places—no one would have authority to take these letters away, or to interfere with any letters, except those that were put up in parcels, and had a docket in front of them, and then they would be put on the teller's-table for the purpose of being told.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a sorter finds letters imperfectly addressed, what does he do with them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He would put them on his right hand—he usually lays them down flat—they are then passed over to another sorter—it is understood that it is a signal that they are letters for the blind sorter—it is understood that that they mean blind letters, improperly sorted or imperfectly addressed, and to be passed over to be re-sorted—during the press of business consequent upon the arrival of an Indian mail, the sub-sorter is sometimes incommoded by the number of his letters—it is then his duty to put a docket on those letters, and to pass them over to the telling-table—I should say it is the sorter's own duty to hand over his blind letters—the blind sorter is just on the opposite side—I observed Thacker pass some letters over to a man on the opposite side, who, I have no doubt, was the blind sorter, and they were sorted by him—I observed Thacker do something of that sort, ac<lb/>cording to the usual practice—the man sat just on the opposite side of the desk—it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050083"/>
               <p>happened so that morning—he is not properly a blind sorter, but he is a man that re-sorted the miss-sorted letters to Thacker, as I understood from his position—the course is this: on side one of the table the letters are sorted into the divisions, one of which was the tenth, on Thacker, and the letters Thacker had miss-sorted to him he would pass over, in the first stage of sorting, that they should be re-sorted, but the man is not in any sense a blind sorter—if a letter had such a direction that he could not tell to what division it belonged, he would pass it to the original sorter, and it would go from him to the book-officer, if he employed a stranger to take those letters to the sorter, he would do wrong—I am not aware of its being com<lb/>monly done in the press of business—I have never heard of such a thing—instead of doing that, he should hand them to the person opposite—there is no officer called the blind-sorter—there is a man who would sort them as far as possible—when letters arrive at the sub-sorter's, not properly addressed, he hands them up to the re-sorter to be re-sorted, and if he cannot find out into what division to put them, then he puts them into a charge, called the book-officer's charge, or blind charge, and they search out the right address—a letter directed so badly as not to be read, would not be sorted to Thacker, it would be stopped at an earlier stage—the first sorting is the general sorting—they all come out of sorts, and are thrown down on the table, and placed in rows—the general sorter has to sort them into divisions—a letter so imperfectly addressed would not be sorted into any division—it might happen by accident, in the hurry of business—letters are sorted into different divisions—when the sub-sorter comes to sort those letters in the usual expeditions manner, and cannot find out to whose walk they should go, he would put them down on his right-hand side, and pass them to the sorter on the opposite side, who is sorting the first-stage, to re-sort—he puts them on his right side until he has a convenient opportunity of passing them over to be re-sorted, instead of passing over every letter as he comes to it—if busi<lb/>ness is heavy, it is important to him to get off the letters as quickly as possible—he would not say to anybody coming by, "Take these away for me" when he is himself so say near the man that, by just leaning over, and passing his hand over, he could reach him—such letters would go back to the general sorter, who would re-sort them—the sub-sorter puts them over on his right side until there is a sufficient number for a parcel—I should not understand that as a signal to anybody coming by to take the letters up—I should say if a sorter having unpaid letters so placed saw any person take them up, it would be his duty to see what his object was in taking them—they are put there for the purpose of going to the general sorter—no one is authorized to take the letters away to be blind-sorted, except the President on duty or one of the inspectors—I have seen it done except by one of those officers—I never saw a letter-carrier do it—a sub-sorter would not question a superior officer if he saw his letters taken away—it is <hi rend="italic">prima-facie</hi> wrong, but if he saw it was his superior officer on duty that did it, he would then suppose all to be right—I have seen the inspector take letters in that way from the sub-sorter—if a sub-sorter finds he has got a dozen or twenty letters for one firm, I should say that they are stood up on the right hand—a docket would be put to them by the sub-sorter before they were taken from him, and they would be told as a separate charge—I believe there are very few such cases—I doubt whether there are half-a-dozen—their being put on the right or left hand would depend on whether the sorter was right-handed or not—if we had a left-handed sorter, the probability is he would put them on the other side.</p>

                  </hi> I am assistant inspector of letter-carriers in the Post-office. On the 23rd of June I was on duty, and with Mr. Kelly and Mr. Bokenham set to watch what was doing at Thacker's table about twelve o'clock—we were so placed as to command a view of Thacker, and the proceeding at his table—I had seen Ringrose, but not when I first began to watch—I saw him afterwards—when I first saw him he was at his duty conveying newspapers, about three yards in front of Thacker—I saw him leave his place and go to Thacker's table—I had then been watching about a quarter of an hour—when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050086"/>
               <p>he got to the table he leaned over, and appeared to converse with Thacker—I could not hear what was said—he was on Thacker's right hand—Thacker was sorting letters, and had some letters occasionally in his left hand, and as he disposed of them of course his left hand become empty—I can hardly recollect what become of Ringrose after he spoke to Thacker—I think he remained there, but I am not quite clear whether it was the first or second time—he came a second time to Thacker—he was still sorting his letters with his right hand—with his left he was holding a small quantity of letters which supplied the right hand—he appeared to pass them to the various divi<lb/>sions or compartments that he was sorting to—I saw him put some on his right hand side and lay them down, which was contrary to the usual practice of sorting, the usual practice being to stand them up—the Lower Thames-street letters should be on his left hand—I saw Ringrose take away a small handful of letters which Thacker had put on his right hand,—he took the first handful into the Letter-carrier's office—Thacker was standing sorting all the while—I am quite positive Thacker could see it done—when Ringrose came back I think he went and spoke to Thacker, and then went and resumed his sorting at the papers—he had nothing in his hand when he came back the second time—about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after, I saw him with what appeared to be a newspaper—I observed as he came to Thacker that he showed Thacker this paper, and immediately after Thacker made a sing, as it were, with his right hand to some letters which were lying, and Ringrose took up those letters, as well as the paper, which he was showing to Thacker—the letters were lying on his right hand—he took them up, and went apparently to the Letter-carrier's office—I lost sight of him, I should say, for scarcely more than a second—I saw him then returning into the Inland-office, where he had taken the letters from, as if seeking for some one—he spoke to one of the clerks—he had in his hand apparently those identical letters, by the size of the grasp—he eventually went to the Letter-carrier's office with them—in the course of the same day I saw him in Mr. Kelly's room—I was present when the letters on him were told up—I imagine all of them were in his own walk, although many of them are not fully directed—they are directed to Messrs, <hi rend="italic">so and so</hi>, London—I only conjecture that they were in his delivery—when told of having been seen taking the letters, he at first said that he could not account for it—he produced this paper, from which we gathered that his letters should have amounted to a certain sum—it is marked with pencil marks—the amount at that time was gathered by Mr. Kelly from the paper, not by me—it was gathered from Ringrose's own lips—the paper was first produced by Ringrose in answer to a question by Mr. Kelly, as to how much was the amount of his letters, and there being some additions and subtractions, Mr. Kelly reduced it to a given sum—Mr. Kelly knew what figures to put down, from the lips of Ringrose, and from the production of the paper—he held the paper in his hand—I saw Mr. Kelly make a memorandum of his own—I think it began by Ringrose holding this paper in his hand, and saying from it, "So much is my amount," and he put it down, but I was passing in and out of the room and am not so confident about it—I cannot positively say whether. Mr. Kelly collected it from the paper, or whether Ringrose told it him—I told up the postage of the letters found on him—I made a memorandum of the amount at the time, but I think I have destroyed it—I have a copy which I made next day—the total amount of the letters found on Ringrose was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot give the items—they are copied partly by myself, and partly by three of the clerks—I cannot tell what the postage of the different letters</p>

                  </hi> I am a cow-keeper and carman, and live at No. 19, New-street, Brompton. Smith was my carman—I have lost a great quantity of corn lately—I have two horses, and I found them very poor and out of con<lb/>dition—they are five year old horses, and young horses will do better on a small quantity of corn than old ones will—I set a person to watch, and found that corn was taken from my premises to the Seven Stars—I put forty pieces of paper amongst the corn with my initials on them—on the 23rd of June the constable came to me—I have examined the oats that are here—they contain the papers I put in them—I am able to swear it is my corn.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Smith.</hi> When I came that morning, did you not tell me to go after the cart, and say, "<hi rend="italic">Jem, Jem</hi>, you will be behind?"—I said yes, I should; it was near five o'clock; I put the corn in the nose-bags because the fowls were scratching about the place; you have not always put the corn out for me: there was one horse your son used to feed every day; you ordered me to go after the horses, and take corn with me; I gave it the horses at the same time that I ate my breakfast, because I did not like to see them without their breakfast; I always looked after your horses.</p>

On the 15th of June, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I was walking in Leicester-square—I saw some persons running—I ran with them, and saw some persons quarrelling—I stopped to look at them—the prisoner spoke to me—he was quite a stranger—he re<lb/>marked that he would like to see the two men fight, there being a difference in their size—I said there was a great contrast in the, and they were badly matched—I walked away, and as I turned round by some wine vaults I felt a tap on my shoulder—I saw that it was the prisoner—he asked me what I was going to stand—I asked what he meant—he said if I did not give him some money or drink, he would call a policeman, and give me into custody for an indecent assault on him—I called him a rascal, and said if he did not be off I would call a policeman and give him into custody—I walked down James-street, till I came near the corner of the Haymarket—I saw a policeman—I went across to speak to him—the prisoner ran before me, and gave me is charge—I told him it was a false charge, because I would not stand drink or money, and said that I was the person who ought to give him into custody—I was taken into station and locked up all night—I was taken to Marlbo<lb/>rough-street the next morning, where the prisoner made his statement to the Magistrate that I had indecently assaulted him—the Magistrate released me till the following Saturday—I went then, the prisoner did not appear, and I was discharged—I did not see the prisoner again till the policeman called at my house, and said that the prisoner was in custody—I went and found he was in custody—I had given my right address at the station, and asked the inspector whether he would take bail, and he would not—I had never seen the prisoner in my life till I saw him in Leicester-square between nine and ten o'clock that night.</p>

                  </hi> I am a shoe-maker, and live at No. 4, Tower-street, Seven-dials, in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-fields. On the 28th of June, about five minutes before five o'clock, I was in my room, which is the Second floor back—the prisoner lodged in the third floor front room—about five minutes before five, Edward James Maids, the prisoner's husband, came home—in turning the staircase, by my door, I saw he had his coat under his left arm—I said to him, "Higher up"—he scarce made me any answer, but went up stairs to his own room—in two or three minutes, his little girl, who is two or three years old, came up stairs—he said to her, "Polly, come in, and if mother comes in to-night there will be murder"—he said that before the prisoner came in—a few minutes afterwards, the prisoner, with her child in her arms, came in, and came up to my room—she had not been there above half a minute before her little boy, who is about six years of age, came up stairs, and she said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi>, go up stairs and see if your father is asleep; don't tell him I am here"—the child went up—he came down again, and said, "No, mother"—I and my friend had just had a cup of tea, and I said to prisoner, "If you had been a little sooner you could have had a cup of tea with us"—she sent her little boy up stairs again to get a bottle of tea, and he came down with it into my room—she sent him up a third time to get a basin out of the drawer with some sugar, and whether the father had any ill thoughts that the child was going to steal the sugar, I cannot tell, but I heard a smack, and the child cried—the prisoner was in my room—she put the little baby out of her arms on the bed, hastened up stairs, and said, "I will see that he don't knock and ill-use my children"—when she got into the room there were some words each way, and I could hear as it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050101"/>
               <p>there were blows each way—I heard them in the room and on the landing, I believe, as if struggling—with that I heard him say there was a person he was intimate with, who had his place better in order than the prisoner's was, though she has always strove to the utmost to do what she could—when she heard this woman brought up, she said, "You sha'nt knock and ill-use my children for that b—y Mrs. Trissell, that w—e"—they had a few words again, and I heard her say all at once, "Take that, you b—r"—as she came down stairs I heard a kind of a fall, and as the prisoner came into my room I heard her husband call out to me, "<hi rend="italic">Bob, Bob</hi>"—I looked round as I was twisting my thread, and I saw a knife in the prisoner's right hand—she had then come into my room—I took the knife out of her right hand, and laid it on the table—I went up stairs to Mr. Maids—he was then lying very near the middle of the floor, in his room, in the act of crawling towards the chil<lb/>dren's bed—as he was on his left side, he said, "<hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, I am an innocent man, so help me G—, of what I am accused of!"—I looked, and saw he had his hand to his left side—I said, "Don't mind me, let me see what it is,"—I undid his braces, and pulled his shirt out—I saw two spots of blood on the shirt, full the size of an egg; and in pulling the shirt up, I saw a wound on the left side of the body, just above the hip—I looked for some water, and there was none—I came down to my room and got about three pints of water and a cloth—I said to him, "Keep it quiet, if it had been more in front it would have been serious"—I went up stairs and washed the wound—I washed his face, and wetted his lips, and left a wet cloth to his wound, while I came down to wash myself and to get a clean shirt, to persuade him to go to Charing-cross hospital with me—he was removed to the hospital, and he lived from Monday, the 28th, till half-past two on the following Wednes<lb/>day—I saw him after his death—I helped him off his death-bed into the shell, and helped to carry him down stairs—that was the same man—I am sure I heard him say, "If mother comes in to night, there will be murder;" and I am sure I heard blows up stairs after that.</p>

                  </hi> I am housekeeper to Mr. William Henry Greville, of No. 2, Herbert-place, Eaton-square, Pimlico—it is his dwelling-house—I came into his service on the 28th of Nov. last—I succeeded the prisoner, who was in the same capacity—I have never seen her but twice in the house since I have been there—she had no business to enter the house. On the morning of the 21st I came down a little after eight o'clock, and discovered that the house had been opened—I found the key of the area gate in the area, and the area door open; the scullery window was broken over the catch, and the window thrown up—I had left the area key on the kitchen table—the two doors were open—I missed a silver cash-box, a gold pencil.</p>

                  </hi> My name are Charles Louis Napoleon Bonaparte—I am a son of the late King of Holland—I re<lb/>side at No. 3, King-street, St. James's. In the month of June last, in con<lb/>sequence of the non-arrival of a remittance from Florence, I was desirous of obtaining 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a temporary purpose—I communicated that wish to Mr. Orsi, who is acting as my secretary—on the 10th of June I received this letter by the post—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I saw the prisoner the day afterwards, and he told me he was the man that written to me the day before—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Private—Cornhill, June 10th, 1847—Mr. Pollard presents respect to Prince Napo<lb/>lean, and Mr. P. will do himself the honour of calling upon the Prince to-morrow morning at twelve o'clock on private business. Prince Napolean.") On the following day he came to my house in King-street, and introduced himself as the writer of that letter—he was at that time a perfect stranger to me—he told that he had heard I wished to have some money; and that he had 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to offer if I wished it—I told him I was not quite sure that I should want it; that I was about selling out several shares in railways, which I had at that moment—I asked him how he knew I wanted money—his answer was that he was a man of business; that it was his busi<lb/>ness to procure money for noblemen; and if such was the case that they always came to him—I asked him about the terms, and he was to take five per cent.—I asked his address—he told me he was living at No. 10, Essex-street, Strand—I then told him to come back on the following Monday, that would be the 14th—he produced some stamps to me, and asked me to sign my name to them—I declined doing so—it was on that occasion that I asked him for his address—he gave it me and then left, arranging to come on the Monday following—he came on that day, the 14th, at twelve o'clock—he began to speak about the commercial crisis, and told me that money was very rare at that time—I told him if he did not like to finish the business I did not care about it—he said he had not altered his mind, and that he had the two bills in his pocket—he then produce two pieces of paper with writing on them—there was no writing on them on the first occasion—they were then blank.</p>

                  </hi> I am superintending president of the Inland-office of the Post-office. I remember the arrival of the Indian mail on the 23rd of June—when the letters are taken out of the bags they are divided into fifteen divisions, numbered from one to fifteen—the person who so divide are on one side of what is called the sorters' table; and on the other side are the sorters, who have the letters given to them to sub-sort them into walks——there is a sub-sorter to each division—they have lines on a board in front indicating the particular walks composing the division; and as they sort the letters they place them end-ways against the walk in which they run—it is the duty of the sub-sorter, when they have accumulated sufficiently, to place a blank docket in front of the parcel, and to hand the letters so placed, to the teller, who is at a table close by—the teller ascertains the amount of postage charged on the letters, and enters on the docket the total amount—each of those parcels is called a charge—they are taken from the teller with the docket, which contains the total amount of the postage of each charge, into the adjoining office, called the letter-carriers' office—the docket is then handed to the check-clerk, and at the same time the letters are put into boxes or com<lb/>partments—on the docket being handed to the check-clerk, the letter-carrier, who belongs to the walk, looks at the letters so brought, and tells to the check-clerk the amount of the postage on them without having any previous knowledge of the docket—the letter-carrier is then called to receive the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050117"/>
               <p>charge if it is St. Mary Axe charge for instance, they would call out, "St. Mary Axe," and the letter-carrier would go and receive the latter—the letter-carrier has no means whatever of knowing the amount on the docket—he tells up the amount of the postage, and calls it over to the check-clerk imme<lb/>diately; and if it corresponds with the amount mentioned in the docket, then the letters are put in the letter-carrier's box for delivery—if the amount which the letter-carrier makes, corresponds with the entry on the docket, the docket is handed to the letter-carrier by the check-clerk, and the carrier places his initial upon it and restores it; he then takes the letters away to his own place—the check is then complete, and the revenue has nothing further to do with it—all he has then to do, is to bring back the money for the letter; he then has to go to the charge-taker—letters sometimes get mis-sorted in the course of this process; but that is arranged before the latter-carrier leaves; and those having been mis-sorted to his walk, and not belonging to him, are taken off the amount of money charged against him by the charge-taker—if any belonging to him are brought from another walk, the amount of that postage is added to his by the charge-taker—the balance so struck is the sum he is to bring back to the Post-office—if any letters remain in his possession mis-sorted, he has to deliver them after com<lb/>pleting his own delivery, and would be punished if he did not—the amount of postage of these letters would be included in the charge—the prisoner was a letter-carrier of the ninth division, in which the St. Mary Axe walk is, No. 96—Gallin is the sorter of the ninth division, which would be the next to No. 10, the division at which Thacker, who was tried yesterday, was placed—I did not see the prisoner at his duty on the day in question—as he was going out with his letters he was stopped by my direction, from a communi<lb/>cation that had been made to me, and was taken into Mr. Kelly's office—I afterwards saw him in my private room—the letters that he had to deliver were produced—I do not know whether the postage was told up in his presence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you speaking of the morning or the mid-day duty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The mid-day duty, the letter-carriers are then in a different office—I should say there are three times more person engaged in the morning than at mid-day—the mid-day duty occurs every day—the In<lb/>dian mail does not arrive every day—when the Indian mail is connected with the mid-day duty more exertion is required; but I should say there is not more bustle—letters are taken about from one to the other in the same way in the morning—there may be bustle on both occasions; but I think not more at mid-day than in the morning—if one person had nothing particular to do he would be employed in some way other—I have heard since that an inspector sometimes tells a letter-currier to put over a charge to the teller—there are seats or desks at which the letter-carriers some<lb/>times leave their letters while they go to some other part of the place—they are sometimes left for a long time—if letters not properly belonging to that seat are put on it, that could only be corrected by the letter-carrier sorting his letters—the seat is only a small desk for the letter-carrier to arrange his letters on—he cannot get his letters for his walk until they have been pre<lb/>viously charged by the teller—when he gets them he frequently lays them down on his seat or desk, and goes away—if any other letters were put there in his absence he could only ascertain that by sorting the letters were put there finding, when he went to deliver them, that he had more.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT.</hi>

               <p>place or letters occasionally to fetch his second or third charge—if his letters are completely made up. it would be barely possible that he might leave them even then, being called by the president, or go for a registered letter, or for some purpose or other—he sets the letters himself—he commences sorting his letters as soon as he receives his first charge—he cannot finish it till he has got them all—he then should go out for delivery—a certain time is allowed, and then a bell rings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the bell rings, he must go at once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, whether he has times to sort his letters or not—after going out he would not be able to set right any mistake till next day—at the time the prisoner was called into Mr. Kelly's room, two clerks reported to me that they had told his letters up—I heard that Mr. Cook, the inspector, had also told them up, and Mr. Brodie afterwards—Mr. Brodie and Mr. Cook made a difference in the amount of their telling, but I do not know what—when I found they dif<lb/>fered, I requested Mr. Brodie to be very particular, and also told another clerk to take it—the telling is a mental operation—it is a very rapid busi<lb/>ness—when they amount to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they are put up together, and the odd pence are carried on to the next—it is written down to help the recollection—it is all matter of recollection until they come to the end—Mr. Cook is not here, that I am aware of—Mr. Brodie will be able to state how much the dif<lb/>ference was between him and Mr. Cook—he told me the difference, but what it was I do not know—there is a paper called the president's docket, on which allowances are made and charges added—if there were more or fewer letters than there ought to be in a man's possession, he would come next day and explain it, and it would be set right in the president's paper of next day; but I never heard of such a transaction—if you are charged 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. too much, you take it back to the letter-carrier, and he will take it to the president, and he will allow you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the dockt—if any mistake does occur, it must be corrected next day on the president's paper; but I never heard of one—if a man carried out more letters than he ought, and came back and said, "I have carried out more," that would be correct.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If some person, with a wicked motive, put some letters on a man's desk, inducing him to believe they were there before, and he went away with them, it must be set right by the president's paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Undoubtedly—the man would come to the president, and say, "I received 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more than my charge yesterday; I had some letters put by some person, with an evil design, on my desk, and here are the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," that would be the way in which it would be set right—they must have been letters not charged, or else the other person who put them there would have it, or else the revenue would get 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more than it ought—I never heard of such a circumstance in my experi<lb/>ence, and I sometimes have to attend to these president's papers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The Indian mail letters would require a smaller number to make up an amount, than common letters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Undoubtedly—the lowest charge is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were some twopenny letters—they were inland letters which he had to deliver as well—I have seen Indian letters charged 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which a man could carry out with ease, or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it need not be very large—the French post charge by the quarter of an ounce weight.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If neither one or the other is taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Then it is gone through again, and when two calculations agree, it is taken—supposing the teller is 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the clerk at the counter 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the clerk called in 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he would count them up till he made it either 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he would ascertain what the right amount was, and so alter the docket—that would be settled before the letters were taken away by the letter-carrier—the re-teller would alter the docket, and the check-clerk his book, before the letters are allowed to leave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi> Then the effect would be, that the letter-carrier would only be charged with the sum that the inspector found was the proper sum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if the carrier had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of letters more than was counted in his charge, there must have been a mistake in the first place made in the amount by the teller and letter-carrier, or some person must have put the letters there to make him a present of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he would get by the postage.</p>

                  </hi> On the 23rd of June I was charge-taker of the ninth division—this is my book, the amount of charge to the carrier to the St. Mary Axe walk on that day, No.96, is 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not know what it consists of—I only take the sum total in the book—I take it from docu<lb/>ments he produces to me—if there has been any mis-sorting, it would be set to rights in this book—there was on that day 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. mis-sorted to the St. Mary Axe walk—that was taken off his amount—there were letters for other walks that were mis-sorted there—they amounted to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I sub<lb/>tracted 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and allowed him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is done with the letter-carrier just before he leaves of the purpose of delivering his letters—he has generally got his letters set for delivery before he comes to me, as many as he can get set at the time.</p>

               <p>well as the amount of three charges—he produced it to me as being the amount of his charges—I then stated to Mr. Bokenham the difference, and he desired me to have the prisoner brought into his private room—if he had gone away with the letters that were produced to me as his, he would have had the opportunity of putting 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the difference, into his pocket—when he got into Mr. Bokenham's room, he was called on to explain how he got pos<lb/>session of the difference in postage—he said be could not account for it; that he did not know that he had any surplus of letters in his possession—he might have said something about somebody putting letters on his table—I am not quite certain—the letters were all for hi walk—a list of the letters was afterwards made out by myself, and two of the inspectors—there were eighty-one letters and sixty-five newspapers—the postage of those amounted to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—sixty-eight of the letters and fifty of newspapers would amount to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I believe they all belong to his walk—thirteen letters and fifteen newspapers would be left—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. would be postage of those—newspapers are charged.</p>

                  </hi> I am a greengrocer, and live at No. 27, Eliza<lb/>beth-street. Eaton-square, Pimlico—Cloud was in my service, and stopped with me a fortnight after the robbery. On the 28th of May I was called down at eight o'clock in the morning—I found the kitchen window was open, and a table which stood near it had been moved; a box which was there had been unlocked, and a small pasteboard box, which contained jewellery, was gone—the key of the box had been in the table-drawer the night before, where it has been always kept; and the box had been in the same place these four years—I had been sleeping there myself till recently—I found my clothes all thrown on the ground, the drawers all open, and every thing dis<lb/>turbed</p>

               <p>and confused; and the head and foot of the bed were turned up-there is a trap grating over the area, and that was lifted up—I did not keep it fastened—it could be opened by anybody, and when anybody got into the area, they could get in at the kitchen window—I do not know whether the window was shut on the over night—Cloud did not sleep on my premises—he left about nine in the evening—I do not know what time he came the morning—I was not up till eight—I sent Cloud for a policeman—he returnes without one—I waited a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and I sent him again—he then returned with one this brooch is mine—it was gives me by Stanford, and he told me where I should find the locket—here is the mark where the pin was broken—the gold was broken out, and I had a small plate put to it—it is a very old brooch—it is not for the worth of it that I prize it—it had a glass in it, and a piece of hair—this is my locket, and chain and key—here is the reminder of the chain which I was wearing at the time—I value all the property I missed at 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it cost me a great deal more—I could have got 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it if I had wanted to part with it—I found the locket at Mrs. Hughan's—I had seen my box safe on the day before the robbery—I kept my cash there, and had occasion to go to it that day—these things are part of the jewellery I had there.</p>

On the 23rd June last, about three o'clock in the morning, I was on duty with inspector Maddox, in a police galley on the Thames, near Deptford-creek—there is slip there to go up to the wharf of the General Steam Navigation Company which is some distance up the creek—I saw a steamer, called the <hi rend="italic">Venezuela</hi>, lying alongside the wharf, high</p>

               <p>and dry, aground, as it was low water—I observed a small boat lying under<lb/>neath her starboard quarter, between the wharf and the vessel and saw the three prisoners underneath the paddle-wheel of the steamer—in consequence of that, I and my companions went on board a vessel there, called the <hi rend="italic">Little Western</hi>—Mr. Maddox went with me, but he returned—I remained on board the <hi rend="italic">Little Western</hi>, which gave me a view right up the creek—I saw the three prisoners come away from under the paddle-wheel, walk through the mud up the slip till they got to high water; and I then lost sight of them, as there is a turn in the slip—I saw them again within five minutes—they then returned, each with property in their arms—(they had nothing when they went up)—it appeared to be very heavy—I cannot tell what is was—they proceeded directly to the boat I had observed laying there, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the property into—after that Johnson handed a kettle out of the boat to Tullet who got into the mud alongside, and <hi rend="italic">kettled</hi>fifteen or sixteen kettles of mud into the boat; and after that they <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the kettle into the mud, where they had put then property, they stopped till the tide made in so as to float their boat, they then came and rowed out of the creek—we then went alongside of them—Maddox asked what they had in the boat—they said, "Iron"—I said, "Have you no copper?"—Johnson said, "None at all"—I put my arm in down to my elbow, and pulled up a bar of copper out of the boat—they were all three in the boat—I asked them what it was—Morris said it was iron—I said, "How do you know that?"—he said, "I know it is iron"—I said, "It is copper"—he made use of a very bad word, and said, "Who would have thought it was copper?"—I scraped the mud off to show that it was copper—they said they had picked it up—I put my arm down again, and fetched up a copper clamp—I took possession of the boat, and took the prisoners into custody—I produce the property—there is about 2 cwt altogether—this is the copper bolt that came out first—two of the wedges out of the eight have the navigation mark.</p>

The slip leading to Deptford-creek, goes up to the wharf belonging to the Company, and is the Company's property—on the morning in question, there was property of this description belonging to the Company on the wharf—I have examined this—it is of the kind and description that was on the wharf at the time—here are some pieces that bear the marks of the Company—the Company make their screws and nuts themselves, and they are not the subjects of sale—I recognize these as screws and nuts made by the Company, on their premises—they are not taken away, except for the purposes of repair, on board ships—I know the three prisoners very well—they have been in the habit of coming alongside, and about the wharf, for three years—Johnson was once in the Company's employment for about eighteen months, and knows the place very well.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Lombard-street, Battersea, and am an engineer—I have a factory there—there are steps at one corner of my premises, down to the river, and a garden, which is slightly fenced off—there is then a boiler<lb/>shop, and beyond it is the place where my old iron is pilled up—the proper way to go from the steps to where the iron is piled up, would be through the boiler-house, but if the boiler-house were locked up, the only way would be to get over the fence, and to go through the garden—I bad entrusted my keys to police-sergeant Read, in consequence of my premises being robbed several times. On the night of the 23rd of June, while I was at supper. I heard a noise in front of my house—I left the table, and went through the garden on to the steam-boats which laid at the bottom of the garden—I looked up the river, and saw three men—the two nearest me appeared to be struggling, and I saw one who appeared to be wading through the water—I saw Steadman, the officer, he had the prisoner Clark in custody—I found Read in an awkward position, hanging by the steam-boat—he cried, in a low voice, "Help, help, Mr. Spiller; I am in the water!"—he was hanging by his hands to the gunwale of the steam-boat, with his legs in the water—I rescued him, and he went after the prisoners—I returned to my premises, and after the affray was over, I saw that some iron had been taken from the stock, a por<lb/>tion of it was round about the steps leading down to the water, and there was a basket with some iron in it on the top of the steps—the basket did not belongs to me, but the iron in it did—I believe it to be mine—I know that the stock was diminished in size, and the iron bars appeared to be the same—the officers took possession of it—I did not weight it, but according to the weight given to me, it was worth about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—later in the evening I saw, in the boat</p>

I received Mr. Spiller's Keys—on the evening of the 23rd of June I entered his premises with Steadman—I saw a boat, with the prisoners and another man in it, row up the river, and immediately return—the men landed at the steps leading to Mr. Spiller's—I went into the boiler-house, and saw two men, six or seven times, carry some<lb/>thing heavy on their shoulders, and lay it down at the fence, and the last time there were three men carrying loads on their shoulders—they got over the fence, and began to load the boat with bars of iron—when they had loaded a quantity, I and Steadman rushed out and tried to seize them—I struck Langford as I was on the top of the steps, just over the water—he rolled over the boat into the river—I jumped into the boat, and tried to seize him, but he sprang away out of my reach—the other man who was in the boat first, made a fair spring out of the boat into the river—Langford called out to throw the b----r overboard—I have not the least doubt that Langford is the man, I have seen him frequently in Lambeth; I saw him go by the boiling-house five or six times, and when I came out, he was just in the gateway—I had a fair view of him—I took charge of the boat which I first saw drifting down—I got on another boat and took that—it contained 3cwt. or 4cwt. of iron—the iron I found on the steps and in the boat was 8cwt. 1qr. 19lbs.</p>

"You are very fond of wading, young man!"—he said, "It won't hurt me; I have been in the water once to-night"—I said, "How did that happen?"—he said, "I was knocked off a barge with a tiller, in going under Putney-bridge"—I asked him what barge it was, and the captain's name—he said it was a Rochester barge, and the captain's name was Dunn—I talked to him for some little time, and told him I wanted to speak to him—he said, "You can speak to me here"—I said "Yes; but I want you here to speak to me"—he said, "If you want me, come and fetch me"—I said I should not do that, I should keep there—by that time the fishing-boat came up—I told the people not to take him, as I wanted him there to speak to me—however the boat came, and he jumped into it—I called to them to bring him to me, but they would not—I kept calling—they rowed on—they then said some<lb/>thing in a low voice that I could not hear, and they put him on the dummy—he got from the dummy and came a little nearer to me, and said, "You can see me now"—I said I could not says as much to him as I wanted to do—he then jumped into the water, and swam some distance towards London, away from me—when he got there the water was running very fast, and he called out, "<hi rend="italic">Jem, Jem</hi>, I am going down; pick me up"—the fishing-boat rowed back and took him up and put him where he could stand—he came at last on shore, and I took him to the watch-house—Steadman was there—I said to the sergeant, "I have brought this young man here on suspicion"—Stead-man looked round and said, "That is one of the men"—he pulled off Lang<lb/>ford's hat put his hand to his head, and said, "You have had a smartish knock," or a "<hi rend="italic">tidy</hi> knock," or something of that kind, and he smiled—Lang<lb/>ford was pulling his wet clothes off, and said, "You seem to laugh; you would not laugh, if you had been there, and had such a knock as I had."</p>
