On October 20th, about ten minutes to twelve, I was in Wolfs Lane, about a quarter of a mile from my grandfather's house—I saw the prisoner there; he was following me; he overtook me, and passed me on the opposite side of the way; he crossed over to some bushes pretending to look for some berries—knowing that the time for berries had gone by I thought it suspicious, and I began to hurry on—he was up to me in a minute and said something, I don't know what, and I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "Come, none of that; I mean to have a bit"—he threw me down and put his hand up my clothes—I got up; he threw me down a second time—I got up again; he said he would brush me down—he did brush me down, and while doing so he took my purse out of my pocket, took the money out, and threw the purse at me—he went towards the green and I went towards home, and I met Mr. Wellock and told him what had happened—he asked what sort of man he was—I told him, and he told me to follow him—I did so, but could not see him—a policeman afterwards came to my grandfather's, and I went with him to the station and saw a number of mea standing in a line, and I picked the prisoner out—I had seven shillings, and three pence in bronze in my purse—I was not bruised at all; my dress was torn out of the gathers at the back.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>), I was in charge of the station at Wood Green on 20th October at half-past two in the afternoon, when the prisoner was brought there—I called in six working men, dressed similar to the prisoner and about his height, and placed him among them—I then fetched Miss Low; she looked at the man and identified him immediately, without any hesitation—he was then charged—he said, "I am not guilty, I was not there"—Wolf's Lane had been mentioned—what he said was, "This is all for nothing, it is a mistake; I have not been in Wolf's Lane to-day; I have just come from Edmonton"—he said that before the charge.</p>

               <p>after waiting about ten minutes he asked if the order was ready—I went and spoke to one of the partners, and they were making inquiries—I came back to the prisoner and told him the order was not quite ready, we were rather busy—he waited for a minute or two—one of the partners came down and asked if he came from Mr. Stenson—he said "Yes," and afterwards he said he wished to pay for the things, and he moved towards the pay-box, which was near the door—he rattled a few coins, and then made a sharp walk towards the door—one of the partners stopped him in the roadway, and he was brought back—I said inquiries were being made, and he sat down and waited, and Mr. Glenister gave him into custody—these order-forms are supplied by us to the trade.</p>

Burbage on the Ceylon Tea Company, for £23 14s. lid.—the prisoner said he had found it two days previously in the street, near Victoria—he was going to advertise it—that was not necessary, seeing that the name was on it—it had been enclosed in a letter of 8th September, and should have been delivered on the 9th—when I searched the prisoner's lodgings I found this pin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ironer in a laundry at 39, Moleswar Road North—I recollect the last day of September; it was Friday—I thrashed my little girl on account of you sending her errands and not getting her father's dinner ready—you opened the door to my husband, and said you had sent my little girl for half a pint of beer, and liver or sausages—you live underneath us and are quite a stranger to me, only that my little girl goes errands for you and minds your baby—on the day previous there was a disturbance in the house over your wanting to buy furniture of a man who was leaving—you had paid a deposit of 30s.—I could not say you went out on 30th September—I was not at home all day long—in the afternoon you took your wife and baby out—I think that was the first and only time your wife went out with you—I have been at the house about seven weeks, and you had been there only a week or fortnight before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe the prisoner's name is John Griffiths; all his letters were addressed in that name—I work at my ironing away occasionally—it was the only time I thrashed my little girl, once in September; it was the last time I and my husband had an angry word, and that was over his dinner—I went on the last day in September to get a basket of shirts to iron for my sister, and was absent from half-past eleven to half-past one; it was the only day I did any ironing for my sister—I took the shirts home in the evening at half-past nine—I first saw the prisoner about half-past eight or a quarter to nine on 30th September, when I took down the baby and a bottle of milk—at a quarter to ten I gave him his daily paper—I saw him at a quarter past eleven; he then had on a light coat and no waistcoat—I did not see him after that till nine in the evening—my little girl, who is between eleven and twelve, was in the room and saw him at two: she was not at. School because she was ill with her throat—the man the prisoner had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with about the furniture is a conductor on the trams, and had only been living there three weeks—the row lasted from Tuesday to Thursday—I had nothing to do with it, I only know what I heard—my husband is a carpenter and joiner.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told the policeman I was the prisoner's wife; I have lived with him as his wife since last June—the prisoner is not the father of my baby—I never lived with a man before—my child is illegitimate—I had no occasion to gee my living before I fell into disgrace—I knew the prisoner as John Griffiths—he worked for the Manchester Life and Burial Insurance Company, which has offices in Cheapside—the chief superintendent, Mr. Golding, lives at Hammersmith—as a rule the prisoner went out every day, sometimes at one time, sometimes at another; I could not swear to the time; sometimes he did not go out till between two and three—I went to Bow Street when this case was before the Magistrate—I did not offer to give evidence; I was too late—on Friday, September 30th, I sent the little girl to get me half a pound of liver or half a pound of a usages—she is too young to come and give evidence; I don't know her age—she is Mrs. Forsyth's child, and she has to stay and mind my baby—she was beaten on that day because she did not bring me the liver—her mother says she was beaten because she went out for me instead of getting her father's dinner; that is perfectly correct—the prisoner did not go out till a quarter-past four in the afternoon, and I said he might as well take me, and we went together; and it was the last day of the quarter, and he told them that it was the last day of the quarter, and that they had better pay now.</p>

I am Inspector of Coin to Her Majesty's Mint—this shilling (<hi rend="italic">The one found on Ballard.</hi>) is bad—these forty-nine shillings are all counterfeit, and of different dates and moulds; some of them are from the same mould as the one uttered—this is a mould for shillings, and here are other pieces of broken moulds—all the articles found are used in making counterfeit coin—most of these coins are unfinished—this is a third of a counterfeit shilling.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Braithwaite's Defence:</hi> On 2nd October I called for a glass of ale, and put down a shilling; it was broken. If I had been guilty I should have walked out of the place. About three weeks afterwards I went to the Elder Tree, and saw this young woman there, and a policeman took her in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Sawyer has been with us about two years—100 copies is the first instalment; there is a considerable quantity afterwards; we get 200 more about twenty minutes later; the Scotch mail goes at 5.15; those are for country agents, and they may not be sold in London—we get a third lot about 4.45—Sawyer generally brings all three lots—we have not been able to check them for the last two months, as they arrived a few minutes late—I charged Sawyer of my own free will, and determined to prosecute him as a dishonest servant, but t«o or three days after he was let out on bail it occurred to me to take him back—that was not on condition that he should give information—I read in the paper that he was a supposed dupe; he has a large family, and I thought I would give him another chance, and make him an honest man if possible.</p>

GEOGHEGAN</hi> I am the Dalziel whose name is at the bottom of telegrams—our agency has been established in London since 1889 or 1890—it is in the Outer Temple—our cablegrams do not circulate largely on the Continent—we have no offices on the Continent; we do not do business on the Continent for ourselves—I decline to say whether the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> supply us with an early copy, on the ground that it has nothing to do with the case—if you read my deposition you will see that I have paid persons myself to supply me with an early copy—I have received an early copy for my agency and paid for it—I had it from Mr. Hawkins—we did not know that it was improperly supplied to us—it was within this year—I think Boulden is the man who carried it to the office—we paid about 15s. for it, though it was only 3d. a copy, simply because we could not get it for less—we never sent information to the provinces: we transmitted the leading articles to America; frequently matters of great importance occur between the United States and England, and the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> opinion is highly useful; by procuring a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> we are able to give information to America the same morning, if we get the copy early; it really never entered my head to write to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and get the same thing for eighteenpence; the arrangement was made when we were first established in London, and it was carried on entirely without being brought under my notice—we do not still pay fifteen shillings a week for early copies—we get an early copy now in the morning—we send telegrams to the Continent—the commercial crisis is the least important information—we are not subscribers to Jones' Commercial Bureau—I know nothing about it; I do not know that it contributes the current price of grain from America—some time ago Jones complained to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> about us, and the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> complained to us that we had taken their prices and sent them to the Continent without being subscribers—I do not know that Jones' Bureau told the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> that we put down false quotations, or that the quotations went all over Europe—the manager of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> called me up on the telephone and said, I am informed by Jones that you have been taking for the commercial telegrams you have been sending abroad a price which is wrong"—I said, "No, if such a thing is being done I will put a stop to it"—I knew afterwards that a statement was circulated before that—I know very little about the business of Reuter and Co.; it is a very well-known</p>

               <p>firm—I never heard that they complained that my firm were taking their information and sending: it to the Continent, or that they trapped us in some way—when Mr. Hanson called on me, I did not understand that Hawkins was stealing the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, but it was my impression that he was getting it by illegitimate means—I never had to get early papers from the dealers in London—I had not the common curiosity to inquire where the copies came from—I presumed they were legitimately obtained—he assured me so till we stopped taking it, and I thought it was—there Was a complaint about the early copies being got, and immediately it was brought to my knowledge by the proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> we stopped it—when the prisoner said that the difficulty had been surmounted I did not say I would have nothing to do with it. because my desire was to put a stop to the whole thing—I wanted to find out how it was done—I have had considerable experience in America—I let the prisoner go on bringing the paper from, I think, the 5th to the 13th October, and did not tell him I was in communication with the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—the money was at the office waiting for him—country papers do not acknowledge what they steal from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—we have no agreement with the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, we have with the <hi rend="italic">Standard, Chronicle</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi>—it is possible that we get an early copy of the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>—we do not get our information from any papers—we utilize the early copies of the London daily papers; we pay a regular subscription for them—we pay 15s. for, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, because we cannot get it for less—we do not supply the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> with telegraphic information; we exclude the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, and I am not aware that we utilise the information contained in it—I am the person who gave the information to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and the person who is interested in putting a stop to this kind of thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> That is because we find our telegrams are reproduced in the newspapers in an enlarged form—we have a special service with which we supply the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—we wire in the morning to America for the morning papers, and to France and Belgium in the afternoon—the prisoner said nothing to lead me to suppose that he had improperly come by the copies of the paper—Mr. Soames made a communication to me, and then the matter was put a atop to.</p>

               <p>had been surreptitiously obtained and the news telegraphed to the country—there was an arrangement that they were not to be sold in London under any circumstances—the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> begins about 3.45—early copies are only delivered to five or six agents—Smith and Son are served first, and they are only for posting—they have none till 4.30—the next firm is Marshall and Son, and three or four others, and among them Messrs. Farrington—no news-agents are supplied till the second and third lots are delivered at 4.20 or 4.30—in consequence of a communication, I made a machine mark and a cross on all copies delivered to Messrs. Farrington, and they were the only papers so marked—I had a man to count the papers on the 13th, and afterwards I counted them myself—they were in four separate quires, and I never lost sight of them from the time they were counted till they were in Sawyer's possession.</p>

Marshall's, Marlborough's, Farrington's and Dawson's receive copies at four o'clock—we send a copy to Daiziel's under cover—this has been going on eighteen months or two years, so they had no occasion to pay fifteen shillings for another copy—I could find out the exact time—the Central Press Agency never gets a copy nor the Central News—the <hi rend="italic">Melbourne Argus</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Melbourne Age</hi>, and the Associated Press each have copies under cover—if a country agent, say at Ipswich, orders 500 copies, and 250 are unsold, they are not returned to us, we receive returns only from a few special agents—only from Messrs. Smith and Sons—I have now communicated with the office, and found that it was about the middle of June, 1892, that Mr. Dalziel was supplied with a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> under cover at four a.m.—all those people are supplied under special conditions.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer, and live at Mr. Collier's house, 29, Colchester Street—Mrs. Vernon lived with me, and left me seven or eight years ago—I was living there when the prisoner and Mrs. Vernon were there; they were there two days before I arrived, but I did not know they were there; that was in January this year—that is not the house where Mrs. Vernon had lived with me before—they left the house because they made so much noise; they called out "Murder" and "Police"—about the beginning of October Mrs. Vernon came to the house and spoke to me—I wrote a letter to the prisoner,. because she accosted me in the street, announcing her wedding, and she used language to me which induced me to write it—this is the letter: "Dear Sir,—Excuse my troubling you with this note, my reason for so doing will be apparent. Some few days since, your wife came up to me in the City to announce your recent union, and made use of most offensive language; will you insist upon her letting me alone? Please ask her not to call here, as I prefer not to see her, and if she continues her noisy visits I must do as the gentleman did who occupied the rooms you did, which would be rather hard on people who have given us so much consideration.</p>

               <p>H. <hi rend="smallCaps">LINDSAY BUCKNALL</hi>."—on 18th October, about eleven p.m., I was called to the hall door and saw Mrs. Vernon and the prisoner, who said, "I have called about this letter; I want it explained"—I said, "It does not want explanation; your wife ruined me, and if I am to be followed in the street, and crowds come round me, I am ruined in this country"—he immediately struck roe on my forehead—I fell, and he tried to kick me in my groin—I put my legs together, and he kicked me on my stomach—I have a mark on my head—the blood seemed like water coming from a garden hose—it ruined my shirt and my drawers—the police doctor saw me that night.</p>

Siemens, of Queen Ann's Gate, and I have forests where there is rook and china—Gow is a friend of mine; he lived with Mrs. Vernon—I never drank in a public-house at her expense—Gow was not with her when I met her, nor with me—I swear by everything that is sacred I never drank with her at her expense in Gow's presence—I asked her not to annoy me—I wrote to Mr. Hay ward instead of to Mrs. Vernon, because she was generally drunk—Mr. Collier was my landlord at another house, Cambridge Street, S. W., four and a half or five years ago—my intimacy with him had ceased three or four years before I went to that address; when I went to his place I did not know that Mr. and Mrs. Vernon were stopping there—I do not know that Mr. Collier is indebted to Mr. Hay ward.</p>

I am a tailor, of Colchester Street—Mr. Bucknall was living there on 17th October, and about 11.20 the prisoner came with Mrs. Vernon—he said, "Is Mr. Bucknall in?"—I said, "Yes." and called him—he came out without his hat, and the prisoner said, "You can go; I do not want anything to do with you, I can settle with you afterwards"—I left Mr. Bucknall sitting on the door step with his hands behind his back, and went into my sitting-room to my wife, and in a minute or two I heard screams of "Murder!" and went out and saw Bucknall lying on the ground in a quantity of</p>

I am a gold and silver refiner, of War-dour Street—on Saturday, 14th October, James came into my shop, and I saw Brown outside—James offered these things for sale—he said, "How much will you give me for them?"—I weighed the coins, and offered him 3s. 9d. for each of these dollars—he said he would take that, and I paid him the money—then he pulled out these Moorish coins—I looked at the police-list of stolen articles which I am provided with, and found they were entered there, and I asked the prisoner for the money back—he gave it back to me, and I told him he would have to come to the police-station with me—I asked him how long he had had the articles; he said, "Five months"—when we came outside I saw Brown standing on the kerb; he and Brown spoke together in a whisper; I did not hear what they said—I took James to Vine Street; Brown followed a little way, and then left.</p>

I will mark you; you have hit me in the neck"—he said, "All right; you can do as you like with it now"—he then started running away; I followed him—he ran half-way across the marsh-towards a policeman, and when I came up to him he was standing there with a policeman, who had stopped him—he said he was loading his gun, and it went off accidentally—I told the policeman I would give him in charge for shooting me—the policeman said, "You will both have to come to the station"—we went there, but they would not take the charge because I did not see the prisoner put the gun to his shoulder and fire at me—I afterwards applied for a warrant—when this happened I was on the Essex side and the prisoner was on the Middlesex side of the river Lea—he was in a direct line with me, straight across—England was on the same side as the prisoner, behind some railings.</p>

At twelve o'clock on 4th November I was on duty in Hackney Marshes—I saw the prisoner running with a gun—when he got near to me I called out and asked him what was the matter he stopped and came to me, and said, "I have just shot a pigeon; it dropped on the Waterworks ground. A man at work there picked it up. I asked him to <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it down for the dog; he did not. I then reloaded my gun. In closing it the hammer struck one of the caps; the gun went off. I think some of the shots have hit the man in the neck. Come back and meet him"—I said, "They are coming"—the prosecutor came up and said, "I charge this man with shooting me"—I said, "Where did he shoot you?"—he said, "In the back of the neck"—I saw a small red place at the back of his neck—I took them to the station—the charge was not taken there on account of deficiency of evidence—neither Phillips nor the other man was there then.</p>

I am a jeweller, of 1, Rigely Road, College Park—I am Pearce's brother-in-law—in March, 1882,1 had the house, 9, Oatlands Road, about four miles from Rigely Road—Pearce lived at 13, and the prisoner at 15, Rigely Road, next door to each other—in March, 1882, I let 9, Oatlands Road to the prisoner—he came with Pearce to see me about March 31st—the prisoner said he wanted the house-for occupation, and eventually I agreed to let it to him for £30 a year—he and Pearce were to have the house together on a joint tenancy—I gave them possession—on the same night, October 31st or thereabouts, I bought a horse and cart from the prisoner—the day after I let the house I went to 9, Oatlands Road—there was a conversation between the prisoner and Memory—eventually I had to give up the horse and cart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think I paid the money to Pearce—I don't know if he financed the business—I paid £20 for the horse and cart, and then they paid me back a quarter's rent—I don't think Banyard was there when I bought the horse and cart, so that Pearce was the person by whom I was paid for the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the last witness's brother—in 1882 I was working for the prisoner and Pearce—on the morning of the 1st April I saw them together at Oatlands Road in the same house—there was furniture there—I knew they had resided at Rigely Road, and had been into the house there—I cannot say if I saw anything at Oatlands Road which I had seen in Rigely Road; it was many years ago, and I never took notice of anything special—I think I saw the same furniture at Oatlands Road that I had seen at Rigely Road—I afterwards went to Colchester, and in consequence of something my sister said I brought some articles of furniture back; they had been at Rigely Road; I cannot say about Oatlands Road—I took some of the things to a broker, Buchanan, at Colchester, by my sister's order, and they were sold—I gave the money to my sister; a portion was paid to bring the other things up to London.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a timber and slate merchant, at Acorn Wharf, Old Kent Road—on or about 3rd April, 1882, an acceptance of Pearce and the prisoner was falling due—it was dishonoured—in consequence of that I sent a clerk named Dalton to the prisoner's premises—he came back and reported, I think between that and the 20th I heard nothing, but on the 20th I sent him again to Rigely Road—again he came back and reported with no result—I then consulted my solicitors, and a petition was filed in bankruptcy against Pearce and the prisoner—on 25th April I saw them at their offices, Adelaide Place, London Bridge—I put questions to both of them; we asked where their goods were; they declined to say—I asked them about money they had received, and they both declined to give any information—I had not then heard that they had received money, £100, or £230, or £120—on 24th May, 1882,1 was appointed trustee by the Court at the first meeting—neither Pearce nor Banyard ever attended—they have never filed any statement of affairs or given any information of any kind—claims came in for about £2,000, actual proofs—we had also to pay some preferential claims in the shape of wages for labour—I recovered about £300 for certain equities on mortgages by process of law; neither Pearce nor the prisoner assisted me in the least—that sum went to provide the 5 1/2 d. dividend, and the bankruptcy was closed after that in 1884.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't recollect if the assets' amounted to £500—the securities were estimated at about £300—there were law charges—the builder's business was a considerable one; they built a lot, and at the time of the failure works were going on at various places—something like £177 was realised from building materials; I don't know about the costs of realisation—workmen's wages left unpaid amounted to about £80, I believe—when I had the interview with Pearce and the prisoner, and they answered no questions with regard to their property, I had not been appointed trustee.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector, Scotland Yard</hi>). On 13th November. 1881, Mr. Wegelin's loss of jewels was first reported to me; I was then inspector in charge of the district—the jewels and their value were described to me, and were put into the pawnbrokers' list and the police information; they were an emerald shirt-stud, as far as I remember, a cat's-eye pin in the form of a bee, and other things—inquiries were made, and a warrant was granted on 24th November, 1881—we had the prisoner's photograph—on 26th November, 1881, at 8.30, I went to 89, Elizabeth Street, Eaton Square, where the prisoner's mother lived—I there saw the prisoner—I said to him, "I am Inspector Marshall; I hold a warrant for a person named Lonergan, I think you are he, for stealing some jewellery from Mr. Wegelin, at 22A, Ebury Street"—he said, "Yes, that is my name, but I know nothing about it; tell me more particulars," or words to that effect—I read the warrant, which states: "The said Lonergan, on 2nd November, did feloniously steal one emerald stud, one diamond tie-stud, and other articles of jewellery, of the value of £100, the property of Hugh Wegelin"—he said, "Good God! it cannot be that jewellery I picked-up in Ebury Street, that was wrapped in brown paper"—he said, "How many articles are there?"—I said, "Four"—he said, "Have you found them?"—I said, "Three out of the four"—he went on to say that he had sold two to a pawnbroker near Golden Square, and the emerald to a pawnbroker in the same neighbourhood, who said it was false; and he said, "The fourth, a pin, I sold on the same day to Mr. Attenborough, of, I think, Oxford Street"—I said, "I suppose you mean No. 68 1/2?"—no pin is mentioned in the warrant; it comes under the head of "other articles"—he volunteered the statement about the pin—he went on to say, speaking of Attenborough's, "I gave my own name as Lonergan, and my address, 4, Park Race, which is my club. I have no doubt I did wrong in selling them; I ought to have taken them to the police-station"—after the evidence was completed the Magistrate committed him for trial at the January Sessions of 1882—he was admitted to bail in £250—a true bill was found at this Court—when he was called on his recognisances he did not appear, and his bail was estreated—a certificate was issued from these sessions, in consequence of which this warrant of 30th January, 1882, was issued—I did not see him from that time till October this year—I tried for some two years to find him—on 10th October, at two a.m., he called at Scotland Yard—I was telegraphed for, and I went and found him detained at King Street Police-station—I asked him his name, I hardly recognised him for a moment, and he said it was William Ernest Lonergan, and that he knew I had a warrant for him—he desired to surrender, as he wanted to get the matter off his mind.</p>

               <p>years perhaps; I heard long ago he had left the country, and I never heard of his return—I practically, in a sense, ceased looking for him after some years—since he has been in custody I have heard that he has been back to this country for two or three years, and has been in the Park and at Brighton and other places openly—at the time of his arrest he was living with his mother, a lady of position; I do not think she lives there now—I had traced the prisoner through various places in Yorkshire—I had been hundreds of miles after him, and traced him back to London from Beverley, where he had been visiting a nobleman—he was a lieutenant in the 66th Regiment at the time, and when I arrested him—in consequence of the original arrest he was dismissed the Army—I was present at the Police-court when the information was sworn—we had this photograph of the prisoner, and Mr. Wegelin would be sure to have given a description of the prisoner—Mr. Wegelin said, "In fact, my friend Lonergan of the. 66th Regiment has stolen my jewellery"—I cannot say he used those words, but the prisoner was described as a friend, and it was known he was Lonergan because I went in pursuit of him to Yorkshire and other places—I got the warrant because I was under the idea that the prisoner had gone out of the metropolitan district—I went to the nobleman's house at Beverley, where the prisoner had been visiting and found he had just left—he left in the ordinary way a guest would leave—he was moving in good society—I was seeking the prisoner between 10th November and 24th November, the date of the granting of the warrant in the metropolitan district—then I traced him to Yorkshire, got the warrant and went to Yorkshire, and then traced him back to London, and went to Elizabeth Street and arrested him—I have forgotten from whom I obtained the photograph.</p>

                  </hi>. In November, 1881, I was Mr. Wegelin's valet, and I am now—I remember certain articles of jewellery being brought to the Police-court by pawnbrokers in whose hands I had previously seen them—I identified them as Mr. Wegelin's—that jewellery was afterwards destroyed in a fire on a house-boat on the Thames—those articles of jewellery were usually in my care—on Monday, about 7th or 8th November, 1881, we came up to London from Cambridge, and the jewellery was brought to Ebury Place—at half-past seven p.m. on November 10th I was going to put the emerald stud in Mr. Wegelin's shirt, but, as Mr. Wegelin said he would not wear it that night, I put it back in its case and in the drawer, and took another one—within a day or two I found it and other articles of jewellery were missing—on November 10th, when my master was dressed, he went out—later in the evening I let Mr. Albert Stopford in, and I went to bed at half-past eleven I should think—I don't remember if I let anyone else in—Mr. Rose was a friend. of Mr. Wegelin—I went to bed before he came—I heard they were there, but did not see them—I happened to come home at the moment that Mr. Stopford arrived at the front door—I had a latchkey and let him in—that was about a quarter-past eleven—I had been out that evening for a couple of hours—I told Mr. Wegelin I might be late,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189211140059"/>
               <p>and he said he should be in early—I think another gentleman came up in a cab just at the time I was letting Mr. Stopford in—they were the only persons I saw—I know nothing of Mr. Rose's arrival—as soon as I missed the property I told Mr. Wegelin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been Mr. Wegelin's valet for four or five years prior to November 10th, 1881—I have since heard that he was on intimate terms with the prisoner during a portion of that time at ail events—I did not see him visiting my master—he called once afterwards—I don't remember seeing him there before—I don't know that my master and the prisoner were together with the same tutor in Paris—the prisoner was not at my master's house very often, or I should have remembered him—I don't know if he was there at all—the emerald stud went in the centre of the shirt—I <hi rend="italic">valetted</hi> my master, and saw him go out—I went out about half-past eight—there were no other servants besides myself—my master occupied the whole of the top part of the house—a woman came in to clean—the ground floor was let to someone else, and my master occupied the two floors above it; they were like chambers divided off—my master had no meals there—my master had a separate door for his apartments—I don't know if anyone else had a latchkey' besides my master and me—I found no gentleman already inside when I got back—I let Mr. Stopford and a gentleman in; my master was not at home then—Mr. Wegelin had told me he expected a few friends, and should be in early; there was no preparation for them except brandy, whisky, and soda—I don't know how Mr. Rose got in—the ground floor was a shop, I think, and my master's rooms were separate, and had a front door opening into the street—I missed the jewels on the evening of 13th, I think; I went to look for the emerald—I asked Mr. Wegelin if he had had the emerald stud, and he said no—I went back and looked in the drawer again, and opened all the cases, and found they were empty, and I went and told him—I don't remember what he said—the prisoner, I think, called some few days after the things were missed; Mr. Wegelin was out; he saw me and left a card, and I told Mr. Wegelin, and I think he said, "I think that is the gentleman who has got my studs," but I would not be quite certain as to those words—I don't remember seeing the prisoner again till I saw him at the Police-court—when I left the house, at a quarter to nine on 10th November, it was empty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I don't remember if the occupant of the ground floor was a wine merchant—none of his clerks slept on the premises—the occupation of the shop was a separate occupation, and quite, apart from the dwelling-house—Mr. Wegelin had two floors, one above the other—on the first floor were two rooms, the bedroom through the sitting-room, on the first floor—I slept on the second floor—only Mr. Wegelin and I slept on the premises at that time—the other articles, besides the emerald, that I brought up from Cambridge were in cases—when the prisoner called and my master was out I did not remember having seen him before.</p>

                  </hi>. In November, 1881, I was living at Cromwell Road, South Kensington—Mr. Wegelin, a stockbroker, was a friend of mine—I am also a stockbroker; he has been working with me ever since he was about eighteen; we have offices together—I had never seen the prisoner before 10th November, 1881—I was a very constant visitor at 22A, Ebury Place; I knew most of Mr. Wegelin's friends for years prior to November, 1881—I had never heard the prisoner's name; Mr.</p>

               <p>Wegelin never spoke of him to me; I did not know he knew him—on 10th November, 1881, I went to 22A, Ebury Place, after dinner, to meet Mr. Wegelin—I wanted to see him particularly; I was not expecting him home early—Mr. Stopford, I think, let me in, and I think Mr. Harcourt was there; I am not sure—the prisoner was not there—I did not see Lee—after sitting there some time Mr. Harcourt and Mr. Stopford went away about twelve or one o'clock—I think then Harcourt and Horace West went and Mr. Stopford remained on with me a little while—then he left and I remained—I went with Mr. Stopford to the front door; I noticed a cab coming down, and I thought it was Mr. Wegelin returning, and I waited at the door to see if it pulled up, and then the prisoner came up, walking I think, and asked me if Mr. Wegelin was in—the cab did not stop—I said that Mr. Wegelin was not in, but that I was waiting to see him, and I was expecting him in every minute—I think he said, "Oh, then I will come in; I want to see him," or something: to that effect—I think he was dressed in evening dress, but I should not like to say—he was dressed as a gentleman, and I allowed him to go in—he went upstairs first, and I followed up almost immediately behind—he went into the sitting room—later on I went downstairs again intending to go away; I got to the front door, and then I came-up thinking I would wait a little longer—I then saw the prisoner in the bedroom, which opens by folding doors into the sitting-room; the doors were just half open; he was standing at the dressing table he came and talked to me a little while, and then I went home—in conversation the prisoner referred to Mr. Wegelin as if he was one of his friends—I left the prisoner behind me when I left about two o'clock—I closed the front door behind me—up to that time there had been no alarm, no throwing of parcels on the pavement—I next saw the prisoner at the Police-court—two or three days after the 10th, when I was out shooting, I got a telegram from Mr. Wegelin saying, "Have you taken my jewellery for fun?" or something of that sort—I saw Mr. Wegelin two or three days afterwards, and told him what had occurred that evening, but I could not tell him the prisoner's name; I described him as nearly as I could—I had not asked the prisoner's name, and he had not given it to me; I did not know it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I got to the house before twelve I should think—Mr. Stopford (who let me in I am almost sure), Mr. Horace West and Mr. Harcourt were there prior to the prisoner coming about one o'clock—I left about two—before the prisoner came I was the only person, except the valet, in Mr. Wegelin's rooms—I might have been out of the room five or six minutes, just time enough to go downstairs and alter my mind and come back—I was talking to the prisoner from the time he came in till the time I left, believing him to be a friend of Mr. Wegelin's—most likely I was smoking—I have not seen the prisoner since he absconded—the only times I have seen him were that evening he came there, one day at the Police-court, and to-day.</p>

In November, 1881, I was living at 22A, Ebury Street—I do not live there now—Lee, my valet then, is still in my service—I think the ground floor was occupied by a wine merchant—no one lived there—the front door to my rooms was the only access to the upper part of the house—I used the first floor, and my valet slept above on the second floor—I should think it was on 10th November that I saw</p>

               <p>the emerald—I did not wear it that night—I went out to dinner and got back about half-past two a.m. on the 11th—I got in by my latchkey—no one was in my rooms—I knew within a day or two that my jewellery was gone; my valet reported it to me—I sent a telegram to Mr. Rose—I knew he had been in my rooms that evening—afterwards Mr. Rose told me of some person, whose name he did not know, coming to the door, and asking for me, and going in—the description he gave me of that person induced me to think it was the prisoner—I had been intimate with the prisoner; I had lived in the same house with him for six months in Paris three or four years before; in the interval we had not seen much of one another, only on and off—I don't think I had ever invited him to my rooms—at Paris we were studying French for six months at an establishment where we were taught by a Frenchman—that is what I mean by our intimacy—I do not know of his coming to my place at 22A, Ebury Street at all—I had never seen or entertained him there—on hearing of the loss of the jewellery I communicated with the police—I was shown the jewellery at the Police-court, and I identified it as my property—I actually saw the emerald when I was dressing on the evening of 10th November, 1881; it was a very good stone, I believe—the jewels I lost were worth about £95; they have since been lost in a fire—I do not remember if Lee afterwards gave me a card.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> These were real jewels—I gave the value at the Police-court as £100—very likely that was the estimated value—I and the prisoner had mutual friends—we both knew Mr. Farrer and other persons; we were moving in the same circles—I knew he was a lieutenant in the 66th, and that his regiment was in the Mwand action in South Africa; I don't think I knew that the prisoner was one of the few surviving officers—after sending a telegram to Mr. Rose I had a conversation with him, and he gave me a description of the prisoner, which I suppose I recognised—I do not think I really then believed that he had stolen my jewels; I believed he had when I swore the information at the Police-court—I don't remember whether I gave a photograph of him—I don't think I saw the prisoner between the 10th and 15th or 16th—I don't remember it; I don't say I did not—I saw him at Brighton, two years ago I think it was, walking in the street; he spoke to me—I knew the warrant was out against him—he said, "How do you do?" I think, and I said the same, and then he said something to the effect either that he was doing very well or was not getting on well; I forget which; and I said I was very glad—I did not care whether he was getting on well or not—I did not tell the police I had seen him in Brighton; I took no steps at all—I did not intend after he had absconded to take any step—I wished the matter to drop, and I do so now—I would rather not be bothered with coming here at all; it is a long time ago—I think I saw him also last year at Brighton; I think he spoke to me then.</p>

Cauchefort—I had never seen him before—I instructed the solicitor to communicate with him—prior to applying for a warrant I had some doubt as to the prisoner's address in Paris—I intended taking proceedings for his extradition, and I went to the postoffice in Hoi born and instructed them to send letters and parcels to my new address in Fitzroy Square—one of the letters I received was addressed to Mrs. Marc—she passed as Friedlander's wife—I recognised his writing on the letter, and opened it, to communicate his address to the police—it was dated about August 25th or 28th—I had no other reason for opening the letter.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Letters from the witness to the prisoner were here put in, expressing fits satisfaction with the business</hi>,)—it was my honest opinion that it was a splendid business, and that there was abundance of work—I formed a very good opinion of the business in six weeks—I had the books of Mare and Co. and of Vallee and Co.—the Vallee business was not so good—I was desirous of taking in another partner when I had had six months' experience of the business—I could have gone to the bank at any time I pleased—I did not frequently nave the pass-book—I had my friends to dinner and so on at Alfred Place—in February, 1892, when I had had more than six months' experience of the business, I desired to sell a third share of it to an aunt of mine for £750—the prisoner told me that it was worth that, and I would not take advantage of my aunt.

(<hi rend="italic">Dated August</hi> 13th, and <hi rend="italic">stating</hi>, "the orders are nearly double; cordially yours, Gaston")—that is not an honest letter; I wanted to get him back here; I have kept some of his letters since August; I did not produce any of them before Mr. Lushington—it was not a great shock to me when somebody came to seize his goods; that is not what upset me—I remember going to Mr. Rusher on 15th or 16th August, who had lent Friedlander money on a bill of sale; I did not tell him that Friedlander's affairs had all gone wrong, and that he would never return from Paris, whither he had absconded—I do not remember telling him that he had absconded; if he says so I will not contradict him—I told him that the bill of sale which he had was fraudulently drawn up, and that I was going to take out a warrant against Friedlander, and asked him to employ the same solicitor so that we might both prosecute Friedlander—I did not know the meaning of the word "absconded" at that time, but I said that he would not come back; I first learned the meaning of the word when I applied for a warrant at Bow Street—I swore in the information, "I subsequently entered into partnership with the said Friedlander, and he has appropriated the partnership funds, and committed fraud and has absconded"—I thought the meaning of the word was "gone to Paris"; I afterwards heard it meant "run away"—I had a solicitor with me when the information was prepared; he wrote it out for me—I said that the best thing Mr. Rusher could do was to come and take possession of the things in the house—it was not by my desire that he put the brokers in—I asked to see the bill of sale, and Mr. Rusher pointed out that the plant of the business was included in it—I went to him again on August 16th, and told him that if he did not put someone in possession at once, the furniture would be taken, and he then put a man in possession—I told him I was going to remove the business plant, and I removed it three or four days afterwards to where I am now, and gave notice to the Post Office with regard to the letters—Mr. Rusher did not remove the furniture—I did not tell Mary Baker that the prisoner had run away—I would not tell her anything—I told her that he never would come back—she was crying all day—I said that there were warrants against him, and that I heard the furniture was not paid for—there are nine warrants against him—his brother came over here with a power of attorney to act for him, and he himself came over here—I was served with a writ at his instance—I have moved the plant, and am carrying on the business—I did not write and say how good the business was—we have lost a lot of customers—the good man who was not to be frightened came over—I am paying him 25s. a week—when he came over I took him to work—his wife and family came over—they lived at 65, Charlotte Street—I say that this man bought Valle's business for me—I have not got any scrap of paper to support me in that—I have plenty of confidence, and I lent him £150—he did not say</p>

               <p>that he was going to pay £150 to Cauchefert—I understood that he had paid it part in cash and part in bills—nothing was said about my baring a receipt for the £150—I have said, "I subsequently asked him if he had paid Cauchefert the £150, because I had a little suspicion, and I asked him if the bills were paid"—he told me the man had gone to Brussels, and had transferred all his things—I do not think I told the Magistrate that he told me he had paid the £150—he may have sent me two or three letters in July—he was to buy the business for me—these seven, eight, or nine letters are all in my writing—the prisoner did not buy the business for himself and tell me so—in my letter of 7th July I have underlined "You have acted perfectly, well; that is all I can tell you"—there is one letter missing; that was alter he wrote to me saying that he could have the business for £150—two businesses could be carried on with much less expense—he spoke to me about that—it was an advantage to get rid of one person engaged in the business—I did not see in the books of Valle and Co. what the receipts had been; if I had liked I could have seen what the takings were up to July, and for two years before—the parchment deed distinctly puts the two businesses as his property—I went to the solicitor's office, and the draft of this deed was shown to me, and remained with me for a week, because Friedlander said, "You may go with it to any solicitor; it is entirely in your favour"—he was the man who understood the business; I knew nothing about it—his capital would be his knowledge of the business and of his customers, the plant of his business, and the plant of Cauchefert's business—he said that the two businesses were not worth £1,000, and I did not believe they were worth £2,000, but in February I believed that a third share was worth £750, as I always believed what he told me—having had seven or eight months' experience in February, I believed that the business was worth £2,000—there were two Caucheferts in the business—Victor Cauchefert is now carrying on a business of exactly the same kind in London—I took the two businesses at the same time, Cauchefert's and Vallée's—I was not to introduce any capital—he asked me to advertise in the paper, and said, "As you are my lodger we can talk over that; will you oblige me with £70 or £75?" I said "Yes"—I told him that shortly after my mother's death a received 20,000 francs—he said it was just as if I had paid £1,000, we were perfectly quits—there was to be a settlement of accounts, between us—I had the advantage of living for a year with my wife and child in the house, but look at what I had lent him, and I was going to lend him some more—I wrote, "Next week I go to Belgium to receive my legacy; now, my dear Marc, the moment has come to make up our accounts; I want to do everything regularly and get you out of your difficulties"—I wrote that because I wanted to make him come over here—I did not get the money, and I got a loan in Brussels on September 8th—at the time I was talking about settling accounts, I did not think there might be a claim on me under the partnership deed, though I had not paid £1,000 in—the prisoner commenced an action against me for having removed the plant; he came to the station on August 29th and surrendered to the warrant—Oldaores, Dear, and Co. are the solicitors who prepared the partnership deed—Cauchefert had undertaken not to do business within ten miles—he is now working for me—I told Mary</p>

Gill addressing the Magistrate, and the hearing was adjourned to October 3rd—someone told me that the witness Morrell got an invitation to go to his brother's funeral, saying that he had died on 30th September, and was to be buried on October 2nd—this is the first time I have seen the letter—Mary Baker gave evidence—my letter to her father did not stop her, and Morrell did not go to his brother's funeral, because his brother was alive—before I swore the information I did not believe the documents relating to the Vallee business had been lost, nor did I tell Mary Baker so—I was represented, at the Police-court by a solicitor and counsel—I do not remember how many hearings there were, but Mr. Lushington dismissed the case, and made some remarks, and I elected to be bound over to prosecute—I have retained possession of the business, and from August to November the prisoner has had nothing to do with it—I do not know whether I should still be in possession of it if he is convicted—I know perfectly well how much it has cost me—if the action was tried the prisoner would be able to tell his story, and to say whether there was a receipt for the £150—I never thought of trying it when I could swear it and his mouth was shut—I did not tell a man named Charles that there were two warrants against Friedlander, and I was going to take out a third—he asked what I meant by it, and I said that he had cheated me on the sale of the business—I said that I had bought the business for £18, and he said it was impossible—he may have told me that there were documents in connection with the sale of the business—I must have said that they were forged documents—I do not swear that I said anything about them—Charles said that he could go over to Paris and see the prisoner—I did not tell him to say to the prisoner that it would be more to his interest not to come back—I said before the Magistrate, "I told Mary Baker that the prisoner would not dare to come back"—Charles suggested that I ought to go and see, Friedlander and speak to him about the matter, and give him an opportunity of explaining—I know that Charles went over to Paris—I believed the prisoner would not come back to the business.</p>

               <p>did not send the letter—I do not remember whether I tore it up; I left it in a desk at Albert Place most probably—I do not know how it came into Friedlander's hands—I did not intend to send it—that was the first communication in writing with regard to Cauchefert—afterwards, from other circumstances, I got into communication with Cauchefert—it is true that I wrote two letters of August 10th and 12th, which are not genuine letters, seeking to induce the prisoner to return to this country; I gave him till August 16th, which had passed when I swore the information on the 18th—I had no knowledge of the bogus communication sent to Morrell—he appeared as a witness before the Magistrate, and Mary Baker also—I wrote to Mary Baker's father, because he asked me to keep her with me and my wife—my takings were £5, £6; or £7 a week, it depended on the season—there were separate accounts of the Vallee business and Marc's business, and those are the takings of the two together.</p>

I was formerly in business as a photographic enameller, at 65, Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square—I was doing pretty well in 1890, but not so well in 1891—I spoke to the prisoner about it in the spring of 1891, but I never offered to sell him the business for £200—I am the brother of Victor Cauchefert—at first I offered the prisoner £20, and he offered me £15—I accepted it, and said, "If I can give you £20 I will"—at the time I sold the business to him I was in great distress, and my wife was in the hospital—the £15 was paid to me so much one day and so much another—part of this book is my writing and part Friedlander's—this 15s., 19s. 6d., and £1 18s. are his writing—this word "Paper" was for the work which I gave him money for, because he had no paper for the work—these sums amount to £3 12s. 11d.—all that I spent from my pocket, and he returned it to me—I told him if I stopped two weeks with him I could spend it out of the £15, and there are the expenses of two weeks while I was working for him, and he paid me back—beyond the £15 and the £3 12s. 11d., I have not been paid a penny by him—this is my signature to this assignment—it is not true, as expressed in it, that I received £150 for the business—I knew it was a false statement, but he said it would make fictitious capital; it said that I was not to come back to London to do business in the same trade—about the same time I was putting my name to certain bills—this is my endorsement on these bills; I think I first saw them on the day I signed the agreement—the prisoner showed them to me, and said that it was to make things right, to make the documents agree—there was in addition this receipt for £75, and this, "M. Valle, received from Marc Friedlander £150 sterling, in payment of assignment of business as per account.—<hi rend="smallCaps">VICTOR</hi> A. <hi rend="smallCaps">CAUCHEFERT</hi>"—if even I had not received £150 he said when I signed that that it was to make it all right with the gentleman—I signed it at the solicitors'—I knew I had not had the £75—after I had signed the bills for £25 each the prisoner kept them, I only had them in my possession to sign them—after I got my £151 went to France on the Sunday morning or evening—the prisoner paid me in small sums and a bill for £3 10s.—I did not part with the bill to anybody before I</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition was here read.</hi>)—I still adhere to those statements; they are true—Hens is a cabinetmaker living next door to me—I think he is a friend of M.

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the Prudential Assurance Company—some money was lent to Friedlander on a bill of sale on furniture at 29, Alfred Place—on August 15th the prosecutor came and told me that Friedlander had been discovered, and had been deceiving and defrauding him in money matters, and he understood that the bill of sale which I had on his furniture was not accurate, that it was fraudulent, that he was in Paris, and it was his opinion that he would not return, that he was about to take out a warrant against him, and asked me if I took any proceedings under the bill of sale if I would join him and employ the same solicitor—he said he was under the impression that the business plant was included in the bill of sale, and asked to see it—I showed it to him, and the plant was not included—I think he said about Friedlander, "He will never return"—I don't think he used the word "absconded"—he asked me before I took any steps to wait for a week—I said that I could not see my way clear to it, but ultimately it was arranged that I would wait till Thursday—he inspected the bill of sale on Tuesday, June 16th, and came again next say, "Wednesday, and said that Mr. Friedlander had been taking some of the goods in the house which were included in the bill of sale, and pawning them; that he had seen him go out with a large bundle of goods and pawn them, and unless I put a man in possession he would urge others who had a claim to take steps to enter into possession and raise a claim prior to me, and unless I aid it in the next two hours he would go to other people—he gave me to understand that he was a partner with Marc, but had no claim on the furniture, only on the business plant—in consequence of these statements I put a man in possession—I inquired whether any furniture had been removed; he said</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We had a bill of sale on the furniture; that was in our possession—we were in the habit of receiving the instalments monthly—he appeared very uneasy in his mind as to what was going to be done at 129, Alfred Place—I was forced to do something to protect our security, but not against the landlord—it is the custom that there should be a declaration on a bill of sale that it is his own property, but I did not require it—there was no separate declaration, but there was a statement by Friedlander that the property was his—I had had transactions with him, and I did not trouble myself—the bill of sale was renewed in May this year—it was a fresh bill two or three years ago, not a renewal—there had not been dealings with him as to his furniture—he wanted money, and I lent it to him on his note of hand—I did not advance it on furniture—I was the original lessee of 129, Alfred Place—I was to give the lease up, and Mr. Friedlander took it and bought the furniture which was in the house—he did not wish to pay cash, and I gave him a note of hand, after which I gave him several small amounts when the prior transactions were nearly cleared off—I did not look at the schedule very carefully; I had no valuation made—I should not have assisted in such a bill of sale unless I had known that the furniture was claimed by a person, because having gone so far I should have asked the prisoner to make out a statement—when M. D'Alkemade called on me he was extremely uneasy as to what was going to take place—he told me something about people holding over—the furniture which was supposed not to belong to me was assessed by Mr. Marc's brother, not by me—my furniture was the major part—I believe there was a very small quantity, nothing material.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 90, Southampton Bow—in July, 1891,1 received instructions from Friedlander to prepare an assignment of the Cauchefert business; I took the instructions from him, they are partly his writing and partly mine—I wrote the words, "half-a-dozen," and "bills," and afterwards struck them out—I forget whether he said he had paid or was going to pay one-half the money down, and give bills for half—Cauchefert and Friedlander came to my office together on July 23rd, and I read the document to them; Cauchefert occasionally did not exactly understand, and Friedlander explained to him in French—he made no objection to the sum of £150, and I am sure he perfectly understood everything—on August 11th, 1891,1 received instructions from Friedlander to prepare a deed of partnership. between him and De Boost—I sent him a draft, and about a week afterwards I called at his place at Charlotte Street to know why he had not returned it—De Boost came into the room, and we went through the partnership deed clause by clause—they were both satisfied with it, with one or two slight alterations which I was to make—I then had it engrossed, and on August 20 it was executed in duplicate in my office—about August 23 I received a letter from Friedlander in Paris—his brother told me he would be in London the following week—I saw his wife and brother two or three times afterwards—they consulted me about the partnership, and I prepared the writ in a partnership action, but it was postponed several days before it was issued—I had no actual knowledge then of any criminal proceedings against Friedlander—the brother said he understood that De Boost had commenced some proceedings—some people said it was a writ, and others a warrant—I saw Friedlander the first thing on Saturday morning, and afterwards I went to Tottenham Court Road, and saw Inspector Weather head—on Sunday, the 28th, Mr. Baker called on me with Friedlander and Charles, and Friedlander brought me an envelope a day or. two afterwards; it had been fastened up again—directly I saw it I said, "This looks to me as if it had been opened"—on 29th August Friedlander surrendered at Bow Street, and has been allowed out on his own personal recognisances ever since.</p>

Mary or Mrs. Marc—I did not personally pay the workmen—the Union Bank of London, Tottenham Court Road, is five or six minutes' walk from Alfred Street, Bedford Square, where this business is carried on—the cheques were made out in my name because they always wanted two shillings or half-a-crown to change them, and by putting them in my name they got it without a fee—I continued to receive cheques through Friedlander's private banking account after the commencement of the partnership—I know no other gentleman named Charles to whom the defendant was in the habit of paying cheques in the same way that he paid them to me—when I was seen by the prosecutor on August 17th he was in a very excited condition; he told me he had been robbed—I said, "Wait till I come back from Paris; it is impossible he can have done such a thing"—I went to Paris the same day—I had no interest in the partnership business, but I was a friend of both—in my capacity as a metal chaser I was not employed by either of the partners; I worked for other people—Friedlander handed back the bills on the evening before my departure for Paris—I am positive Cauchefert left before the end of July, 1891.</p>

               <p>my regular servant, and the mother of Rolf e, who is married, and has frequently come to my house to work; she assisted in the house for about two months—I am never very well; I suffer from my heart and from nervous depression—I have not been treated for drinking too much; I don't know what is the matter with me—in September I knew Mulloch as the servant next door—I think, on 13th September, before my husband went to sea, she came in at the back; I was ill in bed, and she came upstairs and told me she had left next door, and asked if I would allow my servant to help her to the station with her box—I said my servant was out—from that time Mulloch stayed in my house as my nurse—she stayed the first night because it was too late for her to go home, and she said she had nowhere to go, so I allowed her to stay, and the next day a lady friend called for me to go for a drive, and said as Mulloch seemed a very nice girl, and had been a hospital nurse, I had better keep her till I got better—I did so—shortly after my husband went away, and I was taken very ill—Mulloch stayed with me about a month—a few days after she came Scorey came to the house; he said he was Mulloch's husband—I gave her a day's holiday, which she asked for, saying she was going to get married to him—afterwards she came back, and told me she was married; she brought Scorey with her—he said the rice was all down his neck—he stopped in the house too—all the time Rolfe was coming into the house now and again—on 20th October I got better, and went through my things—I had been confined to my bed all the time since my husband went till 30th October—I missed silks, two gold rings, a gold brooch, a silver knife, fork, and spoon in a case; a petticoat, a chemise, a night-dress, a silk wrap, two pieces of China silk, six silver teaspoons, six silver dessertforks, and a pair of drawers—I gave nobody authority to take those away—the wearing apparel was in my bedroom, and the silver in a cabinet in the dining-room—some of the things taken had just come home from the wash—on 25th October I sent for Rolfe, and had a conversation with her, and her mother-in-law went to fetch the silk from pawn; two nieces of silk were brought to me—on the 27th I went to the station and charged Rolfe—she came to my house and I gave her into custody—then Constable Foster produced a number of articles of dress to me—while I was ill I did not go to Southend—I told nobody to deny me to my friends—I have not seen other of my stolen property—I never authorised Mulloch or Harrington to say I had gone to Southend, or anywhere else, or to deny me to Mrs. Jackson, or Dr. Cheetham, or anyone else—I told that to no one.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEITH FRITH</hi>. I have no doubt I first became acquainted with Mulloch on 13th September this year—a letter purporting to be written by me was found in her box, stating that I had known her for twelve months, and that she was a perfectly honest and respectable woman—I did not write that letter—I was too ill—I gave it to her; it is not my signature to it, I swear (<hi rend="italic">The witness here wrote her signature.</hi>)—I simply gave the letter to her to get her out of my house—I only authorised someone to sign it to get rid of her—it is not in Mulloch's writing—I did not know when she left that she was not respectable—she had not been with me twelve months—she could be industrious and a good nurse if she liked, and she could work if she liked—she was not Miss Scorey, which is the name in the letter—I knew her as Mrs. Louisa</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189211140082"/>
               <p>Thomas; I did not know her as Mulloch till after she left my house—I had never seen her till she walked into my bedroom—she told me then her name was Thomas—I was quite sober—I went into her bedroom on the Monday morning when she left me, and told her to go by the doctor's orders, because she was not doing me any good—I did not say I was thankful for the kindness and care she had displayed to me—I did not give her any underlinen—when she first came my husband's Teasel was lying in the East India Docks—I did not communicate with him about her; there was no necessity—he did not come to the house—I have a boy seven years old; I did not tell Mulloch that my husband had come to my house to try and see if he could take the boy from me—he was six days in London before he sailed in the <hi rend="italic">Ganges</hi>—I could have sent to him by Mrs. Harrington—I took Mulloch as a nurse while she behaved herself—I took her on recommendation of Mrs. Crawley, a widow, of Warwick Road, Forest Gate, whom I have known for months—she asked Mulloch to go and fetch the doctor to me—Mulloch did not ask me for some linen the night before she left—she did not say there was a man in my bedroom—only my sister was with me; there was no man in the house—Mulloch did not complain to me next morning of what she had seen—when I told her to go she swore at me, and swore she would not go out of the house until I had given her a reference and money to go out with, and a month's wages in advance—I did not say, "If you do leave, don't tell anyone, and I will give you a twelvemonth's character"—I gave her a twelvemonth's character, which was false—I paid her what was due to her and a month's wages, a sovereign in advance, to go; she was in my house nearly a month—I had made no arrangements to keep and pay her—I did not give her a false character and £3 10s. not to say there was a man in my bedroom—I might have suspected her a fortnight before she left my service; two rings were lost.</p>

Scorey did not come to see me about becoming my groom—I was not in want of a groom; I cannot afford to keep a horse and carriage—I saw him on Wednesday or Thursday at my house as Mulloch's husband—I was ill in bed at the time; he came with Mulloch—he stayed there from that time till they left together on Monday morning—he did not come as my groom—I had nothing to drink with him when he came and saw me in bed—I think I had some brandy and water with him once—the first time he came I did not suggest that as it was late he should stay and sleep with me and Mulloch—I have never invited him to sleep with me—another man came with Mulloch and Scorey; I am not sure whether it was the same day—I don't know how long he stopped in my house; I don't know whether he stopped all next day, because I was not down there; it might have been a mistake on my servant'a part—I don't know Mrs. Becroft—a Mrs. Wainwright called on me—I don't know if she called about a man who had slept at my house all night—there was a disturbance in my house about it—I think I charged Rolfe on 27th October—that was over a week after the other prisoners had left my house together.</p>

I am a physician and surgeon at 8, Norwich Road, Forest Gate—Mrs. Wright was my patient; I attended her constantly between 16th September and 8th October, and then up to 26th October—she was suffering from considerable anxiety of mind, and the use of alcoholic stimulants—she was not in a condition to manage her own affairs—I have seen Mulloch there the first time I saw her I gave orders that she was to see nobody but the folks in the house and the doctor—in the course of a few days I said she might see a few friends just for a few minutes—after about a week Mulloch refused me admission, saying that Mrs. Wright had gone to Southend, and would not</p>

               <p>be back for a few days—two or three days afterwards I called again—I passed the house three or four times a day sometimes, as it was between my surgery and my residence—it was very brilliantly lit up for the house of a person who was ill; I have seen it lit up both back and front—I afterwards saw Mrs. Jackson, and then I communicated with some of Mrs. Wright's friends—I resumed my attendance upon Mrs. Wright from 8th October to 26th intermittently, and then I dismissed her as being cured—in consequence of what she told me I advised her to send for her friends.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FRITH</hi>. From a medical point of view I attached little importance to what she did and said—I considered her memory impaired, and her judgment warped—she might have forgotten from day to day what she had said and done or she might not; possibly she would, not probably—she was not suffering entirely from the effects of alcoholism; I put the mental effect down as being a large one—her mind was not unhinged to that extent—she was very ill from anxiety of mind and the use of stimulants; I don't say the excessive use—it is a very common thing for a medical man attending the wife and family of a seagoing man to be asked to take charge of the house while the patient is ill, if the husband is away—I knew she was taking alcohol, not to an excessive amount—the going away of her husband was the chief thing that upset her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>, The chief cause of her illness was mental depression, and then she would take alcohol to relieve it, and that affected her.</p>

I have not got my attendance book here, and cannot say the exact dates I attended her—I attended her up to October 8th, and then intermittently up to 26th—I attended her on and off from 8th to 16th October—about; three days was the longest time I was absent from her—after 8th October I was very much dissatisfied with her condition—I directed Mulloch that Mrs. Wright might have a tablespoonful of alcohol three times a day if she insisted on having it, not otherwise—I never recognised her as a nurse; she was not represented to me as one—from what I saw of her between 8th and 20th October I formed the opinion that, off and on, Mrs. Wright was taking a great deal more alcohol than the three spoonfuls a day; she would be well for two or three days, then go hack for a whole day—I used to hold a conference in Harrington's presence in the dining-room after I had seen Mrs. Wright, and my instructions were always on the same lines—I had not seen the husband before he went—on many occasions I told Mulloch that Mrs. Wright was having more alcohol than I had directed—she generally said, "Yes, she was having it"—I got a bit disquieted, and felt like throwing the thing over several times; I could not tell who was telling the truth in the house—I don't know if Mulloch first sent for me to attend Mrs. Wright; in my note it was the servants who did so.</p>

I have been staying with my sister since this happened—my husband is a lighterman and waterman—he is away very often in his business—the prisoner is the landlord of the house, 2, Bellwater Gate—I occupied two rooms in it—he has two children—he is a widower; his wife died about eighteen months ago, or a little more; I have looked after his children since then—he is in the same business as my husband I think, a lighterman and waterman—on the morning of 1st October I went out shopping about a quarter to eleven, and I went into a public-house and was having twopennyworth of whisky, and the prisoner came in; he had nothing to drink—he asked me to treat him; I said I would not; I told him to go home to his children—I drank up my whisky and came out, and soon after I saw him up the street—he asked me to have a drink—I said, "No, I am going home"; he went up the street by himself—I next saw him about half-past two, when he came home—I asked him to give me the money he owed me (18s. 6d.) to get something for his children's dinner—he said he would pay me when he thought he would—about half-past two I went over to the Crown and Cushion and had twopennyworth of whisky with him—two of his mates, Digby and Foster, were there—before that, in the morning, I was in the Red House, and the prisoner followed me and asked me to treat him—I told him to go home and feed his children, and I pushed him on the chest or arm with my umbrella—I don't think it hit him in the face; I just pushed him with the handle; this is the umbrella—he said nothing; he took it quite calmly—when I came out of the Crown and Cushion I went straight indoors—he followed after his daughter Susan; she is known as Mrs. Brummett—I went to the back-way door on the ground floor, and spoke to her; the prisoner was standing by the stairs—he went upstairs, and called me up into the children's bedroom—I went up to see what he wanted; he closed the door and put his arm round my neck and kissed me, and walked up to the fireplace, and I saw a revolver in his hand; it was not in his hand when he kissed me; I did not see</p>

I am the wife of Mark Hardley, of 212, Brixton Road—the deceased, Dr. Kirwain, lodged with me, first from May, 1890, to February, 1891—he then returned in September, 1892—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a photograph of the doctor; it is not a good likeness at the present; it would be a very good one two years and a half ago, when he first came to lodge with me—he was lodging with me down to 11th October, 1892—I let him out at eleven that morning; he then seemed in excellent spirits and good health—to the best of my recollection he was wearing a very dark brown morning coat, a high hat, carrying a silk umbrella in his right hand, and light tan gloves—at the breakfast-table in the dining room he had on a watch chain; he used to wear it much the same as you are wearing yours, across—I could not say whether he had any watch that morning—he wore a ring generally, on this left-hand little finger; it was a gold ring with a plain stone—I did not notice whether he was wearing it that morning—when he went out he left behind him a port manteau and a bag containing the ordinary wearing apparel for a gentleman—I expected him to return to tea in the evening, but I never saw him any more—the whole time he was in my house he was a very</p>

I knew him very well—I never knew that he was hard-up for money—he paid me most regular, once a week; he never seemed short of money—I had not the slighest idea that he ever pawned anything in the summer of 1890—he dined frequently at home, but not latterly—he was always exactly the same in his habits—I never saw him drunk—he had nothing but a small bottle of ale for dinner, and cocoa for supper; he never had ale for supper—he always came home at night; except in the summer of 1890, on, I think, three occasions, when he was doing practice for different gentlemen—so far as I know, then he was not home at night, but his habit, as a rule, was before eleven o'clock in bed—he only lodged with me about eight days on the second occasion—when I heard of his death I mentioned something to my house agent, Mr. Hopham, about a betting lot—I bad no reason to suppose he had got in with a betting lot, but I could not understand how such a quiet gentleman could get into such company.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 200, Barking Road; I am an M. D.—I knew William Kirwain since 30th January, 1875—he was about thirty two years of age—he assisted me on several occasions as a <hi rend="italic">locum tenens</hi>, and as an assistant as well: he was acting for Dr. Moser, I think, before October—on the 11th October I was with Kirwain; he was in my company that evening from about half-past five up to about six—he was then in the best health and spirits; he had afternoon tea at my place—I noticed that he wore a chain; it was a gold chain, a curb pattern; it was worn right from one pocket to the other, going through the buttonhole—I could not say whether he had a watch that day, I had previously seen him with a gold watch, an open-faced one, as well as I remember, but I could not swear to that—he had a silk umbrella that day—I could not say if he was wearing a ring—I could not say what money he had—he left just about six—I saw him again a little before ten—I was with him about twenty minutes the second time—he left me about ten minutes or a quarter past ten to go home—I left him opposite my own door; my brother came with him; he would not come in—my brother was transacting some business, and I went outside the door and saw Kirwain alone—at that time he was quite sober—during the years I have known him his character was exceptionally steady; I should describe him as a sober, abstemious man—after hearing of his death, on 13th or 14th October, I went to the mortuary, and saw and identified his body—I first gave evidence before the Magistrate on the 21st October—on the 28th October I went with Sergeant Dybal to Mr. Attenborough's, the pawnbroker's, 193, Fleet Street, and there saw this diamond ring, which I recognised as Dr. Kirwain's—I also went to Mr. Nathan's, a pawnbroker, of St. Leonard's Road, Poplar, and there saw this coat, which I recognised as Dr. Kirwain's—the distance between my house and the commencement of the East India Dock Road is, I think, about three-quarters of a mile; I am only guessing at it, I don't know the locality very well—going from my house to Barking Road, I think you would go down East India Road, Commercial Road, through the Borough, and so on to Brixton.</p>

I am a barman at the Alfred's Head public-house, at the corner of Newington Causeway, close to the Elephant and Castle—we open at five in the morning—on "Wednesday morning, 12th October, I was serving—about half-past five two persons came into one of the public bars; they were Dr. Kirwain and Blanche Roberts—I did not know him then; he had on a tall hat and a black coat, and he was carrying an umbrella (<hi rend="italic">Roberts was called in</hi>)—that is the woman who was with him, and this photograph resembles the doctor; I could not positively say he asked for a glass of bitter for himself and twopennyworth of Irish whisky for the woman—I served him with it, and he paid for the two drinks—they appeared sober; they stood at the counter—they remained about ten minutes—I heard them talking together—they left together—I had not seen the woman before that morning; I knew her by sight as a customer—I don't remember whether the gentleman had any gloves; I did not notice, Or whether he was wearing a ring.</p>

I am a florist, of 2, Great Dover Street—that is the second shop round the corner from St. George's Church; on Wednesday morning, 12th October, about a quarter-past ten, two people came into my shop—the gentleman I recognise as Dr. Kirwain, and the girl they call Blanche—I had not known Dr. Kirwain before, but I recognise him from his photograph; I have seen Blanche outside to-day—I should think they had been recovering from drink, rather steadying themselves—the woman smelt very strongly of drink, and was very dilapidated—the gentleman seemed rather an aristocratic gentleman; she understood quite what she was doing; she came in first; she was wearing a fawn-coloured or drab three-quarter cloak and a broad felt hat with a dark-coloured bow in it, blue I think—she asked me to pin a flower in her jacket or cape, and I did so—it was a blue and white, I think—the gentleman was wearing a tall silk hat; I thought he was a professional gentleman—he seemed the most sober of the two, the other seemed skittish, larkish—the gentleman had on a dark overcoat, not buttoned; it was open, and underneath was a dark coat buttoned across, and he had a curb chain from one pocket to the other, tan coloured gloves, not on his hands, and an umbrella—I believe he was</p>

               <p>wearing a stone ring, if I remember right, but I would not be positive—it was gold, a kind of signet, on his left hand—the woman came in first, the gentleman was immediately behind her—she said she wanted a flower; he gave her one, a chrysanthemum—she would not have it, she wanted a rose; he said, "Let her have what she wants"—he paid for it—he pulled out from his trousers pocket a handful of money; I should think there was some loose silver, half-crowns and two-shilling pieces, and two or three gold coins, all mixed up with some coppers—he was quite sensible and understood, but seemed weary, and leaned on the counter; I watched him through a looking-glass, and he leaned back and looked tired; the shop is entirely glass—I did not turn my face to him; the woman smelt of drink very strongly—they were in the shop from five to ten minutes; the man was able to give me the right money, he quite knew what he was doing—I drew his attention to the gold at the time—they went out, and walked across the road in the direction of the church; I watched them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Lloyd's Row, Clerkenwell, and am a bottle-stopper maker—on Wednesday, 12th October, I was in the Marsbalsea Road about a quarter-past eleven, and saw a gentleman going along with a woman—the woman seemed drunk, and the gentleman not far from it—the woman was Blanche Roberts; I did not know her then; I recognised her on Monday—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a photograph of the gentleman—they stood in the Marshalsea Road, and then went on—I saw Balch, Noble, and Lee standing near them; when the woman and the gentleman walked on Balch and Lee walked behind them, and Noble followed them—in a turning out of the Marshalsea Road I saw the woman leave the gentleman two or three times and go and speak to Balch and Lee several times and then go back to the gentleman, and by the lodging-house I saw Balch get hold of the gentleman's arms and shove him to the lodging-house—there are nothing but lodging-houses there—they tried to get him into the lodging-house—the woman stopped him there—Lee and Balch came up together—Balch got hold of the doctor's arm at the same time as the woman did, and they tried to shove him in there—the gentleman slung his umbrella round and nearly cut me on the chin with it—Balch then let go of his arm, and the woman and the doctor went on; Balch still followed them, a little distance off, with Lee, and Noble still followed—Lee was not a foot from Balch at the time he was trying to get the doctor in—I did not see Noble when they were doing that—I did not see him till they got just round the corner; he was standing by the house at the corner, about three yards away—after leaving the lodging-house the doctor and the woman went up the Marshalsea Road again to the One Distillery; the same three men followed them, and in the same order, and I followed them—the man and woman went inside the One Distillery, to the bottom of the bar—Lee followed them into the house; Balch and Noble stood outside—Lee then came out, and Balch and Noble went in; then they came out—Balch said to me, "What the b——hell are you waiting for?"—I took no notice; I walked away to the little sweetstuff-shop, about two doors from the Distillery—I waited there until they all went in again and came out—a lot of children standing there laughed at them, and they turned in the opposite direction into the Borough High Street—the three men still followed them into Union Street, and so did I, to the second or third turning—then they turned into a small entrance leading to the Recreation Grounds, or Redcross Gardens, and a lot of children pelted at them—the caretaker there was sweeping—the doctor and the woman were going to sit down, but they were pelted by the children, and they went right through the Recreation Grounds and out into the street facing some model buildings—the children still followed, and so did I, straight through Redcross Street into Marshalsea Road, and into High Street, and then into Lant Street, the three men still following—they stood there, then came down Lant Street again, High Street into the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas John Knight, who keeps the Lord Clyde public-house, at the corner of Peter Street and Whitecross Street in the Borough—I was serving on 12th October, when Waller, Noble, Lee, Balch, and the doctor came into the smaller bar from Whitecross Street, about 1.30, together—the doctor sat on a form opposite the bar—Waller sat on his right, and Balch on his left—they seemed to speak to him—Lee leaned on the counter—Noble stood in front of the doctor talking and drinking with him—Noble called for a pot of mild and bitter—he paid for it—it was served in a pewter pot with a spout, and two glasses—it was handed round by Noble, first to the doctor—he drank—I did not see him rise till he went out—Noble gave him a second glass—he put it to his lips and threw it down and broke it—I said the glass would have to be paid for—Noble paid for it—he said, "This is my uncle from the country"—the doctor was in the house from 1.30 till 2.10—he seemed sober, but sleepy, as though he had been up all night—I did not speak to him—I could see he was speaking to them, but I did not hear his voice—the doctor went out of the compartment last—I was standing in the bar a little while after, when I saw people running round Whitecross Street—I lifted the spar and went to the door, and I saw an ambulance being wheeled down Whitecross Street—I followed to the passage, and saw a policeman lift the doctor on to the ambulance—he was dying or dead—that was about 2.50—on Thursday, 13th, I saw Waller, Balch, and Lee at the Southwark Police-court, and on Saturday, 15th, Noble—I am positive the prisoners are the men.</p>

I live at Walpole Road, New Cross—I am a chemist and Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, London—on the 12th October I went into the Lord Clyde public-house about 1.15, into the bar leading into Whitecross Street—about 1.30 five men came in—Waller and Noble are two—this gentlemen was one of the five, in a high hat (<hi rend="italic">looking at the photograph</hi>)—the landlady served them with a pot of beer—the gentleman was going first to pay, and took a sixpence and a half-sovereign from his pocket, but Noble said, "I will pay," and took the sixpence to Mrs. Knight, and put the half-sovereign in his pocket—Noble appeared sober—the gentleman appeared dazed, as if on the borders of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, or recovering from its effects—he had a dark overcoat open, and I could see a gold chain—he was sitting between two of the men on the form—the lady who served them took up a paper and sat down, and when a tumbler was broken she came backhand one of the men said, "I will pay for it; what is the price?"—I noticed the crash of the tumbler, and then the landlady asked who should pay for it—she valued it at twopence—Waller said, "Let us go out," and they filed out, the doctor going last, and as they went Noble smoothed down the gentleman's coat with his hands—they turned to the left—I remained in the bar—I believe the street they went into is Whitecross Street—the gentleman went in the centre of two men, I believe Waller and Noble and two others were behind—I went to Margate the next day—I next saw Waller and Noble on the 28th, when I recognised them among twelve or fourteen men—a woman came in for half a pint of beer and spoke to one man, but I saw no woman in their company.</p>

On 12th October about four p.m. I received information and a description of some men—that same evening about eight p.m. I was in the Marshalsea Road near the Lord Clyde—a number of persons were returning from the City, and the prisoner Waller was hurriedly walking along, putting a white-yellow kid glove on the left hand—the fellow glove was on—I, with Sergeant Gentle, went to him; I seized the prisoner by the coat and said, "lama police officer; I am going to arrest you on suspicion of causing the death of a gentleman this afternoon in Whitecross Street"—he replied, "Oh, very well, but I think you have made a great mistake"—we took him to the Southwark Police-station—I searched him; I found 10s. 6d. in silver, and a penny in bronze, also these three pawn duplicates—one was in this envelope; they were in his waistcoat pocket—I said, "Are these your tickets?"—he looked at the one referring to the watch of 30th September, and said, "That is the ticket for my watch"—I showed him the ticket for the coat, and he said, "That is the ticket for my coat"—I showed him the ticket for the diamond ring—he said, "I know nothing about that"—I</p>

I give myself up, there is no getting out of it"—he was identified by Mrs. Knight—later he was put in the dock at the Police-station and charged—on leaving the dock I was near to him, and he said, "I cannot help what the others have done"—I attended the Coroner's inquiry on 17th and 19th October—the prisoners were present—my evidence was read over on 19th—opportunity was given to them to give evidence if they desired; they reserved their defence—they did not tender themselves as witnesses—I was cross-examined.</p>

I thought as I had been told what I had by Waller that I would help to clear up the mystery about the affair and I wrote to Inspector O'Dea to come and see me, and I would tell him what I knew also, as I thought Lee was an innocent man and should not suffer. I have no other object in making this statement. All the men in question are strangers to me. I expect nothing at the hands of the police, or anyone else; my only object is the innocent should not suffer. I am also willing to give evidence to the above effect on oath against the men in question. (Signed) <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN FEATHBBSTONE</hi>.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMPSON</hi>. I am undergoing a term of nine months' hard labour—I have never before been convicted—when arrested a counterfeit five-shilling piece was found on me—the bonds were said to be worth £2,500—I told the magistrate I bought the bonds—I told the same story at this Court—I gave the addresses of the men I bought them of—I found that out in prison—I told Inspector Strood where one of these men lived—the Inspector gave me one man's address—I did not know where he was; I knew he was in prison—I gave the Inspector another name—someone came to the prison who found it out for me—I had not seen the men before I got the bonds—I innocently got the bonds from strangers—I saw the inspector's name in the paper—the report was about half a column—it says "Surrender" in this copy, but it had not the surrender when I read it—I signed the statement as absolutely correct—the forgery charged was on account of a cheque I received for £5 11s. 6d. for work I did, and it turned out to be bad—(<hi rend="italic">two more editions of Lloyd's were produced</hi>)—<hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the one (<hi rend="italic">the third edition</hi>), but there is a whole column instead of about half, but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is all I read (<hi rend="italic">The first paragraph of the report.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMPSON</hi>.

               <p>Coroner's depositions—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>, "No evidence of the deceased having been drugged, no appearance of any irritant poison")—that is correct—I cannot account for his being supported by three men, and his feet dragging on the ground, and that but for support he would have fallen—I did not say he was not drunk—I have not said there was food in the epiglottis—I said there was some in the gullet, the passage from the mouth to the stomach—the gullet is behind the larynx—I do not think the food in the gullet was caused by the man trying to vomit—food often regurgitates back from the stomach while the body is lying in the mortuary; but no food got up to the epiglottis, and there was none in the larynx—that is my experience at the hospital—I cannot quote any book of authority for that—I have made a number of post-mortem examinations—food goes back from the gullet when you take it out and hang it up—I do not know of a case of food going back into the stomach on the removal of the body, because you cannot tell if there is any food in the gullet till you have the gullet out of the body—it is possible—it would be possible for a particle of food to almost choke, or cause such sensations as to bring about vomiting or violent retching—epileptics, in consequence of the regurgitation of food, frequently die from being suffocated in that way—persons who drink to excess usually vomit, but I do not think the food in the gullet was through this man's effort to vomit—I have been house surgeon since the 1st October—I have never had a case like this before—the injuries to the neck would have been sufficient to cause death by asphyxia, not the hand on the mouth—the wound on the finger appeared older than the other wounds—the wound on the chin is consistent with tumbling over a step, assuming that he fell on his chin, but that would not account for the injuries to the delicate bones injured—I have had experience of a case in which the larynx has been fractured—I cannot say in which direction the force was applied—the fractures described did not loosen the muscles—I found no trace of blood on the skull—there was simply capillary hemorrhage or bleeding of the small vessels, caused by pressure, not by a blow on the head——I do not think the pressure from loosening the stud caused the injuries, they were too extensive—nor would violent vomiting have a tendency to injure those parts of the throat; nor struggling for breath—I should describe the deceased as being rather long-necked—supposing strangulation, the time of death would depend upon circumstances—it might not be immediate, but might be very rapid; perhaps within a minute—his dying two or three minutes after violence, and being put on an ambulance, would be consistent with strangulation—I do not understand a man being half-strangled—in this case the man may have lived four, five, or six minutes—the drunken condition of the man would not affect these injuries—I should agree with Dr. Taylor when he says, in his book on "Medical Jurisprudence," "In homicidal strangulation, from the unnecessary violence used, we may expect to find the skin much lacerated or excoriated"—in this case I do not find it—I cannot account for these injuries—I have no doubt they were inflicted—sometimes you may have internal injuries without any external wounds or bruises, although that is the exception—I was surprised to find those injuries without external marks—I should think the pressure would have been sufficient to disturb the shape of the collar if the hand had been between</p>

               <p>his neck and the collar—the stud would not account for the amount of pressure even if he fell on the stud, and it would not be like a hammer, because the injuries are too extensive; they go beyond when the collar-stud is and below it—I do not think choking from a particle of food and the stud combined would cause the injuries, nor tend to produce any result like them; nor would the man struggling for life, in addition to the two other conditions, account for the injuries; not even with the fourth condition of the pressure of the stud in trying to loosen the collar—to paralyse the respiratory centres a man must be very drunk—I do not think that the drunkenness would have a certain effect upon the respiratory centres—if he was very drunk he would get a change in his respiration—you might have heavy breathing—the breathing might be more labored and difficult—ecchymosis does not extend considerably beyond the actual place to which the force is applied—it prevents extravasations of blood, which extends beyond the area covered by the fracture—an oyster has been known to choke a man; also potato peel—a sudden violent jerk of the head would not cause the injuries—I cannot imagine that any kind of force arising from a fall could have produced these injuries—a to-and-fro movement of the head would not cause them—protrusion of the tongue is a symptom of strangulation—a man's head. would not be doubled up under his legs by a fall—a fall would not account for injury to the neck—given the conditions you have stated, it is absurd to suppose the man inflioted the injuries on himself in trying to get breath—I think it is impossible—I never heard of anybody committing suicide by pressure on the windpipe, if you mean by manual pressure; I should think it highly improbable—a pressure of food on the epiglottis and falling violently would not produce the fractures described—I have received my diploma since Christmas.</p>

I am lecturer on Forensic Medicine at Guy's Hospital, and analyst ordinarily employed by the Government—I wag present at the post-mortem examination on Dr. Kirwain—I had seen the body on the previous day—on the 13th the face was an ashy or leaden hue; the lividity of the face, neck and shoulders was very marked—there was a peculiar and significant form of blotchy ecchymosis over the forehead and scalp, which was somewhat bald—I saw a livid mark on the right-hand side of the neck, laterally to the right of the centre, and rather below half-way down; it was co-centric with the hollow or cavity upwards, and about the size of the mark which would be made by the middle finger or thumbnail—it might have been done by the collartud, although it was not in the position the collar-stud would press when worn—he was a rather long-necked man—when I saw him he had no shirt or collar—the mark was to the right, and the shirt must have been worn at an unusual height to naturally press on that part—it was higher, and not on the spot where the stud would press, but if the stud did press there it might have produced the mark—I observed a bruise on the left knee and a graze on the chin, both recent, and the second joint of the middle finger was considerably grazed—I formed the opinion that had been done several hours before death—it was older than the graze or the bruise, but within a day—I formed the provisional opinion that asphyxia would be found to be the cause of death—on the 14th the post-mortem was conducted, twenty-four hours later, by Dr. Carling—I was present—I agree generally with him in all the important points of his evidence—I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> see the brain then—I saw it afterwards—I saw nothing to account for death—I was present at the examination of the throat, not of the brain—there was a very extensive effusion or extravasation of blood around the larynx, and the tongue bone; all round, but most on the right side—the air passages were free from any foreign body or obstruction; the epiglottis, or covering of the larynx, being raised, and the chink of the glottis through which the air passes open—the windpipe was red, or injected with blood—by "the chink of the glottis" I mean the chink below the valve which closes the aperture when food is swallowed; that was open, so that any food could pass in—the cartilages of the larynx were broken in three places; the lowest, or ring cartilage, at the entrance of the gullet, was broken on the right, and the two broken pieces overlaid one another; the larger, or shield cartilage, was split from the top on the right side to the bottom ring, cracked through, and the little horn, back of that cartilage, was broken off; on the left the cartilage was broken below the horn, so that the little triangular piece of cartilage was broken off—the bone of the tongue was broken across on the right, close behind the little horn there is on it—the blood-points on the forehead of the scalp were in the same condition as the day before; there was no bruising of the scalp—I had the liver, kidneys, and spleen—the liver and kidneys, the organs which would be affected by chronic drinking, were healthy—I saw nothing to indicate</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189211140123"/>
               <p>habitual drinking to excess—the silvered condition of the long was very apparent, what I may term asphyxiated, a most significant form, one special form of asphyxia—another sign I thought significant was the small effusions of blood on the surface of the lung and in the substance of the lung and heart; also the general condition of the lung as regards blood and air—all these appearances induce me to form the opinion that asphyxia was the cause of death, and strangulation was the cause of the asphyxia—I formed the opinion at the time that it was caused by external violence—the violence must have been considerable—his organs appeared to be healthy and strong; he was a well-built and well-nourished man, and I discovered no disease—an attack with one hand on the mouth and another at the throat, with his body supported, with grasping or pressing at the throat, more likely grasping, would, or might, result in these injuries—I think Dr. Carling's measurement of the injuries as covering some three and a quarter inches fairly accurate—on 24th October I received for analysis sealed jars containing the stomach, liver, spleen, kidneys, and brain, also a bottle of clean blood, and a bottle of urine—I did not see the stomach opened, but when examining the gullet, that is in the chest, I observed smell of beer, and a very small quantity of half-fluid and half-food appeared to be there, which smelt strongly of beer—the food in the stomach amounted to three-quarters of a pint, but it was so dead I could not make out any solid food—I should say he had not taken solid food in any quantity within four or five hours, or even more—the alcohol in it would delay digestion, and possibly the food might have been his breakfast that morning or supper the. previous night, or a meal early on the day of his death—in the three-quarters of a pint of food there was as much alcohol as would be contained in a pint of ordinary beer—I should like to add that after death, when alcohol is in the stomach, it <hi rend="italic">becomes</hi> weaker; it passes away from the stomach; and it points to this, that at the time of death there must have been <hi rend="italic">something</hi> considerably stronger than alcohol in the stomach—that led me to the opinion that some short time before death <hi rend="italic">the</hi> deceased man had drunk something stronger than beer—it might have been spirit or strong wine—I found no drug or irritant poison beyond alcohol, irritant or stupefying—in strangulation generally the tongue is forced upwards against the teeth, but not necessarily.—it is not invariable—in some cases the tongue is found in its natural position, as I believe in this case, not forcibly pressed against the teeth, or indented—I might add that when the strangulating medium is removed from the neck, either before or at the point of death, the tongue, being very flabby, might easily fall back into its place; and if it did there would be no marks afterwards—the effect of a sudden and violent pressure of the windpipe is to cause almost immediate insensibility.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMPSON</hi>. Strangulation does not include suffocation from any cause—I should define strangulation as death from asphyxia produced by pressure of the windpipe or air passage, and not produced by suspension of the body, and not including hanging—the pressure would be external in case of violent vomiting, and some food in the epiglottis or larynx that produces suffocation—you would not produce that in strangulation, because there is no pressure of the air passages—I examined the injured bone—a bone is an osified</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189211140124"/>
               <p>structure—it was not brittle, it bore handling very well, and bent fairly well—the cartilage was a little more ossified than generally in a man the age of forty-two, a little more than the average—that would render it more liable to fracture and more liable to accident than in any quite young person—strangulation is rare in adults—there are not more than fifty cases of strangulation in a year in Great Britain, I suppose, all recorded—it was not the horn of the tongue bone, but the horn of the cartilage that had become detached—the horn of the cartilage may become detached through ulceration, but this was snapped off—the left ventricle of the heart was empty; the right had a little clotted blood in t, not much—an empty heart is not a sign of the person not having been strangled—the heart in strangulation is more often found empty than in any other form in the case of death from asphyxia—I should suspect the man had been drunk: his stomach was full of liquor—as a drunken man he would be more likely to fall, and receive serious injury when he fell, than a person who is not drunk—alcohol fives rise to paralysis of the respiratory centres, if a person drinks ardent spirits so as to become absolutely unconscious and comatose, but not in a person ordinarily drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not find a sufficient quantity of alcohol to indicate paralysis of the respiratory centres—I think the injuries could have been occasioned by external pressure without outward marks being visible—that is not inconsistent with my experience, and I have actually cut down a woman, when the mark was not seen, within a few minutes—in this case the blood had gone inwards—ordinarily I should expect to find more marks—it would much depend upon the force applied, but external injury more than I saw is not necessary—I cannot conceive any other way, than by external violence, that these injuries could be produced.</p>

About one a.m. on 21st October I was in High Street, Borough, and saw the prisoners walking about three or four yards apart; Cleary near the house and Courtney near the edge of the pavement—Courtney seized the prosecutor by the right-hand side of his Coat-collar—the prosecutor appeared to push him away, and called out "Police! police!"—I ran across and seized Courtney—I said, "We are police officers; what is the matter?"—the prosecutor said, "Oh, sir, these men are trying to rob me"—pointing to Courtney, he said, "He says he is a detective, and wants to know what I have got in my bundle; that man" (pointing to Cleary) "Put his hand into my trousers pocket, and tried to get <hi rend="italic">my</hi> purse"—Cleary was there—I did not see him do anything—he came close up to the prosecutor; but I did not see what he did—Cleary walked away, and was brought back by a constable—I said to the prisoners, "You will both be charged with attempting to rob this man"—Courtney said, "That is quite wrong"—Cleary said, "We have no wish" to rob him; what he says is lies"—I took them to the station; they were charged, and in answer to the charge Courtney said, "That is quite false; I know him, and have no wish to rob him"—Cleary said, "You are a d——old liar," speaking to the prosecutor—they gave correct names and addresses.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Courtney.</hi> I did not see you put your hand into his pocket—you made no resistance when I said I was going to take you to, the station—I found fourpence halfpenny, I think, in your pocket.</p>

On the 21st October, about one a.m., I was with Gentle—I saw the prosecutor and Courtney on the opposite side of the road—they struggled together—I heard a scuffling noise like someone trying to call out—we stopped to watch, and Cleary jumped out from a doorway close by, and got hold of the prosecutor on the other side—after a scuffle the prosecutor got away, jumped on to the road, and shouted "Police!"—I ran across, and Cleary ran, or walked very quickly one way and Courtney went in the other direction—I followed Cleary,</p>

               <p>and said, "What have you been doing?"—he said, "Who are you?"—I told him, and took him back to the prosecutor—I found Gentle had brought Courtney back—Gentle asked the prosecutor what they had been doing to him—he said trying to rob him; "One got hold of my throat and the other tried to steal my bundle," and also he pointed to his trousers pocket and said they tried to rob him—Cleary said, "You are an old liar"—Courtney said he had no wish to rob him—the prosecutor said, "You told me you were a detective"—they were taken to the station, and charged with assaulting, with intent to rob him—I saw Courtney holding the prosecutor—in the prosecutor's pocket I found a purse with two shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother at 51, Camilla Road, Bermondsey—my father, William Low Bagworth, was living there up to the 15th November, 1890, when he died—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the certificate of his death—in July last a paper was left at the house with reference to some claim—it was called for in August—I don't know who called for it; he seemed to be a young man between thirty and thirty-five,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189211140131"/>
               <p>of rather slim build—I do not see anyone in Court like him—the prisoner rather resembles the man—my landlady opened the door to him—he asked for the paper (this is it)—I said, of course, that my father was not living; my mother was away on business, and would not be home till Saturday evening, the paper was not signed; would he call again, or would I do he said, "Yes"—my landlady then called out, "Take the young man into the front parlour, to save the trouble of coming upstairs"—we then entered the parlour together—I said, H William Low Bagworth?"—he said, "Yes"—I had the paper in my hand, and I signed the name—after I had done so I asked if that was correct—he said, "Yes"—he pointed with his finger where I was to sign—it was with either red or black ink, or mixed—I handed him the paper, and he then left—about a month later two gentlemen called and made inquiries with reference to the paper—I gave them information with reference to my father, and they went away—the prisoner wrote nothing in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see the man who left the paper, or the man who called for it before the prisoner came—I told my mother that a certain paper had been left, would she see to it—she said she would, but it slipped her memory—I did not understand what it was—I never troubled my head about elections—I never wrote letters for my father when he was alive, nor my mother; I did it for her—since his death I have written letters for my mother; I never signed them in matters like this—I have signed her name—to the best of my belief I had not seen any man before I saw the prisoner, or given him my father's name—I was not asked about this until two months afterwards—I was not then absolutely certain as to what took place—if the man who left the paper had asked if Mr. Low Bagworth was the person who lodged on the first floor I should have said Mr. Bagworth was not living; I should give my mother's name—I did not see that man—my landlady brought the paper to me, and said it was a claim which she expected must be filled up, and I put it away and thought no more of it—I am positive I did not take in the paper when the prisoner came; the landlady opened the door for him, and called up to me, "Emily, there's a man called for the payer"—I was rather annoyed that I had not reminded mother of it, and I took it from the drawer and went upstairs—the man was standing at the door at the time—I told him dearly that the paper was not signed—I did not say, "Father has not signed it;" or "Father never did any writing"—I said, "Mother is not at home, will I do?"—I did not hear him say anything—we went into the front room; there was no one there but myself and the man—I spoke first—I said, "William Low Bagworth?"—he said, "Yes"—I had the pen in my hand, and said, "Where?" and he said, "There," pointing at the same time—when I went to the door I said I was sorry the form had not been filled up—after signing it I never saw him again.</p>

               <p>Camilla Road, Bermondsey—I remember a paper like this being left at the house for Mr. Bagworth, I took it in; I could not be sure whether it came by post or by hand—some time afterwards I remember some man calling for the paper; to the best of my belief it was the prisoner—I opened the door to him—he asked for Mr. Bagworth—I told him there was not a Mr. Bagworth; there was Mrs. Bagworth, that Mr. Bagworth had been dead some time—he asked me for the paper that was left to be filled in—I told him I did not think it was filled in; I would ask Miss Bagworth, and asked him if she would do—he said, "Yes," she would do—I asked him to come inside—I called for her, and she came down into the front room; I had shown him in there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This was some time in August—I could not say the date; it was a Friday morning—it was three weeks afterwards that I was asked about it; I was then examined at the Police-court—to the best of my belief I said then that I told him Mr. Bagworth had been dead some time; there had been a lot of these papers, I was quite upset answering the door to one and another—I don't remember any of the other canvassers asking for Mr. Bagworth—there are no other lodgers; I think four or fire canvassers called.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 77, Southwark Park Road—I am an accountant and registration agent for the Bermondsey division of Lambeth—I knew William Bagworth, of Camilla Road, and knew that he died on 15th November, 1890; in the course of my duty I inspected the claims for lodgers' votes for Bermondsey; among others I saw this one, signed William Low Bagworth—seeing that, I made inquiries, and at the revision I objected to the claim—I handed in my objection to the Revising Barrister on 16th November—I was present that day—the defendant was there sitting opposite to me at the same table—I remember the name of William Low Bagworth being mentioned—I raised an objection, because I knew the man was dead—I presume the defendant heard me—he said nothing—by direction of the barrister, two agents left the Court; when they returned, the barrister impounded the claim, and made this endorsement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I represented the Conservative party at the revision—these proceedings were taken at my initiative—no other claims were made for men who had. died, to my knowledge—I will not swear it—many canvassers on the other side sign the claims as witnesses—Bagworth was very well known to me—he did some canvassing for us once—this was the first time I had ever seen the defendant—some canvassers are not so strict as they ought to be in witnessing claims—an occupier's claim does not require a witness; a lodger's claim does.</p>
