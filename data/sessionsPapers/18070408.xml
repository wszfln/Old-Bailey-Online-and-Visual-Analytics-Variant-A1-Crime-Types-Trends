               <p>Q. Was it dark when you went out. - A. It was dark, but a fine night.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the door when you came home. - A. I found it open; immediately when I got inside of the door, a man rushed out of the parlour. I heard another at the handles of my drawers, which were in the parlour; I heard the drawers open and shut; I only heard the noise; I did not then see the men. I immediately took hold of the man that rushed out of the parlour. I struggled with the man a little; by the time I was got to the cill of the door, I asked him what business he had in my house, he said it is me to be sure, and he ran from me through a court that is facing my house. I had fallen down. Immediately another man rushed out of my parlour, and stepped upon me in getting out; that is all I know of the man; at that time when I went into the parlour, I missed a pair of silver table spoons, which were in the corner of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you them here. - A. No, I have not recovered any part of the property; I gave the discription of the prisoner to Mr. Clitherow; he asked me if I should know him again, he told me that a little after the time a man came that answered the description I gave him, came into the public house where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that man afterwards. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That man that you saw afterwards is he the prisoner at the bar. - A. He is very much altered, he is not as he was then; he is like him; I should be very sorry to swear to him. I believe him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that these things were left in the drawer when you went out. - A. They were; I had seen the spoons in the drawer before I went out; when I was looking for my gloves, the other things I had not seen for many days, they were in he same drawer.</p>

The goods that were stolen were in an auction room, adjoining my shop, where I dwell; it is the next door to my dwelling house; I have a son that sleeps in that house in the garret, he is my servant. On the 13th of March, the prisoner was detected between three and four in the afternoon, just at the close of the sale; a gentleman tapped me on the leg, and pointed to the prisoner who was sitting at the table. I went to where he was, I saw he was in the act of tying some books up.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he tying up. - A. He was tying up a bible with a handkerchief; I went to the clerk that takes the money and delivers the books, and sent him to him; when he returned I kept a watch over him. The prisoner finding he was detected, untied the bundle, which contained a large quarto bible, and put it on the table; as soon as the sale had closed, I called out to the auctioneer Mr. Walker, and said, I had detected a person stealing a bible. I then took him to Bow street, where he was searched, and a number of duplicates were found on him; which duplicates led to a discovery of a great number of books of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Those books were not taken at this time. - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080005"/> No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. Mr. Walker sold for you; therefore whether he sold books to the prisoner, or he bought them at another time, you cannot possibly know. - A. I rather believe he never did.</p>
               <p>Q. That you cannot know, you are only to speak to what you know; I would ask you whether this bible was not one of the prior lots that Mr. Walker put up, for which the prisoner bid twenty-four shillings. - A. I am positive that it was bought by another person who bid twenty-five shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether he bid for that bible. - A. I cannot say. It was knocked down to Mr. Taffey for one pound five.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not received the money for this book. - A. No. In consequence of Mr. Stockdale speaking to me, I asked the prisoner how he came in possession of the book; he told me he had bought it, and paid one pound four for it, to a person at the top of the room. I examined my book, and found that lot had been knocked down to Mr. Taffey, for one pound five; as soon as I was going back again to the prisoner, I observed him take the bible out of the handkerchief and lay it on the table.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any watch or seals on Monday the 9th of February. - A. Yes, it was a metal watch and two gold seals. The watch was sent to us by a silversmith of the name of Emanuel; it was not sold in the sale; after the sale we generally returned to that gentleman some lots that were unsold immediately; and we thought it was returned to him, so that we did not miss it for three or four days afterwards. This gentleman made application to me, that I did not put it in my account; he suggested to me that it was at a pawnbrokers in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there. - A. I saw the watch there about three weeks afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go immediately. - A. I had no suspicion of the prisoner; I did not suppose he had taken it.</p>

I bought the watch of the prisoner, I gave him two guineas for it, he said he was a hatter, and was going to Bristol; that he found business very slack in London; he said it was is own watch.

            . Mr. Winfield sent for me to purchase some goods. I saw the watch, I knew it to be my property. I told Mr. Edney of it; he would not go when I wanted him.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Edney) Do you know the watch. - A. Generally I should know it, particularly by the chain; it is more like a jack chain than a watch chain. I should not be able to swear to it.</p>

               <p>Q. (to Emanuel). Do you know the watch. - A. I could not swear to the watch, I can swear to the chain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews. Can you swear that this is the watch you sent to Mr. Edney's. - A. I do not wish to swear it, if I had my book here I could produce the number upon the watch. I never buy a watch without entering it in my book.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body standing with the dray at this time. - A. No, the whip laid on the curb, between the dray and the public house; in the course of a minute or two the prisoner Gun came out of the house with a bottle in his hand; he took up his whip, and drove off down to the store house with the seven barrels; where they were starting at the end of my beat. The store house belongs to Messrs. Hanbury and Co. In about twenty minutes afterwards I was sitting in my box. Gun came up to me with the empty dray; he says, what do you set there for, why did not you come and have something to drink. I said I did not know whether I might or no; he took hold of my hand, and shook hands with me. With that I found there was a finger wanting on his right hand. He drove off, in a direction to the brew-house; just before five o'clock I saw a dray coming from the brewhouse to go the store house, it stopped at the same public house; I stood up in my box, I saw a barrel go off the dray into the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see who took the barrel. - A. No, I was on the offside, I came out of my box and took my lanthorn, from which I took out a bit of chalk to mark the dray. When I came up to the dray, there was nobody then with the dray, the same as before; they were in the house; I marked the dray on the right hand of the horse, on the shafts of the dray.</p>
               <p>Q. What mark did you put upon it. - A. I went to make two crosses, I made one cross and a stroke, and then the chalk fell.</p>
               <p>Court. How many barrels were there on the dray. - A. Seven remained on the dray, and one I saw carried in. I heard somebody coming out of the house, then I walked away from the door. Gun quickly came out of the house, he came up to me, and said, why do not you come and have something to drink.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. About what time was this. - A. It was just before five when this happened. Gun said I shall be there in about ten minutes, come and have something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by there. - A. Where they were starting. I looked at my watch, it was just about five o'clock, then he drove off; I went my round, and then I went down to the store house, I staid there about two or three minutes; there were several <rs id="t18070408-8-viclabel46" type="occupation">brewer</rs>

               <p>Gunn said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Bowser's Defence. When Gunn called on me the night before and had a pot of ale, he shook me by the hand and said, that he had heard say that I was a good civil fellow, and was well liked in the neighbourhhood, he should come and have his beer of me, and several more of his acquaintance; he ordered a pot of beer to be taken home to his house, which I took home myself. He afterwards wanted to say something to me in secret, we went into the kitchen together, he told me he could let me have a barrel of stout, he said they were perquisites. I asked him how much it was to be, he said a one pound note was the same as they had of others, he should not charge me any more. I asked him what I was to do with it, he said put it into the waste but, it would help the waste but very much; he asked me what time I would be up in the morning, for they were going to start beer, and they should give me a call in the morning. I understood that there was a good many of them, and it was worth my attention to be up early in the morning. I told him I would be up at any hour, he said he would bring the cask in the morning in his way to the store-house; accordingly he did, and ordered me to have a bottle of gin, which I gave him according to his orders; then they put the barrel down into the cellar, he said be could let me have two more, which he brought, one at each turn. When he went and put up his horses, he said he would come and empty them, which he did, and brought tools with him for that purpose; he knocked up the hoops so as he might be able to knock in the head; when he was knocking in the head the beer flew about; I left him and went into the tap-room for a considerable time, I went to see how he was getting on. he ordered a glass of gin, which I took him; he skimmed some of the froth off with his hand, and said it was very strong, and they ought to brew it all like that; he asked me how much I gave for a but of other beer, I could not say exactly, I told him near six pounds; he said that they sold that for nine pounds in about three months time; that was nearly all that passed at that time. We went into the bar, I asked him how much I was to pay him, he said four pounds; I told him that I understood that one barrel was to be only one pound, why was I to give him four for the three, he said I must give him a seven shilling piece then, or else he should be out of pocket. After I had gave him the three pound and the seven shilling piece, he asked me to give him change of a one pound note, which I did, supposing that he wanted change to divide it; I asked him how many there was, he said only three. He went away for some time, and then called again for half a pint of gin, and then he asked me to change him a one pound note, which I did. There were two came first in the morning, which I forgot to mention.</p>

               <p>Bowser called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On Saturday the 21st of February, I missed three birds and the cages out of my tap room; these are the three cages and the three birds, (witness producing them).

               <p>Q. Did you miss them all at one time. - A. I did not; I missed the goldfinch first, about twelve I missed my linnet, and then looked round and missed my chaffinch. From information I received, I went in pursuit of them, I met the prisoner in Finsbury square, he had two handkerchiefs tied up with the cages, and the birds in them; I got the handkerchiefs off, and I saw they were my three birds and my three cages, each bird was in its own cage; I am sure they are my birds and my cages.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the cages. - A. Three shillings.</p>

            . - Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes. On a Saturday, I cannot recollect the day of the month, the prisoner called upon me with a chaffinch and a linnet in cages, they were tied up in a handkerchief, he told me he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080008"/> given fifteen shillings for them; he told me that he had got a very good goldfinch, he would fetch it for me to look at, and he had given a guinea for that; he went and fetched it, and asked me what I thought they were worth; I told him I could not tell him. He left the birds in my room about ten minutes, and then he came and took them away; I had a suspicion that the chaffice belonged to Mr. Hagger, I went to him, and asked him if he had sold it, he told me no; I told him I had that bird and a linnet, and a goldfinch brought to my house by the prisoner; we pursued the prisoner, and overtook him in Finsbury square with three birds, and three cages that I had seen before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 12th of January did he give you any order. - A. It was on a Monday; I cannot say as to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he was taken up. - A. I believe it was nine or ten days before he was taken up. He gave me an order to draw ten quarters of beans to Mr. Keeps; in consequence of that order I put them into sacks into Mr. Brickwood's storehouse; then we loaded them in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sacks were there. - A. Twenty sacks. I drew them to the <placeName id="t18070408-12-crimeloc68">New Cut windmill, Blackfriar's-road</placeName>

               <p>Q. In the month of January last you had a considerable quantity of beans in your granary. - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had made this discovery, did you endeavour to ascertain what quantity was deficient. - A. I did; the whole of my deficiency I cannot speak to; I am certain of above forty quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of a quarter. - A. Forty shillings a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner and Keep were examined at the office. - A. I was. I can swear that this was the paper that was given by Keep himself to the magistrate; I have no doubt of its being the prisoner's hand-writing; I have seen him write several times.</p>
               <p>Q. When the corn is delivered out of your granary, is it usual to give written bills. - A. I have met with instances where there have not been any printed bills ready at hand; but the foreman never fills up notes. They are filled up by the clerk or myself. (The note read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the business of the prisoner as your foreman, to send out any corn without your knowledge, or the clerk's. - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whenever he sends out any corn, is it the custom to make any entry in the book. - A. It is his duty to enter it in the delivery book; the clerk usually fills up the notes, and enters it in another book, and that is a check to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any entry on the 12th of January, of beans sent to Mr. Keep, New Cut windmill. - A. There is no such entry in the whole book; I never knew any thing of him till after the discovery of this transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you are able to ascertain any loss of your sacks. - A. Not particularly; I saw nine sacks produced at the office with my name on them; there were twenty brought, in which the beans went in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Have you any partners. - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to state to my friend, that these bills of sale are usually printed. - A. The tickets that are sent by the carman are usually printed</p>

               <p>Q. And sometimes I understand that they are not. - A. There may have been twice in seven years, if the clerk had not any bills at hand, that he has wrote them. I had but one clerk then, and he was at the Corn-exchange with me; it was impossible for him to have wrote it, and every foreman is positively ordered not to deliver any goods without an order from me or the clerk.</p>

On his return home he was to bring hay; he returned on the 14th about half past nine; he said he had been at work in the field for Mr. Gosling till past six, and that made him so late home; I asked him how many trusses he had brought; he told me eighteen trusses, and he had left it in the cart; he was to come at eight o'clock in the morning to put it in the loft; at eight o'clock the next morning I found the cart there and the hay, but there was not the quantity that I expected; when he came I told him there was but thirteen trusses; he told me there was eighteen, he said the horses had eat some in the night; I said they could not eat five trusses; there might be with what the horses had eat, and what was loose, another truss; reckoning that there might be fourteen trusses in all. I asked him what he had done with the other, he said he had not done nothing with it. I sent for an officer; during the time the officer came, the foreman told him he had better tell me what he had done with the hay, and I might be a friend to him. I told him if he would tell me who he had sold the hay to, I would be a friend to him. In consequence he was put in the custody of an officer; and we went and found the hay at the Leg of Mutton and Trimmings public house, Kingsland-road.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you find there. - A. Six trusses altogether and four of them were like mine; the other two might be outside trusses.</p>

On Sunday the 15th of March, Ward was brought to my house about this hay; I sent for Mr. Mason, another officer, and left Ward at my house; I went and took Latter, and brought him to my house; he there said in the presence of Ward that Ward had left some hay for some money that he owed him; I think he mentioned six or seven shillings. I found six trusses, four of which Mr. Arnold believed to be his, which he took away.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of what passed, did you think it necessary to follow them - A. Yes, and before they got out of St. Paul's church yard, they were joined by a woman who was standing outside, I followed them as far as a dozen doors down Cheapside, they then stopped and held a parley. I passed them and went on the opposite side of the way to see what they would be after; just as I got across they parted, and the two that was in my shop went into Mr. Giesler's the furrier. I crossed over and passed the shop, and the third person was looking in the shop door. I immediately ran home, put on my great coat and a silk handkerchief round my neck, because they should not know me; when I returned to Mr. Giesler's shop, I found the third person was still standing there; the prisoner and another woman was in the shop, and just as I crossed over the third person opened the door and went in. I immediately crossed again and took her station and looked in the shop, I saw the prisoner at the bar sitting on a stool, the others were standing up. I immediately saw her stoop down and pull up her petticoats as high as her knee, and apparently put something up her petticoats, but I could not see what; she then pulled off her patten and put it on the counter, and attempted to tie it; I thought I see her put something up again; she then stood up and they came out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. All three. - A. No; the prisoner and another woman; when they came out of the shop, I fell back towards St. Paul's church yard, I followed them but a few steps before I saw the end of the tippet hanging down between her legs, I ran after her and caught hold of it and pulled it down, and down came another along with it. I immediately got hold of her arm, I said you have stole the tippets. I called to several gentlemen going past to stop the other person, they did not, I took her into Mr. Giesler's shop. I shewed them the tippets, I marked them and delivered them to the constable.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the window glass all whole. - A. I have a number of windows cracked but no glass was out.</p>

I heard something in the shop, I had no apprehension it was any body at the window, I heard a ratling of glass, I imagined at the time it was the cat, for we use glass in our business, and I thought the cat had got upon the man's seat in the shop. I sleep in the back room adjoining the shop; about one o'clock the watchman knocked at my door; I got up, the watchman said I had been robbed, he told me I must come to the watchhouse; when I had got a light I saw I had lost five pair and one shoe, and an odd child's boot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive what state the windows was in at that time. - A. The shutter was down, I perceived a pane of glass out. The shoes were all lost from the spot where the window was broken. I went to the watchhouse, I saw the the two prisoners at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any shoes that were lost. - A. I saw them at Worship street. On the next morning a young man came to my house and said he had found some shoes. I went up to his house and saw the shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair of shoes did you see. - A. Four pair with the half boot, I saw them again at the office, I know they are mine, I cut them out. I lost six pair in the whole with the half boot, I have the fellow to that at home, there was but four pair found.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know where the prosecutrix lives. - A. Yes, my box is between thirty and forty yards from her shop. On the 25th of February, about twenty minutes to one o'clock, I perceived two men at Mrs. Welldon's window, the moon shone very bright at the time, I perceived one of these men stoop; in the course of a minute afterwards I heard some glass crack. I got out of my box, and when I got within ten or a dozen yards of the men they run away, I ran after them, they separated, I catched hold of Purdon, he stopped suddenly, and when I laid hold of him he asked me what was the matter, I told him nothing particular. I led him to the watchhouse; bringing him along I perceived Taylor come out of the willow walk. I am sure he was one of the men that I saw at the window, he had gaiters on.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had lost sight of him. - A. I had, but I had not lost sight of Purdon. Taylor came to me while I was taking Purdon round Old street corner, he shammed very drunk; we perceived him sober when he came to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What symptoms did he show to you that he was drunk. - A. He staggered and run against me and asked me what I was going to do with that man. I called the other watchman to lay hold of him. I told him he must go to the watchhouse; when I came back I see one of the shutters down, and the pane of glass was broke large enough to put a man's head in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. How long have you been a watchman. - A. Six years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been a witness here before. - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. In a case of burglary. - A. Yes, I was here once in a case of burglary.</p>
               <p>Q. If these men are convicted you know there is a reward. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath do you mean to swear that you did not know there is a forty pound reward upon the conviction of these men. - A I know it now.</p>

My lord, I pledged the blanket, I owed Mrs. Fisher one weeks rent, I told her I should pay her on the Thursday, I said to her I hoped it made no odds to her, she did not seem to say to the contrary. I carried out a bundle to pledge, I had to make up some money for a child out to nurse; when I came to the pawnbroker's they were shut up. When I returned, Mrs. Fisher had got two constables, she came up with the constable, she said you have pawned the blanket, I said I have. The sheets were out to wash, I sent them home to her, she found them secure, and since that I sent her the money for the rent; here is her hand writing for the rent (producing a paper.)</p>

             lives in the house. On the 1st of April, about a quarter before four in the evening, the prisoner came into the sale shop and asked to look at a watch that was in the window; having several watches in the window I asked him what kind of a one, he said one with a going fusee; knowing that we had but one of that kind in the shop, which was a gold chronometer, with a label fixed to it price forty-six pound, I took it out of the window, took the label off and put it on the counter. He pulled out of his fob pocket a little metal watch, &amp;c. then took up the gold chronometer, saying, I shall try this for a few days; he put it into his side pocket of his great coat. I thought he meaned to leave it with us to try it; he immediately went off with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he give you his directions. - A. No, not knowing the prisoner I followed him, and within ten or twelve yards I came up to him; I then brought him back with the watch in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. What said he to you when you came up to him. - A. I said it is a strange thing taking away a watch of this value. He repeated the words that he should try it for a few days and then return it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you who he was. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce the watch to you. - A. Yes, directly I brought him back to the shop he took it out of his pocket.</p>

I asked him again what he meant by taking such a watch; he was very sullen, he said what is that to you; I told him for his impertinence I should make an example of him, otherwise I did not wish to punish him. I sent the boy for a constable, he returned and said there was no one could be found; upon hearing that he walked to the door, he said he should go out, he should not be detained. I said he should not go out, he knocked down some books and a glass worth five guineas, at last we secured him and took him to Hatton-garden; he behaved in the same riotous manner fighting and quarreling there.</p>

            . - Mr. Curwood. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes, the prisoner at the bar has worked for me and my father four or five years; he always bore the character of a very sober and honest man; for the last six or eight years he has been very strange.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of opinion that he is lately deranged. - A. I am fully persuaded of it. I have lately been obliged to get him out of the office by stratagem, and twice by force.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of derangement had you observed. - A. In his manner of doing his work, and particularly in his manner of talking. A week or two ago he got in some uproar and was put in the compter; when he came out he said he should enter an action against them and get twenty or thirty pounds, and he would purchase a watch and become a gentleman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you express that you meant to give her sixpence. - A. Yes; having no sixpence in my pocket, I told her I would give her a shilling if she could give me a sixpence, and in putting the sixpence into my pocket which she gave me, I found the rest of my money was missing. I charged her with stealing it.</p>

               <p>Q. You missed all of them. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you put the sixpence in your pocket you charged her with it. - A. Yes, and she denied it. I told her if she would give me up the money I would not charge the watch with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it her by way of charity. - A. Yes. She begged that I would not charge the watch with her. I told her I must if she did not give it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge the watch with her. - A. I did. We took her to the watchhouse; she was stripped and her clothes looked over, but nothing was found in her clothes. I saw her hand clenched, I laid hold of it, I gave it into the constable's hands that keeps the watchhouse; and before he opened her hand I described the money to him, that two of the half guineas were of the old coin and one of the new die; and upon his opening of her hand he found it correct, as I had stated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards make any search for the note. - Q. Yes, I went back, and with the assistance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080016"/> of two watchmen's lights. I picked up the one pound note, near about the place where we had been standing.</p>

               <p>Q. You searched her did you. - A. Yes, we found nothing about her clothes; I had her there so often, I was sure I should not find any thing about her clothes; before I opened her hand the prosecutor told me that two of the half guineas were of the old coin, and one of the new die; she had it in her left hand clenched; she swore solemnly she had nothing in her hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man picked me up in the street, he took me down a gateway, and gave me sixpence; I pulled out my handkerchief, I heard something fall, I stooped and picked up something, not knowing whether it came out of my pocket on his; a little while afterwards he told me I had robbed him. In taking me to the watchhouse he said he would forgive me, and say nothing about it if I would give it him. I did not, I was taken to the watchhouse, they searched me in a very indecent manner; and when I found it did not belong to me, I gave it up every farthing to the constable.</p>
               <p>Howell. She denied having it. I had hard work to break her hand open.</p>

On Sunday the 8th of March, I went out about eight o'clock to take a walk; I returned back about eleven, and at two I went up stairs to clean myself. I found my things out of the box; I missed a new shirt, a pair of stockings, and a tool called a jigger. I turned round and looked over Statham's seat, I found his tools were gone, and his seat was covered over with a coat. I went down stairs and told Mr. Wiggins, my master; he and I went in pursuit after him, we met him at the Bell near Barnett-gate; he had a bundle in his possession. I challenged him with stealing my shirt and stockings, he said he was sorry that he had taken them, but they were safe in his bundle. I was not satisfied, he shewed me them; we brought him back and delivered him to the constable.</p>

opening the coach, I found myself run against the arm; I looked round, I saw the prisoner whom I thought was a little intoxicated, he went on in a hurry; I stepped a little back and let him pass. I saw him after he passed me, he mended his pace; I overtook him at the London assurance company. I stepped forward, I said you have robbed me, laying my hand upon him, I saw at that time a handkerchief in his right hand. He knocked or pushed me down, I came to the ground, and my hat fell off; the moment he knocked me down I saw my handkerchief go away; and the man run off. I said immediately stop thief, I got up and ran after him; he was taken in Threadneedle-street. When I came up to him, I said you are the man that robbed me; he cried he knew nothing about it, that he was not capable of robbing. We took him back to the place where I had talked to the coachman. We sent for an officer and took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the handkerchief. - A. It is in the hands of the officer. I am certain that he is the man that passed me at the coach, because he ran against me.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sober. - A I had been drinking, I was sober enough to know who took my bag away. I have known the prisoner this twelve years. He wanted to buy a cart, he wanted to borrow three guineas of me, I pulled out my bag and laid it on the table, I promised him he should have three pound or three guineas; he looked at the bag, took it up and went away. I staid there some time and then I went after him, I did not think he was going to rob me of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you remain in the public-house. A. I suppose the best part of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew where his wife lived. - A. Yes; I made the best of my way to where his wife lived, in Pye-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his wife at home. - A. I did not go to his lodgings; I went to a public house that he used, and enquired for him; I staid there some time, and when he came home I asked him for it; he denied it, and said he had not got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your money again. - A. No; there was some part of it found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the two pound notes and the one pound notes. - A. No, none of the notes; there was fourteen pounds in notes; there was fifty-three pounds fifteen shillings in all.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I have got the purse and some part of the money here. On the 20th of March in the evening I was sent for to a public house in Pye-street, Westminster, where I found the prisoner Bland and Piety, and a man of the name of Evans. Piety told me of his loss, and gave charge both of Evans and Bland. I conveyed them both to the watchhouse; I searched Bland; I found a half crown and a few halfpence; he told me that was all the money he had in the world; he refused to tell me where his lodgings were when I asked him, and said his stable was in 
Tothil fields. I went and found them both within an hundred yards. I searched them both and found nothing there. On the Monday following, at the office, I saw Mr. Cope's man give the prisoner half a guinea; I learned that some money was left at Mr. Cope's, a liquor shop, just by Newgate market. I went there and found thirteen guineas and a half.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Cope, he keeps a liquor shop in Newgate-market. On the 20th of March the prisoner came into my master's shop between the hours of six and seven in the evening; he asked if Mr. Cope was at home, I told him no; he said he wanted to leave a little money with him, I told him he might leave it with me, I would take care of it. He left with me thirteen guineas and a half; that is the bag and the same money.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) Is that your bag. - A. I believe it is, there was a string in then; this is what the gold was in; there was another bag larger than this, that had the notes in, and this bag was inside of that.</p>


               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That is my bag what I put my silver and what I took in, I have had it two years. I left thirteen guineas and a half at Mr. Cope's, because I was drunk; I left it for safety.

The next morning I found him in the stable, cleaning one of my horses; I said to Mr. Dean it is very odd who took my coat, the prisoner looked very much confused, I taxed him and another about it; I asked him where he lodged, he said at first in Pall-mall, but he did not know the name nor the number, and then he said he lodged in Titchfield-street. I told them I would take them to Marlborough-street and put them upon their oaths, and make them swear whether they knew any thing or not of the coat; then I went to breakfast. I left word with two men in the yard not to let him go to breakfast without watching him; a man that is here watched him and brought him back with the coat. He came up to me and said, coachman, I did take your coat, but I hope you will not hurt me; I told him no, I would not, I would give him what the law would allow him.</p>

               <p>Q. Are there any other lodgers in the house besides you. - A. Only one. On the 30th of March, I went out about half past three in the afternoon, I left my door locked, and my shutters bolted; I returned home about half past twelve; I found my door on the latch. I alarmed my landlord, and the first thing I missed was a basket, containing two bed quilts, and a blanket was taken away, and a straw bonnet, four gowns, four aprons, five petticoats, several napkins, and several towels; my landlord and me looked about the door, we found a child's spencer of mine in the saw-pit, opposite my door. We found a few piece of muslin, which is my property. The next day there was a child's petticoat produced at the office Worship-street, which I prove to be mine; it belonged to one of the children. They got in at the window and went out at the door; they had drawn the nails from the bolts of the window.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you on the evening of the 30th of March, and at what what time, hear any noise. - A. Being an ailing man, I went to bed about eight o'clock; between eight and nine I heard a rumbling below stairs, like a drawing of boxes; I had been in the house all the afternoon, I heard no noise before; I can hear the mangle go in that room; I heard the street door shut as I laid in bed, after the rumbling noise was over, which was about ten minutes. About one o'clock my landlord came up and asked me if I had heard any noise; I told him I had heard a noise; I at the time supposed the woman was about her ordinary business.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street, Harding was brought to the office in Worship-street. On Tuesday morning the 31st of March, by Armstrong, Bishop, and Kennedy, I understood he had been in Shoreditch watchhouse, and he had secreted a child's skirt in the privy; I went with Bishop, and Bishop took the child's skirt out of the privy. The prosecutrix swore to it before the magistrate.</p>

            . On Monday night the 30th of March, I went out in company with Armstrong and Kennedy. About half after twelve o'clock we met the prisoner in company with two other men; knowing him, we secured him and took him to Shoreditch watch-house. I searched the prisoner Harding; in his hat I found a small child's black skirt; he said it was his own; he put it in his hat; the hat having no lining to keep it from coming over his eyes, believing his story, I returned it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him by name and person. - A. I did; I heard of this robbery about four o'clock in the morning; we kept Harding in the cage all night. In the morning we took him before the magistrate, and among other articles that were lost, this black petticoat was mentioned; I then asked Harding what he had done with the black petticoat that he had in his hat the night before; he said he had thrown it down the watch-house privy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he assign any reason why he had done so. - A. No.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home about half after twelve o'clock; I was stopped by three of the officers and taken to the watchhouse. Bishop searched me, and left the petticoat in my hat; I was put in the cage, it was very wet and dirty; in the cage a man had been sick there. In the course of the night I fell asleep on the bench, my hat felt off, I would not put it in my hat again, it was very wet. The next day, when I was taken to the office, they asked me where the black petticoat was that I had in my hat; I directly told him where it was. I have two of the same yellow strings, and two or three of the same black pieces of stuff; my sister is here that made the petticoat.</p>
               <p>- HARDING. Q. Are you the prisoner's sister. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make this petticoat. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the petticoat before you see it. - A. It is bombazeen, with a narrow hem at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen it since your brother has been taken up. - A. No, I have not; it has yellow strings to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080019"/> it. I made it nine weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have examined it before; I am sure it is my property.</p>
               <p>Jury. The stuff which the prisoner has produced and the skirt appear to be very similar, and there is no doubt but the strings he has produced are of the same piece of goods as the strings on the petticoat.</p>

I saw two men run by my box, I followed them across the quarters, he run round the quarters into the Broker-row and into Wilson-street; I called out stop thief, he was stopped by two gentlemen, I was close behind, I took hold of him by the collar. I am sure it is the same man, I never had him out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him. - A. No, we put him in the watchhouse, and we went to Sash court, where we saw him run out; there we saw this quantity of lead laying on the dunghill.</p>

I am a watchman; at two o'clock in the morning I heard a noise of something scratching against the bricks, I walked towards where the sound was, and coming towards the corner of the alley the prisoner walked out, as I believe him to be the man, I did not see his face, with his hands in his pockets. he walked towards the quarters. I asked the other man that came out what they were doing there, he made answer that they were making water. I had suspicion that they were after no good; I went to shift the lanthorn into my other hand to catch him, in the mean time they made their escape; he run across the street to the quarters and went towards Bedlam wall. I lost sight of this man and the other both.</p>

I went up stairs into the ware-room, and brought some down; he asked Mr. Cogger the price of them, he said nine-pence each; he took the list from under the counter, he told him he should have them for eight-pence halfpenny each; he desired me to match six, I did, I asked him if I should do them up in a parcel for him, he said yes; I heard him ask Mr. Cogger if it made any difference if he paid him in halfpence, Mr. Cogger said no; then he went away from the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him produce any bag. - A. I saw a bag, I did not see what was in it. I observed his hands over the counter where the salts was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the salts at this time. - A. No, I did in the morning when I dusted the counter. When he went away, Cogger desired me to run after him; nearly as soon as he had shut the door I opened the door, I saw him he was crossing the road as fast as he could. I run after him, he is lame I believe, he hopped a little. I laid my hands upon him on the pavement, the other side of the way; he turned himself round close to the area rails of Mr. Bankes house; our shop is directly opposite Round court, in the Strand; Mr. Bankes is six or seven doors from Round-court.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him close to the railings, did you see him do any thing. - A. His back was close to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080021"/> railings; Cogger came up directly, and he was taken back to the shop. The constable searched him, the salt was not found on him. Mr Cogger desired me to search in the direction he had gone; I did so, I found nothing. I knocked at Mr. Banke's door, I went in the kitchen, I opened the window. Mrs. Bankes lent me a candle, I found the salt at the bottom of the arae where he stood with his back. I brought the salt back and gave it to Mr. Cogger.</p>

             has the first floor in my house. On the 25th of Februray, between seven and eight in the evening, I was alarmed by my servant, as I was sitting in my parlour. On the prosecutrix going out, she requested my servant to attend her fire, and on my servant going into the room, she came down and told me that she saw a man in the room. I proceeded to the lodger's apartment, I found nobody in the room; on returning down stairs again a person knocked at the door, and informed me that some body had escaped from the window; and by the directions I pursued him, and took him by Portland chapel; he was then standing by the side of a house, he was pointed to me, he had no coat on; I gave him in charge of a watchman. When I returned home, I found a glass tumbler outside of the door broken, and several small cakes laying by the side of it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a considerable way from your house where you laid hold of him. - A. Yes, near a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the parlour before you received the alarm. - A. An hour at the least.</p>

            . What are you. - A. I am an apprentice to Mr. Clark, brush maker in Charlton-street. On the 25th of February, about half past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw a man without a coat on, coming out of the first floor window of Mr. Prior's house; he got from the first floor window to the lid of the door, and then he dropped into the street; he ran down the next turning, and I after him; he came back again to the house, within a few doors, he leaned on a post, I went and informed Mr. Prior; I knocked at the door and called out, and then the man ran away; I went first after him, and Mr. Prior followed; he ran into George-street, Portland chapel; and then he stood at the corner of a public house. Mr. Prior charged the watch with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that the person Mr. Prior laid hold of, was the same man that you had seen come out of the window. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any thing of any glass at any time. - A. When I came back from the watch-house not before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when the man came out of the window you did not see him throw any thing down. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor hear any glass break. - A. No, Mr. Prior picked up the bits of glass from the step of the door when we came back.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prior) This lad has told us that you picked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080022"/> up some broken glass. - A. I did, when I returned from the watchhouse I produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutrix) You cannot speak to the glass. - A. I cannot; only my tumbler had a foot to it, and this has a foot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am an innocent man. Before the magistrate the prosecutrix only valued the tumbler at sixpence, so I was to be tried at Hicks'-hall. They made a burglary of it yesterday and brought me here.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 28th of March did you find the prisoner there. - A. Yes. Mr. Burridge charged the prisoner with stealing three pieces of some mahogany belonging to Mr. Ayres. The prisoner denied it at first, but afterwards he owned to taking one piece; the prisoner said if I would go with him to a baker's just by, he would shew me that piece, which he did; it was under the baker's dough through. I took it back to his master's. I then asked him where the other two pieces were; he said he had taken them to No. 10, Caroline-court, Saffron-hill; I went there and found fourteen pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner acknowledge that he had taken them there. - A. Yes; and the man in whose place it was found said he had brought that wood there. The prisoner said he took it out of his master's yard.</p>

               <p>Q. What money had you. - A. Two one pound notes, a half guinea, and a seven shilling piece. I wound my silver watch up, and put it and the money in a silk handkerchief together. I left it under the bin of a four-stall stable in Nag's-head yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cover it over under this bin. - A. No further than pushing it under the bin; there were three horses in this stable that I had put in when I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock this stable door. - A. No, there was no lock to the door; I left the watch and money there a little before two o'clock; I returned to the stable about five o'clock, it was gone; I asked Cave if he had been in the stable, he said no.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you heard any thing of it. - A. Nearly two months; I saw it first at Dunstable in Bedfordshire; Cave was down there. He wrote to me he had suspicion my watch was there in the prisoner's custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before. - A. Yes;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080023"/> he had been accustomed to sleep in the stables, or in the lofts in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. On this information of Cave's you went down to Dunstable. - A. Yes; I heard the watch had been to a watchmaker at Dunstable, and by the description the watchmaker gave me, I got a constable and took up the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was at Dunstable. - A. Yes. I sent Cave first to the prisoner; he came; I told him I had lost my watch and money, I told him I thought he had got it; he said he had not, but he knew who had got it, it was not far off, he would shew me where it was; he took me to the landlady of the Saracen's-head, Dunstable; it was in her possession; he asked the landlady for his watch, she gave it into his hand, and he delivered it to me; he told me it was mine, I might take it, he had bought it of a girl for fifteen shillings.</p>

            . Q. You drove with this lad on the 14th of August. - A. Yes, we returned about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his putting by his money and watch in the way he has stated. - A. Yes, he wrapped it up in a handkerchief, and put it under the bin; the next morning he came into my stable and asked me if I had been in his stable; I said no. The next morning he made it known to his master; and he laid it to my charge; my master had us all searched, and nothing was found on any body.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay with your master after that. - A. Very near two months; then I went to Dunstable. I heard the prisoner was there; I asked a friend of his if he had ever seen him with a watch; I learned the watch had been to a watchmaker's there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask that question. - A. Because a person had said he came into the country with a good watch; it struck me it might be this watch, as he had worked in the yard, and after that he had liberty from the master to sleep in the yard. I wrote to Medes, and he came down and claimed the watch</p>

To the Monday he was taken up, he had not left my house.</p>

No; he was taken up in the city on Saturday the 21st of March, and two officers came with him to my house; they called me up stairs, and asked me if any thing was missing from the bed. I went up in the room and missed a sheet from the bed where the prisoner had slept. The officer ordered me to attend on Wednesday at the mansion house.</p>

            . I am a city officer. I had the prisoner in custody upon another charge; on Saturday the 21st of March he was examined before the lord-mayor, and I was ordered to take him to the other end of the town to see if I could find the property.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean the property of this woman. - A. No; before I took him to the other end of the town I searched him; I found this duplicate in his breeches fob; I asked him what sheet it was, he told me it was the sheet of the bed where he lodged, at No. 5, Prince's-court, Drury-lane. He had a key in his pocket which he said was the key of his room; I took the key from him. Sherry and I and the prisoner went up to the lodging; after we were in his room I sent for Mrs. Martin to come up; when she came up, I desired her to look round the room to see if she had lost any thing; she missed the sheet from the bed. I told her the prisoner was remanded for examination on the next Wednesday at the mansion house, and requested her to attend. We came from there and went to the pawnbroker's; I asked the young man in the shop if he knew the prisoner; he said he did. I produced the duplicate, I desired him to produce the sheet at the mansion house on the Wednesday following. He appeared there with the sheet, and the prosecutrix identified it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Martin observed to you if you would give her the ticket, she did not want to go to the mansion house, she did not think I was the person to wrong her of the sheet.</p>
               <p>Leadbetter. The prisoner said he had some crockery in the room that would satisfy Mrs. Martin for the sheet; Mrs. Martin seemed inclined to be favourable to the prisoner; she did not wish to go to further trouble.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (read in court) My lord, having an impediment in my speech, which makes it out of my power to address the court, I hope your lordship will excuse these few lines; my case is as follows: - On or about August last, I went to Mr. Loader to work, my shopmate asked me to lodge with him; I did so, at eighteen pence a week. On Saturday night following my master paid me my wages, and discharged me. My prosecutor and I went home together, from whence the prosecutor, his wife and I, went out to take a walk together, as far as Smithfield; I met a shopmate of mine, who told me where I might get work: I told him I should not stay with him, and that I would leave my shirt and stockings, which would be a security to him for what I owed him. I went with my shopmate to Hertfordshire, and got work there. In January last I got work in Little Moorfields, where I was apprehended. The prosecutor came to Newgate and told me the bill was thrown out; he treated me; I sent all my friends away yesterday.</p>

Last Thursday week I suspected the prisoners, I laid wait for them, I placed my boy below in the cellar; I then went up stairs as though I intended to go out, but I placed myself in the shop; I saw the mother and the daughter come down with a candle; they opened the cellar door and went down into the cellar; about five minutes afterwards I see the daughter come up with a bag full of potatoes; I followed her, and had just time to touch the mother as she emptied out a lap full of large coals; I called the lad out of his hiding place, and sent him for a constable. The mother was filling her apron with the coals that were in the cellar; I found her emptying them out when she heard me. The officer went up stairs and found a large bag of potatoes and coals, I could not swear to them; I am partly sure they are mine. These are the potatoes I took from her in the passage</p>

The mother began to fill her apron with large coals; Mr. Higgins came down stairs, and when she saw him, she chucked the coals out of her apron.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there nothing about the fire place. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she given you any account about the fire place. - A. When we were going to the magistrate she said there were two guineas and two half guineas in the fire place; we searched the fire place, and found nothing there.</p>

               <p>Q. Being applied to by Owen, did you go to the house where he lodged. - A. I did; it is in the parish of Twickenham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her pockets. - A. I did; I found six shillings, which she declared was her husband's.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any gold nor a pocket book. A. No; I searched the room, and found nothing at all. I saw her put her hand to her head; I thought there was something in it; I took her bonnet off, I searched the back part of her head, and in her hair I found the pocket book with the money and watch. The magistrate sealed it up; it has been in my possession ever since. When the prisoner went to bed the husband searched his wife along with Owen, he searched all her clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing taken out of her pocket. - A. I saw a glove in his hand, I saw one guinea and two half guineas taken out of it; this money was found after she had been to the magistrate. I produce the property.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) Is that your pocket book. - A. Yes, it contained the note and my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at, the note can you at all tell whether that was your note. - A. I cannot, I can only say I had a one pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. The money you cannot tell. - A. No, there is eight guineas and two dollars; the watch is mine; I know it by the the inside case not fastening too; I have had it a twelve month. I know the chain and seals. It is a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q Where is the money that was found in the glove. - A. In my pocket, all but half a guinea; I was out of money.</p>
               <p>Q. What watchmaker's hands had your watch been in before this time. - A. Mr. Howard of Brentford, about three months before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it come back with the case not fastening as it is now. - A. Yes, it was so when I took it him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in your house. - A. Yes, she lived in another apartment. On the 14th of March about two o'clock in the afternoon, I went out to work I saw the shirt before I went out in the bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house do you occupy. - A. Two rooms on the ground floor. The farthings were on the dresser in a pot; there was forty three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your wife at home when you went out. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock your door. - A. I do not think that I did. I returned about five, and I missed the key from the door; I went across my room, I saw my chest lid was open; my wife came home, she missed a sheet from the chest; I missed the shirt from the bed-room. I examined the pot, I found all the farthings were gone. On Tuesday morning after the sheet and shirt were found at the pawnbroker's, I charged the prisoner with it; I took her to the pawnbroker's he said she was the person that pledged them.</p>
               <p>MRS. ABBOT. Q. You are the wife of the last witness. - A. Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080027"/> Q. Were you at home on Saturday the 14th of March, when these things were lost. - A. I was not; when I came home I looked in the chest, and there was a sheet taken out of it; the chest was not locked, I had put the sheet in the chest on the Sunday before. My husband counted the farthings the night before, there were forty three; when I came home there were none left in the pot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When Mrs. Abbot told me she had lost these things, I said, do not be too sure; Mrs Abbot said she had lost her husband's silk handkerchief and he knows no other to this day; she told me she had got the money for it.</p>

               <p>Q. What was his situation. - A. Cleaning knives and running of errands.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether any thing attracted your notice of this boy. - A. I perceived him have a watch and a broach.</p>
               <p>Court. What age is the prisoner. - A. About fourteen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. When you first observed them things, did you ask him any questions. - A. Yes, I asked him how he got his watch; he said his father gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his father. - A. A soldier in the guards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the father employed by you. - A. Now and then occasionally; when he said his father gave it him it struck me not very likely that his father should give him the watch, as he had complained to me that his father always used him very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you placed this ten pound note. - A. In a desk in a back room about three weeks ago; I always kept it locked.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first discovered that you had lost your bank note, was it locked. - A. Yes, the lock was injured.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you inattentive to your keys and leave them about - A. Yes, I often do.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost also a seal. - A. Yes, which I prized very much. I had left it on the mantle piece.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never seen it again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have never seen your bank note again. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did the noise come from. - A. From Leman-street, the corner of Prescott-street; I says to the prisoner, let us go and see what is the matter; we both went up and endeavoured to make peace, if we could.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up how many persons did you find, and who was there. - A. I found six, and the deceased made seven; the deceased was then fighting. We told them to disperse As soon as we said that the deceased fell on the patrol, and struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a blow was it. - A. I do not know; the deceased fell down upon the prisoner. I laid hold of the deceased by the coat, and pulled him from the patrol. I said to the prisoner, we will take him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. That is take the deceased. - A. Yes, he struggled and said he would not go to the watchhouse; we came together so far as the middle of <placeName id="t18070408-45-crimeloc266">Little Ayliffe-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. The deceased then struck the patrol. - A. Yes, with that the patrol made a blow, and struck the deceased over the head; then we took the deceased to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he strike him with. - A. The hilt of his sword; the sword had the scabbard on, and the blade part was in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where it struck him. - A. On the side of his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a violent blow. - A. Not so violent as I saw; upon the deceased receiving the blow he fell on the ground, we took him up and set him on the step of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the man get up without you had picked him up. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he appear. - A. He was in liquor, and with the stun of the blow he appeared very much affected, he was conducted to the watchhouse, and afterwards to the hospital the same night, shortly after.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge how long he lived. - A. I believe about nine days.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. The deceased struck the prisoner a blow on the side of the head, then momentary, he having a sword in his hand, struck the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080028"/> deceased. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any threats of using force. - A. The deceased's friends insisted upon his not going to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you as if the prisoner had not used force, the deceased would have been rescued. - A. I make no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to the blow, the sword had a nob on the handle, which part unfortunately gave the blow and was the cause of his death. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the effect of the blow the prisoner received, was not his head cut. - A. It was; there was some blood came from the blow he received.</p>

On Monday Mrs. Johnson came and described them, they were brought down to her, she owned them, paid me the money and took them; in the evening the prisoner Swinney was examined at Shadwell office; the two curtains were produced at the office, which I believe to be the same Mrs. Johnson redeemed; I put a mark on them at the office.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you feel it go away. - A. No, I did not feel her take it out. I ran after her but could not see her that night. On the 14th of March I came up from Queen-square, Bloomsbury, and waited there at Dover-street two hours before I saw her; I happened with her at ten at night, and then I charged the watch with her.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of March were you unwell at any time in that month. - A. I was very ill the latter part of last March; I was taken ill the middle of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in the house. - A. He is a married man, he lodged at the Plough in Crown street, near Soho-square; I lived in the house with my young masters.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when you was ill the prisoner at the bar coming to you about any thing belonging to your master. - A. Yes, it was a Sunday morning we got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Got what. - A. A bottle of brandy, I cannot recollect the day of the month; I got up that morning very ill indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come in the morning. - A. Betwixt six and seven o'clock, he came to my master's house, he said to me he wanted some brandy; accordingly I had a key that would undo this desk in the accompting house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he before that day know that you had a key of that desk. - A. Yes; after he said he wanted some bandy, I unlocked the desk, and took out the key of the brandy cellar; the prisoner took a stone bottle from the warehouse; we opened the brandy cellar and filled the bottle with three gallons of brandy. The prisoner took it up stairs, and went home with it to his lodgings. We put the key in the desk again and locked the desk up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the key from that you opened the desk. - A. That key I found in the bottom drawer in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Q. How came he to ask you to get some brandy, how did he know that you had the key. - A. He knew before that I had the key, we had used it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of your masters at home that day. - A. Yes, both my young masters, but they were not up.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he took it home to his lodgings. - A. He told me so; I received one pound two and six-pence, as my share for the last brandy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I suppose sir, not one word of the story that you have been telling to day, did you tell your master till you were found out. - A. Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. I have the misfortune to speak low; I suppose not one word that you have told to day, did you tell your master till you were found out, and threatened to be prosecuted. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You stole a key three weeks after you had been with your master, you found your way to the cellar where you stole frequently; and now you hope to be believed by the jury. - A. I should wish to speak nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You know by speaking the truth you keep yourself from being tried. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you shall be hanged. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Three months you have been in your master's service, and according to your own account you have been robbing him all the time. - A. Not all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a house at Cambridge. - A. Me and my wife left it; there was a captain hired me and my wife, and we went and lived with him.</p>

               <p>Q. This man is not to suffer for the sake of your saving your husband, upon your oath were not you turned out of the house in which the prisoner lodged, for your improper conduct with the captain. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived there about a fortnight. - A. Three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know the captain at Cambridge. - A. I have seen him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you threatened to be punished if you did not leave Cambridge, you and your husband. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So you went to that poor man's house to lodge, and now you come to swear that you saw him bring brandy in the house; he told you he had got brandy, you thought he stole it. - A. I supposed it.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you never tasted it. - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Stolen waters are sweet, and so is brandy too; you did not tell the master until the master took up your husband, and threatened to hang him. - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go up to the roof of the church to see how much was missing. - A. Yes, there was missing nine feet six inches in length, and nine feet over, was taken from the roof. I was upon the roof of the church in last October, it was safe then. I know no further than we missed it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you in October do any repairs to the church of Ryslip. - A. Yes, I was at work there two days in October. I repaired the lead work at the chancel end.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the roof entirely covered with lead. - A. On the 24th of February I saw it again, then I went to make some further repairs; as soon as I put the ladder up I saw some of the lead had been taken off the church; it appeared to me as if it had been cut with a knife, and that some had been ripped by a pair of pincers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lead that you saw on the church, that you saw and knew elsewhere. - A. Yes; on the 25th of February I went to Notting-hill, and saw the lead that the constable had the custody of.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking at the lead, was there any mark that you could know it was taken from Ryslip church. - A. Yes, I am certain of it; I should know it if it was in fifty pieces; I knew it by a damaged part, and it was about the quantity of lead that was taken from the church. I told the constable the admeasurement before I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. It had been fixed to the place. - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am constable of Kensington, near London. On the 21st of February, about four o'clock in the morning, I was called up by two men, they said they had detained a man with some lead at Notting-hill turnpike. I went there and took charge of the prisoner; the lead was in a cart. The prisoner said he had not stole the lead; first he said he had hired a horse and cart at Little Chelsea; he had been fourteen or fifteen miles down in the country, and found the lead on a dunghill. Then he said that he was hired, and that two men were to give him twenty-shillings on a job that was to bring away the lead, and that was the lead in the cart; but when they hired him, they said he was to bring furniture, but he did not know the men's names; one he called Sam and the other Joe. He said they were going to deliver it to a shop in Oxford-street. I asked him what shop, he said he did not know exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Notting-hill from Kensington. - A. About half a mile.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said it was not my lead, I told the constable that two men had got it planted in the dung; they went and got it and loaded the cart with it.</p>
               <p>Crib. He said there were two men, one Sam, and the other Joe; he did not know it was lead; he said if he had he would not have gone, and when he was there the men threatened him with his life if he did not put it in his cart, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what place they brought it from. - A. He said he went to Ealing, and went down the road a great many miles, and took it out of a dunghill.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever mention the lead to you before you looked in the cart. - A. No. I asked him how he came by it, he said he had been down in the country for it; but he did not know the place, he said he set off the night before, and Sam was then along with him; he said he was behind, travelling after the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080031"/> cart; I never saw him.</p>

            . I am a parish officer, I keep a sheep's head shop. On Saturday morning the 21st of March, about half after six, I saw the prisoner Markwell with a dozen of shovels, he had six in each hand; I saw him go into Brittain's old iron shop, <placeName id="t18070408-51-crimeloc305">No. 6, Peter's-lane, St. John-street, Clerkenwell</placeName>

I waited a quarter of an hour, I saw him come out without the shovels; I followed him to High Holborn, into a tool shop; when he came out I went in and made enquiry. I found he lodged at a shovel maker's in the Old-Bailey, and coming down Holborn I met Brittain with some shovels on his shoulder; they appeared to me to be the same shovels that I saw Markwell take to his house. I told him he must not sell these shovels, I had every reason to suspect they were stolen; he said, Tissiker if they are stolen, it is unknown to me, I have given a fair price for them, and there is no harm can come to me; he carried the shovels home. Going along, I asked him if he knew the man that he bought the shovels of; he told me he knew nothing of the man, but he had had dealings with him before. I went home with him, and three of the shovels that were marked with chalk I took to Mr. Haskins in the Old-Bailey; Mr. Haskins said they were his property. I then went and took Brittain in custody.</p>

               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Markwell left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>Brittain's Defence. I bought these shovels of this man; he said he was out of work, and he was employed to sell them any where he could get a customer; I thought I had a right to buy as well as any other person.</p>
               <p>Brittain called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I immediately went round the counter and detained him; in my going round the counter he took a handful of tobacco out of his pocket; some he put in the jar, some on the counter, and some he spilt on the ground; I said I would send for an officer; he immediately fell on his knees, and begged for mercy.</p>

On Monday the thirtieth of March, he was at my master's soap house surveying there; about twelve o'clock I saw him in the cutting room, in the soap house where the men cut the slabs; I left the cutting room and returned there again in about three or four minutes, the prisoner was in the stoke hole.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned to the cutting room, did you observe any thing. - A. I observed a pile of bars of soap which had three at the top, and there was one gone; I immediately informed my master. I afterwards saw a green bag, it was pointed out to me by Mr. Nowland; I watched that bag for an hour and a half, and then I saw the prisoner take up the bag and go off the premises with it. I saw him brought back to the accompting house.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. What is the name of your partner. - A. James, my father.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 30th of March you received information from your servant. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner go from your premises. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cause him to be brought back directly. - A. I did; he was brought into my accompting house, he had in his hand a green bag; I asked him if he had any objection to my searching the bag, he said he had not; this took place in the street. When I first stopped him I asked him what was in the bag, he said it was soap but not mine; this bag contained ten pieces; these are the pieces (the soap produced); that was not the particular quality of soap that we had on the premises, I was satisfied that it was not my property. I asked him where he had got it, he hesitated, and said if I would be kind with him he would inform me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Before he told you any thing in consequence of your questioning him, had not you told him there was an officer waiting ready to take him in custody. - A. I told him there was an officer ready to take him in custody, it was of no use to resist.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do not tell me what the prisoner said to you about accounting for the soap you produce; go on. - A. I told him he could expect nomercy of me as there were printed papers in the manufactory, stating if any person was detected they would be prosecuted; he said he had a large family. I said it was impossiable he could expect any favour of me; I asked where the soap was that he took from my cutting room in the morning; he said he had not got any soap of mine, nor he never robbed me; I told him I had strong reason to think a bar of soap had been gone that morning, and I must insist upon knowing where it was. At that moment I did not expect that he had the property about him, I thought he had hid it in the stoke hole; he still begged for mercy, I told him the officer was waiting for him; he then put his two hands into his pockets, and drew from each pocket a piece of soap, saying, that is the soap I took. (The soap produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Would these two pieces of soap make a complete bar. - A. They form a complete bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare that soap with the soap in the pile. - A. I did, it matched in complexion exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it being your property. - A. From all the circumstances, I can have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. The value is not above eighteen pence. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent for the police officer, he came and took him in custody. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you no other partner than your father. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose this is common mottle soap. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any other manufacturer could manufacture the same soap as you. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing to distinguish this soap from any other persons. - A. It is very dark, I very seldom have a boil so dark.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark to it. - A. There is no mark at all.</p>

            . I am a smith, I live opposite of Mr. Brown's shop. On the 25th of February, between two and three in the afternoon, I saw Green and Britten, and a little boy was with them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure that they are the two persons. - A. Yes, I know them to be three suspicious characters; I followed them from Clark's-place to Islington church; they returned to Clark's-place again, the little one that got away went into this shop and got this baize; the little boy went up the steps, the biggest stood against the door post, and the little one in a brown jacket clapped this green baize into the big one's arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go up the steps strait or creep up. - A. He crept up so as they could not see him in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the tall one stand against the doorpost. - A. Yes, his name is Green, Britten was standing close by him; I saw the little one take this piece of green baize and put it into Green's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see from what part he drew away that baize. - A. I thought it was a yard or two from the door post; it was standing upright when Green had got it in his possession; they all three made off together. I pursued them about twenty yards from the shop, and took Green in custody with the baize under his arm. A relation of mine came up at the time and took Britten.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had the green baize in your custody ever since. - A. Yes, it is the same that I saw these boys take out of the shop.</p>

I got up in the morning and did Smith's horses, for him. I never left the mews; when Smith came to the carriage, the prosecutor asked about his watch, Smith said that he never saw the watch. I met a person in August last, I bought the duplicate of him, I gave two shillings for it. I am innocent of stealing the watch.</p>

I told him he must go back with me, he said he would not; we scuffled, and he got from me; he run back towards Cavendish-square, he fell over a child; we there scuffled, he got from me again; I at last took him back to the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon looking into her box did you see these three articles. - A. Yes, she asked me if I would forgive her, as I had the articles back. I refused to do that; I said I must appeal to the laws of my country.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to live with this gentleman; I wrote a letter to a friend the place did not suit me; he opened my letter. I had no box in his house; I know nothing at all of these things.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is true she had no box, it was her mistresses' box which she had lent her; I found the things in that box with her wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you know whether at the time the box was delivered to her, there was any thing in the box. - A. That I cannot swear to; the box was delivered to her by Mrs. Stoddart.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

            . - Mr. Knapp. How old are you. - A. sixteen. I belong to the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Which vessel do you tow. - A. The Rose in June.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Palmer. - A. Yes, he was half captain of the Queen of all Traders.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Pickford's vessel. - A. Yes. Lindon was half captain of the Rose in June; and Ratcliffe he was the other half captain of the Rose in June.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these three persons tried and convicted at Warwick assizes. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do your boats first start. - A. I meet them at Newbolt upon Avon.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the place where the returned boats meet. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the boats that came from London to Newbolt, shift their property to the boats that come there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you saw about this box. - A. I saw Lindon go out of the cabin with a pair of pincers and a chissel, and Palmer came from the Queen of all Traders and helped him; they opened a large square box, clenched with iron; they took out some waiters, I do not know how many; four japanned tea pots, four candlesticks and a coffee pot; they brought the things into the cabin, and locked them up; they fastened the box again. I saw nothing else till we came to Uxbridge; we stopped there and gave our horses some corn. We went into the Sawn and Bottle public house and had some beer. Hallett was was sitting at the other side of the house; Palmer went to him and talked with him a good while; we stopped there two hours, and then we started again. Hallett followed us, he came on board the Rose in June, a good bit below Cowley-lock, and then Lindon unlocked his cupboard and took the things out; he asked Hallett if he would buy them, he said yes, he did not care if he did; Hallett asked what was the price, Lindon said fifteen shillings; Lindon packed all up in a handkerchief, all but the four tea pots. The prisoner Hallett said they must go home with him; Ratcliffe had taken them out of the boat, they all three went together, I kept on, they came back again; Ratcliffe said he had got a spade-ace, that means a guinea. I afterwards told Mr. Lee.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You did not tell the prisoner when he came on board that the things were stolen. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Then when they are called supernumerary sergeant, it is not that he is a sergeant of the marines. - A. No, only the rank; all the supernumeraries on board are entitled to a private seaman's share, twenty-four pounds, one shilling and six-pence; they are put upon that class.</p>

               <p>Q. At that time when he came to make this claim, did he produce any administration to you. - A. He did, as far as I can recollect; in consequence of there having been several applications for the same ship from different persons I took him to Mr. Smith before I examined the prize-list. Mr. Smith asked him several questions, and took down memorandums. I recollect his coming to the office again on the 1st of July; I made out the usual certificate.</p>

While I was off my horse four persons came up to me: a tall man went by me within a yard of me, I put my glove on; at the time he was going by, I had my foot on the stirrup and the other going over the horse, when I was pulled down by the men; the tall one came up, they did not ask me any thing at all, they all rifled my pockets; I was standing with my back to the horse, they searched all my pockets and took every thing they could; I stood quiet, I had no power to do any thing, they said not a word to me; when they all four had rifled my pockets, I said to them, gentlemen I hope you will not use me ill; I was then standing, and they all four around me; the tall man knocked me down directly; the blow cut me very much under my eye.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not know whether it was his first or with a weapon. - A. I do not. Then after he had knocked me down they began thrashing of me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Are you quite sure it was the tall man that knocked you down. - A. Yes; I was laying on the ground when they thrashed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take from you all the money and notes - A. Yes, the money notes and all I had about me I had about a dozen little errands for my family in my pockets. I received many blows from them on my body; they beat me with sticks. They all went away; the tall man went away about three yards he came back, he said old man you have got a good great coat, he pulled it off; I was laying on the ground at the time. I was not able to get up, I saw him put it on, he turned back to me again, and put a pistol to my head, and said you rascal if you follow us a yard, we will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen a pistol before. - A. Yes, in the tall man's hand; he jobbed the pistol to the side of my head, and went away; they went towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were you able to get up and get on your horse again. - A. I suppose in the space of five or ten minutes; when I go on my horse I went after them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080045"/> Q. Now during the time the men were robbing of you, did you or did you not look in their faces. - A. Yes; the tall man was dressed in a blue jacket and trowsers, like a sailor, with round nobby buttons, and a blue handkerchief round his neck; two of the others were in light brown, one a drab cloth, and the other a Bath coating; they had nothing over their faces.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoners at the bar, and tell me whether either of them are the men that robbed you. - Q. Yes, they are the three.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them do you describe as the tallest. - A. Hayes, in the blue jacket; he came back and took my coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you equally sure of them all. - A. I am equally as sure of one as I am of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see them again - A. In about ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went after them to London, did you get sight of them again. - A. No; I met two friends on the road, it was light enough to see their faces. I saw four men at Shadwell office, and the three prisoners were among them; I knew them directly. Hayes was not dressed on the first examination as he was when he robbed me; the second and third examination he was dressed the same as when he robbed me. I had no doubt of their being three of the persons that robbed me. I knew them on the second examination.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You have never been fortunate enough to recover your property. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never known these persons in your life before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And the only opportunity that you had of observing their persons was, at the time they were robbing of you. - Q. Exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you were a good deal alarmed at four persons coming up to you. - A. I was not frightened, I was rather alarmed; I looked at them very much before they knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. How much time might it take up while they were robbing of you. - A. About five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been of the same opinion that you were equally sure with respect to all of them. - A. On the third examination I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were not certain at the first examination. - A. I was, but I did not mark them out; I only marked out Hayes and Merrit.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to Shadwell office, had you given information to Bow-street office. - A. I did as well as I could on the Monday after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe their dress then as you have now. - A. I cannot tell, I was very ill, I described them as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You have now said the tall man was dressed in a blue coat. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you have ever said he was dressed in a dark great coat that must be a mistake of your's. Are you quite correct when you stated to my learned friend just now, that at the time of the robbery, that the tall man put on the great coat - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said so. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you have ever said the short man put on the great coat that is a mistake too. - A. I never said so to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if it is put down in the book so at Bow-street office there is a mistake somewhere. - A. There is a mistake somewhere, I never said so in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it. - A. It was moon light. I am certain as to their persons.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. You are a police officer of Shadwell. - A. I am; I apprehended the prisoner Hayes, in company with Mr. Brown. On Saturday the 21st of March we took him in bed, at a place called Chiswell Hill, Ratcliffe Highway; there was laying by the bed a large great coat, such as riggers wear; he had a jacket which he put on under that, he had blue trowsers, there was a blue silk handkerchief laying by them. Brown and I apprehended Merrit in Essex-street, Whitechapel, commonly called Catherine Wheel-alley; he was in bed at the time. The coat which was joined to the rest of his clothes was a drab coloured coat. We took Roach on the Saturday following; he was in bed at a house in Parish-street, in the Borough; we took him to the office. Hayes was examined in a dark drab coat; on the second examination, Hayes was dressed in a blue jacket, without the long coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prosecutor came the first time, did he speak to any of them. - A. He pointed out Hayes and Merrit. On the second examination he pointed out the same men; he looked at Roach, but said he would take time to consider of him. On the third examination he swore positively to the three.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course, being an officer, you know there is a forty pound reward. - A. Very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not been able to discover any of the property. - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Hayes' Defence. I solemnly declare my innocence before God, and this court; I had no hand in the act, or part in it, nor was I ever on the road since I came in the world.</p>
               <p>Merrit's Defence. I should not know my way to the place without asking; I declare I was not nigh the place.</p>

You must understand that my wife's birth day was on the 17th; I can give you another instance, which will satisfy you further; there was a woman in the house, she asked Merrick to treat her with a glass of liquor, he denied it, he said he had a guinea in his pocket, it was as much as he could do to pay his way; Mrs. Merrick came in, and there was a little bit of jealously, Merrick struck his wife, she was turned out, and she broke one of the windows, and it is not mended yet. Mrs. Merrick came and asked me if I could remember when she broke the window, I said I could; it was the Saturday before St. Patrick's day.</p>

               <p>Q. At what hour. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not she ask you whether you recollected shaving him any particular hour. - A. Not at that time, she did about three days afterwards; she then asked me what hour her husband was in my shop, told her about my supper hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you subpoenaed. - A. Last Friday night, by an attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the public house, can you tell me how many persons were there. - A. There were great many, Lane and Lane's wife was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they doing. - A. They were drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were drinking. - A. I thought they were drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Where they drinking or dancing, as you was there you can tell me. - A. They were drinking, Cohen was in the same tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was Merrit sitting and drinking with. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the landlord there. - A. I saw a man there they called Davey. The landlady's sister served me, the landlady was laying in, she is not expected to live; she was sick a bed, and is now; I just looked in to see if any of my customers that had been in my shop were there.</p>
               <p>Q. I should have thought you would have looked in to see whether any of your customers that had not been in your house were there, that is most likely; give me a reason for your looking in to see if any of your customers that were shaved were in there; is it your habit to go there and see if any of your customer are in that house. - A. On Saturday night when the shop is vacant I go in, if I see any of my customers I tell them the shop is vacant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You told me you were looking after customers that were shaved, you took my hint very well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You shave a great many persons resident in that neighbourhood. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday night you go there for your beer, to see if any one wants shaving - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What is there makes you recollect his shaving late on that Saturday. - A. Because I speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. That is no reason; have you any reason for saying so; is there any circumstance that fixes it on your mind, that that man was shaved late rather than early, if there is no circumstance you will say so. - A. None sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Every thing was quiet when you went in the public house. - A. Yes, there were girls of the town there; I recollect a noise in the public house, like making a fight; after I got my supper beer, they said this Merrick was fighting his wife; I understood the next day there was a pane of glass broke; the young woman told me Merrick shoved his wife against it, and broke it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it mended. - A. I cannot tell, it was mended within a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it is mended. - A. I think so, I am sure it is, I saw the panes of glass were all right.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a night was this. - A. It was moon light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how the man was dressed. - A. He had got long sailor's trowsers on, and a long light coloured great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What was under that. - A. I could not tell, it was buttoned up to the top.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was the coat. - A. A road colour, and his trowsers I took to be blue.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his countenance. - A. Yes, I looked in his face all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be with you. - A. He was with me as much as five minutes, I'll be bound for him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before. - A. No, never sir, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him afterwards. - A. I heard there was such a person taken; I saw him afterwards get out of a coach; it struck me directly that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where. - A. At Shadwell office.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that. - A. It was the second time of their being examined. I was robbed on a Friday; this was almost three weeks afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know he was in custody when he come out of the coach - had he irons on. - A. Yes, he had irons on when I saw him at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is, whether you knew when you saw him that he was a prisoner. - A. Yes, I was sure he was a prisoner. There was Roach's brother he came to me when I was in the yard; I walked over to the other side of the yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. That has nothing to do with this business.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Roach's brother said to me so sure as I swore against these men, we were all dead men.</p>
               <p>Court. Now look at the prisoner, are you sure he is the man. - A. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear to him by his features. - A. Yes, and by his nose; I looked at his face when he undone my small clothes, and when he held the pistol to my cheek I took notice of his nose all the time; the other man presented the pistol to my cheek, I saw him but once, and by that I will not say I am sure of him; the other man I took to be Roach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. How often have you been robbed. - A. Never before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. When he put the pistol so you you was alarmed. A. I was at first, till I threw my purse away.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080048"/> Q. You had a pistol put to your head, that alarmed you - when persons are alarmed they have not their senses so much about them. - A. I know that.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a hat had this man on that robbed you. - A. A largish round hat.</p>
               <p>Q. It come over his face. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had his hat on, and you say it was a moonlight night. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the moon coming on the top of his hat you could not see his face. - A. That did not hide his face from me. I dropped my purse down between two trees, I marked where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Which did you think most about, your money or your life. - A. I thought more about my purse than my life; I had four pounds about me.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that when you saw the prisoner get out of the coach it struck you that he was the man. - A. Yes, I did not like to swear to him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that you could not swear to him, - A. I said I will not swear to him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you attend three or four examinations before you swore to him. - A. No, only one.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not swear to him at the first. - A. No, I said I won't; I did at the second examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of a reward afterwards. - A. No, I had heard of that before.</p>
               <p>Q. You never hand any conversation with any body about any reward. - A. Not now.</p>
               <p>Q. You are talking to me now, has no one told you that there is a reward for convicting a man of a highway robbery. - A. I have been told so.</p>
               <p>Q. You expect to get a great deal more than four-pence. - A. I do not expect to get any.</p>
               <p>Q. If it is to be given do not you expect to get part of it. - A. Yes, if it is given.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do expect it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you say so at first, have any of the officers told you. - A. No, I have heard it in different places in the country.</p>

            . I am a waiter at Mr. Beale's hotel. On the 11th of March the prisoner came into Mr. Beale's hotel, and asked if that was the Union hotel; I informed him the Union hotel was in St. James's-square; I had suspicion he had took some part of the plate from the side-board; he was standing by the side-board in the passage. I asked him what he had got in his pocket, he said he had got nothing belonging to me; I asked him to draw his hand out of his pocket, and after he took his hand out of his pocket, I took the fork from between his fingers; I asked him what he meant by taking it. He said take what, I said this fork that you have got between your fingers; he said if I have got it you put it in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I shall not intrude upon your time long. The situation of my three motherless children can be better concieved than described. I only was in the passage, I was not in any room nor did I open any door. I am forty-eight years of age; you must be aware the stigma this must cast on my character. I rely upon you to restore me to my family - and, gentlemen, if you are not guided by mercy, I must be for ever an outcast upon the earth.</p>

The prisoner at the bar came to my house three different times, he came about seven o'clock in the morning and called for half a pint of porter; first of all he asked for his partner, a stone mason that was to call there. About a month after he called again and asked for half a pint of porter, and asked if his partner was come then; I said no. I lost a candlestick each time; then on the 28th of March he called for the boy to open the door, he asked if his partner was come; the boy said no, but he dare say if he had promised him to meet him he would be there; the boy had suspicion of him as well as me. The prisoner went into the back room, the boy saw there were two brass candlesticks on the table, he ran up stairs and taps at the door and said the partner is come again; he went down stairs and stood at the door; when I came down stairs he came out of the room and asked me for half a pint of beer; while I was unlocking the machine the boy went into the back room, he saw the candlesticks were gone; the prisoner made a bolt towards the door, the boy says stop him, he has got the candlesticks. I told him now he happened to meet with the right partner; I said how dare you steal my candlesticks, he said he had not got them; I told him he had them in his pockets; he pulled one out of each pocket then.</p>

            . - Mr. Pitcairn. Were you in the service of the prisoner in December 1805. - A. Yes, as chamberlain.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in his service in December 1805. - A. I was nearly three years in his service then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you chamberlain in 1803. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you leave him. - A. I have left him about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 29th of December 1805 any fire happening. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when the fire broke out. - A. I was at a friend's house in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave the Swan on that day the fire broke out. - A. I think between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear that the fire broke out. - A. About six in the evening, the chambermaid sent her son to me; she knew where I was gone, she sent to me, to let me know the house was a fire; I took my hat and came as fast as it was possible the boy could go with me. When I returned I found the fire at the extremity of the building, called the wood-room.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned did you see your master. - A. I saw him in the passage when I came in.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing. - A. I do not know that he was doing any thing particular. I think I said to him, sir, where is the fire, he said it is in the wood-room; I went up immediately to my own room, I threw off my coat, I went up the gallery stairs, I took a bucket or a pitcher of water with me; when I came to the top of the building, the fire was flaming along that passage where the chimney was; I found it was of no use throwing the water down on that passage; I came down immediately, I saw Mr. Williams in the passage; when I came down again, he says to me, the fire is very bad, you had better take care of your things; I went up into my own room, and packed up what belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Was your room distant to where this fire was. - A. About one hundred feet distance. I took my things to the Castle in Queen-street; I came back and assisted the chambermaid, I took her things to the coach office. I then assisted in getting Mr. William's beds and things out of the rooms; I took them into the coach office; I took the luggage which gentlemen had left out of the store-room, and put them in the coach office; it is attached together under one roof; but some distance from the wood-garret.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pitcairn. What time was this fire in the wood garret extinguished. - A. I suppose it was completely out between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it got under. - A. In an hour and a half or two hours; the roof fell in, and it burried the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this fire was extinguished did you perceive any other fire. - A. About eleven o'clock; I was standing opposite a small stair case, direct opposite the bar accompting house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the fire in the garret was extinguished. - A. A very little while; it was a little after eleven when I was standing in that situation.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was standing in that situation, what did you see. - A. It appeared to me there was some smoke coming down that stair case, and there was a candle and candlestick which stood in the dish larder, within about a yard of the stair case; I took the candle and went up stairs, I thought there appeared to be a great deal of smoke coming down there; I concluded that there must be a fire about that spot; I looked in the lower rooms, I found all was perfectly safe; then I went into the second flight, which was four rooms, 27, 28, 29, and 30; I opened the room door, No. 30, I saw Mr. Williams in No. 30, his back was towards me when I went into the room, and the window was a little pushed up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any light with him. - A. No, he had none; the door was shut, I opened the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any light of any lamp, or candle, or fire burning, so as to light the room. - A. No, it was a back room, it was perfectly dark; there was a great deal of smoke in the room where he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pitcairn. You say you saw Mr. Williams there, describe the manner you saw him there. - A. I saw Mr. Williams there; I will not swear whether he was sitting or standing, his back was towards me; I said as I went into the room, who is here, I saw it was Mr. Williams. I said, sir, here is a great deal of smoke here; he said all is very safe, go and get something to drink; I said sir I will throw the windows up and let the smoke out. Mr. Williams replied I have opened the windows myself; I did not notice that, I opened the window of the room adjoining 29; Mr. Williams was in No. 30, that window was a little open; there was a little smoke in No. 29; I then went into No. 28, there was a little smoke there; in that room there are three panes of glass that pull down; I pulled them down myself; then I went to No. 27; when I opened the door, the flames rushed out immediately; the flames came out so rapid, that I was obliged to drop on the ground to prevent myself from being burned. I went down immediately, and gave the alarm to the firemen that No. 27 was on fire, and they came up in the course of a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Q. The firemen were in the house, and several engines there when you discovered this fire in No. 27. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to your master. - A. No; I did not see him when I came up again; the foreman of the Sun fire office came up stairs, and the first thing they did, they pulled the bestead to pieces, threw water over the room, and got the fire under:</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080052"/> Q. After the fire had been extinguished in this room had you any opportunity of observing the state of it. - A. Yes, I saw that every thing was burned to pieces, and a candlestick was found under the bed; the fireman of the Sun fire office brought it out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the candlestick found under the bed. A. No, I saw the candlestick brought out of the room; the fireman said he had taken it from under the bed; I did not see him. Some little time after that fire was extinguished I saw my master in the passage walking about; he said nothing to me, nor did he make any enquiry about that fire.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the fire in No. 27. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you discover any other fire. A. There were several more discovered after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of your master after this fire in No. 27. - A. I do not know: I saw him about some time after in the passage; he came to me, and desired me not to put any body to sleep on that side of the house. There was another fire at No. 16, the top gallery on the right hand as you go up the staircase, the same side as No. 27, and separated by a brick wall; that fire was discovered near three o'clock in the morning. Mr. Williams came to me about half past one, he said if any thing should happen, I am going to bed at No. 62, you come there to me. After he went to bed the firemen gave the alarm that the top gallery was on fire at No. 16.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was this after your master had gone to bed. - A. I suppose about an hour; I went up first with the firemen to see where it was, and at the top room, No. 16, the fire was flowing out of the room over the doorway; it is a thin partition over the door, and it is a narrow passage; the door was shut to, the firemen split the door open to let the fire out; they played in water upon the room and put the fire out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of what your master had told you alarm him. - A. I did, I knocked at No. 62, I told him the top gallery was on fire, No. 16; he came out immediately, whether he had his clothes on or off I cannot say; he came out in the passage. I did not observe any thing particular in his manner at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing this room, No. 16, after the fire was extinguished. - A. Yes; No. 98, which was a room adjoining to 16, it appeared as if there was a large hole through, which I thought the fire came from 98; I found every thing in 16 burnt, the two beds, bedsteads, and the clothes, and it burnt through the ceiling into the coffee room.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you thought the fire came from 98, was it on fire. - A. Part of the partition was on fire, a large place was burnt through.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other part of 98 burnt. - A. Not any.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pitcairn. After this fire had been extinguished, did you see any thing of the prisoner. - A. Yes, I saw Mr. Williams after the fire at 16 and 98 was extinguished, several times in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any enquiry respecting this fire. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again. - A. About four o'clock in the morning; the chambermaid Simpson, and me, were drinking a cup of tea in the chamberlain's room; it is very near to the bar, and faomg it on the same passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were there. - A. Mrs. Simpson, the chambermaid, Mr. Tourzey, and the cook and myself; while we were drinking tea Mr. Williams came past with a candlestick and candle in his hand, he says why do not you go and get yourself something to drink; the chambermaid and myself made reply, we did not want any thing, we were drinking of tea; Mr. Williams passed us and went up a flight of stairs that led to No. 66, 67, and 69; in about ten minntes afterwards Simpson and myself went up stairs, and followed him to see if every thing was safe; it was expected that he was going to do some mischief.</p>
               <p>Court. Some suspicion in your mind led you to go there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up where he had gone with the candle and candlestick. - A. We did; I looked in room 69, I found every thing perfectly safe, and 67 every thing was safe; I then went to 66, every thing was safe there; in the passage opposite there is a cupboard, it formerly was a water closet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pitcairn. Is there any chimney in it. - A. None at all; it had been fitted up by Mr. Williams to put fruit in to keep it from freezing; at that time there was nothing in it, it had been emptied a long time. When I opened the door, Simpson said, good God, Triggey, here's fire; there were two shelves in the cupboard, the lower shelf was all in a blaze, it was totally alight. It appeared to me by the fragments that were left, that there had been some paper there; there were some of the little pieces of the paper in the cupboard, and it appeared as if they had flew about; the paper was all burnt, there was the cinders of the paper left, and a quantity of ashes. On the upper shelf, which was of the same size, there was a decanter with brandy in it; I think it was a pint one. 
               <persName id="t18070408-90-person848">Simpson</persName>
             the chambermaid took it from the shelf herself.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of the shelf was burnt. - A. The lower shelf was burnt; the upper shelf was not, it was very hot. but not burned.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was brandy in this decanter, how do you know it was brandy. - A. I tasted it.</p>
               <p>Q. You put this fire out. - A. Yes, there was a mahogany flap to a table and green baize in this cupboard; I took the green baize, rolled it up, and put the fire out with it; they both were placed against the fire. In about a minute after I had put the fire out, I saw Mr. Williams coming from the Sun tavern room, he was coming towards us (the tavern rooms have all distinct names); as he came towards us he said I have put that fire out; I told him that he had not put it out, we had put it out, meaning the chambermaid and myself; he made no reply, but went away.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see no more of him after that time. - A. No, I heard he had gone to bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pitcairn. When did any person come from the Sun fire office after this, and make any enquiry. - A. Mr. Hall came in a few days after this.</p>
               <p>Q. About the time of Mr. Hall's coming, or previous to it, did any conversation pass between you and the prisoner on the subject. - A. Yes; previous to Mr. Hall's coming, Mr. Williams slept at Islington after the fire, he used to come home in the morning, I saw him in the passage, I told him there had been a gentleman enquiring if I knew any thing concerning the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that gentleman. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been a gentleman previous to Mr. Hall coming. - A. Yes; I went into the parlour and told Mr. Williams of it, a day or two after the fire: I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080053"/> told him I would point out the gentleman to him when I saw him again; I said sir, if the fire office knew of the fire in the closet opposite 66, your insurance would not be worth a farthing; he told me to knock the boards down and put them out of the way. That was all that passed at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that you knocked them down. - A. I did; I put them away in the store room for some time, and put trunks upon them; after the storeroom was cleared of the luggage, I took the boards out and put them under a large dresser where we put foul clothes in in the chamberlain's room; I nailed a skirting board before them, so that they were completely out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find the boards again. - A. Mr Nalder, the city marshall found them; he knocked the skirting board down and took the boards from under the dresser, and soon after this Mr. Hall from the Sun fire office came.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the fire was this. - A. Some few days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention any circumstance of the fire in the closet opposite 66. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention any circumstance of finding your master in room No. 30. - A. I did not, and the reason why I did not mention it, Mr. Williams came up to me in our own room, I believe it was the day Mr. Hall came; before Mr. Hall examined me, he desired us to say if we were asked, that he made all enquiry respecting the fire that he could. The fact is, he never did to me neither at the fire, nor any other time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this did you continue in Mr. Williams' service. - A. I left him near five or six months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the cause of your leaving him. - A. A dispute between Mrs. Williams and my wife respecting a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mention the circumstance of the fire in the water closet while you lived with him. - A. I did not; the first time I gave the information, was to Mr. Wilson the coach-proprietor, and the Sun fire office, a fortnight after I left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the Sun fire office. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. You came to the situation of chamberlain in 1803. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been before. - A. I had been a labourer in the India house seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation are you in now. - A. A publican.</p>
               <p>Q. You left Mr. Williams in consequence of a dispute that took place between Mrs. Williams and your wife. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that dispute you were very willing to leave that situation as chamberlain. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not like to stay in a family that you could not live easy and comfortable, you are quite sure that you did not desire to stay. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor to offer any terms for which you would stay, nor make any threats in case you were to be turned away. - A. No, I made no threats.</p>
               <p>Q. You went most willingly away. - A. No, not till my books were settled.</p>
               <p>Q. The first person you disclosed it to was the coach-proprietor. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. I should be glad to know whether Mr. Wilson is the owner of the house. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any idea of taking this house yourself - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to swear that. - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not there when the fire broke out, you came in about six o'clock in the evening. - A. A little after six.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room did the fire begin. - A. It was in a wood room where the fire began.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great deal of dry wood in that room. A. All sorts of wood, it was mixed wood.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some very dry. - A. I do not know that; it was not my business to examine it; there was old chairs and wood of every description almost.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any wood kept in that room for the purpose of firing. - A. It was kept for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you do not know that there was dry wood there. - A. It was not my business to know that, it did not concern me, I concerned myself only with the beds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not a great many people make enquiry that night how this fire happened. - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Endeavour to recollect yourself. - A. They could only judge by the same as I did myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I should like to know your judgment of it. A. I gave my judgment that it was wilfully done.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you gave that night. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you gave no other judgment that night. - A. Not as I know of.</p>

               <p>Q. I ask you whether on that night you did not say you had no idea how it happened, whether you did not say so to Mr. King Thorn - do you know the man that keeps the Black Swan. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him that night. - A. I believe I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you never say so to him. - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Waterhouse is a gentleman that has a large concern, he is the owner of the horses that are kept at this house. - A. I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you did not say to Mr. Water-house, with respect to the other fires, that they happened through the carelessness of the other servants moving<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080054"/> the goods, and leaving the candles in the rooms. - A. I do not know that I did; I was desired by Mr. Williams to say many things.</p>
               <p>Q. Your opinion was the direct reverse to this; you think you never could have said this. - A. My opinion was averse to this, I had my doubts upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the next morning after this fire happened, you were examined by the officers of the Sun fire office, and that you never hinted to him that these places were set fire to by any body. - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say to him that they happened by accident in your judgment. - A. I do not know but that I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that the account you had given to the Sun fire office was a true account. - A. I said so to Mr. Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say so to other persons. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never abused the servants for removing the things from one place to another. - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you wish to state that positively. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are quite certain that at the moment they wanted to get rid of you, you did not want to stop. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Miss Mather. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She is the sister of Mrs. Williams. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Miss Mather the night before your master turned you out of doors. - A. No particular conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you use these words I am going to say, remember these words are taken down; did not you say, Miss Mather, Mr. Williams and I had better part friendly. - A. I believe them are the words exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. You did say that. - A. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing more. - A. I do not know, in the general conversation something else may come in.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself, I can bring proof what you said; did not you desire Miss Mather to intercede with Mr. Williams, for Mr. Williams to suffer you to stay. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you before you was turned away, threaten Mr. Williams. - A. I told him I certainly would discover something that would be very serious to him. I never asked him to stop.</p>
               <p>Q. He turned you out that night. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He persisted that you should not stop. - A. Yes, he was very tipsey.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days after he turned you away was it before you found your way to the Sun fire office. - A. A fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been to Mr. Wilson first. - A. I saw Mr. Wilson in the coach yard, I believe that was about a fortnight after, and then I mentioned it to him; that was before I went to the Sun fire office.</p>
               <p>Q. I will now take you back to No. 27, when you discovered the fire in No. 27, Mr. Williams was in No. 30; you are quite positive of that. - A. Quite positive.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him in the room. - A. Yes, I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. The door was shut, and the window was open. - A. A little open.</p>
               <p>Q. So that a person sitting there with a light, and any person going in there and opening the door, the wind might blow it out. - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him in 62, you went and called him when the fire broke out at No. 16. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from 16. - A. I suppose sixty, eighty, or one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. To go from there to No. 16, they must go down one stair-case and go up another. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He must have got out of his bed at No. 62, passed down one staircase and gone up another, and must have passed through where the firemen were; were they not stationed there. - A. They were in the rooms adjoining; he could have gone through a long stone passage, without coming where the firemen were; the two rooms where the firemen were, were at the bottom of the staircase; the firemen were in the Manchester and Liverpool rooms as they call them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no other firemen in any other rooms. - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever threaten Mr. Williams if ever he turned you away. - A. I mentioned it to him when he discharged me.</p>
               <p>Q. You never did mention it to him till after you was discharged, that was near a twelvemonth after. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you said that you could hang him, and that you was sure you could do it. - A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it. - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never threatened to accuse him of any thing else. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear to that. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt about that. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you threaten him to charge him with an unnatural crime. - A. No, I never mentioned any such thing, not to Mr. Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hint to any other person, that you could charge Mr. Williams with the commission of an unnatural crime. - A. No, I never did.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. You are one of the city marshalls. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. About the time that Triggey was examined before the lord mayor, did he go with you and point out where the boards were. - A. Yes, he stooped down and took out the boards himself and gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he occasion to knock down any thing. - A. Yes, there was a small skirting board before them; he knocked that down, and then he pulled out these two boards (producing them), they have been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Triggey) How were these shelves. - A. That part that is scorched was on fire in blazes; that is the lower shelf, the fire was upon that shelf, the shelf above it was hot, and it had the decanter of brandy upon it.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not say what quantity. - A. I did not know exactly the quantity.</p>
               <p>MRS. SIMPSON. - Mr. Gurney. In December 1805, you were chambermaid to the Swan and Two Necks. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080055"/> Q. How lately before that fire broke out had you seen your master. - A. I saw him at various times in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether you had seen him shortly before the fire in No. 27. - A. I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your master going to bed. - A. I heard he did go to bed.</p>

               <p>Q. After that fire was put out, what did you and your husband do. - A. We went into the chamberlain's room and took a cup of tea.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were taking tea in the chamberlain's room, did you see your master. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come into the room after the fire was put out. - A. Yes, between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in company with you at the time that you saw your master come in. - A. There was my husband and Triggey.</p>
               <p>Q. When your master went through the chamberlain's room, where did he go. - A. He went up stairs towards No. 69; he had a candle and candlestick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and Triggey follow him at any time afterwards. - A. In about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you follow him. - A. To see if all was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up the same stair-case that he had gone towards 69. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and Triggey look in 69. - A. Yes, and we looked in 67 and 66; we then looked into the closet.</p>
               <p>Q. When you looked in the closet in what condition did you find it. - A. There was some fire in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see apparently any paper burnt down to an ash. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that paper. - A. On the shelf, and the shelf was some of it burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on fire and in flame. - A. I cannot recollect any flame, the shelf was black.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any smoke. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Who put it out. - A. It was put out by Triggey, with the green baize, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that green baize. - A. It laid under the shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that green baize there. - A. It was out of use, it had been used over a carpet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fire near that closet that day. - A. No; we found the door put to it, it had a lock, but it was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there. - A. A very few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you return down the same stair-case that you came. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing on the other shelf. - A. Yes, a decanter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in that decanter. - A. No, except the drainings; there had been brandy in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it off the shelf or Triggey. - A. I cannot say, I brought it down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q Then you mean to say it was empty when you found it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no appearance of any brandy having been spilt there. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. None of the paper was wet. - A. It was burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all go into the room called the Sun below that. - A. No, I found Mr. Williams in the Sun after we had found the fire in the closet; Triggey spoke to him, but I do not recollect any of the words that passed. I brought the decanter with me, and the next day Fletcher, the head waiter, smelt the fire and saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point it out to your husband. - A. Triggey shewed it to my husband. I went up when Fletcher was there, and Tourzy the cook.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Hall the surveyor coming and examining you and the other persons in the house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Hall any thing about that fire in the closet. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you. - A. I had no particular reason for not telling him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master make any particular enquiry respecting the fire the night it happened. - A. He said he did not know how it could happen in the wood garret.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day following the fire did he ever question you about the manner, or which way this fire could possibly have happened. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you the next day discover that there had been a fire in No. 27. - A. I found there had been a fire in 27; I did not discover it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. That is two stories under the wood garret, and accessible by a passage; did you go into that room. - A. I did; the bed-furniture was perfectly burnt; the mattress and coverlid was burnt round.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever mentioned the fire in the closet opposite to No. 66, till you was examined before the lord-mayor. - A. To no one but Touzy, Fletcher, Triggey, and my husband.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Dancy. What situation were you in that house. - A. Chambermaid, and Triggey was chamberlain.</p>
               <p>Q. He was out that day. - A. Yes; my son boarded with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mr. Williams come in the house - A. Mr. Williams came in the house on the 5th of April, and the fire was on the 9th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Triggey been there. - A. Triggey was there a few days before Mr. Williams was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he chamberlain when he first came: - A. No; he acted about the house. He came, I fancy, in expectation of having the place.</p>
               <p>Q. The fire broke out about six o'clock. - A. About a quarter after six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect where Mr. Williams had dined that day. - A. To the best of my recollection in the parlour with company.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time. - A. The usual time is between three and four o'clock, but the particular time on that day I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you are able to say who dined with him. A. I believe captain Dickson and Mrs. Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. They went out after dinner. - A. Yes, I understood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080056"/> they went up to Islington.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was in the parlour at the time the alarm of fire was given. - A. I understood, Mr. Williams, captain Dickson, and another of the company were in the parlour. I had not seen them, nor had I been in the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dancy. When the alarm of fire was you saw them. - A. Yes, Mr. Williams ordered me to get the keys; I told him that I did not know that I could; I would get somebody to get them, and before I had got to the door the people had got the keys, and they were removing the goods; I saw every one about the house using the greatest exertions they could, and I saw Mr. Williams about in different parts of the lower part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose this fire created no small confusion. - A. A very great one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the things removed in that hurry that that confusion would create. - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were the firemen there with their engines. - A. It might be three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. The fire was got under in this wood garret. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the firemen came were there other persons assisting in getting this fire under. - A. Yes, all of the servants were carrying up water.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any one said it was impossible for any one to carry water there, it is not true. - A. It is not; the fire in the garret was partly out when Triggey came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was possible for any one to throw water there. - A. I was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see persons carrying water up. - A. I did; the waiter, and the housemaid Jane,

            , and another; one met the other, and took the water from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps Triggey was afraid of fire, did he go near it. - A. He went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he carry up water and throw it on. - A. I do not think there was any occasion then.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say you drank tea in Triggey's room. A. In my own room.</p>
               <p>Q. In your own room; then did not Mr. Williams go through your room while you were drinking tea. - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if Triggey has said that if Mr. Williams went through, that is not true. - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go through before or after you was drinking tea. - A. I do not know whether it was before or after; it was not at the time that we were drinking tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember when Mr. Williams went away to inform his wife. - A. I think it was after the second fire had been extinguished.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was present after the second fire had been extinguished. - A. He was about the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the second fire. - A. At No. 27.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Williams at any time before there at No. 27. - A. Yes, he was at the bottom part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you think Mr. Williams was absent when he went to inform Mrs. Williams of the accident that had taken place - was it an hour or more. - A. I think it must be that before he returned.</p>
               <p>Q. After he went through the chamberlain's room, you yourself went up stairs to that place that led you to No. 66 - did you open the closet door or Triggey. - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you do not recollect there was any flame there, the shelf was black and smoking, it appeared as if paper had been burnt out, as if it had been extinguished and gone out. - A. It was burning then on the decline, it was black and smoking.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the green baize laid on the ground underneath the shelf. - A. I think the baize was on the ground; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it put up before the door to hide the fire from you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a decanter there, it had the drainings of brandy in it, and as Triggey might be alarmed, he might take a little brandy at that time. - A. I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. You stood by and never saw him. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The decanter was cold, it did not burn your fingers. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether it was any time in contemplation for the office of chamberlain and chambermaid to be united. - A. Mr. Williams offered me the chamberlain's place in addition to mine; I mentioned it to Triggey the same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after the fire. - A. About May or June after.</p>
               <p>Q. When you mentioned it to Triggey was he pleased or angry - A. He was not pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I may venture to say he was angry. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him do any thing particular after this anger of his, do you remember his taking a rule and measuring the distances of places afterwards. - A. Yes, the same evening he got a rule and line measuring; he was an hour and a half measuring the distance about different parts of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. He was measuring distances afterwards, and putting down his distances upon paper. - A. I did not see what he wrote.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he write. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take that situation. - A. No, Triggey continued as chamberlain; I left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his tearing a leaf out of a book. A. Yes, the bed-book.</p>
               <p>Q. That leaf that he tore out enabled him to know all the numbers of the rooms. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Williams went to bed that night. - A. He did, in No. 62.</p>
               <p>Q. That is one pair of stairs higher than the Liverpool and Manchester; were the firemen stationed in the Liverpool and Manchester. - A. Yes, and in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Then to come down from Mr. Williams's room No. 62, he must come along the same passage where the Liverpool and the Manchester rooms were - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you cross the yard after you come by the Liverpool, to go where the fire had been. - A. No, there is the passage, and then the stairs front you; it is near the bar; the bar is of one side of the passage, and the stairs of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all the people who are in the bar, if they look that way, would see the persons who went up that stair-case. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. So then he must come by the Liverpool and Manchester, where the firemen were, and by the bar;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080057"/> where any body might have seen him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You never went up stairs while the fire lasted. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether you could get at it to throw water upon it you do not know. - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now at the time your master went to bed at 62, do you know whether the door of the Manchester or the Liverpool was open or shut. - A. I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. If they were shut he might pass without any person seeing him. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>MR. HALL. Q. You have told us you was a surveyor in the Sun fire office. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day after the fire was, did you go to the Swan and Two Necks to see what damage the fire had done. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the appearance of fire in these different places. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see all that is now mentioned, or was there any exception. - A. I saw all that is now mentioned, with the exception of the closet.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this model describe the form and manner of the house in the best purpose. - A. I think it does.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the access to the wood garret up the staircase, and through that narrow passage. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it have been an easy thing for persons to go along that narrow passage and throw water. - A. I think not, presuming it was full of smoke.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined the remainder of the wood garret. - A. Yes; the floor was burnt very much, the room had fallen in; that part of the building was considerably injured. I examined 27, the fire left a very strong mark there, there was a burnt place in the floor, just at the end of the foot of the bed; the floor of 28 was very much burnt indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any means by which the fire of the wood loft could be communicated to 27 and 28. - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Would any persons bringing wood out of that garret, come past there. - A. I should think it highly improbable, it is an hundred yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a party wall between them, is there not. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that wall injured by fire. - A. Certainly not, the wall was perfect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards examine the rooms 16 and 98. - A. Yes; 16 was very much injured; the floor of 16 was burnt through into the coffee room; 98 was as if the fire had come through 16 to 98, and not as if it originated in 98; in 21 the curtains and vallens were consumed, and the panes of glass in the windows were cracked; it evidently shewed that there was a great degree of heat; glass that has been cracked by fire, the lines have a different appearance from those effected by a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a candle in the room. - A. I cannot take upon me to say at this distance of time whether I did or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any communication that you could trace between that fire and any of the others. - A. None whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you have seen of this closet, was there any thing that this fire in the closet could be communicated by any of the other fires. - A. I think certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what you saw there did you ask any questions of Mr. Williams, and did he give you any account of the fire. - A. He did; which account I took down in writing at the time. I have now the original writing in my hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take it down so that Williams saw you were taking it down from him. - A. Certainly; we were at a table together, and I had pen, ink, and paper from the inn. That was on the morning of the 30th of December, the morning after the fire. (The examination read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did he at that time mention to you about the fire in the closet. - A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. You also examined some of the servants. - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you dine there on the 29th of December 1805. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who dined in company with you. - A. Mr. Muiret, his wife, and two ladies; we sat down to dinner at half after two or three o'clock, in the bar parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue with him till the alarm of fire was given. - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the bar parlour a great distance from the garret where the fire was. - A. A great way.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time that you dined till the alarm of fire was given, was the prisoner at the bar out of the room time sufficient to have gone to that place. - A. I do not think he left the room for two minutes; when he did leave the room some gentleman called out where is the master of the yard; he was not out more than a minute or two minutes at any time; I am certain of it, or else I would not say it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the alarm of fire being given. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect by whom the alarm was given. A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the alarm of fire being given, what was done. - A. Mr. Williams and me went up, and we did every thing that possibly could be done; Mr. Williams was very much agitated and hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were at dinner, till the alarm of fire, did you perceive any agitation upon him. A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Williams give directions for putting the fire out. - A. He assisted, as well as myself; he ordered the engines, and he asked for the keys of the church, I fancy to put his goods in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Mr. Williams during the fire, till it was put out. - A. Most of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed him during the whole time. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you saw, did he appear to be doing all he could do, in order to put out the fire. - A. Upon my honour he did.</p>

            . - Mr. Dancy. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Williams. - A. I have known him nine or ten years; at the time the fire happened I was an inmate of his family.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been so. - A. From the time that he separated from his partner. Mr. Simpson. the July preceding; at that time it was his particular request that I should reside in it, having leisure hours in my own business, which I could be of service to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect at what time you dined on that day, when the fire took place. - A. About three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What company dined there. - A. Mr. Dickson, his wife, myself, Mr. and Mrs. Williams, and another gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time of dinner did your company continue till the fire broke out, did the ladies continue with you or go else where. - A. The ladies continued till between four and five.</p>
               <p>Q. The company consisted of yourself, Mr. Dickson, and Mrs. Dickson, Mrs. Williams, and the prisoner; at what time did the fire break out. - A. About six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Williams being absent during that time. - A. No more than going into the bar to put any thing down, or when he was called out, then he returned immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. You call this room in which you dined, the bar parlour. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you see from the bar parlour into the bar itself. - A. Yes, the division is of glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he with you at the time the fire broke out. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any thing in his manner, that any thing extraordinary was likely to take place. - A. Nothing at all; he was perfectly cheerfull and paid attention to his guests.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was about six o'clock when you first heard the alarm of fire. - A. Yes, on or about six when we first heard any alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect who made that alarm to you. - A. No, one of the servants came in very much flurried; I do not know which it was; the fire was at the back of the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Williams do on that occasion. - A. Nothing more than anxious to render any assistance, giving directions for water to be taken up. He appeared to act perfectly as he ought to have done; I carried up water myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How near might you go with the water to where the fire was. - A. I went into the narrow passage where the fire was; it was so full of smoke I was obliged to leave it; I threw the water along the passage, in hopes of it getting to the fire. A great many other persons carried up water; there was a great quantity of water carried up, but I do not think if the engines had not come, it would have put it out. Mr. Williams placed himself in the bar, from whence he could see what was done, and he gave directions.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many persons engaged in getting the fire under. - A. Yes, all the servants, and I think as many as twenty, rendered every exertion possible.</p>
               <p>Q. How long since you first heard the alarm of fire, before the engines were brought. - A. I was so busy employed, I did not observe when the engines came; the firemen were in the house and got the pipes up before I observed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Until the engines came, did Mr. Williams continue to act in the way you have described. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. When that was got under, do you recollect what became of Mr. Williams. - A. Mr. Dickson and I went up to his wife, to break out this intelligence to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You did go and break this intelligence. - A. I did; she was at her father in law's. Mr. Williams said he would follow as soon as he could get things in order. He came, and returned with him and Mr. Dickson to the inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any exertion made with respect to the furniture, what was done with that. - A. I saw a quantity of furniture taken out of the house; I was told it was taken to the church, particularly the plate, of which Mr. Williams had great quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a considerable confusion during this business. - A. A very great confusion indeed, the servants were flying in all directions.</p>
               <p>Q. It was after day, it was dark, so as to require candles. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the servants got candles with them. - A. I do not recollect seeing persons with candles, I was principally in that part of the house where the fire began.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a great many rooms about this place. - A. Near one hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue at the inn after the time that you returned to it. - A. I think I might stay up about an hour, then I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then had any other fire taken place in any other room than that garret. - A. I understood there had, I saw it in the morning, at No. 27; I slept at the further extremity from the fire, I heard nothing of it till the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me how many firemen there were. - A. Thirty or forty I think; I left them there when I went to Mrs. Williams, I think they were encreased when I came back; and when I got up in the morning the firemen were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Williams seem anxious of extinguishing the fire. - A. He did; when I came to him in the bar, to ask him to let the firemen have a little liquor, he told me to do as I like, and take it to them to increase their exertion, which I did.</p>

The next day I saw Triggey, I asked him if he could ascertain by what means the fire happened, his answer was, he did not know, he was not there when the fire began; I asked him how the second<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080059"/> fire began, he said it must be by removing the furniture from one place to another. A day or two after he told me had been examined, and the company were perfectly satisfied.</p>

            . - Mr. Alley. What are you. - A. I am an attorney, I live in Leatherseller's-buildings, London Wall. I am the son of the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the fire were you at the Swan and Two Necks. - A. Yes, I attended my father about eight o'clock in the evening; I heard the alarm of fire at the inn, I went as a friend of Mr. Williams; I found the house in great confusion; the first fire had been put out. I was in the bar, I saw persons carrying things backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether they had candles or lights in their hands. - A. There was a great many lights carried about; when the fire was said to be extinguished Mr. Williams seemed exhausted by fatigue; there was a second alarm of fire when I was there; when that second fire was extinguished, Triggey came into the bar, he was warm, and appeared as if he had exhausted himself on the occasion; he complained of persons moving the goods from one room to another, and he thinking it his duty, had gone into several rooms, and by accident saw the second fire; he said it was by the d - d foolish conduct of carrying the things from one room to another.</p>
               <p>MR. WATERHOUSE. - Mr. Serjeant Best. I believe you have some interest in this inn. - A. I am the landlord; the horses belong to me.</p>
               <p>Q. The tavern part to Mr. Williams. - A. Yes; I carry on the coach business. When the fire was first discovered, I had just been round all my stables to see that all was right; there is seven mails go from my yard of a Sunday night at six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave the alarm of fire. - A. I think one of Mr. Williams's servants, he hallooed out to me he believed the stables were on fire; I told him it was impossible to be there, because I had just left the stable; I looked into the front yard which adjoins the stables, I discovered it blazing out; I then said it is in the house. Mr. Williams's waiter or porter, I don't know which, he run in the house and called Mr. Williams from the bar parlour; he came running to me, and said my stable was on fire; it did appear to a person coming from where he was, as if it came from the stable; it is a double roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Williams take any pains to put the fire out. - A. He immediately called his servants together, and told them to get the keys of the church to put the best of his plate and furniture in.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have some interest in this concern. A. Yes, I should have been ruined had not the fire been got under, I am not half insured.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave the order for the engines. - A. Mr. Williams and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember of there being any failure of water for the supply of the engines. - A. We are supplied with water from two companies, the New River and the Thames; the New River pipe failed. I communicated it to Mr. Williams, he said that he was afraid that we should all be burned down and ruined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Triggey. - A. I saw him the next day; I wished to see where these fires had been, and what damage had been done; he took me to the wood room garret.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take you all round. - A. No, to no other place than that; I asked him how he could account for that, he said God knows how the first began, he said he could not account for the other, no way but this, but by the confusion of the servants leaving candles in the rooms too close to the bed furniture.</p>

               <p>Q. After the engines did arrive was that fire got completely out. - A. I believe it was; I did not see the second fire till the next day, that was in No. 27; Mr. Williams went to bed soon after one o'clock; he gave me the keys of the bar, he said I might as well set up during the remainder of the night. About three o'clock in the morning the firemen came to the bar door and knocked, they told me they thought it was not all safe; they asked me to give them candles, I did. That fire was in No. 16.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the alarm of that fire; did you call Mr. Williams. - A. I did, I found him in No. 61, or 62; he was in bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to your shop. - A. I do, on the 11th of February, between eight and nine in the morning; she came into the shop alone, as she had frequently done before; there was a girl waiting outside of the shop. I had frequently turned the prisoner away for bringing of bad money. She came that morning for a quarter of an ounce of thread, which came to a penny, I gave it her, she produced the sixpence which I have here; I gave her five pennyworth of halfpence in change; she then went out of the shop. In a few minutes after, the girl that was with her came into the shop, she produced a fellow sixpence to the one that I had taken; she wanted a quarter of an ounce of thread; I told her I thought the sixpence was bad, I returned her the sixpence she gave me, keeping the other. She went away. After shewing both the sixpences to one of the partners, I went out of the shop on purpose to follow them. I saw Mr. Browning, an assistant in the shop, he went in pursuit of them; I have had it ever since (producing it).</p>
               <p>- BROWNING. Q. You also assist in this shop of Messrs. Wells and Fisher. - A. I do; I pursued the prisoner, I had seen the girl in the shop, I afterwards saw the girl join in company with the prisoner. I followed them down Fetter-lane till they came to Hatton-garden; the girl went into a shop and offered a bad sixpence; I went for an officer, and while I was gone the girl made her escape. When I came back the officer took the prisoner in custody.</p>
