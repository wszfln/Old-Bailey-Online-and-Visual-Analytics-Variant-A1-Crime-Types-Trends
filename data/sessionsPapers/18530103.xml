                  </hi>. A short time ago I was living at the Golden Horse public house—I took that house through an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi>—in consequence of the advertisement I called on the defendant Wynn—I told him I had seen and advertisement in the paper of a public house called the Red Lion, in Great Wild-street, and it stated that the man was going to Australia or something of that sort—he gave me a ticket to go and view it—I went and saw it—he also gave me a ticket to see the Golden Horse at the same time—I saw the Red Lion first—I went over it, but did not like the character of the house, and declined to take it—I then called at the Golden Horse, in Theobald's-road—I have not got the ticket he gave me to view it—I destroyed it—I destroyed it—the ticket was to the effect that the Golden Horse was to be let, rent and taxes included, at 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; lease, ten years and a half; premium, 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and doing 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per month—Mrs. Paxton showed me over the house; I liked the appearance of it—I saw Mr. Wynn again the following morning, at his office, 7, Sidney-street, City-road; it is a small broker's office, like the generality of brokers' office—I agreed to take possession on the following Thursday—I think it must have been the 29th Aug. that I saw him again at his office; it was either the 28th or 29th, I am not certain which—I told him that I preferred the Golden Horse of the two; he said it was a very nice little house, and he had no doubt a man could do very well there—he accompanied me down, and saw Mr. and Mrs. Paxton—Mr. Wynn introduced me, saying he thought he had brought a purchaser, and accordingly I went in—Paxton said there was a lease—I do not know exactly what passed between Paxton and myself on that occasion, but it was very trifling; he did not seem to be the person that looked to the business; his wife seemed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301030002"/>
               <p>to be the business part altogether—I did not go over the house again, I was satisfied—in going down, Wynn told me that if I liked he could get me the house for 155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was asked 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the first place, and I thought it was very cheap, and was going to give that sum for it—I made no deposit at Paxton's house; that was at my own apartment, on the same day—we agreed there, and I agreed to take possession on the following Thursday—Wynn was with me when I paid the deposit—my wife was also present—Wynn acted as my broker, and as Paxton's too—when I paid him the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit I told him I would prefer my own broker—he said there was no occasion for employing another broker, as it was purchased by the lump—he made out that he could do the business for both of us, and that would make the thing more reasonable—therefore as I thought he was a respectable man I <hi rend="italic">gave in</hi> directly that he was to do it—the purchase was to be settled on 2nd Sept., the Thursday, at the Golden Horse, when I took possession—I went there on the Thursday, took my goods, and took possession—Mr. Young, a collector at Messrs. Gardner's brewery, and Mr. Shand, a collector at Messrs. Curtis' distillery, were present—Mr. Wynn and Mr. Paxton were there, and the gauger to gauge the spirits, whose name I forget—he was to gauge the spirits for both of us—Mr. Young was there gauging the beer, and Mr. Shand, the distiller's clerk, was there seeing to the stock, because they took to the stock; it was to remain on the premises for me; it was what is termed a transfer—all the goods on the premises belong to the brewer or the distiller, and they transfer it from one person to the other; that is the custom of the trade—this is the account that was made out by Wynn—(<hi rend="italic">this being read stated the items of the purchase, and the deduction for the stock, making the balance payable by the prosecutor to Paxton of</hi> 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—there is an item of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, which I paid to Wynn for the brokerage—I got this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Paxton, at the Golden Horse—it was given me along with that which is called the lease—it was to certify that the lease was all right, and that Paxton had paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it is a receipt—when Wynn gave it me he said, "This is the receipt for the making up of the lease"—he said Paxton had paid for it, and that was the receipt (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Received this 15th March, 1852, of Mr. John Paxton, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., being charges in respect of the lease of the Golden Horse public house, Theobald's-road, Bloomsbury, granted by the executors of the late Mr. Howe to Mr. Rosson. <hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">J. W. ILIFF</hi>, for <hi rend="smallCaps">H. DREW</hi>")—I think Mrs. Paxton took the lease out of a drawer, and said, "This is the lease," and Wynn said, "Oh, yes, sir, this is the lease, shall I read it for you? or you can read it yourself if you like"—I am not a very clever reader of writing, so I told Mr. Wynn I should trust entirely to his honour and respectability to read it for me, and he read it, but I find there is a clause in it that he never read to me—I attended to it as he read it over; he read it aloud, part of it very loud—here is a proviso at the bottom of this page, "Provided also, and it is hereby agreed and declared, that it shall be lawful for either of the parties hereto, or his or their representatives, to determine the term hereby granted at Christmas-day, 1852, or upon Christmas-day in any subsequent year thereof, by giving to the other party a notice of his or their intention, such notice to be given on or before the Midsummer-day next preceding the intended determination, to be given to the said executors, or left for them at their respective usual or last known places of abode"—a part of that was read over to me, but not all—I remember that part about notice to be given on or before the Midsummer-day next preceding the day of the intended determination, but that part about giving up possession at Christmas, 1852, was not mentioned; nothing whatever was read about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301030003"/>
               <p>Christmas—I was not told by either of them that any notice had been given to determine the tenancy at Christmas, 1852, or else of course I should not have taken it—I was not told by either of them, at any time, that notice to quit at Christmas had been given—I paid the balance according to their statement, and took possession of the premises—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given me by Wynn, as an inventory of the goods there—about two months after this two gentlemen called on me respecting my quitting the premises—I do not know who they were—they came respecting the house and yard; it appears that the place was put up by auction—they told me they were in treaty for the house—in consequence of what they said I went to Wynn, and told him that there had been a party from him looking at the house, and one was a lawyer's clerk, who came to see his friend righted—I told Wynn it appeared the lease was a complete failure, and that I was liable to be turned out at a moment's notice; that the lawyer's clerk who read it told me I had no more right behind the bar than he had, and that I was to quit at Christmas—he said I had no right to have shown the lease till I had got a deposit—Wynn was negotiating for me—I told him the business did not suit me, I wanted to sell it—I showed the parties who came for the lease, and they found out the clause that was in the lease, and told me of it—one week I took 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the house, and I have taken as low as 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I wanted to dispose of it, because I should have soon been in the workhouse; it did not produce 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, it did not produce more than 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—about a month before Christmas Mr. Linder, the executor, called and asked me if I was ready to quit at Christmas—I do not think I saw Wynn after that—I saw Paxton two or three days after Mr. Linder called on me—I found him at a public house at the comer of Robert-street, Little James-street; he was smoking his pipe: it was at night, after he had done work (I had called the evening before that, and seen him at his own house)—I asked him to come out, and to come to the door, that I wanted to speak to him, and I told him that Mr. Linder said I must leave at Christmas, and that a person of the name of Holmer, a wheelwright, had bought the property, and paid a deposit of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it, and he had taken possession of the yard, but of course he could not take possession of the house till I was out of it—I asked him if he would come to any arrangement, that it was hard for me to lose all—he told me he had no money—I asked him what had become of all the money I had paid him—he said he had paid it away, that he had borrowed 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he went into the house, and during the time he was in it, he had managed to pay it back, out of the profits, I understood him; and about two or three minutes after he told me he had lost 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it—I told him if he did not come to some arrangement I should take proceedings against him—he told me that he was taken in; he was sorry to see me there, of course, but he would not come to any terms with me, and when I said I should take proceedings against him he smiled, and said, "Well, I might do the best I could," or something of that sort—I think he said he had borrowed the money of his mother—I told him he had had notice to quit in June, and he ought to have told me that—he said he did not take any notice of the notice—he mentioned something about the lease after I had spoken to him about the notice that he had had—he said, "What a rascally thing that lease was"—that was all he said—I have had two brokers to value the things in the inventory.</p>

               <p>he said he had paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more for the place than I did—I was a publican before I took these premises, and had been so three or four years—the part of the clause of the lease that I remember Wynn's reading to me, was about the notice to be given on or before the Midsummer day preceding the day of the intended determination of the term, and the notice to be left at the executor's last known place of abode—nothing was read about Christmas day, that was left out entirely—that I swear—after the lease was read by Wynn it was put down on the table—I had signed an agreement which Wynn made out before that, which my lawyer has—I forget exactly whether it was signed before or after the lease was read—it was given to Paxton—I believe Paxton paid for it—it was signed the same evening, 28th August, I think—as far as I remember, it was after Wynn had read the lease out—I have had the paper called the lease ever since—I do not know whether Mr. Knight is here to-day, I have not brought him—I heard from Paxton that Knight had told him he was to take no notice of the notice, and I went to Mr. Knight, and asked him—he lives in Carnaby-market—Mr. Holmer told me he gave 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the premises, for the lease of the lot, and that he paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit on it—I am not able to say how much of the stock I had consumed from 28th August to 2nd December—I went to my lawyer about this as soon as I found I was in <hi rend="italic">fix</hi>—that was about three weeks ago—the lawyer went to a Magistrate—I have not been before a Magistrate; I come here to tell my story for the first time, to-day—I was not generally in the habit of getting drunk in this house—publicans are liable to it, now and then—I did not get so every day; I do not suppose I was drunk above three or four times while I was there—I have been a little inebriated, but not to say drunk—that was not every day—I really cannot say how often I have been drunk or inebriated since I have had these premises—I did not take any notice of it, I do not put down day and date for such a thing as that—I have seen Mr. Knight on this subject—I saw him last about eight or ten days ago, and I saw him about three weeks ago, and spoke to him about Paxton's notice—I have not seen him very often, I dare say I have seen him four or five times during the time I was in the house, not more—Paxton <hi rend="italic">showed</hi> nothing in the business; he did not tell me he had been a carpenter at Cubitt's—I have since learned that he was for years a carpenter at Cubitt's—I have not had to say a right offer made to me for the house when the lawyer's clerk came; I had an offer of 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, after I found out that I was to quit at Christmas, and I told the man I could not let it—I did not tell him I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> not, I told him I <hi rend="italic">should</hi> not let it; I could not, it was out of my power—he made me an offer of 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. through his broker—I told him I could not take it; he came the following day himself, and I mentioned the transaction to him, and said, "Why, I have been taken in in this house, and it won't do, and I shan't, or can't, let it"—I swear that was all I told him—that conversation was since Mr. Linder the executor called on me—I found out in less than a fortnight that the business did not answer—I advertised it about three months ago, but not since—the broker advertised it in November, I do not remember its being advertised in December—I do not remember authorizing the broker to advertise it in December, I might have done so, but I do not think it was in December—I certainly did not advertise it after I had seen Mr. Linder; I swear that—I did not give anybody else authority to advertise it—I spoke to Paxton about the lease soon after I was there; I spoke to him about the trade and about the lease; not to complain of the notice in the lease, but to complain of the trade—I said what a pity it was that with such a good lease to the house the trade was so bad; the lease was then in my cupboard</p>

               <p>I had not read it, and I did not then refer to it—I never read it all over till after this lawyer's clerk read it, and found cut this clause—I have taken it up to read over and over again, and somebody has come in, and I have thrown it down, I never finished it—it must have been early in November that the lawyer's clerk came—I did not to my knowledge advertise it on 25th Nov.—I cannot swear it was not done with my authority; I do not believe it was advertised on my authority—it must have been in the early part of November that the broker advertised it—I will not swear it was not past the middle of November—I paid the money on Thursday, 2nd Sept., I signed the agreement on 28th August.</p>

On 15th Nov. he went with me in my cart to London—when we were coming from Edmonton I lent him a great coat—I said, "Put this on; it will keep you dry"—he put it on, and when we got to the County Court he said he wanted to go out for a necessary purpose—he went out with the coat on, and I never saw him again till the officer took him, which, I think, was three weeks or more afterwards—he had been in regular work for me, assisting the potman, and doing what he could about the house, and acting as ostler—I should have thought he would have been the last man in the world to have done such a thing—I have not seen my coat since—he says he sold it in Petticoat-lane.</p>

Gentlemen,—We are in receipt of your favour of yesterday, and note we can have fifteen steerage passengers, at 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and will, in course of a post or two, let you know how many more we can engage, and what class; as also forward you the names and ages of those positively booked. If you can inform us what vessel you have sailing about the middle of Oct., we can at once positively guarantee you a certain number of passengers. Please let us hear from you as to this.")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you with Mr. Thompson from the commencement? <hi rend="italic">A. No</hi>; I think I was with him about six months—I only know from what he told me, that his brother died after the business began—I was there when Mr. Wanostrocht came, I think that was in Aug., or the latter end of July, he represented Baines and Co.—I did not see Mr. Thompson pay him between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I know that he had a large sum of money for that purpose, it was the accumulation of passage moneys that had been paid; that was the money for one ship, I think it was the <hi rend="italic">El Dorado</hi>—I was not present at any portion of the time when the conversation took place between Mr. Thompson and Mr. Wanostrocht; it was in a private office, I heard no part of their conversation—there were a great many complaints about the non<lb/>payment of detention money, that is money given for the time of their being delayed from sailing, money paid back to the passengers—I know that in a great many instances it was paid by Mr. Thompson—in consequence of these various payments, Mr. Thompson's funds were very much reduced—he remained at the office up to the commencement of Oct. I think, or about the latter end of Sept.—at the time I met him at Paddington I made known to him that warrants were out against him—his papers and books had not then been seized; that was done at the last examination at the Mansion House—when I told him that warrants had been issued against him, he did not say that that fact would ruin him; he said he hoped to settle it—I am not aware that he said it would so damage his character as to ruin him—I cannot exactly tell how many cases he did settle, or how much money he paid; I know it was a large sum—that was paid in consequence of the repeated applications at the Mansion House—there was a very frequent correspondence between Messrs. Baines and Mr. Thompson, and also telegraphic messages—when Mr.</p>

               <p>Thompson was absent from the office, I had authority to open the letters from Liverpool—I acted upon the instructions in those letters in Mr. Thompson's absence—I treated Mr. Thompson as the agent of Baines and Co throughout—I know that he has paid them thousands of pounds in the course of the last year—that was all passage money—as far as I know, they never repudiated his authority until after the public investigation at the Mansion House—I saw all the letters that came—the large sums of money were paid on account of parties that shipped from Liverpool—(<hi rend="italic">looking at two letters</hi>) I have seen these before, I acted upon them—cards of Mr. Thompson's were circulated respecting the <hi rend="italic">South Sea.</hi> and I believe advertisements were inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>; there were also placards—Mr. Wanostrocht took several of them—I believe I have seen Mr. Baines at the office, but I could not swear to it; I believe I have—I am not aware that Mr. Baines saw any of these placards—I do not know Mr. Mackay—I have had frequent opportunities of witnessing the conduct and character of Mr. Thompson, and from everything I have seen and heard I believe him to be an honourable man—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some papers</hi>) these are the telegraphic despatches that have been received from Baines and Co.—I know of no other business between Mr. Baines and Mr. Thompson except that which had reference to the emigrants' shipping—I know there is such a firm as Fry and Davison, I am not aware that Mr. Thompson has acted for them, not while I was in his service, nor for Marshall and Etheridge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a ship-broker and ship-owner, at Liverpool, Captain Brett is the owner of the <hi rend="italic">South Sea</hi>—we were agents for the vessel in Liverpool—John Jaffery and Co., of Great St, Helens, were the London agents of the vessel—I know the father of the defendant, he was repeatedly at our office in June last, making inquiry about the Black Ball line of packets; you will find a correspondence before you concerning it—I cannot recollect the first time I saw the prisoner, as the older gentleman was the person we always saw—I have known the prisoner probably since about Aug.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he in any way, and if so, to what extent, employed by you in reference to the <hi rend="italic">South Sea</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We made arrangements with Thompson Brothers, not only with the <hi rend="italic">South Sea.</hi> but with previous vessels, to take passengers from them at a certain rate; it was no business of ours whether they got a profit or loss—we used to take a certain number usually by each ship, and if we could take more we used to send them word—the <hi rend="italic">South Sea</hi> was the last vessel—we arranged to take certain passengers on certain terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you at any time give the firm of Thompson Brothers, or the prisoner who represented the firm, any absolute authority to dispose of berths in the <hi rend="italic">South Sea</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We agreed, as you will find in the correspondence, to take fifteen passengers from them, and they had a perfect right to engage</p>

Thompson, nor the money; we could not know those persons any more than any strangers who presented themselves.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that your general mode of dealing with Messrs. Thompson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, my universal mode of dealing; as I said before, if we made an arrangement for fifteen or twenty passengers, and afterwards found we could take more, we afterwards wrote or telegraphed them so, on the same terms; Mr. Wanostrocht was in my office at the time, he is a friend of mine, he is not a paid servant, he acted for us—I do not recollect his paying me between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of Thompson Brothers, in the beginning of Aug., but it is very likely—I have no doubt of it, I cannot speak positively as to the time, it might be July or Aug., but this I know that we took a large number of passengers from Thompson's—they paid us a certain amount in checks, and Mr. Wanostrocht being in London, had authority to call and receive the balance; I dare say they have paid me upwards of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the last year—Mr. Mackay is interested in a number of the ships, he is interested in the Australian trade with me, but not in my general business; this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is my writing; the last remark is written by Mr. Mackay—independent of Thompson Brothers sending passengers to us they had similar transactions with almost every house in Liverpool—there is nothing due to us from them.</p>

The Jury expressing their opinion that the evidence was not conclusive</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employment of Messrs. Hodgkinson, who carry on business as wholesale druggists, at No. 213, Upper Thamesstreet—many of the articles in which they deal are of a valuable kind—the prisoner Charles Witham Harridge was an assistant in the employment—he was in the dry department—that is the department in which drugs of a valuable kind are kept—we keep salacine and quinine there—I remember the policeman Evans calling upon me—it was on Wednesday, 1st Dec—in consequence of what he said to me, I went to Mr. Slipper's, a retail druggist in Leather-lane—I there saw certain drugs which Mr. Slipper said he had purchased—they were shown to me in the presence of the officer Who accompanied me—I returned immediately and communicated to the firm what I had learnt; and one of the firm, Mr. Tonge, fetched a bottle of salacine from the warehouse, and in my presence he scratched the label on the bottle, and requested me, being resident on the premises, when all the other servants were gone, to mark others—I did so on the same day, the 1st Dec.—the labels on the bottles are blue, and printed in gold; it is a French preparation—I marked other bottles in the same way—the salacine was marked the same evening, and the quinine I marked on Sunday, Dec. 5th, nothing was said about quinine on the 1st—I marked the quinine with invisible ink—I marked it in consequence of some further information which I got from Mr. Slipper—I had been to Mr. Slipper's, and desired him to ask for more quinine—after marking the salacine and quinine, I replaced them in their several places whence they were taken—that was a place to which Charles Harridge had access; it was in the dry department—these were not wet goods, they are powders—I afterwards called on Mr. Slipper, on 9th Dec, in consequence of a communication from him, and he showed me some salacine and quinine; there was eight ounces of quinine, and four ounces of salacine; they were parts of the quinine and salacine that I had marked—they were in one ounce bottles.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been in the service of Messrs. Hodgkinson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between eleven and twelve years; I think the prisoner Charles has been there between two and three years—it may be possibly more, but I think not three years—I should imagine that he must have come with a high character, he came from a respectable customer—the firm usually take great care of that circumstance—the firm consists of five partners; they are all in the business—there are between thirty and forty servants—there are several persons who have access to the dry department, no strangers are ever there—persons coming there to deal would not have access there; they could not—the quinine was kept in a chest locked—that is in the department of Charles Harridge—there is a key which is kept on a post before the warehouseman, for the use of the others—anybody could have access to it whose business it was to procure goods for the wrappers—there are only three in that department—either of those three would have an opportunity of taking it; that would not apply to a porter—when a person had an order, he would go and take the key and go to the chest, and take any quantity he wanted for his order—he would not ask the warehouseman for permission, if the warehouseman was there he would see him—he is not always there, he is mostly—Charles Harridge was in that department—I am sure of that—he was a weigher, it was his business to procure these things—he was in the room where the quinine was kept—the other weighers were also there—the prisoner would not have to weigh quinine,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301030019"/>
               <p>it is kept already weighed in one ounce bottles; a weigher would have to procure goods from different parts of the warehouse, and take them to the wrappers—he would not have to apply to the warehouseman for an order to take quinine if he wanted it, he would take the key and proceed to the chest—there is no permission required from the warehouseman, I presume it is merely a safeguard against the porters—I cannot say whether the prisoner ever got any quinine in his life, he may have done so, I cannot say that her has, I was a clerk in the counting-house—he was not a wrapper—I believe it was not the practice for the wrappers to get the quinine, but being a clerk in the warehouse I do not know the exact minutiæ of the thing—I know the practice of the warehouse—it is the duty of the weigher to proceed to any part of the warehouse to procure such articles as the wrapper may require—I presume quinine is no exception to any other article—a weigher is a man who weighs—the quinine is not weighed at the time, it is in bottles kept ready for delivery—the weigher would have no occasion to go to the quinine for the purpose of weighing it, he would have to procure it for his wrapper; the wrapper always stands at the counter—I believe the prisoner Charles is between twenty-two and twenty-three years of age.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retail druggist, of Leather-lane. I know the prisoner, Henry Harridge; I have always known him by the name of Humphreys—I think I first became acquainted with him in June last—I have made purchases of drugs of him on several occasions—in consequence of what transpired on the matter, I communicated with our wholesale druggist, and they sent the police to me—Evans was the man that I saw—it was principally quinine that I purchased of Henry Harridge, nitrate of silver, and iodine—it was in June that I made the first purchase—I should think I made purchases of Henry Harridge about twelve or fourteen times—upon Mr. Joseph calling upon me, after seeing the police, I made a communication to him, and showed him some drugs—in consequence of directions from Mr. Joseph I sent to No. 418, Strand, to Humphreys, for 8 ozs. of quinine and 4 ozs. of salacine—I received them on 9th Dec, I think—Henry Harridge brought them to me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—each bottle of quinine contains an ounce—one of the bottles was tested by acid before the Magistrate—this is it—I have eight of these bottles—I have a mark of my own on them; these are the bottles I purchased of Henry Harridge—I paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an oz. for the quinine, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for the salacine—at that time I was in communication with the police—after I had made this purchase, I sent for Mr. Joseph and showed him these articles.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301030020"/>
               <p>brought it—I have seen that person once since, but I do not know him—I saw him last on the 7th or 8th Dec., I did not order anything of him then; the only order I gave him was in June—he called on me to solicit orders—he did not mention quinine, or anything specially, but simply to solicit orders—Henry Harridge had then received my order for these things—drugs are purchased at sales to a very considerable extent—I purchased the first lot without any hesitation—this quinine was manufactured in France; the salacine I should imagine is either German or Italian, by the appearance of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the discount allowed to the trade on these articles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe quinine is a net article generally, or there may be 2 1/2 per cent. discount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Hodgkinson, but to another wholesale house that I do business with, Davey, Macmurdo, and Co.—I mentioned it to their traveller at the latter end of July—I had not bought anything from June to July; I have not sold the goods that I bought, I have kept them—I first gave 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., an oz. for the quinine; in July I gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it was that transaction that I first mentioned—the memorandum I am referring to is taken from my book, my cash book is not here.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let us understand—you say you made a purchase in June, and afterwards communicated to your wholesale druggist—how soon after that did you come into communication with the police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think about the middle of Oct.—the purchases which I made from the middle of Oct. down to the present time were known to the police—these things that have been produced are a portion of what I purchased on 9th Dec.—this is the mark which I made myself, it is merely the price and date—I also marked the salacine—I made a mark on all the bottles.</p>

I owed the prisoner was a bet which I lost at the end of the year—Mr. John Hodgkinson may have betted with his clerks; I never saw it, I have heard it, it may be so, I have heard that it was so—if I am bound to believe what I hear, I believe it—I am not aware that Mr. John</p>

               <p>Hodgkinson is here, I have not seen him here—I did not owe any other debts of honour—Mr. John Hodgkinson it the head partner—I am sure this was the only debt of honour I owed; I have had three gambling transactions in the last nine months; I think it is only fair to state what I have done during that time—in April last I had a transaction with the prisoner—I receive 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I have access to the musk; all the young men have access to it—I know this musk by the quality of it, (<hi rend="italic">examining it</hi>,) I will swear to the quality of it—there are some small gray hairs in it, which I placed in the bottle with the musk—that is uncommon—it it a custom that I have adopted, merely to give an appearance to the musk, to identify it—I can identify it from the hairs; I have done that for eighteen months—there has been a considerable quantity of the musk sold during that time—there was hair in that—we are wholesale chemists—the hair is taken from the outside of the pod of the musk, it grows on the pod, it is not part of the musk itself, musk is a grain—the hair was not intended for adulteration—I took the hair off the surface of the pod and kept it in a bottle, and added a small quantity to the grain musk, so that I could detect at any time whether or not the musk was sold from us—it is not commonly found in musk—I have seen it with other chemists—I have not seen it from other chemists in the same way—I have not seen hair in musk supplied from other chemists, they may do it—I have not said that I have seen it; there are two qualities of musk—this is the finest quality; the difference in quality varies very much, it is perceptible, it is very different in flavour, the finest is dry, and easily pulverised; the common musk is soft, devoid of flavour, and requires a great deal of time to get into powder—the finest comes from China; it is the prodace of an animal, a rat or a cat, it is a particular part of the body—the value of it is 80<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—this quantity produced is worth 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. On 5th Dec. I examined a room, in which the young men's boxes are kept, where they change their clothes—I examined the box used by the prisoner—I saw this musk in it—Green and Cotty, two other clerks, were there to assist me—I did not mark the musk—it was wrapped up in three separate papers—I looked at it, but, not having any experience in the warehouse, I did not examine it, but Green weighed it in my presence—there was forty-two grains—I afterwards missed it from the box on the following Sunday, Dec. 12th—the prisoner was taken into custody on Tuesday, Dec. 14th—there was some musk produced at the Mansion-house as from the prisoner's lodging—I have every reason to believe it was the same musk, and the same quality, that I had seen in the box; for when it was produced at the Mansion-house, it had three papers round it, and appeared to be precisely the same.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was the box in which you first saw it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a portion of the warehouse where the young men change their clothes—each has a separate box where he keeps his working dress—it is not locked; in fact the cover is loose altogether—they keep their working dress there—I think in this box there was a pair of trowsers, and a coat, or blouse, or something of that kind, a great number of letters, and the musk—the musk was in among the letters—it was on Sunday, Dec. 5th, that I saw it—I cannot tell you why it was not taken possession of then—I have not done anything in the betting line lately; I have done so—I think I have done so twice with the prisoner, but not within the last two years—I did not identify the musk by the hair—I think the reason why we did not take possession of the musk then was, because it was strongly suspected that the prisoner was robbing the firm, and it was left in order to see whether it would be removed or not;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301030024"/>
               <p>on the following morning I communicated that fact to the firm, immediately on their arrival—I communicated it to Mr. Thomas Hodgkinson—he has been here to-day—I also communicated it to Mr. Tonge—the box it was in has not been removed—it belongs to the firm—the letters were removed by the officers—they were not taken away at the same time as the musk—I am positive about that—the letters remained there till after he was taken into Custody, and the officers came there and removed everything that belonged to him.</p>

Grossmith's shop, and saw her—she came out, and I went in, and received some information—I came out, and saw the prisoner between Foster-lane and the end of Cheapside—he went down Foster-lane—I followed him, and stopped him in Carey-lane—I told him I suspected he had some base coin about him—his hand was in his pocket at the time—I turned him round, and a witness who is here said, "One of you gentlemen has dropped a glove"—I saw a glove lying; I took it up—it contained nine half crowns, wrapped in separate papers—I did not drop the glove.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Knightsbridge. One 18th Dec. I met a young man for whom I had been making a waistcoat, near the bar at Kensington—he paid me for the waistcoat, and we went into the Goat, and had some bread and cheese, and a pint of ale—I saw four persons there—the prisoner was one of them—I had no talk with them—they were passing some remarks on me; what it was I do not know—I and the young man left the public house about 12 o'clock—we went down the Gloucester-road—I observed the four persons that I bad seen in the public-house were following us—my friend left me just by the Gloucester-road, and I waited a few minutes as I saw the four men following me—I waited till the placeman came—he passed, and they were wishing him good night—I waited a few minutes for them to go—they came up to me, and smothered my face in mud, and the prisoner said, "Pin the b—r's petticoats over her head"—my pocket was cut off, and they opened a knife, and said they would rip me up if I hallooed—I hallooed "Murder!" and "Police!"—they took my handkerchiefs and my money, and all ran away—when the policeman came up, I went to the station—the prisoner was not taken till the next day—I did not see him before the Tuesday—this happened on Saturday evening—the prisoner cut my eye with his fist—it was one who was not taken who cut my pocket off—the prisoner was by at the time—my gown and shawl were torn.</p>

I have seen Reardon, Sullivan, and Flynn on the works at that immense building in St. Paul's Churchyard, opposite the south door of St. Paul's Church—on the evening of 20th Dec. I saw three men go up and down the ladders between 6 and 8 o'clock at night, and they crossed some boards, and pulled some lead off a house belonging to Mr. William Cook—in consequence of what I saw I set Joyce and another man to watch.</p>

In consequence of what was told me by the last witness, I watched the premises—I saw Sullivan go up the ladder—he stopped between five and ten minutes, cutting the lead—I do not know whether it was with a knife or what—Sullivan came down across the plank and down the ladder—Flynn then went up, and when he came down Sullivan went up again, and was cutting the lead again—he put a piece under each arm and brought it down—Reardon was standing at the foot of the ladder—he took the lead of them—I watched them, and never lost sight of them till they carried the lead into the marine store shop—Reardon is the man that carried it—both he and Sullivan went into the shop—Flynn followed them in—the shop is ten or twelve yards from the building—I had the policeman waiting in Swan-passage—I beckoned him, and said that all three were in the house—before he got dose to the house Flynn came out, and he caught him by the collar, and took him into the house—the other two prisoners were there—the officer said to the marine store dealer, "I demand that lead that these men have sold"—he stooped down behind the counter, and picked it up, and said, "Here is the lead; I have asked them where they got it from, and they told me they found it in the rubbish, and Flynn came in and said, 'It is all right, master'"—the policemen took these three men to the station—Flynn lives next door to the marine store dealer's—this is the lead which the three men had—it weight 15 lbs.—I cannot say how long Flynn has lived next door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing wharfinger to Messrs. Wilkinson, of Botolph Wharf, close to London-bridge. On 22nd Dec, about half-past 2 o'clock, in consequence of information I received from the watchman, I inquired of a man whether he had seen a man pass with a case on his head—I requested him to follow me into the street, and we traced a case containing sixty drums of figs, which had been lost, into a shop on Fish-street-hill, about 800 or 900 yards from the wharf—the prisoner was in the shop, in the act of placing the stolen case on a man's head—I knew the case, but not the man—I went up to them, and requested them not to trouble themselves to reload the case till the arrival of the police—Neill, the prisoner, said he had nothing to do with the matter; he was passing through the premises, and bad given the man who had carried it, a lift, placed it on his head—the other man stated, in Neill's presence, that Neill had employed him to carry it—the case was the property of Messrs. Wilkinsons—I had seen it before it was lost, standing with others in the lower part of the gateway of the wharf, within the premises—I know the prisoner—he is a supernumerary fellowship porter—he has worked in the neighbourhood, and carried cases of a similar description for parties in the neighbourhood for years—he was never employed by us, but has been in the constant habit of presenting orders to us from wholesale grocers in the neighbourhood—they employ him and send him to us—when he used to come in that way he brought a delivery note—had I met him with the case, I should not have suspected he had stolen it.</p>

Browning kept possession of him till the policeman came, and he was given into custody—after the other prisoner's clothes were torn, he ran away down the passage leading into Whitechapel, and my son afterwards came back with him in the custody of an officer—I missed some rum, and some spoons had been removed from their usual place, and tied up in some paper—I cannot say I had seen them the night before, but my servant says she did—I found the piece of the parlour shutter which laps over had been broken off, and the shutters wrenched open with a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—in running to the window I kicked against a hat which was in my way, it was given to the policeman—the rum tap was left running, but I cannot say whether any one had been to it; and</p>

               <p>I had left a bottle of rum on the counter the night before, that was partly emptied, and when the prisoners were brought back they smelt of rum.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in King's Head-court, at the side of Mr. Stainforth's—on the morning of 17th Dec., about half-past 7 o'clock, I went outside my door, with only my trowsers and boots on, to see what time it was; I looked towards Mr. Stainforth's (because if his house had been open I should have known it was near 8 o'clock) and saw the parlour shutters fly open, and saw Ward jump out of the window—I opened my arms, saying, "Holloa. holloa!" and he ran into my arms; before he got up to me, Young jumped out at the same window—I am quite sure Ward is the man—I had him in my hands five minutes before I let him go—I struggled with them both, and was hit in the back of my neck, but I do not know who by—I thought I had better make sure of one than lose both, and Ward tore his coat and got away—I held the other one till the officer came, and I gave him to him—almost as soon as Young jumped out of the window, Mr. Stainforth's son jumped out also, and I told him to follow Ward up, and said he would be sure to know him, as his shirt and waistcoat were all torn—shortly after I had given Young in custody, Ward was brought back by the son and a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the foremen at the Eastern Counties Railway; on 6th Dec., I asked Pike if he had taken any sweepings from the "D" floor, he said, "No"—I then asked if he had taken from "M" or "N," which are the next to "D," and the floor from which these sacks were missed—he said, "No," he had not been in there since last Friday—I did not give him any authority on Friday to take any sack out—I then asked if he was certain he had not put a sack of grain on a hand cart—he said, "Certainly not"—I told him to be sure about it—he said he had no business to put anything on a truck without my sanction, and he had not done it—this conversation was between 10 and 11 o'clock, and when he went to his dinner I watched him to Robin Hood-lane, which is a quarter of a mile, or more, from the Company's premises; I saw him go into a yard there where the prisoner Samuel's premises are—I left him there—I cannot say how long he remained there, he came back to his work at the usual time—he was taken into custody on the same day, a short time afterwards.</p>

I was at the Mansion House in the course of my duty, and saw Cockrell in the body of the Court—a foreigner, named Badoski, was to be examined for uttering forged notes, that day—I saw the prisoner in Court; he was at the further end of the Court when I first saw him—Mr. Cockrell called my attention to him—he was in my view a little better than an hour, I should think—I and Cockrell were standing together some part of the time, and the prisoner looked at us several times and got shifting towards the door (I was in plain clothes)—he kept shifting along a little, and at the end of one case which was being heard, there was a little bit of a <hi rend="italic">bustle</hi> in the Court, and he made a rush towards the door—I went up to him, caught hold of his arm, and said; "I want you"—he said, "Which station are you going to take me to?"—I told him I was going to take him to Bow-street police station—we got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> by the Mansion-house; when we got part of the way up Cheapside, I asked him if he knew what he was charged with; he said, "No"—I then told him he was charged with uttering a forged 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note at Bull and Wilson's, in St. Martin's-lane; he said, "Oh! I know Bull and Wilson's very well; I have had dealings with them"—we then went there for the young gentleman to come and press the charge against him—I searched him at the station, and found a petition to the Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police in his pocket, and asked him what it was; he said it was a petition to the Commissioners of Police, as he was desirous of getting into the police force, and the reason he was at the Mansion House was to see how business was conducted—he afterwards said he went there to get some gentlemen to sign the petition—I found several papers upon him, and among others this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in which I find the name of Johnson written in two places.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> And you find the names of Keys, Sears, and Gatehouse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not tell the Magistrate about the name—when I stopped the prisoner going out of the Court, I did not tell him he was charged with uttering a forged Bank of England note before he asked me what station I was going to take him to. (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, contained the words, "I told him he was charged with uttering a forged</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Bank of England note, and he asked me which station I was going to take him to.</hi>") When that was being read over to me by the clerk of the Court I stopped him, and said, "I beg your pardon; I did not mention anything about the note until we were half way up Cheapside," and he said, "It is immaterial"—I do not know the clerk's name; it was at Bow-street—I told the Magistrate that the prisoner said he was at the Mansion House to see how business was conducted, as he meant to go into the police, and I said I had found several papers in his pocket—I did not tell the clerk I had stated it, and that he had not put it down—Pocock told the Magistrate that the prisoner said he went there to get some gentlemen to sign the petition—I did not tell the Magistrate that among the things there was a book with the name of Johnson in it.</p>

I lived at the Three Cups, in Lower Shadwell—on that night I was in Sutton-street, St. George's in the East, on my way home, nearly opposite the George—I had for some time felt indisposed, and at that time I felt very sick—I sat down on the step of a doorway—I observed two men coming towards me, arm in arm, and a third man was following me—I had not been sitting half a minute before they got to me—I had scarcely sat down—the two men put their arms through mine, pinioning my arms back—they put their arms under mine, and lifted me up with their arms, and pinioned my arms back—they raised me up on my feet—one man was on each side of me—they said, "Here is a man drunk and ill—let us take him home"—I was perfectly sober—I said, "Hold hard, let me alone"—and then the third person put his arm round my neck, and gagged me back—he did not come in front of me, he was behind—he put his arm round my neck and got hold of his hand with his other hand, and pulled me back, rendering me almost insensible—I can identify the prisoner as the man who had hold of my left arm—he robbed my left-hand pocket, and the other robbed my right hand pocket—the prisoner put his hand into my left hand waistcoat pocket, where I had a half crown—I had seen it about half an hour previous to that time—the man on my right side put his hand into my other pocket—the prisoner then let go my arm and struck me a violent blow in my stomach with his fist, and at the same moment I fell down—I had five halfpence</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Queen-street, Wapping. I recollect the night of 18th Dec.—I recollect being in Neptune-street, round the square, near the Cock and Neptune—I saw the last witness there, and Carr and Chesney came one on each side of him, and looked at him—I knew him before by going to his house—I asked Carr and Chesney to buy a box of lucifers of me—there were 500 in a box—they told me to run away home, or they would give me in charge of a policeman—there was a policeman near the Sailor's Home, and then seeing him, they let the old gentleman pass them by—I went to a pair of large doors and hid myself—it was before he passed the Cock and Neptune that these men went and looked at him—it was up in the square, a lonesome place, very dark—I hid myself and watched, and I saw Carr put his arm round his neck to choke him, and Chesney hit him in the eye—I saw Swanton there—he took hold of Mr. Jewill's coat to pull him back—a gentleman and lady were coming down the street, and they disturbed</p>

               <p>these men, and they chucked the old gentleman down on the ground and ran away—before they threw him down there were four men, and I saw the fourth man putting his arm round Mr. Jewill's neck, and he pulled the guard up—it was a gold guard—I should know that fourth man if I were to see him—he succeeded in getting the chain—he pulled it up, the man who is not here.</p>

On 21st Dec, between 8 and 9 in the morning, I saw the prisoner go into my employers' new warehouse with an empty wrapper—he had no business there, he is not in our employ—he came out again with a large parcel in the wrapper under his arm—it appeared to be the same wrapper he had taken in with him—I went after him, caught him and said, "You are a thief!" and threw him down—to the best of my belief he said nothing to that—thinking he might have some accomplices, I sent for a young man named Stevens to take charge of the goods while I took the prisoner; I took him into Knowles-court, and directed one of the porters to secure him, by tying him to a lamp post till my employers came; which I saw done—one end of the wrapper was undone, and I saw a piece of twill or Coburg cloth, of a red colour, in the wrapper—I gave the wrapper to the policeman in the same state I had taken it from the prisoner, and gave the</p>

I received information of this burglary on the evening of the 25th, and went to the shop of Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker, in Chiswell-street, St. Luke's—I there saw Edward Greaves, and received from him this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I received information from him; in consequence of which, I went on the following morning, at 11 o'clock, to a house, No. 11, Foster's-buildings, Whitecross-street, St. Luke's, where I saw the witness Mary Hill, and the prisoner Watts was sitting in the room; before I said anything as to what I had come about, the witness Hill said, in Watts' hearing, "I know what you have come about; I know all about it, I had the watch from this girl, "meaning Watts—Watts replied," Oh, yes; I received it from a young man"—while I was talking to her, I saw Watts pass this duplicate to a woman who was in bed, and concealed under the bedclothes—I then took Watts into custody, on suspicion of stealing the watch, and took possession of the duplicate, which I now produce—it is dated 25th Nov., and is for a "S. watch," that means a silver watch, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the name of Watts—the name of the pawnbroker is John Thomas Hawes, 98, Old-street, St. Luke's—I went to the shop of Hawes on the same day with the witness Hill and the prisoner Watts—Watts was identified by Mr. Hawes's managing young man as having pledged a watch there—on the same evening I went to a beershop in Worship-street, kept by the prisoner Saunders—I called him aside, and told him I had information that he was in possession of a quantity of jewellery, consisting of watches, rings, and other articles—he said, "I have not"—I said, "I shall take you into custody, and search your place"—he said, "Indeed I have not"—he then said, "Stop, Sir," and then whispered to his wife, who stood close to him, loud enough for me to hear, and said, "Go up stairs; you know where they are as well as I do"—she then ran up stairs, and I followed her—I saw her go to a chimney, put her hand up, and bring from it this stocking, with its contents, which I now produce—it was</p>

               <p>not a bedroom—these are the things—here it a gold watch, a signet ring, fifteen wedding rings, and a little pocketbook, all of which have been identified by Mr. Raftery—at that time Evans, an officer who accompanied me, brought Saunders into the room—Saunders saw me in possession of these things, and said, "I wish I never had them from him," or "took them from him"—I said, "From whom?"—he said, "I don't know," and then added," I don't know the man; he only slept here one night"—upon that I took him into custody—on the following evening, Saturday, 27th, in consequence of information I received, I went with Evans to No. 19, Twister's-alley, Bunhillrow, and there saw the prisoner Emma Wilson; I told her I bad information that she could give me information of a quantity of watches and jewellery which had been brought there by a person named Matthews, and another; I named rings, and other articles—she said, "I know nothing at all about it"—I then said, "Perhaps you are not aware that I am in possession of so much of the circumstances as I am"—she then said, "Well, I did pledge a ring at Brooks's"—I then left—I did not take her into custody then—from further information I received, I went to Mr. Sharp's, a pawnbroker's, in Bath-street, St. Luke's—I found that a watch and ring had been pledged there; and on 2nd Dec. I again went, with Mr. Sharp's assistant, to No. 19, Twister's-alley, and he saw Wilson, and identified her; he met her on the stairs, and said, "This is the person that pledged the watch and ring"—the said, "I know nothing about it; I pledged the ring at Brooks's, but I know nothing about the watch and ring"—I then took her into custody, and afterwards, in consequence of information, directed M'Kendrick to be taken that same day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Chingford. On 20th Dec; I saw the three prisoners in a cart at Chingford Hatch—they went by my house, between 1 and 2 o'clock—they went by Mr. William Mason's, and were hardly gone a minute before they turned back, I should not think they went above forty yards beyond his gate before they turned back—the female prisoner stopped in the cart and the two men got out, and got over some railings, went into the field, and ran to the lawn hedge and took this linen off—there was a variety of linen hanging on the hedge—each of them took some, and they were running back to the cart—I called to a young man to tell him—the prisoners did not get the linen to the cart, they lald it down by the side of the gate—I think they lald it down because they saw me, and another person ran up the road after them—they got into the cart, and I took hold of the bridle and sent for a constable—Sculthorp jumped out of the cart, I took him by the collar and told him he had better get in the cart till the officer came, which he did; and I gave the three prisoners to the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Davis and Son, drapers. On Tuesday, 21st Dec., about three in the afternoon, I found two square shawls gone, and early next morning I missed a long shawl from a stand inside the door—it was safe about 6 o'clock, the night before—the others I had seen safe, about three hours before I missed them—these shawls (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two I lost on Tuesday, and this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the one I lost on the Wednesday morning—they are Messrs. Davis's property; they are the patterns of those we lost; there is no mark on them—I went with the policeman to the house of the prisoners' father, and saw him there, and the prisoners also—the policeman told the father that his daughters were charged with stealing shawls—he said he knew nothing of it, he had more shawls in his box, and said, "Will you come up stairs and see?"—we went up stairs, and he opened the box, showed us two other shawls not referred to here, and said his youngest daughter had brought them home as a present from her mistress, Mrs. Stride—I found this shawl, which was taken on 22nd, in the hands of the prisoner Amelia. who was outside a pawnbroker's door, and the other girl was with her—I told her it was my shawl—she said it was given her to pledge by a woman living in Coleman-street, whose name she did not know; and as we went towards Coleman-street, she said her father had given it her—there is nothing by which I know the shawl, except the pattern—I had seen it ten minutes before it was missed, and the prisoner only had been in the house during that time—I missed it at half past 10 o'clock, on the Wednesday morning.</p>

Goulding" on it—he had a glass of ale and a cigar, for which he changed one of the half sovereigns, and then left—I paid the note into the Excise-office next day (Monday), and on the following Saturday it was returned to me stamped" Forged"—the prisoner was dressed quite differently to what he is now, he was quite respectable then, and wore a black coat, waistcoat, and cravat—I wrote nothing on the note, but can swear that this is the signature he put on it.</p>

Lomax" on the note, and I gave him five sovereigns, I think, for it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); this is the person's writing on the back; there was no other writing on it at the time—I kept it till 12th Nov., and then paid it to Mr. Haddock, Messrs.

It was true that this was not</hi> in totidem verbis <hi rend="italic">the same offence, but it was not necessary that it should be so in so many words: for upon a charge of murder a verdict of manslaughter might be found, although that was not the charge in the indictment.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE TALFOURD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">inquired whether it was contended that under the first indictment the prisoner might have been convicted of the Statutable felony now charged?</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">did so contend; the charge was an attempt to murder; if a person fired a loaded gun at another with intent to murder him, he would certainly commit an attempt to murder, and that was identical with the present case, which he thought was widely distinguishable from Reg. v. Bird, Reg. v. Phelps, and others of that description. Upon these grounds he submitted that there was such a record before the Court as had been denied by the Crown.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. B. THOMPSON</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on the same side, said that the real question was, whether the prisoner had been in jeopardy before, on the charge contained in the two first Counts; he contended that she had, because, upon the previous indictment, she might have been found guilty of an attempt to murder, if the facts had warranted it. The word "attempt" in the</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th section was to be taken in a broad and general sense: and from two cases referred to by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON MARTIN</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in Reg. v. Bird, it might be taken as including all those Statutable crimes which commenced by an attempt to destroy life, but which failed in destroying it.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>, <hi rend="italic">for the Crown, did not desire to dispute the proposition, that under the former indictment the prisoner might have been convicted of an attempt to murder, but that attempt would have amounted only to a misdemeanour, which was a totally different offence to the present. The</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th section was evidently intended to provide for the non<lb/>escape of persons charged with felony, which felony included a misdemeanour; and could not have been designed to preclude a person, acquitted of an aggravated felony, from being afterwards indicted for another felony of a less serious character. This was evident, from the wording of the</hi> 11 <hi rend="italic">th section, which would have been altogether unnecessary had the</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th given a general authority for such a finding as was now suggested.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in reply, urged that there was nothing to warrant the assumption that the finding of an attempt to murder would be only a misdemeanour: that</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">was a question to be decided; and as to the</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th section, it was a special clause, framed to meet a special state of circumstances arising in the caseof Reg. v.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Felt some difficulty in saying that the form of replication which had been permitted here, was one that the case required; but Counsel having consented to treat the issue of</hi> nul tiel record (<hi rend="italic">raised upon this record</hi>) <hi rend="italic">as one which raised the question whether the prisoner could have been convicted under the former indicatiment of the charge contained in the first and second Counts of the present, he was content to rest his judgment upon that footing. It had not been contended, on the part oofthe prisoner, that at Common Law she could, under the former indictment, have been convicted of the charge, which was the subject of the first and second Counts of the present indictment; but it was said tht she was in jeopardy, because she might have been convicted under the 9th section of 14 and 15 Vic. He was of opinion that she owas in no such jeopardy; for that section would only enable the Jury to convict of a charge, simpliciter, of an attempt to commit a felony, which wuld only amount to a misdemeanour. The various portions of the section seemed to warrow the expression, "Attempt to commit, "to an attempt, simpliciter, to commit the felony; the only verdict the Jury were authorized to find was simply a verdict of guility of an attempt t commit the felony, while on the record there was nothing to authorize any punishment further than punishment for misdemeanour. The 11th section was different, and carefully provided for a punishment in the same way as in a cinviction of felony. For these reasons he was of opinion that the judgment should be for the Crown.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Lapham, of No. 57, Lower Marsh, Lambeth. Some time before 5th Nov. I had a child named George William Lapham—it died on 5th Nov., and was then about seven weeks old—the prisoner was in our service seven weeks, up to 20th Nov.; I do not know the day of the month she came—the child had been ill with inflammation on the chest; it was attended by a medical gentleman named Sewell, and was getting better—on 20th Oct., about 7o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came up into my bedroom, saying, "My master wants you"—I sent her out to get some tape, and she and me went downstairs together—when she returned, I and Mr. Lapham were in the shop, still talking; she passed us, and went straight upstairs—about five minutes afterwards she came down, saying that the baby owas crying—I and my husband had remained in the shop all the time she was gone on the errand, and during that time no other person had gone upstairs—I had ledt a candle in my bedroom, which was where the child was sleeping; when the prisoner came down to me, she had a condle alight; I went upstairs with the prisoner; I am not sure whether she was behind or before me—the child was screaming violently; when I took it out of bed I could scarcely hold it in my arms, it <hi rend="italic">wriggled</hi> and twisted so with pain, and was foaming at the mouth—as I was wiping its mouth, I perceived a large hole in the linene handkerchief which was round its neck; after I wiped the foam from its mouth, I perceived that the inside of its mouth was a mass of white; its lips were white also—I had put the handkerchief on its neck in the morning; there were no holes in it then; it was perfectly new—when I saw the hole in the handkerchief, I said, "You have burnt the child with a candle; and after wiping the foam from its mouth, I said, "You creature, you have put.</p>

Mrs. Lapham was one of my patients; I attended her in her recent confinement—the child was healthy until 10th Oct., when it was seized with inflammation of the windpipe—it had recovered on 20th Oct., although it was yet weak from that attack—I considered the child some day or two before quite out of danger, and told the parents so; but it was not without that sort of weakness which would attend an inflammatory disorder—there was no appearance</p>

               <p>of any injury in the lips, mouth, tongue, or roof, the result of any caustical application up to 20th Oct.—on the evening of that day I was sent for by Mr. and Mrs. Lapham, but was absent from home, and did not arrive until between 10 and 11 o'clock—I went to the house, and took the handkerchief off the child's neck; it was burnt in holes, through the folds to the night dress, and also the strings of the nightcap—there were not so many holes in the handkerchief then, it is now all to pieces, the acid has worked upon it ever since—I put my tongue to the handkerchief, and at once said that a corrosive acid had been given to the child—there was nothing about the appearance of the child or its linen that could lead to the possibility of its being burnt by a candle; it was the burning of an acid which had eaten it away, and which has eaten the handkerchief ever since—I saw the night dress, that presented the same appearance—I found two-thirds of the child's tongue on the right side covered with thick white fur; the inside of the mouth and lips were in the same state—the tongue was inside the mouth—the inside of the cheek and the lips were in the same state, and on the outside of the right cheek the skin was destroyed by the same acid; it did not present the same appearance quite, but it was from the same cause; and at the side of the mouth the skin was destroyed, and there was a kind of blueish appearance—if an acid had been applied to the side of the mouth, and the saliva had ran down, that would, in my judgment, have produced the appearance I saw—oil of vitriol is a strong corrosive acid, and is unquestionably calculated to produce the state I found—I applied my tongue to part of the handkerchief, and it presented such a taste as vitriolic acid would, which I have often tasted—the child's thumb was in the same state as the inside of the cheek, there was a small spot—it was a sucking child, the mother brought it up herself—it became almost incapacitated from sucking, but I recommended the mother to apply the breast as the most healing thing—the state of the child's mouth rendered it more feeble in drawing the breast.</p>

On Friday, 17th Dec., I went into the yard, a few minutes before 6 o'clock in the morning—there were a number of boys there, who directed my attention to a shed—I looked in, and saw some soap and candles—I then went to a storeroom in the back garden—I went in, and saw some mortar and plaster on the floor—I saw a hole had been made over the door, about a foot wide, and about fourteen inches long—there was a weighing machine by the door, which a person could get at from the hole—there was no other method for a person to have got in—the hole was large enough for a boy or a man to get in—I called Mr. Hall, the superintendent, and he directed me to go to Miss White—she came, and brought the key of the storeroom, and opened the door—I found a quantity about by the side of the chest, and a quantity of tea and coffee mixed together by the side of the fence—that appeared to have been the way they might get over—if a person came over the fence, they could get over the boys' yard, from that through the engine house yard, and through a small passage to the back garden—I know the prisoner; he had been employed there it might have been for four or five years altogether—he has left about twelve months—he used to sleep in the tailor's shop, close by the fence, where I found the tea.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—it was gone 12 o'clock that night when I went to bed—the prisoner went to bed at the same time—I was not disturbed in the night at all till my husband gave the alarm that the watch was gone—I locked the room door before I went to bed; I left the key inside in the door—my husband got up at about a quarter to 3 o'clock in the morning—there was no one in the room but my husband and me and my children—my eldest child is getting on for eight years.</p>
