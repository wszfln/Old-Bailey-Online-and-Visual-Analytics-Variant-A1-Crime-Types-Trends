I missed the articles stated in the indictment. The school room door is opposite the kitchen - I found a hole bored in the back door of the school room with a centre-bit, which laid by the door, opposite the hole. A person could introduce an instrument, and unbolt the door; it was wide open - I had seen it secure about eleven o'clock the night before. I found part of a candle and a match there - I missed a chimney glass from the parlour, adjoining the kitchen - it hung on a nail over the mantel-piece, but was not fastened to the wall. I missed all the articles stated in the indictment (enumerating them); they were worth about 15l. The stockings belonged to the trustees - I had the charge of them; the rest belonged to me. I went to Worship-street that morning, and saw part of the things - here is the glass; I have had it many years; here are two hats, one of which I had worn the day before, and the other I believe to be the one left on the premises; here are two pairs of pliers, a pair of callupers, a file, and the tracer of the penograph; they are all mine. Here is the center-bit which I found on the premises. My desk was broken open.</p>

On the 18th of November, about six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner going down Golden-lane, about a hundred yards from Mr. Bennett's, and coming in a direction from there; it was dark - he had the looking-glass in a sack. I followed, and stopped him - I asked what he had got there - he said, "Why?" I said I insisted on seeing what he had got; he took the sack from his shoulder - I put my hand in, and felt the looking-glass; I said he must go to the watch-house - two other watchmen were with me; Williamson carried the sack; he tried to run away as we took him along, and Yates stopped him; nothing else was in the sack; he did not say where he got it.

My husband's name is Joseph; we lodged there: George Vose is the landlord, and lives there - we occupied the shop and kitchen. On the evening of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080004"/>the 5th of November, at ten o'clock, I was in the shop - the door was shut, and the shutters up, there was a light in the shop. Mr. Murrell was with me - we heard a noise of the kitchen window going up and down; I went out into the street, saw the kitchen window open, and called the watchman; I came in, and met the prisoner on the kitchen stairs, caught hold of his collar, and said, "This is the thief;" he said, "Thief! where is the thief?" and struck me in the face, broke my ear-ring, and tore my cap - I lost my hold, but caught hold of him again; he slipped out of his coat, leaving part of it in my hand, and ran off; I went into the kitchen, and unlocked the door - he must have come out of another passage-door. I found the window open, and a carpet about six yards square half out of the window, and half in - I had left it on a chair, and am sure I left the window down, and fastened with the snap. I found three of the centre panes broke, and the snap pulled back - the carpet was ours. I went to the watch-house, and found the prisoner there. I had a light in my hand when I collared him, and saw his face. I believe him to be the same man who had come into the shop in the afternoon. He said, "Pray have mercy - I was in liquor - it was only a frolie." I found a hat in the area - it was not returned to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There is a passage-door, which was open? A. I think it was - he could go through that door, turn to the left, and get out into the area, and cut the glass - the kitchen door was fast: my char-woman had left about twenty minutes. I had been in the kitchen at seven o'clock, and fastened the window, but not after. I believe the charwoman was in the kitchen after me. I cannot say that I thought the prisoner in liquor; there was no appearance of his having been sick there. My husband has never lived there - he is in the country, for his health - we were married at Stepney-church.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you really married? A. My name is Simpson, and the property is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you really married to any body? A. No - it happened about ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. They could not get into the area without coming through the house? A. No; he could not have entered the kitchen-door, for I found it locked; he must have gone through the passage into the area, and opened the window. I cannot tell whether the charwoman had done any thing to the window - she and the servant of the house had been in the kitchen together.</p>

A gentleman stopped him, and a watchman came up. I returned to the house - the carpet was partly out of the window; the sash was pulled down, and the glass broken.</p>

               <p>MICHAEL MORRIS. I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. - Griffiths came to me; we went and found the prisoner at the Pomfret Castle, sitting in the tap-room. I called him out, and said I wanted him; he said, "What for?" I took him out, and in his coat pocket found two pairs of stockings; he had some pieces of cloth, which he said he had found. I found five pairs of stockings in his hat, and in his coat pocket a skeleton key, which I tried to the door; it opened it. I asked what he had done with a sheet and shirt - he said he knew nothing of the sheet, but had left the shirt with a person whom he would not get into trouble, for he had trouble enough himself. I was taking him to the watch-house - he said, "It is a pity she should lose all her property - she has behaved like a mother to me - if you go to Haystack-lane you will find the counterpane among some shavings in a shed." I went with Griffiths, and found it among shavings, in the place he described.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HANCOCK. I live in Mount-street, Grosvenor-square. On Monday, the 14th of November, a little before eight o'clock, I was in the second floor back room, with my wife and an upholsterer, putting up a bed - my wife went down for the curtains; she returned, and alarmed me. I went down to the back room on the ground floor, and missed the articles stated in the indictment; I opened a side door which leads into a mews, and saw my hat and gloves laying outside the door. I got a search-warrant on the 25th, and went with Ballard and Collins to the second floor back room of No. 9, Gilbert-street, Oxford-street; the prisoner and his wife were there; we found six leaves of the History of England, which I had been reading a night or two before. I found two metal seals - the clapper of a bell, a button, and an ink-stand. - The door leading to the mews is half glass, and slides up like a window, and was not fastened down - it would not keep up, having no pullies; the door was locked, and the key out; there was dirt on the side of the window of the door, as if they had entered there. There was no appearance of any one getting in elsewhere. The officer told the prisoner our business - he denied all knowledge of the things.</p>

            . I went with a search-warrant to the prisoner's room, on the 25th. I asked if his name was Willis - he said it was; I said I was come to search for stolen things, and asked if he knew any thing about a box and an unfinished silk dress; he said No; I searched and found a spectacle glass, and two pieces of one - he said the old one he had been in the habit of reading with. In a small box in a tea-caddy I found a button, two metal seals, and the bell-clapper, which Hancock claimed. I found some leaves of the History of England, between the bed and sacking. I went there afterwards, and found a glass ink-stand on the dust heap, which I had before seen on the mantel-piece, and shewn to Hancock, but he did not know it. Mrs. Hancock afterwards claimed it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the 7th of November, between two and three o'clock, the bell rang, and on going to the door I saw the prisoner, and asked what he wanted - he said, "A little money;" I asked why he wanted money of me, and said, "Do I owe you any thing?" he said, "No - you know very well what it is for;" I said, No, I did not - he answered, "You do, you remember meeting me at Fairburn's picture shop, in the City, and you put your hand in an indecent manner on me, and promised to meet me at another time, but never came." I called him an insolent rascal, and asked how he could dare to say so, and I certainly should not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080006"/>give him any money - upon this another man came up, took hold of me by the collar, and said, "D-n his eyes, that is the man; I know him - I know him;" I then became very much alarmed, and put my hand into my pocket, and gave the prisoner a shilling, and said it was all I had in my pocket; the other man then let go of my collar; another man then came up on the other side, and took hold of my waistcoat pocket, and said, "He has got more money than that," and said, "That is the man - I know him - his name is Turner." I put my hand into my pocket, and gave the prisoner 5d. - the other man called me a white-faced b-r before that. The other two men went away down the street; the prisoner remained, and said, "This won't do - I must have 5s. at least;" I told him he could not have it, for I had no more about me; he said, "I must have it, and if you don't get it I will write to your master, and expose you." I said I had no more money, but if he would call at five o'clock I would contrive to get the other 4s., he agreed to call at five o'clock, and went away - he called again about four o'clock, and I gave him the 4s.; he then said I must make it up 10s., for he had got a pair of trousers in pawn for that sum, and wanted to get them out. I asked how he could think of making such a charge, and said I certainly would not give him any more - he said he would write to my master if I did not give him the other 5s.; I said, "If you must have the other money call again to-morrow morning, at eleven o'clock, and I will contrive to get it;" he said very well, he would call at eleven o'clock, and left. My master was out at this time; but not when the three came - he was just going out then; I thought he was out, but when they went away he came down stairs with mistress - he came home about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour to five, and within twenty minutes I informed him of what had passed. I went to Marlborough-street office about nine o'clock that evening, as I had before that to wait at dinner and tea, and go out for master. I left a message at the office. On the next morning, about ten minutes before eleven o'clock, the prisoner came - nobody had arrived from the office then. I told him to call in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; Ballard was then in the parlour. I asked the prisoner to step inside, and as soon as he got in I shut the door on him. I then held out two half-crowns,(which Ballard had marked); he took them in his hand; I asked him what the money was for which he demanded of me - he looked round in a very suspicious way, and said in an under tone, "I only want to borrow it." I asked what he meant by saying what he did when he came the day before, and had the other 5s.; he said, "Oh! never mind, there is no harm in that." I then pressed him very much to tell me what the money was for; he said, "Oh! never mind, take the 5s. back, and for God's sake let me go out;" when he found I would not take the money back he laid it on the lock of the door. Ballard then came and took him into custody. I know one Fennell; he was servant to Mr. Cartwright, who lived opposite. I had seen the prisoner in his company in David-street, when I was out on an errand. Fennell spoke to me; I had no particular acquaintance with Fennell.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to part with the shilling, and the fivepence to the prisoner? A. I was very much alarmed at what they accused me of, knowing myself innocent, and three men coming up - I had no other reason for parting with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your master here? A. No, he went to Brighton; whether he has returned I do not know - I am not in his service now - I saw him about a fortnight ago - he knew about this trial - he has four female servants, and a young lad as groom, about sixteen years old, but no coachman. I called the prisoner an insolent rascal when he first came - I was not much alarmed just then.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not instantly give an alarm, and call the servants to your assistance? A. The other man came up directly and collared me - I held the door in my hand all the time - they were not inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not shut it in their faces? A. I was so much alarmed I hardly knew what I was doing - the charge frightened me - I was not so much alarmed before the second man came up as after; I was perhaps three or four minutes talking to them - it might be five - the street is pretty public - I gave no alarm - I did not tell my fellow servants of it - I told master when he came home - mistress was with him when he went out, or I should have told him then - I did not see the groom till after I had told master.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not seize the prisoner when he was left alone with you? A. I was afraid the other two might come back; I did not wish to do any thing till I had spoken to master. I was not so much alarmed the second time - I appointed for him to come at five o'clock because I knew master would be back. I was five or six yards from the parlour door when Ballard was in the parlour - he could not see Ballard. When I met him and Fennell, the prisoner said "How do you do?" I met him two or three times afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. On all those occasions had you any more conversation than "How do you do?" A. The first time we met the prisoner said "I think I have some knowledge of you?" I said "Very likely, but if so, you have the advantage of me." This might be six weeks before- Fennell was with him in David-street. I left Mr. Thornton by my own wish - he said if I could not pay the solicitor in this case he would, and his brother took me to the solicitor - I applied at the police-office by master's advice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is yours a corner house? A. No, there are houses on each side. I parted with none of my money willingly - I should not have parted with it unless the second man had come up, and collared me, and saying what he did.</p>

I had not seen the prosecutor the night before myself, but I was sent there at eleven o'clock in the morning, and went - I went into the house the back way, by the mews, and was introduced to the prosecutor and Mr. Thornton; I was placed in the parlour with the door open; I heard somebody come to the door, and heard a whispering in the passage, but could not hear what was said till I heard the prosecutor say "What am I to give you money for?" I could not hear the prisoner's answer; the prosecutor then said"You have got the money; now what is it for?" the prisoner said he wanted to take out a pair of trousers which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080007"/>were in pawn; the prosecutor again said "You have got the money, and I want to know what it is for;" some answer was given which I could not hear; he put the same question again, and said "You said yesterday that I had taken indecent liberties with you, now what is it I have done;" and I heard the prisoner say "O never mind if I did," and something else, but I could not hear the whole; the prosecutor again said, "You have got the money, and I want to know what it is for;" he said, "I want to take out my trousers, and if you do not like to lend me the money take it again." There was more conversation between them, but the prisoner spoke in a half whisper, and I could not hear what he said. I went out and desired the prisoner to come into the parlour, which he did, and I asked if he knew any thing of the prosecutor - he said No- I asked if he had ever seen him before; he said Yes, about three weeks or a month before - he met him in Grosvenor-street with Fennell - David-street crosses Grosvesnor-street - I asked if he had seen him at any other time - he said he had seen him in Cheapside; that he merely saw him pass along, but did not stop to speak to him - I asked if he had seen him at any other time or place - he said not, he knew nothing further of him; I asked him who the two men were who were with him - he said he did not know who they were; I asked if he denied two men having been there with him; he said No, that he had seen the two men following him along the street but did not know who they were, nor where they lived; I took him to the office - the two half-crowns which I had previously marked, I found on the lock of the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the parlour door wide open? A. Yes, he could not see into the room; the prosecutor spoke loud enough but the prisoner whispared.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did not Mr. Thornton communicate with you on this subject? A. Yes, he was at the office, and took a decided interest in prosecutor's behalf.</p>

             (examined by MR. PHILLIPS). I once met the prosecutor when I was with the prisoner in David-street - the prosecutor asked the prisoner how he did- the prisoner said "Pretty well" - the prosecutor said"You don't look so well as when I last saw you;" the prisoner did not answer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prosecutor say any thing about not knowing him? A. I understood the prosecutor that he knew him, because he told me his name was George Kelly - that was three weeks or more after we met - I had met him in Regent-street and Oxford-street about three weeks after the first time, and he asked me if I knew Kelly - I said not particularly, only by meeting him in the street: I had always understood his name to be George Reeve till the prosecutor told me it was Relly. I had met the prisoner about five minutes before we met the prosecutor in David-street. I do not know whether I or the prosecutor spoke first - I think I did; we stood talking about five minutes - the prosecutor asked how he did; I think the prisoner nodded when he first came up- they had no conversation but what I have mentioned and then we parted.</p>

On the 26th of November I left my shop and had just got as far as the curb stone, opposite to my own door, when I heard my wife call out; I turned round, saw several people round the door, and the prisoner, who had been seized by somebody - he was taken into the shop - I had left my seals on a tray on the glass-case - these six seals cost me 4l. 12s.; I found the seals scattered about the counter, and some on the glass-case; I gave him in charge.</p>

I said I must trouble him to go to Mr. Davison's - he said "Very well, come along;" I asked if he lived there - he said No, that the porter, named Thomas James, asked him to carry it for him; I said I thought it very curious, and asked how long he had known him; he said from a child; We went to Davison's, and the prisoner said to the witness,"Did not you send this paper out about ten minutes ago?" he said "Certainly not; I sent none out;" I asked if he knew the mark on it - he said he thought it was Mr. Bullock's mark. Mr. Bullock's men identified it, and I locked him up. Mr. Bullock claimed it next morning.</p>

            . I am beadle of Cornhill. On Friday, the 25th of November, I was fetched to Mr. Day's - I searched the prisoner and found two tongues, one in each of his coat-pockets. I said it was a bad concern; he said he should not have done it, if he had not been persuaded by another person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. He was errand-boy in the house? A. Yes; three persons were called into the counting-house to be searched. I asked where he was going to take them to; he said he could not tell. I said he had better tell all about it - and he said he should not have done it if he had not been persuaded.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAM DAY. I have other partners - the prisoner was our weekly servant. I sent for the beadle - saw him search the prisoner, and take the tongues from his pockets - they are worth 2s. each - he had been nearly four years with me, and behaved very well.</p>

On Thursday, the 17th of November, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I observed a barrel of anchovies on a different side of the warehouse to what it ought to be - it was concealed behind two casks. I took it out, and particularly noticed the marks on it; it had the letter W. and a small blemish on one of the staves. I placed it between some casks of the same size - the prisoner worked in the yard near that warehouse. I did not miss it until he was brought back to me. I had given 46s. each, for one hundred of them. Mr. Nelme was the broker - they were all one price.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you opened the cask? A. No; I only bought them in October - the barrel is marked in a peculiar manner; I know it from any others. I noticed the blemish in the stave - we may have sold eighty of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever employ the prisoner to take out barrels? A. We sent none out that evening - we do at times make allowances for damaged barrels.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Friday, the 18th of November, about nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in Wilson-street, Shoreditch, with something in a bag on his shoulder. I went across, and asked what he had got; he said a barrel of anchovies - that he bought them at Billingsgate off the quay for 25s. I took him to the watch-house, and asked where he was going to take them - he said to Brick-lane, Spitalfields, and that he had brought them from St. John's-street, Goswell-street-road. I asked where in Brick-lane he was taking them to - he could not tell. Mr. Messenger saw the barrel on Monday.</p>
               <p>MR. MESSENGER. We missed it on Saturday, when we took stock of them; I saw it safe on Thursday; it is worth much more than 25s.; the prisoner had a guinea a week.</p>

I think he is the man. Dillon stopped at the shop window, and began, as I thought, to use very abusive language. I heard him swearing at the prisoner, who was at the back part of his shop, and seemed to wish to avoid him - he did not come forward. Dillon put his feet towards the shop door, as if to go in, but his feet did not touch the step - the prisoner then rushed out, and put himself in a fighting attitude. Dillon had been menacing, lifting up his arms, and saying, "D-n you," before that. Dobie struck him several blows, and he fell - he did not strike Dobie, he did not seem to have power - he fell on the back of his head in the road on the stones - he attempted to raise himself up, but fell back again. I did not see Dobie strike him any more - I saw him at his shop door afterwards. Dillon was an old man, and used to be a good deal with the prisoner in his shop at one time, assisting him in unloading coals - he kept a coal and potatoe warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You at first saw Dillon at the door of his own house? A. I have heard since that it is his house - he seemed in a passion, and his face was all over blood when I first saw him.</p>

            . I have known the deceased six or seven years - he was a plasterer's labourer - he was rather in liquor at this time - he came to my door - took me by the hand, and asked how I did - his face was all over blood - I never knew him quarrelsome. I told him he had better go home than be in the street; I went with him to his own door - the door was shut, and before it was opened he loosed from me, and went to the prisoner's door. I called him back, got him into the passage, and shut the door; he came out before I could get to my own door, which is two houses off, and went to the corner of Dobie's house - he said something. Dobie came out, seeming in a great passion with him, wiping his own face with a towel, and struck Dillon on his side, with his double fist. Dillon lifted up his arms to strike again, but was too weak. Dobie struck him several blows in his body - and Dobie's mother called out "Give it him well;" then he struck him on the temple; he fell and never arose any more - he tried to arise but could not; the prisoner tried to kick him, and then went away - they carried Dillon into the kitchen of his own house - he died that evening between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. When he stood at the prisoner's door, could you hear what he said? A. No; his manner appeared agitated.</p>
               <p>MR. BRYANT. I am a surgeon. On the 21st of July I was visiting a patient in this neighbourhood and saw a crowd; I saw the deceased lying on his face - I went away to my patient, and on returning saw two persons raising him - I saw a slight contused wound above, and over his left eye; I felt his pulse and considered him labouring under symptoms of a compressed brain; I had him taken home, and directed such treatment as I thought proper, and that the person who had given the blow should be secured, as I thought it a dangerous case. Two days after his death I opened his body, and found from four to six ounces of extravasted blood over the surface of the right hemisphere of the brain - that I consider the immediate cause of his death. I do not conceive the slight confusion to have caused his death; but that the concussion given to the vessels by falling with violence on the stones, produced the rupture of the vessels and caused his death. The vessels might be ruptured by intoxication, and his falling produce the same appearances.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had before fallen down from intoxication, and his face bled, should you attribute the rupture to that or the latter fall, produced by this fight? A. The latter, for I think a man could not stand on his legs after such a rupture as this: he was laying on his face - vessels will very readily give way when a man is in a very high state of excitement from intoxication or anger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Suppose him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080011"/>have been fighting, and his passion to be violently excited, would he not be more likely to have a rupture of the vessels? A. Certainly; a concussion might have been caused by fighting.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If he had been fighting an hour before, and received a blow which caused coagulated blood upon the brain then, he could not have walked? A. No, nor stood. If it had been the effect of liquor it might not be produced immediately - if his brain got in that state by intoxication he could not have walked about.</p>

            . On the 21st of July I saw Dillon - he was in liquor, but not drunk - he seemed vexed in his mind. I remember his coming up to Dobie's window - he said "I have come for recompence for the injuries you have done me." Words passed on both sides, which I took no notice of; Dobie was washing himself, and when he had dried himself he came out, took him by the collar, and flung him on the pavement - knocked him down with his face in the middle of the kennel - he never groaned - I set him up and got a woman to bring a basin and wash his face - the blood gushed out of his mouth, nose and all parts of his face, very freely.</p>

            . On the day this happened, about two o'clock, I saw Dillon come to Dobie's house - he conducted himself very improper, abusing Dobie very much, calling him a bl-y b-r. Mrs. Dobie was in the parlour- he called her an old convicted bawd, come out of Newgate for robbing a gentleman - he was on the step of the door; Dobie desired him to go about his business - Dillon said he would knock him down - Dobie walked to the door to wipe his hands - Dillon walked into the shop - angry words were still going on - Dobie told him to go about his business - he then came into the shop and struck Dobie; he had been abusing him for two or three minutes before any blow was given. Dillon did not appear drunk - he walked across the road steady enough; he once worked for Dobie, who lent him both money and provisions, and was very kind to him.</p>

            . I am the son of John Frederick Shusler, and live at Chelsea. I am eleven years old. On the 1st of November, at ten o'clock in the morning, I and my father were crossing <placeName id="t18251208-18-crimeloc86">Hyde-park</placeName>

                        targets="t18251208-18-off84 t18251208-18-crimeloc86"/> - my father had stopped to speak to a gentleman - I walked on - the prisoners came across from the gate up to me, and hit me in the face with the back of their hands, and asked what I had got in my basket, which was in my hand - they knocked me down - Brown took a bundle out of my basket, put it under his coat and ran away with it - I did not know them before. I ran after them and got it from them - my father was only two or three yards from me - they both ran one way. I then went and told my father - he pursued and caught one and the officer the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROACH. Where was this? A. Near Grosvenor-gate - it happened on the footpath; we were about half-way from the barracks - there were three boys together - Brown asked what I had in my basket - both the prisoners struck me; they did not resist my getting the parcel back - they had ran away with it towards Kensingtoh-gardens, about the length of this Court. I did not call out nor tell my father till I had got it back.</p>
               <p>JOHN FREDERICK SHUSLER. I was with my son and gave him a bundle, containing these things; I stopped to speak to a gentleman and told him to go towards Cumberland-gate; I did not see the prisoners stop him, but after our talk was over I went on, and he told me he had been robbed of his parcel - he pointed out the prisoners and another boy, who were walking towards the powder-mills, and when they saw me pursuing they all three ran; I overtook Brown, and asked how he came to insult my boy - he said it was the other boys. Brown was then going to run, but I took him to Grosvenor-gate to inform the park-keeper; an officer brought up Dunbeven, and I gave them in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw nothing of the transaction? A. No, my son said he had been insulted and robbed of his parcel. He is a very quiet mild boy - my being near, I supposed, gave him courage to pursue them; I probably should not have given them in charge but the officer said I ought to do so for the sake of justice.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was on duty in the Park, and found the father holding Brown - Dunbeven and others were standing by, and from what Shusler said I laid hold of Dunbeven, and considered it my duty to take them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not the father's wish not to prosecute them? A. He wished to take them to the park-keeper - I did not persuade him not to do so - some gentleman said if he did justice he would give them in charge, and that I was ready to take them.</p>
               <p>BROWN'S Defence. I was going to bathe with two boys - this little boy was picking up the mushrooms, the other boy said "Give us a mushroom;" and he said he would give him a slap in the face, and then gave him a kick, and offered to fight either of us; he ran to call his father and we were stopped - the officer persuaded him to take us to the office.</p>
               <p>DUNBEVEN made the same defence.</p>
               <p>SHUSLER, JUN. I was not gathering mushrooms, nor did they ask me for any - I did not say I would slap his face.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM THOMAS. I live in Duke-street, Lisson-grove. On the 29th of October, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was coming from the pay-table, in Earl-street, Lisson-grove - I stopped at a watering-place, by the Brazen-head, public-house, for a necessary purpose; two boys were in the watering-place; I got them out, and when I came out myself they made an attempt at my seals, but did not succeed; a scuffle ensued: the watchman came up, and was going to take me to the watch-house for ill-using the boys; the prisoner then came up, and drew my watch from my pocket, without using any violence - the watchman stood four or five feet off at the time. I pursued the prisoner into the Brazen Head; I overtook him in the passage; he rushed into the tap-room - I held him by the collar, and said, "Oh! dear, I have lost my watch - you are the man who took it from me;" during that time I received a blow in my jaw, and on my nose, which cut me. I still held him, but in a little time his neck handkerchief was cut, and came away in my hand - he got from me, but did not get out of the room; my watch was then handed to me over their heads, by somebody. I am quite sure he is the man who drew it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROACH. Q. Did you see the handkerchief cut? A. No - it must have been cut, or it would not have come away. I am a bricklayer. I was rather elevated, but not drunk. I did not beat the boys.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you accuse them of stealing your watch, and the watchman tell you it was in your fob? A. I do not recollect it - I remember his telling me it was in my fob; I was not above two feet from the public-house, and saw nobody but the prisoner come out - nobody but the watchman was near when he took the watch. I did not call out that I had lost it when I had it in my hands; when I got it I said I was perfectly satisfied - it was dark, but there were gas-lights there. I did not accuse any one else of it - I was beat about, but did not keep my bed in consequence of it. The officer came to my house on Monday, the 1st of November, but I was out.</p>

I came out of the Brazen Head to go to the watering-place at the corner, and saw the prosecutor holding a boy - he told the watchman to take him; I did not hear what it was for. A mob collected - the boy got away, and he attempted to run after him; some words occurred, and the watchman collared Thomas, to take him to the watch-house - he was rather in liquor. The mob followed them to one of the doors of the Brazen Head; I went into the tap-room at another door, and saw him holding the prisoner by the neck handkerchief; he said he had robbed him of his watch, and that he had got it; the watchman stood by, looking at the prisoner, as if he was afraid to take him - in a little while his neck handkerchief came off, and the prisoner went into the mob which stood in the tap-room, and tried to go out; the watchman spoke to him, and then he went back into the room. I saw somebody put the watch into the prosecutor's hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him ill-treating the boys? A. No; I saw him holding a boy - he was not very drunk. I went into the parlour, where I was drinking, and saw no more.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard a noise at the corner, and saw the prosecutor violently shaking a little boy; I said, "What are you about?" he said they had attempted to take his watch; a mob collected, and persuaded him to let the boy go - he did so, and then abused me, and said he would give the boy in charge - and for his abuse, and being in liquor, I took him by the collar, and he collared me; I could not take him by myself, and sprang my rattle - the prisoner and two or three more came out of the public-house, and in about a minute he hallooed out that his watch was gone; I let go of him - he collared the prisoner, and said, "You have got my watch; the prisoner made his way into the house, the prosecutor keeping hold of him, and when we got inside he called out for his watch; I said, "For God's sake, if any of you have the poor man's watch give it to him," and finding nobody would own it I said I must go out for assistance, and desired the landlord to let nobody out. I returned in about two minutes, and was told it was restored to him. I asked if he had got it - he said, Yes, but he wanted his hat, which was given to him, and he said he was perfectly satisfied; I escorted him off my beat, and he went into a pork-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him walking about with his hat in his hand, and saying he had lost it? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was very drunk and troublesome? A. He was troublesome, and not sober. I never saw the prisoner with the watch.</p>

I went on about a hundred yards, then returned, and asked his name - he said, "Thomas" - I then said he was the man I had been looking for, and pointing to the prisoner, asked if he was the man who had robbed him; he said, "That is the man who robbed me, and hit me on the side of my head;" he went with me to the office.</p>

On the 5th of December, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in Great Bush-lane, and saw the prisoner and another coming towards the prosecutrix's house - I watched them, and saw the prisoner enter this house - the other waited outside; I walked by, but he was not in the passage - in about five minutes he came out with this cloak in a wrapper; he went up Little Bush-lane; I went up Great Bush-lane, and stopped him - his companion was gone.

I have seen her before; I did not know where she lived before; she keeps a bad house, for the reception of street-walkers; I did not ask why she was pelted; I certainly would not believe her on her oath, as I have heard her swear to day that she did not keep such a house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Before you met her on that day had you been in the habit of speaking to her? A. I believe I have; I have seen her in the saloon of the theatre, and in the boxes.

            . In consequence of what my brother said I pursued the prisoner into Pell-street, where I saw him walking with the cloth over his shoulder. I walked sharply after him, but not so fast as him - he turned round twice, and looked very hard at me. I began to run after him then, and he ran - I called Stop thief! three or four times - he dropped the cloth, and continued running. I picked the cloth up - he was stopped by two or three persons, and got away again; a boy came down the street with a basket of coals, which he threw over him, and he fell down.

I said, "It appears so;" he instantly snatched my watch out - I got hold of the watch and of him by the collar - one of his companions put out his foot to trip me up, I immediately sung out for the watchman; they struck me on the left ear, and I lost my hold of the watch and him also; they got away - there was a light at some distance - the prisoner's face was so close to me I pulled him down, and held so heavily on him, that I had an opportunity of seeing him - he had a blue or a black coat on, and was in a working dress - nobody came to my assistance. I went up to the top of the street in four or five minutes, and saw the watchman in company with a man, and in three quarters of an hour I saw Downes and Davis; they took me to a public-house, where I saw the prisoner, with sixteen or eighteen other persons, and the instant I entered the room I pointed him out.

            . I am a last-maker, and live in Worship-strret. On Friday, the 2d of December, about seven o'clock, I went to the Sidney Smith; the prisoner came in about eight, and was not out of the room from then till the officers came.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you use this house every night? A. I am there two or three times a week; he sat in my company, by the stove, near the yard door. I went to the office to state this, but they would not hear me; one or two women sat in the box; the prisoner sat on the bench, and I on a chair; we were smoking.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect who sat on the bench with the prisoner? A. Coleman sat next to him.</p>

               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you watch your company to see if they go out for any purpose? A. No. I set in the tap-room when I am not serving - he might go out for a minute or two, and I not see him; he sat in the box by the fire, near the yard door, on a form - some women were in the room. About twenty minutes past ten o'clock some neighbours were saying a man had been robbed in the street, and when I returned to the room, the prisoner had just finished a song.</p>

On the 17th of November, at half-past five o'clock, I saw thirteen sheep there; and at half-past seven that evening I missed eleven of them; the two remaining were lame. I and Cope went next morning to a stable in Sermon-lane, about three hundred yards off; we forced the door a little way open, and saw the sheep - I went to Mr. Young, who returned with me; we then forced it quite open, and I found the eleven sheep, and am sure they were the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Who did they belong to? A. They were under my master's care; I was to deliver them to the owner - there were others in the field, but not with these, nor marked in the same way; I left somebody to watch the stable while I fetched Young. I was not absent two minutes, and did not lose sight of the stable.</p>

            . I belong to the stable in Sermon-lane - I let it to the prisoner on the 25th of July; he said he was a butcher, and attended Newgate-market, to carry home carcases to the butcher's, and kept a cart and horse for that purpose. I had one key of the stable to put my barrow in, and he had another. On the 17th of November my barrow was fetched from my door, which is not ten yards from the stable, but I did not see it put into the stable. Next morning I went there with Walton and Cope - I put the key into the hole, and found the lock was off - the door was tied with a string. I found the sheep there. I had found my barrow before my door about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were not in the habit of going to the stable? A. Only at times. I cannot say that he had not lent the stable to anybody.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see anybody else go there? A. No. If my barrow had not been put at my door I should have gone to the stable for it. I seldom saw him there.</p>

            . I am one of the presidents of the Inland Department, at the General Post-office. - On the morning of the 24th of November, the prisoner was employed there as a stamper - I observed him put a letter before him, which he should have taken to the sorter - his duty, after stamping a letter, is to place it before the sorter; in a short time I saw two letters before him, one of which I knew it was his duty to take to the lobby. I watched, and observed him take both letters in his hand, and go towards the lobby with them in his hand - and when he got to the lobby door, I observed him hastily slip one of the letters into his right hand inner coat pocket: he then went into the lobby - and on his return, I told him I wanted to speak to him in the Inspector's-room - and when we got there, I desired him to empty his pockets, which he did - and produced eight letters out of his pocket - these are them, (looking at them) - they are all stamped, and bear the stamp of that morning; there was another stamper at that table, but he used a different stamp - these letters bear the impression of the stamp the prisoner uses; here is a letter among them, addressed to Samuel Williams, Esq. No. 13, Finsbury-square, London - it is taxed as double, and shows that it is double. I put my initials on it - it came from Liverpool, and is a ship letter; after marking it I left it with Mr. Wood, the Inspector of letter carriers, without breaking the seal. The prisoner said he had only taken the letters for the purpose of delivering them, and receiving the postage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He was employed as a stamper, was he not also a letter carrier? A. Yes; they are both inferior situations in the office, and filled by inferior persons; the whole eight were not all ship letters, the other seven were single. It is easy to ascertain whether letters contain money or notes - the postage on this letter is 3s. 2d. - there is a postage on all the others.</p>
               <p>Q. If the person wanted to take the letters, and deliver them to receiver the postage for himself, without putting them into the hands of the sorter, could he do so? A. He could - he is a letter carrier himself; the seven single letters could be of no use to him, except to get the postage on them. I did not open the letter - the lobby is a room adjoining the Inland-office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where are the sorters? A. They stand at a table very near the stamper - he had occasion to take one letter into the lobby - it contained shipping intelligence, and should be delivered early, it was in a blue cover, which attracted my attention - that was not one of these eight.</p>

            . I am one of the inspectors of letter carriers, and was stationed at the Inland-office, in Lombard-street, which is in the city. On this day, the letter addressed to Mr. Williams was delivered to me, sealed by Mr. Vandergucht. I took it myself that day to Mr. Williams's, in Finsbury-square, and he opened it in my presence - it contained bills of exchange, which I did not examine. Mr. Williams sealed it up in my presence; the prisoner is a letter carrier - his walk is Titchfield-street, Mary-lebone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are the letter carriers generally known to the persons to whom they deliver letters? A. Very probably - I have since seen the bills of exchange.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it the busines of a stamper to deliver them to the sorter? A. Yes; they then go through two or three different hands to the carrier.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. This is a ship letter? A. Yes; I cannot say whether Bank-notes usually come from America.</p>
               <p>MR. VANDERGUCHT re-examined. The prisoner stamps the letters, and delivers them to the sorters - there are twenty-four sorters; they are first sorted into different divisions, then into subdivisions, until they come to the proper delivery; the sorter then delivers them to the teller, who reckons the amount of postage, and gives them to a messenger, who puts them into each letter carrier's box; the letter carrier is then called in to see that the account of postage agrees with the teller; he then takes them away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it unusual for the stamper, in taking a letter to the lobby, to carry a letter in his hand? A. It is not usual - but unless I had some particular suspicion I might not think any thing of it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 24th of November, I received a letter from Mr. Woods, addressed to Mr. Williams - that produced is the same. I accompanied Mr. Woods to Mr. Williams', in Finsbury-square, handed the letter to him - he opened it, and took out bills of exchange, which I marked - these are the same - (examining them.)</p>
               <p>MR. WOODS re-examined. The Titchfield district extends nearly to the New-road, and nearly to Oxford-street; it would be greatly out of a person's way to go by Finsbury-square to Titchfield-street - the stages go that way; one of these letters is addressed to Nortonfalgate, another to Somers town - which is not in the General Post-office delivery - it is not far from the New-road; here is another to Middlesex hospital, which is out of his district, but not far from it - he might go that way if he pleased; here is another to Buckingham-street, Fitzroy-square, which is in his district; one to No. 357, Oxford-street, which is a few minutes walk from his district - one to Gower-street, Bedford-square; he could go that way to Titchfield-street; and one to Cumberland-street, Portman-square. I saw him produce the letters from his pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Are there more than one of these letters in the prisoner's delivery? A. Only one; the direct way to his delivery would be by Cheapside and Holborn. Norton-falgate is quite a different way.</p>

            . I live in Finsbury-square; the letter addressed to me, was brought to me by Mr. Wood and Ellis, (looking at it), here is a bill of exchange, drawn by Joseph Peabody, payable to the order of John William Fenno, for 1000l.; another for 1000l., drawn by Mr. Lyman, to the order of Samuel Daney, on me; and another, drawn by the same person, for the same amount, and the same order; one for 67l. 16s., drawn by Edward Thomas, on Daniel and Co., London, endorsed specially to me; and one for 163l. 12s. 9d., drawn by G. Ball, on Uriah Rowe, and endorsed to me; they are transmitted to me by Edward Clarke and Co., of America - his partner is David Badger; this is the letter which contained them.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of the receipt of this letter, you had unfortunately become a bankrupt? A. Yes; Mr. Wiggen, Mr. Alzedo, and Mr. Hughes, are my assigness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are these bills sent to you for acceptance? A. They are remitted to me by Messrs. Clarke and Co., for acceptance - here are three of 1000l. drawn on me, they are not accepted, the other two were accepted at the time. I know nothing of the hand-writing of the acceptors. I should think they could not be negociated by a man in a low situation of life; I generally receive remittances from America in bills.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. None of the five bills were accepted when they arrived? A. No; the 167l., and 67l. 16s. 3d. have been accepted since; they are both specially endorsed to me.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. On what day did you receive the letter? A. On the 24th of November. These two bills, in my opinion, were not negotiable by a person in the prisoner's situation of life. Norton Falgate is a little to the northeast of Finsbury-square, and two or three minutes' walk from it - a person would come through Finsbury-square from Norton-falgate to go to Titchfield-street.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Are either Norton-falgate or Finsbury-square in the way to Titchfield-street? A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it your practice to pay the person who delivers letters to you? A. No, I have the early delivery, and keep an account against the postman, and pay him about once a week. I pay the regular man belonging to my delivery. I never saw the prisoner deliver letters to me.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you take in letters yourself? A. They are brought into the counting-house and laid on my desk; I am generally there, and know the postman who delivers them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You receive letters by the early delivery? A. Yes, a regular postman comes - they sometimes change their carriers. If a stranger brought a single letter I should pay him.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it happen sometimes that letters are mis-sorted, and not all sent by the early delivery, and then sent afterwards? A. Yes, and then I pay the person who delivers it.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you, on the 24th of November, the control over bills of this kind? A. I had not - none of the bills are stamped.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Did you open all the letters which came to you? A. I did not; one of my assigness generally opened them; they remain unopened till Mr. Timothy Wiggen, one of my assignees, comes. Mr. Henry Hughes has once or twice attended - Mr. Alzedo never attended.</p>

               <p>MR. VANDERGUCHT. This letter came from Liverpool - it is stamped "Liverpool, ship letter;" that is done at Liverpool; the charge is made in town - all the eight letters are of that morning's arrival.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Holborn. On Sunday, the 13th of November, about ten minutes or a quarter to one o'clock, I was in Shoe-lane, near to Plumtree-court, and heard the cry of Watch! Stop him! the prisoner came running up Shoe-lane, in a direction towards me; I heard something fall - it could not fall from any body but the prisoner - nobody else was near enough, nor had any one passed for ten minutes; I was then twenty or thirty yards from him; I advanced and collared him - he said "What is the matter?" I said "You have thrown something away;" he said nothing to that; the prosecutor came up in four or five minutes; but before that Scott, a watchman, came up and held him, while I looked and found the watch in the gutter, ten or twelve paces from where I stopped him; the case was separated from it - the prosecutor came up and said, "Oh, you villain, you have robbed me of my watch." The prisoner said nothing - I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is it possible for ten minutes to pass without somebody passing there? A. Yes, at that time - it was about one o'clock: after he was in custody, he said he had not taken the watch. I believe there was nobody at the watch-house but Edwards, Bryant, and the prosecutor - he was running when I first saw him, but when I stopped him he was walking - we shut the watch-house door to prevent any one coming in, but there was no crowd assembled.</p>

I followed to the watch-house, and saw nobody about. I am a wine-merchant, and live in Crutched-friars.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was Bryant drunk or sober? A. Very drunk, as I thought - I thought him so drunk that he could not identify a man, but not knowing him I could not judge whether he was drunk.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were there many persons in or about the watch-house? A. When he was taken into the watch-house there might be seven or eight - I was let in by saying I could give evidence. I saw nobody near enough to rob the prosecutor but the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a watchman on Holborn-hill. Between twelve and one o'clock I heard a cry of Watch! I looked towards Fetter-lane, and saw the prisoner running, and the prosecutor pursuing - nobody else was near but Edwards - the prisoner ran up Shoe-lane - the prosecutor fell in turning the corner - I pursued and called to Adams, who stopped him, and immediately said "You have thrown something away" - he denied it - I held him while Adams went and picked up the watch and case, two houses from where he was stopped - nobody else was near enough to throw it there.</p>

            . I was the officer of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house - Bryant said he had robbed him of his watch - Adams produced it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080021"/>- Bryant told me the maker's name, and described the initials on the key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you order the watchmen to keep out several persons? A. No; the prisoner said there was another man in company with the prosecutor. The prosecutor appeared drunk, when he first came in, but answered my questions very sensibly, and soon appeared more sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Holborn, Mr. Bryant caught my arm; he mistook me for a shopmate, but finding he was wrong, he turned round, and called several times to somebody - a person came up, and left him in a few minutes, and soon after he charged me with the robbery; having been in a situation a long time, and master expecting me home, I thought it not fit to stop to be detained by a drunken man.</p>
               <p>GEORGE THOMAS FORD re-examined. I did not think the prosecutor in such a situation as not to know what he was doing.</p>

            . I am a tailor. On the 25th of November I saw the prisoner in Carter-lane; he ran by me, with the truss upon his shoulder; the porter overtook him- he then dropped it down, and ran back, by me; I pursued, and lost sight of him, but saw him in ten minutes, and collared him; he said he was the person who cried Stop thief! I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him and the porter speaking together? A. Yes - I think he said a gentleman had sent him after it; he stopped just to drop the truss; I noticed him before he came up, seeing a respectable dressed man with a truss, and after he had passed I heard a cry of Stop thief!</p>

I saw hands thrust through the glass, and caught hold of them in strugglidg with them, or the window would have been cleared. I got out what I could, but lost a gold and a silver watch. I found the silver one at Worship-street next morning, when the prisoner was in custody.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Chester-place, nearly opposite to the prosecutor. On the 21st of November, about half-past five o'clock (it was dark - candles were lighted - my lamp hung outside the shop.) I heard the mob returning with the bullock - I was in my back parlour. I got up, and the moment I arose, I heard the smash of a window - I came to my door, and saw several people round Mr. Stevenson's window - two of them were busily employed in taking watches from his window; one of them was dressed in a white jacket, and that one I particularly kept my eye upon - the other was dressed in dark clothes. I immediately jumped out of my shop and pursued them - they ran away. I collared the one in the white jacket, and held him for nearly five minutes, calling loudly for assistance - nobody came - he struggled with me and got away; six or seven of them stopped and said, "Stand hard against the b-r, down with him," and for my own safety I pursued him no further - or I dare say they would have knocked my brains out. I have not seen the man in the white jacket since - I can swear to none but him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. There was a croud with them? A. Yes; it was the mob with the bullock that did it - some of them were dressed in blue coats and gilt buttons.</p>

            . I live in Chester-place, opposite to the prosecutor, and am a tmman. I was at my door, about half-past five o'clock, as the bullock passed Mr. Stevenson's window - I heard glass break immediately - looked over and saw two persons at the window - their hands were in the window very busy apparently - one had a white flannel jacket, and the other a dark coat on - it was too dark to see the colour - candles had been lighted three-quarters of an hour. I stood at my own door to protect my property - the shop light went out, and I could not see the one in the dark coat any more - but saw the one in the light jacket - he ran about thirty-five yards from the window - Harris laid hold of him; the mob came back and hit Harris, who let him go. I was sixteen or eighteen yards from them. I think the person in the dark coat, was taller than the prisoner - but that side of the way is higher than where I was.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HARRIS re-examined. I was not struck, but they had sticks with them.</p>

On the 22d of November, a little after eleven o'clock in the morning, in consequence of information, I went with Garton to different houses round Bethnalgreen - and on going into the tap-room of the King and Queen, public-house, in Air-street, Bethnal-green, I observed the prisoner sitting alone, smoking his pipe. I saw his left hand move, towards his left hand trousers' pocket, immediately as I entered. He must have known me, and what I was; I immediately laid hold of his hand, and asked, "If all the property he had got about him was his own." He said Yes. I put my hand into his left hand trousers' pocket, and there found this watch. I found nothing else on him; I asked how he came by the watch. He said he had found it; I asked if he had shown it to any body - he said No. On going to the office, I asked where he was last night - he said he was at work until five, and after that was at a house in St. John-street - there is a St. John-street, Bethnal-green. I asked at whose house; he did not tell me; he was dressed in a blue coat; the watch was quite clean, and did not appear to have been in the dirt at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He put his left hand into his pocket? A. To his pocket, not into it. Air-street-fields is full half a mile from the prosecutor's house.</p>

On the 27th of October, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw him on the other side of the way with two boys, whistling up and down the street; I went out about four o'clock in the afternoon, and locked the room door, and then saw him opposite the door with the same two boys, and heard one of them whistle to him, as I went up the street; I came back at half-past five o'clock, and put the key into the lock, but it would not open the door - it was bolted - I called Elizabeth Holland down, who lodges on the second floor - we both pushed against it, and I got my knee in, and saw the prisoner through the crevice, placed against the drawers - he then unbolted the door and let me in, and placed himself against the drawers again; I saw a fork in his hand - I pushed him from the drawers, and missed a scarf from one of them, which was open - I had left it locked - I asked what made him come there - he made no answer; I said he had broken the drawers open and taken the scarf - he then knocked me down - Holland asked him to let her search him - he said he would see her ********* first, and then ran out; I then examined further and missed nine shells, a waistcoat, and two handkerchiefs of my brother's; I saw two shells in his coat, and two in his breeches pocket, as he went out; they rattled when Holland took hold of him to search him, and there was a bulk in his thigh, which I suppose was the scarf. He came back in a quarter of an hour, and said "Search me;" he let a little child, named Sweeting, search him, and she found two shells in his coat pocket; he then took an old shell off the mantelpiece, and put a new one in its place, out of his breeches pocket; he then went out; I sent Holland for Furzeman, but he would not come, as he said we were making game of him. The prisoner went out, and ran through the Sugarloaf public-house, with two more boys. Here is the shell he put on the mantel-piece - I am sure it was in the drawer before - those on the shelf were quite old.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not live with you? A. No, with his mother; he moved three months before this - he was not in the room at all that morning, and had not bought me any pears - he would only have one pocket searched, and when the little girl found the shells, he gave her money not to say any thing - I have not seen Holland since Monday week - her father will not tell us where she is.</p>

            , JUN. I live with my father. I saw these things safe the night before the robbery. I had brought the scarf from India, intending it for my sister, but had not given it to her. I came home about six o'clock on this evening, and heard what had happened, and about half-past nine o'clock somebody ran down the street, calling out "Jack Keeffe, have you found your scarf?" I ran out and met the prisoner soon after, crossing Queen-street, with another boy and girl, thirty or forty yards from the house. I know the shell found on the mantel-piece to be the one which I had left in the drawer - it is new, and those on the shelf were old. The lock of the drawer had been picked with a fork.</p>

For the last six months an intercourse took place between me and that girl - the friends proposed marriage, which I declined - since then there has been a little malice. I was passing the door on this day- this girl and three or four more, were at the window - they called me up stairs - she asked me to tea - I had dined with her the day before, and gave her 1s. to fetch some pears; I pushed her out of the room for two minutes, and she came in again, and said she saw me picking the lock with a fork - I said they might search me - she has given the witness money to swear falsely - witnesses came for me on Friday but she has frightened them away, saying they would be confined.</p>

On the 4th of December, about twenty minutes past three o'clock, in the morning, I stopped the prisoner at Tottenham, coming towards town, with these stirrup irons, and a pair of pattens; I asked what he had got there - he said a pair of old irons and pattens - that the irons belonged to his pony saddle - that he had sold his pony and saddle, and was going towards town, to Greenwich for his pension - that his wife had given him the pattens in case he wanted money to pay his expenses - that he had come from Ealing, near Cambridgeshire, and his wife had come up by the carrier; I insisted on his going with us - he said if we took him to where he took the irons from he would: when we had got a few paces he slipped his arm out of ours, and ran away - I secured and took him to the watch-house.</p>

On the 29th of October, at eleven o'clock at night, I went out to fetch my wife's things from her stall, at the top of the street, as there was a piece of work there.

            . On this Saturday night my father went to fetch my mother's things, and in about a minute I went out of the front room, locked the door, and went after my father, because there was a disturbance at the top of the street, and I was afraid my mother would be ill-used. I am sure I locked the door, for I shoved my knee against it after taking the key out - nobody could have come in before I went out, for I stood facing the room door, which was open; I heard my father call me - went back with the key, and found the door open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does the front room door open into the passage, near the street door, or a good way from it? A. A good way from it; when I went out I left the street-door open, close against the wall - nobody could have been behind it.</p>

            . I live at No. 8, Swan-street - twenty-five or thirty-yards from Lane. On the 29th of October, about eleven o'clock at night, I was going along the street and saw the prisoner, Needham, and Warren, coming from the Church-street end of the street; I knew them all three very well; I was within fifteen or sixteen yards of Lane's house - they came from the end of the street where Lane's stall was, and all three came up to his door - I stopped at the Swan (which is right opposite) for a necessary purpose - they all three went in, as I thought, to purchase something - they came out in about a minute and a half - Warren first, Needham and Goddard close after him - I could perceive, by the light on the opposite side of the way, that Warren had something under his arm, and when Goddard came out there seemed something bulky under his coat - he had nothing under it when he went in - he wore a fustian coat - I walked on the opposite side of the way towards my own house, in the same direction as they went - I then saw by a strong gas light, that Warren had something under his arm - I met Stapleton, who went with me - they were rather before me, on the opposite side- I walked on to my own house - there is a strong gas light, and the public-house at the corner has another gas light - I could see, for ten or fifteen yards, the two sleeves of a shirt dragging on the ground, and Goddard's toes nearly on them; I told Stapleton to follow them, while I went in to put my coat and boots on, which I did, and then went over to Lane's; the girl made a complaint, and I went after the prisoners directly and returned, not seeing Stapleton nor them; I examined Lane's door and found the box of the lock nearly wrenched off - I went into the back room and found the bed clothes folded up carelessly, and on the hinge side of the door there seemed to have been a small incision made with a small crow-bar - it was a very clear night - I told Lane I knew them. and I saw them all three again on the Sunday evening - I gave information to several officers, and on the Tuesday or Wednesday following, I was told Goddard was in custody; I believe I spoke to Goddard on Sunday - I went out to fetch another officer, to take all three; I saw them enter the prosecutor's passage - the room door could easily be forced. I have known Goddard eight or nine years - he lives about a minute's walk from me - they are all well known in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It struck you that they were going to buy something? A. I could not suppose they were going to rob such a poor man; I have been a constable several years, but did not wish to belong to it any more; the prisoner's father is one; I was always on good terms with him; I had no dispute with him about his having more of a reward than I had, for he was allowed none of it; I never said I would injure him; I was a witness against one Redman, tried here three years ago; I was not told that I prevaricated in my evidence, nor desired to leave the Court; I employ Stapleton to work for me at times- he has come from the House of Correction to-day.</p>

            . I live at No. 20, Turk-street, Bethnal-green, and am a cordwainer. I lived at No. 8, Swan-street, about four months ago. I lived in Turk-street on the 29th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be described as "William Stapleton, of Swan-street, Bethnal-green," so late as the 16th of November, when you were before the Magistrate? A. I suppose the mistake happened because I worked there then, as a journeyman to Gibbs. On Saturday night, the 29th of October, I saw Warren, Goddard, and Needham, standing against a coal-shed in Church-street, consulting together - I had been to the baker's, at the corner of the street, for a loaf, and saw Goddard turn into Swan-street; I left them there, and on returning towards Gibbs' house, I met Gibbs - he told me to follow them; I saw them two or three doors from Lane's - this was hardly ten minutes after I had seen Goddard go into Swan-street; I went after them down Bacon-street; Goddard had something bulky under his coat - Warren was close to him - a shirt sleeve hung down on the pavement from Warren's-arm - they walked on to Club-row, went through an alley there, and then stopped. I saw Goddard give something like a gown, away from his arm; there was a whistle from the bottom of the court, but I saw nobody. Goddard answered "Is it all right?" After giving the gown to somebody, he took hold of me by the shoulder, and turned me round twice; he would not let me go through the court; the man he had given the parcel to had gone up the court; I said if he did not let me alone I would tell my father; there was a whistle again, and he asked if it was all right; Goddard directly said to his companion, who was running,"Cut it, Dick; a nimble ninepence is better than a slow shilling;" they went on before me - I followed them into York-street, and into Church-street, again, and into Nicholl-street, where I met Gibbs, and told him they were gone into one of the houses there, but I did not know whether it was a public or private house - it might then be twenty minutes or half-past eleven o'clock; I went with Gibbs and one of the Bow-street conductors, to see if I could trace them through an alley which I thought they were gone into; we went to a public-house but saw nothing of them - this was on the same night; I went home to Turk-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What are your usual hours of working at Gibbs'? A. Sometimes till ten or eleven o'clock; I was going to Gibbs' with the loaf - it was for him; he told me he had been over to Lanes while I followed the men, and after going to the public house I went and told Lane I knew the party, but did not tell him their names. I told him next morning that Needham was one; I have now come from the House of Correction, where I am for a misdemeanour, for leaving my master's work - he is Mr. Samuels, of Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you ever go by any other name? A. Yes - William Glover. I am a chance child, and do not know my father nor mother; they call me Stapleton, Smith, and Glover - I do not know my right name.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sent to the House of Correction for leaving you master's work, nothing more? A. And not taking all the stuff back again. The three men were together when I came up to them in the court; I said I would tell my father, because it would frighten him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who was your father? A. I do not know - he is dead; they tell me his name was Tipson, or something.</p>

            . I have known Gibbs seven or eight years, and have heard him say, within the last two years, that he would be revenged, as far as it was in his power, on the prisoner's father; I think it is much less than two years. I am a labourer at the East India House, and keep an evening school.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was this conversation? A. One evening, about two years ago, at the Flower Pot public-house, in Brick-lane - I saw Gibbs and the prisoner's father there; a trial had taken place in this Court; the parish had allowed some remuneration to the officers, and Goddard said Gibbs had taken some money which should have been his; he spoke rather strongly about it, and Gibbs said he would do for him some way or other. I would not believe Gibbs on his oath, for I have acted as an officer with him; his conduct was such the church-wardens would not allow him to be sworn in again; they objected to his character the year before, but some friends spoke for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why would you not believe him on his oath? A. I have been with him when we have seen things at night, and in the morning his evidence before the Magistrate has been completely contradictory.</p>

I saw the prisoner, in company with another person, going up Fleet-street, behind this gentleman, about a minute before the robbery - I saw nobody between them; I was on the opposite side of the way, and saw one of the two lay hold of Mr. Berry's coat - a coach came between us, and I saw Mr. Berry lay hold of one of them - somebody who stood close by picked up the handkerchief - his companion passed on, towards the Strand. A coach passed, which prevented my taking hold of him.</p>

I was in Fleet-street, with Woodward, and saw the prisoner and another person following the prosecutor, for about two minutes. I saw the prisoner have hold of the tail of the prosecutor's coat, endeavouring to take something out, but a hackney coach came between us, and I could not see whether he took anything. I picked the handkerchief up at his heels, and gave it to Woodward - we ran across directly we saw it - I got over before Woodward. I knew the prisoner before well. A silk handkerchief was found in his flap - he said it had no mark - it was marked E. B. I saw nobody pass between him and the prosecutor.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I left them in Mr. Lyne's care, went out, and found it in the road, just by where I had collared them; two or three yards from the public-house; there was nobody else near who could have dropped it.

I had a small staff in my pocket, but did not shew it. I did not hear him ask if I was an officer - if he had I should have said Yes, as I conceive myself one when I see a felony committed.

            , JUN. I know the defendant's hand-writing, and have seen him write several times; to the best of my belief the signature to this affidavit is his writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. Do you mean to say you have seen him write, or have seen what was said to be his writing? A. I have seen him write several times - about twelve months ago, or less - I know it to be his writing. I have seen him write at his lodgings at Westminster, and I think it was in John-street - and at a public-house in Holborn, he wrote a note to his attorney - and at Westminster he was copying something from a book, and frequently gave it me to read, to see if it was correct; and when he practiced as a doctor, he used to write bills to give to unfortunate women, and he used to sign his name to them - I saw that often.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Look at these two documents; are they in the defendant's hand-writing? A. In my judgment both are written by him - but only one bears his signature; I have no doubt of that one.</p>

            . I live in Shaftsbury-place, Aldersate-street - the prisoner lodged with me when I lived in Jewin-street; he came on the 20th of December, 1824, and left on the 6th of January; (he had lodged with me once before) - the furniture in his apartment was mine - I never parted with any of it to him; he occupied the attic the second time he lodged there, and paid 6s. a week - he only had one room - the rent was never reduced. I never had any conversation with him about selling any part of the goods - nor ever told him, I wished to part with them for my subsistence - I never sold him any of the goods at all. On the 20th of May, 1825, (a long time after he had left the lodging), I informed him I was in embarrased circumstances, and wished him to take an apartment for me to deposit my furniture in,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080028"/>being apprehensive of an execution; he very readily agreed to take an apartment for me, and to superintend the removal - part of them were removed on the 21st, and the rest on the 23d; he told me he had removed them, and they were safe - but never told me properly where they were gone; he told me he had moved them into the Borough - but did not say where there - he had told me at first, that he had moved them to Somer's-town, but did not say where. We had received some information that they were in Upper Rosamond-street - he said it was better for my sister and I not to know where they were, under the circumstances of distress we were in. I went to Rosamond-street, on the 25th of May - I was in a coach in the street, and could see part of my sofa, as it stood across the first floor windows - I saw sufficient of it to know it - it stood on its feet under the window; the defendant had given me his address at No. 11, or 14, Margaret-street, Clerkenwell - my sister went there for me, as the coach could not get there, and being a cripple I could not walk. I saw the prisoner that day at my lodgings, which he had taken for me at Somers-town. I told him we had been about the goods - he was very angry - and said we had no business to go - that I had placed confidence in him, and ought to have waited till he came, without making inquiry. I told him we went to consult with him, but could not find him, for he had given a wrong address; he said he meant to move to the lodging where he had told us. He went to Upper Rosamond-street about the goods - he said he had been there - and if we went to the house again to make inquiry we should be insulted, and that he should remove the furniture; he called next day, and said he had moved them into the Borough, where we could not find them, as it was better for us not to know where they were, for fear of the landlord following them. I thought I had put myself in his power, and dare not be otherwise than on good terms with him; he frequently called, and said they were safe - and on the 23d of June, I applied to him for the keys of the apartment where they were deposited - he said he would talk to me at home, in Jewin-street - told me to make the best of my way home, and he would be there as soon as we were. I and my sister went, and waited about half an hour - he did not come - we went back to Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him next time? A. I saw him pass the house in Upper Rosamond-street, where the goods were, but did not speak to him - and did not see him again until I went to Guildhall, before Mr. Alderman Cox, to identify him, after I had preferred this indictment, which was in October. He had not called on me, and I did not know where he was - he never claimed the goods as his in my presence - but on the 25th of May, he made a claim to the people of the house where they were. When he went to take a room to move them to, I gave him a sovereign to pay a week's rent in advance, and while the van was at the door I gave him another. On the 25th of May he made me out a bill of 3l. 5s., and I gave him another sovereign - here is the bill, he wrote it in my presence.</p>
               <p>This account was written in pencil, and much obliterated - it contained a charge for rooms 8s. 6d., for men 3s. 6d., for two vans, &amp;c. - the total sum was 3l. 5s. - I gave him a sovereign, leaving a balance of 5s. I paid him 7s., for a lodging he had taken of a woman - but he said that when he took the furniture, her husband would not let them in without a reference - that he sent them to Houndsditch for one, and in the mean time the people next door took them in - this is charged in the bill. He made me a bill on the 23d of June, this is it (looking at it) - he did not deliver it himself - it is in his hand-writing; he was to have met me that day in Jewin-street, instead of which, Mr. Rushberry, his solicitor, sent me a letter. and he sent me a letter, requesting I would attend to Mr. Rushberry's letter. I tore that up. I never sold him any goods whatever - nor ever received any money from him for any thing except lodging, and money I have lent him at times.</p>
               <p>The bill delivered to the witness on the 23d of June, was here read - as follows "Miss Lee, Dr. to G. B. Valois, Instructing Miss L - two quarters, 2l. 2s., Miss King, 1l. 1s., Master Staples, 2l. 2s., being employed in instructing pupils from the 10th of April, to the 23d of June, at 10s. a day, 36l. 10s. - total, 41l. 15s."</p>
               <p>Q. Was he employed in your school as a teacher, at the rate of 10s. a day? A. He was not; I have but twenty-five scholars, and do not receive as much as 10s. a day for all of them together - not above half that; he was employed to teach French by the quarter in my school - I owed him none of this bill - Master Staples was not to pay me; I have the prisoner's receipt for the money - he wrote it in my presence: (read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Staples to B. G. Valois. - Instructing Masters J. and S. Staples, 1l. 2s.; French Grammars, &amp;c. 8s. 6d. -2l. 10s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Received, 25th Dec. 1824, B. G. VALOIS.</p>
               <p>Q. In August 1824, did you see the prisoner at all, or did you ever sell him any furniture? A. No; he lodged with me then - several of the articles which I have recovered from Margaret-street, and which he swears I sold him in August 1825, I had not even bought at that time; I bought the bedstead and mattress in April, 1825, and many things which I cannot remember - nearly all the furniture in his attic was bought after August - I have the bills of some of them here - I bought the stair-carpet of Mr. Barber, in Henrietta-street, Covent-garden, the beginning of October - the bedstead of Mr. Richardson of Fore-street; and several of the kitchen articles I bought in September, 1824.</p>
               <p>Q. From August to February did he pay you any money for goods by weekly instalments, or in any shape whatever? A. Never a shilling - here are the bills - some of the kitchen furniture was bought on the 25th of October, 1824 - I have no bill of that.</p>
               <p>The bills produced being referred to agreed with the dates mentioned by the witness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. These goods, I take it for granted, have been paid for? A. They have not, unfortunately; I have paid for part of them - I have had some of it four years; I first saw the defendant the latter end of July, 1824. When he took me an apartment at Somers-town, he said he was obliged to pass me as his sister, or they would not let the lodgings but to single men; but that was without my consent; I believe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080029"/>the people took me for his sister for a few days. I remember his telling me he was about taking a house in Jewin-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember saying any thing about the comfort and advantage there would be in you and him living together there? A. I do not; I know he took a house in Upper Clifton-street, Finsbury-square, for he referred to me - I answered the reference; nothing ever passed between us relative to marriage; I never sold him any goods; before I preferred this indictment I charged him with stealing these goods - he was tried here and acquitted, on account of my placing confidence in him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you saw your sofa in Rosamond-street? A. I do not - I thought it was mine, having been told it was there. I positively swear no money has passed between us for these goods, for I never sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, without opening it - is that signature your hand-writing? A. It looks like mine - I think it is - I will not swear that it is, or is not, but I swear I never put my name to any paper given to the defendant but one; I know he can imitate my writing; I never but once gave him a receipt, or any thing of the sort.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You must know whether it is your handwriting or not? A. It is like mine - well, I will say it is, for it is very much like it (No. 1). I never gave him but one receipt.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Here is another (No. 2), is this your writing? A. I know they are not both mine - this is more like mine than the other - I can only speak to one, and I think this one is my writing; I never gave him but one document bearing my name - (looking at another paper, No. 3,) I think this is not my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now open all three of them, and say are they your writing? A. No, I swear that only one is, and that is No. 3 this was when he was in my apartment, the first time; this signature is mine, and it is the only paper I ever gave him with my name to. I recollect the document and dare say my sister will; I admit putting my name to a document of this sort on the 16th of November, 1824. I now say the signature to No. 2, is not mine; I never gave him a receipt when he left my apartment - nor is the signature to No. 1 mine.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. When you speak of your handwriting, in the first instance, you had not seen the contents? A. No; when I see the documents I know only one can be mine, and on seeing them recollect the one I did sign - I never signed the others; the one I signed is a receipt for two weeks rent, and it is the only two weeks he ever paid me at one time; he wrote the body of it and I signed it; I believe the body of all three are his writing, but he writes two different hands; he did not live with us at Somers-town.</p>

            . I assisted my sister in Jewin-street. I attended to the household affairs. The defendant came to lodge there the second time on the 20th of December; when he was there before he had the second floor, at 11s. a-week, but afterwards the attic, at 6s. a-week; his rent was not reduced - he left in January, and called frequently afterwards. One afternoon in April, 1825 (I think) my sister asked him to take an apartment to deposit her furniture; he said he would - I left the room, and heard no more then. I remember the goods being removed; there was a stair-carpet, a bedstead, a mattress, some kitchen furniture, the drawing-room furniture, and all that was in the house - there was a sofa and sofa table - some were moved on Saturday morning, and the rest on Monday. I had bought part of the kitchen furniture myself - it was long after August, 1824 - I think it was in December. I did not hear the defendant give any account where the furniture was placed - he would not tell, nor give us the key; he said he had moved it three miles off; we went to No. 16, Upper Rosamond-street, and saw the sofa across the first floor window - we afterwards had the door forced open - it was not there then. I went to No. 6, Margaret-street, and saw some of our furniture in a van which stood at the door; I followed it to Fleet-market, and recognized the whole of it to be my sister's. The prisoner was there, managing the removal. I saw some of the kitchen furniture which I had bought in December, in the van; also the stair-carpet and bedstead; this was about five weeks after it was moved from Jewin-street. I am certain he had not bought it of my sister - he could not without my knowledge, because I am in constant attendance on her, as she is lame, and unable to go about the house - he never claimed any of it in my presence. He first took the apartment on the 2d of August, 1824, and left on the 16th of November, and on the 17th took his luggage away; he gave up the key, and made no claim to any furniture. - The rooms were let afterwards to two or three people - the second floor was let till we left Jewin-street, and the same furniture in it as when he was there; he never interfered with it. Some part of what he says he paid for, was not bought by my sister till the end of March, or the beginning of April; the bedstead was bought on the 9th of April, 1825 - here is the bill of it - I saw that bedstead in Margaret-street; the kitchen furniture was not bought till December; the prisoner never claimed the goods; he sent a letter to my sister when we were going to law with him, for the furniture - he then made a claim of debt, but not of the furniture. He professed to teach French, but was not engaged at 10s. a-day; she engaged him for one quarter, at a guinea, but found him incompetent. The Masters Staples learned French - I believe their parents paid the defendant for it. I know he got two sovereigns from my sister, and said Mr. Staples was to pay her; I saw her give him a sovereign when he took the first goods away, to pay for the van.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are sure the kitchen furniture was moved with the rest? A. Yes. I knew all the furniture which was in the van. The prisoner never had but one receipt for rent, that was on the evening of the 16th of November, when he left. I never heard of his having any other memorandum - he said he owed her two weeks rent, and would not pay her unless she sent up a receipt. I never took particular notice of my sister's writing.</p>
               <p>The witness was here shewn the three papers, and stated she thought that numbered two to be most like her sister's writing, but was unable to swear to either of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the defendant lodged in the second floor was he the only lodger? A. We had lodgers in the first floor, and the back parlour; Mr. Hattersley and Mr. Pearce lodged there. I never heard a word about my sister's being married to him.</p>

            . I live in Rosamond-street. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080030"/>The defendant took a room there in May last. I saw the furniture brought - a sofa was put by the window; the prosecutrix and her sister came to inquire about it - the sofa could be seen from the ground; I told the prisoner so, and he moved it, and put up blinds. The sofa was taken away by the defendant at eleven o'clock at night. - The other furniture was afterwards taken away by Miss Lee's order. I had told the defendant they had been to demand it - he said it was his, and told me to tell them it was gone away; I said I should not say so till it was gone, and the sooner it went the better; I wished him to stay, as they said they should come on a certain day, and take it by force; he would not stay, but said then that the property was theirs, but he detained it for 41l. 15s.; he called two or three hours after it was gone, and said he should hold my husband responsible for it, as Miss Lee owed him 41l. 15s., and he considered it worth that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he did not claim it? A. He said they owed him 41l. 15s.; not that he had paid that for it.</p>
               <p>MR. LANGDALE re-examined. I received this letter,(which has been sworn to be the defendant's writing,) from a person acting as his attorney; with the bill which has been read. I saw the defendant at Mr. Walter's, in Fleet-market, the latter end of June, or the beginning of July; he said the furniture was his - it was there then.(Letter read.)</p>
               <p>"MR. RUSHBURY. - If you think it necessary that I should put in an execution for the furniture, although I am in possession of it, please leave a note, stating the same, this evening. B. G. VALOIS."</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY addressed the Court on behalf of the defendant. The three papers produced to the prosecutrix were then read.</p>
               <p>No. 1 was a receipt, dated the 28th of December, 1824, for 4l. 10s., for goods sold Mr. Valois, signed M. Lee.</p>
               <p>No. 2, a receipt for 10s., being rent due the 6th instant, dated the 5th of January, signed M. Lee.</p>
               <p>No. 3 was a receipt, dated the 16th of November, 1824, for rent, and acquitting him of all demands, signed M. Lee.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Margaret-street, Spafields, and am a printer; the defendant took a first floor room at my house on the 23d of May, at 7s. 6d. a-week, and brought some furniture. I saw Miss Lee about a fortnight after - she asked to see the defendant; he was out; she then claimed the furniture; he sold the furniture in my house that day, and it was taken away.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS. I am the last witness's wife. The defendant took the apartment on the 23d of May, and on the 25th (I believe) Miss Lee came, and asked for Mr. Valois - I said I knew no such person, but recollecting myself I thought it might be him; I followed, and told her - she said she had pronounced his name as it should be in French, which was the reason of my mistake; I said he had brought some furniture, and I was displeased at my husband taking him in, as I did not like weekly lodgers; she said what did it matter so that I was paid; she did not say the furniture was hers; she said he was a gentleman, and would pay honourably; she afterwards called, and said he was a swindler - that he had robbed and injured her, but never named the furniture. I was not present when she claimed it of my husband.</p>
               <p>DEFENDANT. When I bought the furniture Miss Lee told me not to tell her sister of it; I was to receive part of the rent arising from it while I was in the country, and when I returned my rent was reduced to 6s. a-week.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Anthony Benson. The officer brought back the prisoner on the evening of the 5th of November, with this bacon which I knew to be my master's - it had been laying in the window. - He said at first that he had bought and paid for it; and then he wanted to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought two pieces of beef, 11/2lb. of mutton, and 11/2lb. of bacon. and as I had no basket I I put one in my hat, and another in my pocket; when I went into this man's house I was tipsy - I asked what it was a pound - he said 6d.; I did, upon my soul, pay for it, and the officer then took me.</p>

On the 4th of November, about twenty minutes before one o'clock, I was with my barrow at the corner of Queen's-row, which is about half a mile from Taylor's, I saw the prisoner with this clock - there were two other persons on the other side of the way, who seemed to be in company with him, and I saw one of them make a sign to him to go down a turning, which he did; I followed, and asked him where he got the clock; he said a man had given it to him, and I might have it if I liked; he then got away, and ran very fast; I cried Stop thief! and he was taken before he got out of my sight. I am quite certain of his person.</p>

            . I did belong to Bow-street, but am now a labourer in the East India Company's service. On the 31st of October I was coming out of my own door in in Dorset-crescent, Hoxton New-town, about half past seven o'clock in the evening - I saw the two prisoners together - Francis had the copper and Howson had Francis' hat in his hand; I knew them and followed them; when they got some distance Francis shifted the copper to Howson; when they got to Old-street they crossed the road, and put it down; I went over and asked what they had got there; Howson said an old iron pot; I put my stick against it, and found it was a copper - Francis then ran off - I seized Howson, and took him with the copper to the watch-house. Francis was taken by Grafton the next morning - I had known them both before.</p>

I now live at a short distance from there; I had been at that house on the Thursday before, and had fastened it up - no one lives there now, but I have to pay rent till Christmas. On Tuesday morning, the 1st of November, I passed the house and saw one of the shutters broken down; I went in and saw a stove taken from the fire-place, ready to carry away; I then missed the copper; it was brought to me the same evening. I am quite certain that it is mine - my husband was a butcher - I used to scald pigs in it, in doing which I placed a stick across it, which has made those marks.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Burgis. He directed me to look out, on the 4th of November, and in the evening I saw the prisoner come into the shop, but he did not see me; he went to the counter, and looked about some time, then tok up the parcel once, and laid it down again; he took it up a second time, and as he was taking it towards the door, I stopped him; he might have got about two yards from the counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The shop is not two yards in length altogether? Witness. Yes, it is about ten feet.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop to purchase a black-lead pencil; I knocked on the counter and called - there was no one there; I looked at some of the pictures for about a minute and a half, and on turning round I saw this parcel near the edge of the counter - I removed it further on, and leaned my elbow on the counter, and immediately the witness came and took me.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LUCAS re-examined. Q. Is there any truth in his assertion that he knocked and called? A. Not the least; I saw all he did, as I was behind the door.</p>

            . I am a Thames police-officer. On the evening of the 2d of November, between six and seven o'clock, I stopped the prisoner in the New-road, St. George's in the East, about half a mile from the prosecutor's house - he was carrying six shirts tied up together in a bundle. I asked him what he was carrying - he said shirts. I put my hand on them, and found them wet. I asked him where he was going - he said on board a ship lying off the Tower. I said they were wet - he replied, he had not time to dry them. I took him into a shop, and asked how many there were - he said he did not know, a man had given them to him to take to Tower-hill, and he was to meet him there.</p>

I acquainted Mr. Roake, the bailiff, and went back with him; we saw some foot-marks leading from it, and some barley near them. I afterwards saw the prisoner's shoes applied to these marks, but I was not near enough to see if they corresponded - the barley found, and the sample are here - but I have not compared them - I am not a judge.

            . I am bailiff to Mr. George Winch. I saw the barn all safe about the middle of the day before - there was a quantity of barley there, which had been thrown once. On Friday morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I was called, and found the barn broken open, and missed about a bushel of barley. I proceeded to the back door, and saw some foot-steps leading from the door towards a meadow, with a great deal of barley in the steps which had stuck to the shoes. I took the measure of the footsteps, and counted five nails in the heel of each shoe. I then returned, and informed my master - he suspected the prisoner, who worked in the adjoining grounds. I got a search-warrant, and went with the constable to the prisoner's house - he was not at home; we went up stairs, and found about a bushel of barley concealed in a little box, which was locked - the prisoner's wife refused to give us the key at first, but we got it and found the barley in it; it appeared to me to be barley once thrown. I had taken a sample of what we had in the barn, and compared it with that in the box - it corresponded exactly. I could swear to it - I have been in the farming business all my life, and it appeared to me exactly of the same quality - we then took the prisoner's shoes, and compared them with the foot-steps - they had five nails in the heel, which just corresponded with the marks.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had the barley been in a round heap? A. Yes; if a mouse had gone over it it would have been discovered.</p>

I took off the prisoner's shoes, and compared them with the marks in the ground - the number, size, and position of the nails exactly corresponded - they appeared nearly new, and both shoes had precisely the same number of nails - they fitted the foot-marks in length and breadth.</p>

We searched what we understood to be his bed-room, and found this parallel vice, and in a box this piece of ivory, two sets of letters and figures, and a pawnbroker's ticket for an opera-glass, which we got out - this is all my property - the prisoner had access to it all.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it from his information that you went there? A. Yes; the prisoner was a labourer - the landlord was a superior workman to him; the box in which the vice was, was open, the other was locked - these letters are made by a workman of our's out of doors. I cannot swear to any of this property.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you missed these articles before they were discovered? A. No; there was one letter left behind in the place where these were taken from, and that was missing from these letters when they were found. I am able to say, that two sets of letters had been taken from the place where the letter was found - they were in a case of property which we have in trust. I had taken an account of it perhaps twelve months before; it had been regularly entered in our books by the clerk.</p>

On the 19th of November he came home at twelve o'clock at night, and I went to make his bed in the upper room; I had the articles stated in a cupboard in that room - I saw them all safe then - I came down, and went to bed in the lower room; there was only my husband, me, my children, and the prisoner in the house that night. At six o'clock the next morning I heard the street door unlocked and unbolted - I asked who was there; the prisoner answered, "It is me;" I asked what time it was, and he said half-past seven o'clock- it was rather dark, and I said, "I think you are a liar." As soon as he had banged the door to I got up, and went into his room - I missed all the articles - I have not seen any of them since.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 25th of November, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing in Portland-place, and saw the three prisoners coming down Weymouth-street, playing together; Sheehane had a hair brush in his hand - I stopped him, and asked where he got it: he said the other boys had given it to him - the others had then run away; I took it from him, and he made great resistance. I took him to the Police-office, and searched him. I found this piece of leather in his breast - I asked where he got that; he said he went about selling them, and had sold the fellow to it that morning, for 1s.; it was wrapped up in paper, and a direction written upon it, "No. 28, Marchmont-street, Burton-crescent." I went there, and they identified it. I took the other prisoners next morning, but found no property on them.</p>

The prisoner came in on the 21st of November, and looked at some prints; she said she did not like any of them, and I got some others from the warehouse; when I returned I missed one of those I had shewn her; I then showed her what I had brought from the warehouse; she said she did not like them, and would call another day; I said it was odd none of them would suit her - she then said, "Cut me off seven yards of that," which I did- she paid for it, and went away. I went after her, and brought her back; Mr. Shoolbred said he thought she had got more than she should have; she said she had nothing but what she had paid for. We took her to the watch-house, and met the constable. As we were going along she dropped this piece from under her gown or her shawl.</p>

I told him I was out of place, and out of money, and asked him to lend me 10s. He said he had no money to spare, but I might take three or four of the bridles, and pawn them until the next day, if I would replace them, which I fully intended to do; while I was standing at the door the other witness came up, and Morris told me to run off; he had said he would not tell his master anything about them if I would replace them by two o'clock - he now swears against me to hide his own disgrace.</p>
               <p>COURT to GEORGE MORRIS. Q. Had you upon your oath, given this man leave to take them to pawn? A. No; I had not upon my oath. I had no suspicion of him when he was in the stable; he asked for Mr. Osmond's, and I was directing him when the other came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door shut when you got there? A. Yes; and the prisoner was inside. Mr. Osmond lives in the King's-mews, King's-road.</p>

I saw two persons with him, and he told me to run after the prisoner, who had taken the trousers and waistcoat from the iron rod - I pursued the prisoner. I first took another person - then I took him, and found the trousers and waistcoat under his coat - they are new, and had been hanging on the rod outside the door. I had put them out myself about eight o'clock that morning - he told the Magistrate he had picked them up - but a gentleman who was there, said he had seen him take them off the rod - here they are.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I went there again on the 12th of November, and when I had been there about an hour, I found the property was gone - the inner door had been broken open, and on examining it I found some impressions of iron work about it. I then examined the street door, and the warehouse door - neither of which were hurt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you in the interim sent any person to the warehouse? A. No; a bricklayer had a key that would admit him to the private part of the building, and he could get at the inner door to break it - he had had the key about a month before I left my trimming there. The prisoner is a stranger - no one lives at the house. I had not sold flounces there for a fortnight before - but I cannot swear that I had not sold these very flounces.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother, and lodge in Creed-lane. I had been out on Lord Mayor's Day, and when I was returning down Creed-lane, I saw two persons standing at the corner of the court near the warehouse. I took particular notice of the prisoner Dove, as being one of them. I went home, but as my landlady was not there, I said I would take a walk for a quarter of an hour, and when I went out, I saw the two men again. I went down Ludgate-hill, and when I returned they were gone. In a day or two afterwards, I heard my brother say he had lost something, and I told what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you see the young man standing? A. At the corner of the court, near my brother's premises. I had been out to spend the evening- I had been playing at cards, but had not been drinking. I saw the prisoners in custody, about the 16th or 18th of November. I had not seen any person whom I thought I knew between the time - but I saw two young men lurking about on the Sunday night.</p>

On the 5th of November, I was at work at the cellar, No. 4, Creed-lane - I shut the door, and left every thing safe - the warehouse where the goods were is parted from the passage. I locked the street door, and left the key at the Rising Sun, according to my orders. I gave it to the landlady - she is not here.</p>

            . I am a provision-dealer, and live in Cow-heel-alley, Golden-lane. The prisoner Elsey took a two pair back room there, in the month of September. Evans used to be there, and I believe has paid me the rent twice. I have seen him come in of an evening, and go up to that room - but I have not seen him in the morning; they did not take it as man and wife. I will not swear he lived with her - I have seen him about a dozen times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many times did you see him? A. I saw him once or twice, when I called for the rent. I have seen other men come there frequently. I believe Elsey got her living by seeing men.</p>

            . I went to the Benbow public-house, in Golden-lane, on the 11th of November - I took Evans, and from information I took him to the house in Cow-heel-alley - he said, "Mind, Vann, I don't live here at all;" Elsey and another woman were there; Elsey said she knew nothing of Evans at all, and the room was her's; the other woman said she came to sleep there. I saw this flounce on the table, which Elsey said some strange man had left there - and in the table-drawer I found six skeleton keys, and a crow-bar - this key opened the street-door of the warehouse in Creed-lane, and the bar exactly fitted the indentures in the wood of the inner door.</p>

            . I saw the two prisoners on this night, near Leicester-square - they followed the prosecutor to the corner of Pall Mall; they were together all the time. I saw Blackman take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to Roper. I told Reardon to keep his eye on them, while I went and told the prosecutor, who described his handkerchief as a yellow one, with a red border - we had then lost sight of the prisoners, but we went to Covent-garden, where we found them, and Roper had the handkerchief on his neck.

On the 29th of November I found six dozen and five packs of cards, upon the boards which compose the cieling of a privy which the prisoner uses - I found, by moving one of the boards, there was a space to put some cards. I then mixed a composition of vermilion and oil, and put it on the edge of the boards, so that no one could get the cards without marking their sleeve. The prisoner did not come to our premises until the following Saturday, when I watched him going to the privy - he staid some time - he then came through the front shop, and I asked him what he had been doing - he made some excuse, and wanted to go to the back premises. I then felt his pockets, and felt some cards. - I took him into the parlour, and found three packs of cards on him. I sent for a constable, but before he arrived the prisoner voluntarily emptied his pockets of twenty-nine packs. I then went to the privy, and the number left just made up the quantity I had seen there before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had not this man been some time in your house? A. Yes; he has been partly out of work for some time, though he has occasionally worked for us - he has a wife and ten children. I do not know that he has been in distress - he came to try to get work - he might earn from 8s. 6d. to 25s. a week - he was not in our employ at the time. I have every reason to think he was an honest man until that time.</p>

I had seen him about four weeks before, when he bought a pair of shoes; he came on the Saturday following, and the boots were ready - he tried them on, and was satisfied with them; he then asked if I had any light shoes to fit him; he tried several and selected one pair, which I said would be 8s.; he said, "That will be one pound thirteen together" - but nothing passed about the money being paid at the time of delivery. I asked if I should send them - he said "Yes; to No. 30, Myrtle-street, Hoxton - the name of Smith." I wrote the name and direction on the bottom of one of the shoes - he saw me write it, and I took his name to be Smith - he said"Send a bill and receipt with them." I asked him what time I should send them; he took out his watch and said,"It is now half-past two o'clock, I shall be at home till half-past four." I told him I would be there by four o'clock; about that time I took them with the bill and receipt, to No. 30, Myrtle-street. I knocked at the door - he let me in; he asked me into the parlour, and I took the boots and shoes out of the bag, and put them on the table; he then asked me for the bill and receipt, which I gave him; he asked what discount I allowed, and I said they were charged at cash price; he took the boots and shoes with the bill and receipt into the back parlour, which appeared to be a bed-room - I saw a bed there as he opened the door. I supposed he was gone to put them away and bring the money. I waited about five minutes, but he did not return; an elderly man then came into the parlour, and asked who I wanted - I said I had brought a pair of boots for Mr. Smith, and he was gone into the back parlour to put them on - he then retired. I staid about ten minutes longer, when the landlady came and asked what was my pleasure. I told her I had brought the boots and shoes, and was waiting for the money from Mr. Smith; she opened the bed-room door, and said "Here is no Mr. Smith here." I went and looked, but he was gone, with the boots and shoes. I considered he was at home, and I went with a determination to bring the money or the articles back. I thought he was gone into the room to put the things away. I should not have parted with them, if I had not expected the money. I then went and gave information at Worship-street. I did not see him again till the 22d of November, a little before ten o'clock in the evening, when I was at the Eagle Gardens, City-road. I saw two persons coming from the back part of the house, and when they came to the light of the lamp, I saw the prisoner was one of them. I laid hold of him and said"You rascal I have got you;" he said "What do you want?" I said "Where are my boots and shoes?" he said"I will pay you for them directly." I took him into the house and said "This is the young man I have been looking for these three nights;" he pulled out what money he had, which was 17s. 6d. and he offered me his watch. I said that was not my property, nor his, and I should not let him go; he had my boots on, and the shoes he said were at the Poulterer's Arms, public-house, Honey-lane Market.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not come four months before, and say I was recommended by Mr. Crutwell? A. You might, but I do not recollect it - you might have been a customer; when I brought the boots home, I reckoned it an order.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took me at the Tavern, did you not say"Where is the money for my boots and shoes?" and that you only wanted the money? A. No, I said "Where are my boots and shoes." I took the money and put it in my pocket. I did not say the watch was to serve as part payment - you gave it up as part of payment, but I did not take it as such. I was desirous of bringing him forward, because I knew there were other indictments against him.</p>

            . I live at No. 30, Myrtle-street, Hoxton. I never saw the prisoner till the 19th of November, when he came to my house for apartments, about a quarter before twelve o'clock. I let him my two parlours, but he was not to occupy them till the Monday following; he said he had just come from the country, and wanted the apartments for four months, as he was about to walk the hospital - that his name was Smith, and his father and him would call on the Sunday. I did not see him there when the prosecutor came - I was out. I never saw him but when he came to hire my lodgings, till he was in custody. When he came to hire the rooms, he looked at the passages in and out of the house, and went out at the back door; he said when he was going that he should probably send some luggage in - he never took possession of the rooms.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not take the lodgings from that day, and should you not have expected your rent that day week? A. No.</p>

            . I am headborough of Shoreditch. I was sent for on the 22d of November, to the Eagle, to take the prisoner into custody, at Mr. Smitzer's request - he gave charge of him for swindling him out of some boots and shoes. I found the boots on him. I found four duplicates in his possession, which he said were for his own property; he then said the prosecutor had 17s. or 18s. of his - the prosecutor said he had. I asked if he had kept it separate - he counted out 17s. 6d. and said the prisoner had given him this watch.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I bought the boots, I intended to pay for them. Mr. Smitzer knew me; when I met him at the Eagle, I gave him the 18s. as part of payment. I had called at the shop that evening, but it was shut up; he said if I could satisfy him where he could get the remainder of the money he should be satisfied.</p>

On the 23d of November, about half-past seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner, whom I had known before, take up the flat of butter on his shoulder, and walk towards Newcastle-street; when he had got about forty or fifty yards I said to him "You have made a grand mistake with that butter - where are you going with it;" he said "To Mr. White's, in Newman-street;" I brought him back and sent for an officer, who took him - there was 38lbs. of butter in it.</p>

            . I live in Phoenix-street, Hackney-road, and am a wheelwright. On the 7th of November I was walking in the road, and met the prisoner, (who was a stranger,) walking with another lad; he had a saw buttoned in his coat; I passed him, and then came back and asked him what saw that was; he said "Which?" and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080046"/>saw there were two of them; he said were they mine. I then took him to an officer. As we were going along two squares were picked up behind us, but I did not see them fall from the prisoner.</p>

I saw them again at the watch-house, and knew them to be mine- one of them was dead, and two were alive - I have no doubt they were mine - I had had them about six months.</p>

I met the prisoner in Wood's-place, Chequer-alley, on the 28th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening - Swift and Medlicot were with me; the prisoner had a bundle of leaden pipe - I asked where he got it, and he said, at last, that he got it from Mr. Lavers' premises, and was taking it to his own house, to take care of for his master, Mr. Lavers, of Old-street-road, a bricklayer and palsterer; as it was tied up in an apron, and wrapped up in his jacket, we took him to Mr. Lavers, who said he had no knowledge of the lead; I went the next day with Medlicot to fit the lead to an old house in Chequer-square, used by Mr. Lavers for making up his mortar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not he going to Mr. Lavers' shed? A. Yes; it was an old house of Mr. Lavers, where, as I have since heard, the prisoner lives.</p>

            . I am a plasterer. The prisoner has been several years in my employ - he had the care of some empty houses in Chequer-alley, Bunhill-row - he lives in one, and lets the others when empty - they are all my houses; I have a shed, opposite his house, for my materials. I believe this to be my property, but I did not see it fitted. I went to the house and found the lead was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had the prisoner been in your employ? A. About six years. I would readily employ him again.</p>

I came down, and saw him going off the step; I ran into the back parlour as he was going out so suddenly, and missed the watch - I ran up the street, and overtook him in Hat and Tun-yard, in custody of a young man; I asked him for the watch, which he gave me out of his pocket.</p>

I took the bundle, and said, "I suppose there is nothing but a coat" - he said, "No, nothing but the coat, and handkerchief." I looked into the pocket of the coat, and found this silk handkerchief, a pair of gloves, and two letters, directed to Nathaniel Gooding Clarke, Esq.; he then said he found the coat where they were breaking stones, at Westminster-abbey.</p>

In consequence of suspicion, I got a warrant to search his premises in the beginning of November - the officer Clements, and the prisoner went with me. I had told him I had a warrant to search his premises, which I knew to be in John-street, Fitzroy-square. When we went out, he was about to turn to the left hand instead of the right, and then I found he had left those lodgings, but his box was still there - we went there, and found the box, which was locked - the officer broke it open, and some of the property was in it - we then went to his other lodgings, where we found the remainder of my property.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ for three years - he was discharged on the 12th of November, for being insolent to one of the other servants. I afterwards received information, and got a warrant; I went with Avis to search his father's house, at Battle-bridge - we found him sitting by the fire, and I said "William, I understand you have robbed me" - he said he had never robbed me in his life. I said, "You have taken a pair of shoes, and other articles." He then said, he had taken a pair of soiled shoes, and looked about the house to find them. I then said, I heard he had taken tools to make shoes - he said he had bought them, but he could not give a strict account where. Avis then found three duplicates for boots and shoes, which were mine. - Avis told him three times that he was at liberty to make any confession he pleased, but he would neither make him any promise or threat - he then said that he would confess, that he had other duplicates, and he went with the officer into a back-room, and brought out of his box ninety-seven or ninety-eight duplicates, which he confessed were for my property. We took him to the office - I then went to the pawnbrokers, and got the articles. The prisoner is a cousin of my wife's, and she has a brother living within two doors of me.</p>

I sent her to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner a good character, one of whom stated he had no objection to employ him.</p>

On the 4th of November, the prisoner came and ordered some steaks for supper, which were got for him, and immediately after he was gone, I missed a salt-seller and a spoon, similar to those which had been set before him at supper. I have not found them. On the 5th he came again - he ordered a rump steak for supper, and I laid before him four table spoons, two salt-sellers, two salt spoons, and knives and forks. While I was gone to cut the bread, one of the salt-sellers was missing. I then went into the kitchen to get the steak, and when I took it to him, I missed two table spoons. I came out and mentioned it to Mr. Thomas. Morris, the officer, was sent for; he went in and told the prisoner he wanted him - the prisoner said"You are mistaken, you don't want me" - he said he did; the prisoner then got up, and the plate was found concealed behind him; he said he had been out, but I said he had not - he was then taken in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had not some things been missed before? A. Yes; he could not have gone out without my seeing him - no part of the property was concealed about his person - he did not seem intoxicated - no other person had gone into that box.</p>

The prisoner Jones was in my employ for three weeks - there were some bolts and screws in separate parcels locked up by themselves, in a room over the factory. I went with Cousins. the officer, to Jones' father's lodgings, in Cooper's-place - we found these articles there. I then went to Stanton's shop, and found some others - they are all mine. Those found at her shop were of little value.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I went to Jones' father's lodgings, on the 25th of November - we found these articles in the apartment - these ornaments had been fixed on a little pair of drawers. I then went to Stanton's shop, and found those other things - she said she had bought them nine months ago. Mr. Dobson said, his boy had robbed him to a considerable amount, and she had the whole of it - she said she had had none of it, and these things she had bought three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What shop does she keep? A. It is written over it, "Dealer in Marine Stores," but no name is up. The boy was taken by Mr. Dobson's man, and he came to inform me of it; but the watch-house-keeper said he was not justified in keeping him till I got to the watch-house. I asked him, why he did not return to his master's; he said he was afraid. I said, "I suppose you have done wrong," - he said he had. I told him I was an officer, and not to say any thing that would injure him - he then said, he had carried a pair of hinges to Mrs. Stanton's at first, and she gave him 2d. for them, and told him to bring any thing else, and she would give him a good price - that he had taken all the things there which he took from Mr. Dobson's, and she had given him 4d. the night before, and told him to go to Whitechapel and keep there; and if he was taken, not to tell where he sold them. I showed him these four bolts, on the Monday morning, at the office, and he said he sold them to Stanton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not this woman married? A. A man came to the office and asked for her - she was not present at this conversation.</p>

            . My father lives in King's-street, Soho - he is a saddle-tree-maker. Mrs. Stanton keeps her shop in the same house. I saw Jones one day in November at her shop - there was a man in the shop, and Mrs. Stanton was serving him - he waited till the man came out. I went on, and did not stop - he had a paper cap full of brass bolts and nails.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I saw the prisoner at our shop last Saturday - he brought 40lbs. weight of old metal - there was nobody at home but me - he offered it for sale, we had bought some metal of him a fortnight before, and having received some information, I stopped him. He gave no account of the property, but got away, and ran down the street - a neighbour stopped him about one hundred yards off. He had been in the habit of coming for about two months.</p>

I sold them at Pitt's-place - it is three months since, - Many servants have things given to them which are not worth repairing, and I have sold them for them.</p>

I put my hand to my side pocket, and missed this handkerchief, which had been safe about three minutes before - the prisoner threw it down in the street - I took it up and followed him; the officer came up in Church-lane - the prisoner got into an archway, and shut the door. I am quite certain he is the person - I never lost sight of him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard the cry of Stop thief! - and saw the prisoner running up George-street, with this handkerchief in his hand - he turned round, and threw it away. Mr. Daniels picked it up, and I took the prisoner at a public-house - he cleans boots and shoes on Sunday mornings. I believe he has been at the office before.</p>

On the 2d of December, about a quarter past one o'clock, the two boys at the bar came to my house, and Boyd asked me if I had a waistcoat that would fit him him - I thought they looked suspicious, and was afraid to venture it with them; Spears said, "Not a waistcoat to fit me?" I then shewed them an old one - they said it would not do; they went away, and said they would call between five and six o'clock - they looked in at the window, which attracted my attention, and I looked after them; they went towards Peter-street. In the evening, about five o'clock, Hopkins came alone, and asked for some pieces; I did not like to serve her, and told her it was a bad time to choose them; while she was talking I heard a drag at the window - some of the things fell into the shop, and some out. I ran round the counter, and saw Spears' head, but before I got out he and another boy with him had ran off; I know Spears was one. I did not see Boyd, but by the size I think it was him. I lost a man's waistcoat and a boy's dress, which were buttoned together - I had seen them safe just before. I have not got either of them again. The girl run off, suddenly while I was stooping to pick up the things, without having bought any thing; she went the same way as the boys. When my husband came home I described their persons to him, several times that evening.</p>
               <p>JOHN SAVAGE. My wife described the prisoners to me. I met them on the morning of the 3d of December, in Dean-street, Westminster, about ten minutes past seven o'clock; I knew them by her description; I asked a man who was sweeping a door where there was a constable; I had them all taken, and told the constable to bring them to my wife to see if she could identify them. Two of them got away, but Boyd was kept, and my wife said she could swear to him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BRAY. I am a Bow-street-patrol. I took the three prisoners in Wright's-passage, Tothill-street. I was taking them to Savage's house; I had one of the boys in one hand, and the other in the other - when I got near Marsham-street Spears said if I did not let him go he would run a knife through me; Boyd then began to kick and fight, and got away; I let Spears go, and secured Boyd; I took him to Mrs. Savage, who said she could swear he was one.</p>

I remember Goodliff coming to the house - I did not see him bring the umbrella and basket there, but I saw him in the box; the prisoner and a man who was with her came in just as the witness was going out, and were waiting to take their seat in the box when he left; they staid about five minutes to eat their soup; I saw the prisoner take up the basket and umbrella, and say, "Whose is this?" While they were contending about whether the soup was paid for, she went out. I asked my uncle if those articles had belonged to her - he said, No, they belonged to the old gentleman who went out before. The prosecutor came the next morning about it; the officer came afterwards - I described the prisoner, and she was taken.</p>

I have known the prisoner two years - she has had a hurt on her head, and was quite deranged on Wednesday week, when she called on me. - I have seen her for two or three days together, quite deranged, in consequence of being robbed and beaten dreadfully by a man, who was tried here for it. When she called on me that morning, she said her husband was dying, and she did not know whether she should make away with herself.</p>
               <p>Another witness gave the prisoner an excellent character, and engaged to take her under her care.</p>

On the 8th of December I had some oats which had been threshed, and were in bulk, in an old barn, where Carter was threshing. I sent Miles with a load of straw - this barn was in his way - I followed him and saw him stop at the barn - he had no business there, and I suspected he was taking some oats. As I got up to the cart he came out with a quantity of oats in a sack, and his nose bag; he could not see me till he came out of the barn - I told him how wrong it was- that I had caught him at last, and had long suspected him; he begged my pardon; I told him to go home - I got another man to go on with the load; Carter was in the barn, and I do not suppose he heard what I said; I then went in and asked Carter about it, and he said Miles was determined to take them - that he had told him not, and he would take them; I then took him before a Magistrate - he was doing his work, and was paid by the bushel.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you permit them to put oats into a sack or a nose bag? A. Yes, but not from that barn; I never give my horses oats which are not clean; there had been some measured out for him that day - the corn is measured out for him twice a week, and he takes what he thinks sufficient for the horses.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOOT. I am the constable. I took Carter before the Magistrate. I heard him and Miles examined; I saw them sign these depositions (read).</p>
               <p>Joshua Miles being asked what he had to say, says 'I took them from the barn for the use of my master's horses.'</p>
               <p>Charles Carter being asked how he came to suffer them to be taken, says 'Joshua Miles would take them against my will.'</p>
               <p>CARTER's Defence. He came to me for some oats - I told him I was not going to be blamed for it - if master knew it there would be a piece of work - but he took them against my will.</p>
               <p>MILES' Defence. I took them for my master's horses.</p>

The prisoner came to my shop on the 23d of November, between twelve and one o'clock - I was at a public-house opposite; they looked at the shoes, and then Fowler walked away - Taylor was left at the door. I then saw her put a pair of shoes into her apron, and go after Fowler. I followed, and heard Fowler say "I have got a pair too." I said "They are my shoes," and Taylor gave me a pair out of her apron, and told me the other had got a pair. I sent Patterson after her.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. Part of these goods were sent; and three dozen of dessert knives and forks, I took afterwards myself, to No. 91, Gloucester-place. I saw a servant - he told me to call the next morning before eleven o'clock, or before six in the evening. I went the next morning - he said his master had been gone out twenty minutes - I was to call in the evening. I went in the evening, and he called the prisoner, who gave me a dozen forks, and said they were sent instead of knives. I told him he should have the knives in the morning - he said there was no hurry for them. I went there two or three days afterwards, and took the knives, which I gave to the servant, who said his master was at dinner. I went again that evening, and saw the prisoner, who said he had my bill, but he was not prepared to pay me, as he had no money in the house, and he must go to his banker in the City to get it, but would call and pay me next day - he did not call, and I went on the following evening - I told him I called for my money; he said "I have nothing to do with the transaction; I do'nt even know you - my name is not Ireland; Mr. Ireland is at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080058"/>Richmond, but he will be in town on Saturday or Monday, and I will speak to him on the business, and he will call on you." I went and told Mr. Danell, who made some inquiries of the Magistrate. I went to the prisoner's house on the Monday, and saw him; he said Mr. Ireland had not been in town, but if I would take his word till Wednesday, at five o'clock, I might depend upon having the goods or the money. I asked him if he would let me have the goods, or part of them - he said he could not do that. I looked at him very hard, and said "Pray Sir, what is your name" - he said "Ireland."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen Mr. Ireland, when the order came to your house? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said you insisted upon having the money when the goods were left? A. No.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Lawton's employ - at his house in Green-street. I remember the prisoner coming there on the 7th of March last, and producing duplicates of property to the amount of 34l., which he had previously pledged there; he desired the property to be brought up, and a light, as he had some diamonds to seal; he then produced a small packet of diamonds, which he desired me to look at, and advance the most I could upon them; I looked at them, and agreed to advance 160l. upon them; I then, at his request, having agreed to advance that sum, handed them over to him to seal up, which he did, in my presence, and returned a packet to me, which I supposed to be the one containing the diamonds, as it resembled it in size and composition of paper, and every other respect. I put it into my breast coat pocket, and opened the parcels containing the other pledges; there was a diamond locket, which had been pledged for 9l. - a diamond brooch, for 5l. - a pair of gold watch cases, for 7l. 10s. - a watch movement, for 7l. 10s. - a gold chain, for 3l., and two seals, for 2l.; they had all been pledged on the 4th or 5th of March, and as such, were the property of Mr. Lawton. I cast up the whole amount which, with the interest, was 35l. 2s., and deducted it from the 160l. - I then left the parlour, and fetched him the balance of 124l. in gold and Bank notes, and some silver, which, with the goods, I handed over to the prisoner, for the diamonds, which I supposed I had got. Here is the packet which he deposited with me - I opened it about the first week in June - it contains coloured stones, called rubies and emeralds - the full value of which is 4l. I took out a warrant at Marlborough-street, and he was taken in November. I had no authority from my master to lend money, except upon pledges of an equivalent value.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he took you in? A. Yes. I delivered the money and property, supposing I had an equivalent for it in the diamonds, which I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you delivered these goods to him, to the value of 35l.; you parted with them entirely, thinking you had your master's consent so to do, thinking the diamonds left with you were of sufficient value to cover the value of them, and the cash you advanced? A. Certainly - impressed with the belief that the diamonds shewn to me in the first instance, would cover what I advanced in money, and the pawned goods, I parted with the goods stated in the indictment; and before I parted with them I had received the parcel containing, as I supposed, the diamonds.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. Had you examined the genuine diamonds? A. Yes, and I might then have detained them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you at that time given any thing for them? A. No, and he might then have put them into his pocket and gone away if he chose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You had looked at these diamonds, and believed them to be of genuine value, and given them back to him to seal? A. Yes, from a pre-arrangement made between us, as he said they might go through the hands of a second person, and he changed; I then received the sham diamonds (which I had not an opportunity of seeing without breaking the seal) and then handed to him the pledges, worth 35l. and the money - I had only delivered the genuine diamonds back to him, for the special purpose of being sealed.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. What became of the parcel of false stones? A. It was put into the plate closet, which two persons besides myself have access to - one of them is here. The packet is in the same state as when I received it; it has part of the seal on it now - it was not opened till I opened it in June: it was then in the same state as when I received it - I had enclosed it in another paper, which I sealed with my own hand; it had never been disturbed. - I never lent him money on his I.O.U. I have no share in the business.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you the key of the drawer in your possession? A. Yes, part of the time. All the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080060"/>time it was there it had the outside paper on it, which was put on and sealed by myself; it had not been disturbed or altered till I opened it myself in June, and the inner paper had this seal on it then; it was exactly the same in every respect, wafer, seal, and all.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. In whose presence was it opened? A. There was no one present.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I became acquainted with Mr. Lawton at Newmarket horse races, where he used to bet upon horses, and after that he accommodated me with money; I have had as much as 1000l. a-week, and he charged me 15 per cent., and when I have not been there from one to six weeks, he used to meet me at certain places, and ask me why I did not come, as he was anxious to do business with me; at last he offered me money to take-shares in a gaming-house - he said the profits belonged to him, and he promised me 20 per cent. profit - at last I ran in debt 900l. to him, which I have not the means of paying, and he and his shopman have conspired, and invented this, gaming debts being illegal. When I had nothing of my own he used to lend me money on a ring, or a key, which he took from his own shop; he has made a ticket on his own ring, and lent me, perhaps, 20l. upon it, to make money on the ticket, and thus he took things out of the shop, and made tickets of. I am labouring under great disadvantages, because he took me into his back parlour, and let no one know what we did. I cannot, therefore, prove his conduct to have been illegal.</p>
               <p>COURT to PHILIP LAWTON. Q. Have you ever kept a gaming-house? A. No. - nor have I ever spoken to the prisoner in my life. I do not think I ever saw him ten times.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did you never live in Bury-street? - A. No, never, I swear that.</p>

The prisoner was in my service for a year and three quarters - he left me on the 1st of November last, but not on account of this charge. On the night of the 9th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock, on Mrs. Fryer's retiring to her bed-room, she found several drawers were open - she immediately called to me, and on going into the room I found my wearing apparel scattered about the floor. I examined the drawer in which my cash had been deposited, and discovered that a small bag, containing a 10l. Bank of England note, five or six sovereigns, and an old watch, had been taken away. I also missed a sabre from the room. I had seen my money safe on the 5th of September, when I took some out. I know I left the note and five or six sovereigns in it then, to the best of my recollection. The note was dated the 5th of August, 1825, and was No. 12,850; I had received it at my bankers, Messrs. Cottrel and Trails; I stopped it at the Bank, I think, on the 19th of September - I did not think of it before, but it was suggested by a friend, and I did it. The prisoner remained in my service about seven weeks afterwards.</p>

The first key the officer shewed me was not mine, but it would open my box - the second he shewed me was mine; seven men worked at the stables, and any body who worked in the yard, could go into the room.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner on the 25th of November. I have a bent key which Mr. Ham gave me - I tried it to the prosecutor's box, and it opened it very easily. The prisoner lived at Mr. Hall's, in Gray's-inn-lane-road; I searched different things there, and found this other key in a case which the prisoner said was his; I tried it to the prosecutor's box, and it opened it more easily than the other - I showed both to the prosecutor, and he identified the key found in the case as his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first go to the prisoner's lodgings? A. On the 25th of November I told him I came to search, on a suspicion of felony - he said this was his case, and I went there again on the 28th; I saw the same key again; I saw two persons and a child there - I do not know whether there were any other lodgers - it was a common lock. I had taken away the prisoner on the 25th; he was not at liberty afterwards.</p>

            , who lives in Upper-north-place, Gray's-inn-lane-road - he is a pork butcher. I have a boy four years of age, and a girl of fourteen; the prisoner lodged in my kitchen and slept there; I have seen this case in his room - it is his; this bent key is the key of my kitchen cupboard door, in which I keep some dishes - no one goes into the kitchen but I, my husband, and the prisoner; I had missed this key twice before the 31st of October - it was taken away, and filed, and I had a difficulty in unlocking the door with it; I missed it again on the 1st of November, again on the 7th, and again on the 11th. On the 7th of November I saw the prisoner in the kitchen, and on the 11th he paid me two crown pieces, between ten and eleven o'clock at night - he appeared, about that time, to be flush of money, and had bought clothes and rings, and two very fine seals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he pay you your rent regularly? A. Yes, about every three weeks or a month; I cannot tell when I missed the key first; I have a gentleman who sleeps in the top room - the prisoner's father frequently came to see him.</p>

            . I keep the livery stables; the prosecutor slept in a room in my yard - I have seen the prisoner in that room, and in my house, many times; I do not know whether he ever makes his father's bed - he goes there when he pleases - he slept there formerly.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a fence round your yard? A. Yes, there are stables and coach houses, all round, and a gate which shuts up; you cannot go from the stable into the street without coming into the yard - it is some time since the prisoner was in service as a groom.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 24th of November I was in Castle-street, Oxford-market, about five minutes past nine o'clock, and saw the two prisoners, whom I had known before, going before me at a pretty brisk pace, towards Newman-street - Williams had a bundle under his arm; I followed and got before them in Newman-street; I looked them both in the face- Williams then crossed the way; they turned down Oxford-street, towards Rathbone-place. I followed at a small distance, and at the end of Rathbone-place they divided. Williams went round the hackney-coaches, and turned back up Oxford-street again on the other side of the way. Dunn went towards St. Giles's - Williams them turned into Dean-street, and looked occasionally over his shoulder to see if I was watching. I followed him down Dean-street - he ran very fast down Carlisle-street into Soho-square, and into Bateman's-buildings. I gained upon him very fast, and he threw down the bundle. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080062"/>took it up, and cried Stop thief! he was stopped by a young man in my presence. I took him to the watch-house; the bundle was loose in a silk handkerchief. I found it contained a top coat, and a livery coat, and two cards with "Mrs. William Beckford, No. 12, Manchester-square," on them; in the prisoner's coat pocket, there were five bundles of matches, and in his hat twelve more. I found on him a duplicate in the name of John Dunn; upon Dunn's being taken the next day, another duplicate, in the name of John Dunn, was found on him. Williams said the man I had seen him with had given him the coats to carry. I gave information to Bertraun and others, and Burtraun brought Dunn the next night into Wardour-street, and I saw him there. I knew them both before.</p>

On the 26th of November I went to Mr. Perry for the key of his stable - he went to the prisoner, who is his servant, and brought the key - the prisoner followed him. Perry did not give me the key, but went and put it in the stable door himself - he could not open it - but the prisoner did. I found two sacks in the stable - the prisoner untied one, and I found some black oats in it. I examined the other afterwards. I had twenty-five quarters of oats shot loose in my loft, and could not miss any - but if a quantitity had been taken, they might have been missed by a man who saw them frequently. When I pulled some of the oats out of the sack, the prisoner said they belonged to Hatchet and Dyke, who have horses standing in the same yard - there was a little more than four bushels in each sack.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you miss any of them? A. No; the lofts communicate over the partition - mine is a corner of Mr. Perry's, but I have a door from my loft into my own premises - the two sacks were in the stables, any one going in might easily see them - black oats are very common.</p>

            . I am Mr. Gibbons' carter. On the 25th of November, about five o'clock, I went home with his horses to Market-street - when I unhooked the chainhorse, I saw the prisoner at the top of the ladder, with a sack on his shoulder - the ladder was standing on the pavement, to go up to Mr. Perry's loft, where there was a parcel of scaffolding kept - the loft door was open - he came down the ladder, and went out of the yard with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080063"/>the sack, which hung very heavy on his shoulder - in two or three minutes he returned, went up the ladder, and pulled out another sack and brought it down, and went out of the yard again, with it into the street - he came back in a short time, went up the ladder and shut the door, pinned it and took the ladder away. Next morning, about half-past five o'clock, I went and told my master, and when he sent me home, I found some black oats scattered about where the ladder had been - the door opens into the street - and if a man wanted to take oats from that loft to Mr. Perry's stables, he would go the same way the prisoner was then going.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the prisoner a servant of Mr. Chapman's? A. I do not know; he was a servant of Mr. Perry's - if he wanted to come out of his master's loft, that would be the way he would have come down - he went entirely out into the street, and I did not see where he put the sacks. I know Mr. Gibbon's stables, but I did not see him put anything there - he had as good an opportunity of seeing me as I had of him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not Mr. Perry's loft that he came out of? A. Yes; and he went into his master's stable.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with Mr. Gibbons, to Millbank-street, to take the prisoner - we were walking behind him, and he turned and said, "Mr. Gibbons, what is this about your clover and oats?" I told him he must go with me. He said he would be d-d if he would - we took hold of him, and went about twenty yards - he then made another stop, and we were obliged to handle him rather roughly. As we were going to the watch-house, I asked how he came by the oats we had found in the stable. He said a man like a coal-heaver asked him, the day before, to let him leave them there - but who he was he did not know. On the following Monday we went to the stable, to get a sample - Mr. Gibbons took the sample from the heap, and I from the sacks - there were some beans mixed with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not horses eat beans as well as oats? A. I believe they do. Mr. Perry has a loft there.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my employ for about six weeks. I never recollect keeping oats in my part of the loft.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any rubbish in your part of the loft, that the prisoner would have occasion to put away if he cleaned it? A. There were some scaffolding, and other things which were frequently moved. I think I have heard that the prisoner has four children - I had a good character with him. I had no horse, and did not go to the stable - the prisoner kept the key of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the things into the loft according to my masters orders - and what corn we had left I put into the binn - the person who left these sacks, brought them in a little cart about twelve o'clock, and said they belonged to a Mr. Hatchard, I believe - but he did not call for them again.</p>

            . I am a watchman, at the new buildings in Chester-terrace. On Thursday last I went into the vault of an unfinished house, and found these three pots, covered with some bricks and a board - I left them there and went to my work till five o'clock - I then took another person with me, and we saw the prisoner come and take them; we let him go into the main road; I then said"Cotton, you have got something there you should not have;" he said "I have a bit of wood;" I said "You have something else;" he then pulled out one quart pot- I said "You have more," and he pulled out the two pints - I took him to my master.</p>

            . I am a baker. The prisoner rented the stable of me, in which the cart was found - I had one key of it, and had the privilege of keeping a truck there. On the morning the cart was found, the 18th of November, my truck was brought and put under my window - it was brought there sometimes by the prisoner, and sometimes by others; I afterwards went with the street-keeper and an officer, to the stable; I tried to open it with the key, but could not; I then found the lock was gone, and it was tied with a bit of string to the cill, and a book; I saw a strange cart there and a harness.</p>

            . I am street-keeper. On the morning of Friday, the 18th of November, I went, by the direction of the prisoner, to Sermon-lane. I had apprehended him on another charge, and, as I was going to put him into the inner place, he said "I will tell you something - if you go to my stable, and wait there, a tall man, with a rough great coat, and pockets outside, will come on a horse, to fetch a cart away! but you must hang up the lantern in a particular place, and whistle, or it will be no go.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had the misfortune to become acquainted with Smith, through a man whom I used to meet at the market - he came and asked if I could make room in my stable to put a horse and cart in; I said I did not know, but if it was not large, I would see; he said he should not want it there longer than Friday night; I said I would make room for it. He came on Thursday night- it was put in, and he sent a man, with a truss of hay, to clean the horse; all I was to receive was the remains of the hay, and 1s. As to making any confession, and saying it would be of no go, I declare, by the word of God and man, it is false; I merely stated that a man would come to take the cart; the stable door was open and Mr. Young had a key as well as myself.</p>
               <p>COURT to THOMAS Cope. Q. Are you quite sure he made use of the expression that you must hang up the light and whistle, or it would be of no go? A. Yes, I am.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had not the prisoner told you of his receiving this 28l? A. No; on the 2d of November, I would not take a cheque for the 28l., because the 11s. was deducted from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you might have had it with the 11s. short? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Then you returned that? A. Yes, the prisoner was with me on the 2d, when he offered me the payment with the 11s. deducted, and the next day he received ten sovereigns and the 5l. draft.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The first transaction was between Mr. Somers and you? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not always in the prisoner's hands a floating balance left? A. No, not on any occasion.</p>

            , JUN. I am the son of James Somers, of Oxford-street. I saw 15l. paid to the prisoner on the 3d of November - there were some sovereigns and a draft of 5l. - I paid it to him on his master's account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been always as positive of this? A. Yes; I stated before the Magistrate, that there was some part paid in sovereigns, but I could not tell what; I said I had paid 10l. in cash, but I could not say what number of sovereigns; I am positive I paid some sovereigns.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in the habit of serving Mr. Somers a good while, and Mr. Godfrey had never done any business with him before I went there; I was in his shop on the 2d of November, and Mr. Somers, the el<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080065"/>der, gave me a cheque for the goods; I had sold him for 28l., and told me if I called again he would give me the rest. I went and gave Mr. Godfrey the cheque, as he was in the cart at the door; he said "I shall not take it without the 11s., unless you make it good;" I went back, and said"Mr. Godfrey will not take it without the 11s. and I cannot lose money every time;" he said "Call again and I will pay you;" I called several times and he would not pay it, on account of the 11s. Mr. Godfrey has said that he brought this case forward merely because he understood I was going to leave him, and set up in opposition to him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GODFREY re-examined. Q. Did you ever say you brought forward this case in revenge? A. No, I never heard he was going to set up in opposition.</p>

            . I am a stationer, and live at No. 17, Little Queen-street, Holborn. The prisoner came to my house on Tuesday, November, the 8th, and asked me if I could engrave a plate for a promissory note in the course of that week, from a copy which he left me, which I have not got here - he told me it was for a new Bank that was then going to commence. I engraved the plate from the copy he left, and by his orders, I printed five hundred. I have received some letters from Bath, but I have not communicated with the prisoner on the subject of them - there is no one here from Bath; this note is one of my engraving by his order. I think he gave me 3l. 11s. for them. I had not made any inquiry whether there was such a Bank forming, as I had not the least suspicion, till he called for the five hundred, paid for them immediately, and gave me a further order to take the five out, and put a two in, to make 2l. notes, to save the expence of another plate; he had called on the Saturday evening, and had four or five notes, and on the Monday he had the remainder. I never engraved a plate precisely similar to this for any body else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You employ people to engrave these things when they are ordered, and if a man wanted a cheque plate, or a draft plate, it is quite in the way of your trade? A. Yes; he ordered the 5 to be taken out, and a 2 put in, which is quite a common thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever been to Bath to inquire if there is such a firm as Hobhouse, Wright and Hunter there? A. No - I wrote, and have the letter I received in answer.</p>

I shewed him some which I took out of the window - he chose a ring and a brooch, and agreed to give 1l. for them; he tendered a Pontefract Bank note for five guineas - here is the note. I looked at it, and remarked that it was not payable in London; he said he would give me one that was, and produced this Bath and Bristol note for 5l. - I have never been to Bath to inquire about it.</p>

I saw the prisoner come down Petticoat-lane; Cousins put up his hand, and came across to him; we were in a house close by; the prisoner and Cousins spoke, and something passed from Cousins to the prisoner, and from the prisoner to Cousins; he then went away - I went out and took Cousins to Hall's house, where he gave him twenty counterfeit shillings, which Hall took and marked; I followed Cousins all the way, and it was impossible he could have received them from any one else; they are done up in fives.

The prisoners brought the rope to me about seven o'clock on Monday morning; Riley staid outside while Monnagan came in, and said he had got some rope to sell - I knew him to be a bad character, and I told him I had no change; he insisted upon leaving it till eight o'clock; I then turned him out of the shop; nothing had passed between us about price; I was not up when he came. I sleep in the shop, and I told him as I laid in bed that the rope should not be left - he took it away, and sent another man with, what I believe to be, the same rope; it appeared so. I remarked the rope to be about 1cwt., 1qr., and 10lbs. I had not given information about it.</p>

            . I am a watchman, of Great Cumberland-street. About three o'clock on the morning of the 9th of December, I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor pass by me - the prosecutor seemed very much intoxicated, and the prisoner was supporting him along; in about twenty minutes I saw the prisoner run by on the other side of the street, and the prosecutor came running as well as he could after him without a coat - he cried Stop thief! I went after the prisoner, and saw him taken in Oxford-street. As I went behind him, he dropped this glove, which I picked up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had I the coat when I passed you? A. You had something dark under your arm, which appeared to be a coat.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty at the corner of Old Quebec-street. I heard the alarm, and the rattles - the prisoner ran by me in Oxford-street. I followed, and saw him drop this coat - while I took it up he gained ground on me; he was stopped at the corner of Park-lane.

            . I keep the Bull's Head, public-house, in Leadenhall-street. On the 25th of November the prisoner came in between twelve and one o'clock, and asked for half-a-pint of porter - she gave me a sixpence, which I said was a bad one; she gave me another, and I gave her 41/2d.; I saw she had a number of halfpence - I should think 1s. worth; I kept the had sixpence by me - I let her go, having seen her before. I am confident she is the person. She came again two days afterwards, and offered a bad sixpence to my wife, who tapped at the window and called me.</p>

            . I am an officer, and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went into the shop to buy a bit of bacon, and there was not a bit to suit me; I walked out again, and was not three yards from the shop, when the young man came and took me back to the door of the back parlour - he said, "What have you got there?" I said, "I have nothing;" he turned back to the shop - he then saw a piece of bacon by my side on the counter, and said,"Here it is."</p>
               <p>GEORGE SHARP re-examined. I brought her back with it in her arm - when I got her to the back of the shop I said, "Where is the bacon," and the young man who was in the shop said, "Here it is;" he saw her lay it down on the counter. I declare that she took it from the window; I saw her take it and bring it into the shop, and go out again. I did not see her put it on the counter, but I saw her with it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see it in her possession after you brought her back into the shop? A. No; she had put it down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Here is what you stated before the Magistrate, and signed, "I followed after her, and took her at the corner of Hampshire Hog-yard, and took from underneath her shawl the piece of bacon now produced;" now which of these is true? A. My Lord, I might have made a mistake; but I have said nothing falsely.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the bacon you saw on the counter is the piece you saw her take? A. I found the property on her.</p>

The prisoners were convicted of a larceny - the indictment charged it to have been committed in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate - but the parish was proved to be St. Botolph, without Aldgate. Their Lordships' were unanimously of opinion, that, as in case of larceny, the proof of the parish was unnecessary, and as the prisoners had not proved that there was no such parish, the conviction was legal.</p>
