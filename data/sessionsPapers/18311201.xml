On the 5th of October, about eight o'clock at night, the prisoner called on me - he appeared sober; he said he called, expecting a letter, or message; from his wife - I told him I had received no letter, nor message; his wife was at that time working at Mrs. Nightingale's, Fetter-lane- he asked if I would go and fetch her; I said I would not, but at last my niece went to see if she was there - she at last came to my room; that was between half-past eight and nine o'clock - the prisoner was still in the room; when she first came in he got up and caught hold of her by the hand, as if in friendship - he then pushed her into the corner, and asked her to live with him again; she replied, "Keep off, I cannot live with you any more; "I then got up, and said, "Parrott, leave her alone;" I took her into an adjoining room, and said, "Mrs. Parrott, you have weathered many storms with him, try him once more" - she said she could not, for she was in danger of her life; he was in my kitchen at the time, but could hear what passed, for he pushed into the room immediately, and I then took her into the bed-room - he followed us into that room, and asked her if she would return to him again; she told him No, she could not live with him any more - he said, "Won't you?" she said No, she could not; he pushed her into a corner, and then turned himself round quick - I turned round but for a moment; he did not speak, then he turned round, and I saw him put his hand into his pocket, pull out a piece of paper, and he directly seized her by the throat; she called out, "Oh, my throat! my throat!" I called to my husband, "Chell, for goodness sake come here, for he is choking her;" I did not suppose he was doing any thing more than throttling her - my husband came immediately; I then saw her throat was bleeding to an extreme - she said, "The instrument is in my throat;" he said, "No, it is not," and then he threw a razor away - it caught on my drawers, and broke the glass; I directly sent for an officer - I afterwards saw the officer take the razor up, and it was bloody; his wife bled so profusely, that my husband went without coat or hat on for Mr. Bradford, the surgeon - he arrived in about ten minutes; the bleeding had not stopped - my husband did all he could to stanch the blood.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner do? A. I was supporting his wife on a chair, and he came and said, "Good bye, perhaps we shall meet again in another world;" he was then secured - I kept his wife at my house all night, and sat up with her all night, fearing it would hurt her to remove her; she was taken to the hospital next morning, and was there three weeks - the wound was very large; it went upwards, which prevented its cutting the arteries.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Have you known them often quarrel, and be reconeiled again? A. I must leave that to the wife to say; she never left him before, to my knowledge, except to sleep at a friend's house for a night; I have known them quarrel - they never separated; I cannot say whether he had a strong affection for her - he expressed a strong affection that night, and entreated her to come back; he never would work for her, nor his family - he said, "My dear Harriet, for God's sake let us be reconciled;" I never saw any thing to lead me to conclude he was flighty in his mind - his wife has said his tricks were mad at times when he was tipsy, but he was quite sober then.</p>
               <p>Q.His wife said his tricks were mad at times? A. No, not on that night, nor any thing like it; she has repeatedly said that he had mad tricks, and was tipsy - she never told me he had met with an accident in the head; I know nothing of his having a blow from a cricket-ball- he has had five children by his wife; the eldest is twenty-two, and the youngest nine years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner call out, at the instant he cut her throat, "Oh, God! what have I done?" A. No, he did not; he did not support her in his arms - he did not touch her till my husband got her out of the bed-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010004"/>room into the kitchen; he then sat down opposite me, took up the beer, and drank the officer's good health - when the doctor came he knelt down on the hearth, and looked at the wound while the doctor was sewing her throat; we would not let him go out - it did not strike me that there was any thing extraordinary in his conduct.</p>

            . The prisoner is my husband - he had not lived with me from the Tuesday five weeks before this happened; I was at work at Mrs. Nightingale's, and slept over the water - I did not then know where he lived. I went to Mrs. Chell's on the 5th of October, as she sent over for me - I got there between eight and pine o'clock, and saw my husband there; when I opened the room door he came to me in a hurry - I told him to keep off; he came to me - I said, "Keep off! keep off! let me alone!" Mrs. Chell asked me to go into the next room, and I told him to keep away and let me alone; Mrs. Chell then asked me to try him again, and live with him - I said I could not, and then he came into the room; I do not think he could hear what was said - he asked me to live with him again; I said I could not - he asked me again, and said, "Won't you?" I said No; he said again, "Won't you?" I said No - he turned sideways to me, took something out of his pocket like a letter, and tore it, then turned round, and took me by one side of the neck and pressed it, but what with I could not fell; I said afterwards, "Oh! you have left the instrument in my throat;" he said, "No, I have not - there it is," and threw something across; I perceived blood coming from my throat - there was a looking-glass opposite, and I could see it streaming down; I just recollect Mrs. Chell coming to me, and remember getting across the room into the kitchen, and sitting down there, and that is all: I just recollect my husband saying, "We shall meet in another world;" I was insensible when the surgeon came - I came to myself afterwards; I passed the night at Chells, then went to the hospital, and was there three weeks and one day; I had been married to the prisoner twenty-three years - I have three children with me now; the youngest is between nine and ten years old - I do not know how my husband got his living after I left him; I am quite sure I said nothing to him, but refused to live with him again; I did not reproach him, or strike him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you had some quarrels? A. Yes, and had been reconciled again; Mrs. Nightingale had talked to him the day after I left him, but not particularly to reconcile us - she had not endeavoured to persuade me to return to him; I have seen my husband in rather a flighty and deranged state of mind when he has had a little to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not seen him at times a little flighty without drink? A. No, not particularly - drink would make him flighty latterly; his actions were like a mad man sometimes - he was struck by a cricket-ball on Kenningnton-common six or seven years ago, and received an injury on the temple; he did attempt to destroy himself the day after I left him, which was five weeks before - I do not know of his having attempted it before at any time.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know whethere he has a mark on his neck of his having attempted to cut his throat? A. I have heard he attempted it; he was sober when I came to Chell's - it was all done in the space of five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think he was in the state you had seen him before, crazy and heated? A. He did not appear so bad then - he was all of a work seemingly; I was not in the first room half a minute, and hardly know what condition he was in there - I was so flurried at seeing him, I hardly know; I think he said, "My dear Harriet, for God's sake let us make peace;" he appeared anxious to be reconciled - I do not know what happened to me after my throat was cut, and do not know what he said at the instant; I do not recollect his saying, "O, God! what have I done?"

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Fleet-street. I was sent for to Mrs. Chell's about nine o'clock in the evening; Mrs. Parrott was sitting in a chair- there was a puddle of blood, in the room, and a great deal over her clothes; Mr. Chell's hand was over her neck, and when it was with drawn the blood flowed freely - I said at first that she was dead, for she was cold and blanched, and her sight apparently gone, but Chell said she was not dead; it was a large wound, four or five inches long, of a semicircular shape - it had gone obliquely upwards; the large vessels were laid bare for an inch and a half - the jugular vein had a slight scratch; if the wound had not gone upwards it must have caused instant death; I secured the vessels, laid her down, and sewed the wound up- I went with her to the hospital: I thought the wound dangerous, and ordered her to lay on the floor all night, and not to be moved - I saw the prisoner in the room; my mind was engaged with the wound, but I heard him say, "I committed it;" when the wound was dressed he approached towards her, and used some expressions, but I thrust him back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You do not recollect the expression? A. I do not, but I was afraid he would disturb the wound again by the excitement; he was in one corner of the room when I entered, and Mr. Chell was holding the wound; I found the room door open - I should think the prisoner might easily have gone before I came.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to MRS. PARROTT. Q.Before you went into the second room you yourself said you would not live with him? A. I said I could not live with him - I did not say to Mrs. Chell, "You see he is mad in a moment;" I said, "See how he turns in a moment."</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in charge; I asked him where he got the pony - he said a man named Williams had hired him to sell it for him; I asked him where Williams lived - he said he did not know- that he was an entire stranger to him, but he had slept with him the night previous at a public-house in Kent-street; I asked him what Williams was - he said a hawker, and that he himself was also one, but he had had nothing to do for the last three months; I asked where Williams was to be found - he said he did not know, but he expected to meet him at Liverpool, to give him the money, and that he was gone there to ship some goods; on searching him I found a toll-ticket of the Bermondsey gate, dated the 21st of October.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Williams is a man I know very well, and I have worked with him many times. Witness. I am quite positive he said he only knew him by sleeping with him the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I slept with Williams at the Royal Oak, Kent-street - he said he had a horse for sale, and knowing me to be out of employ he asked me to go to Smithfield, and sell it for him; he told me to lay out the money in goods, come to Liverpool, and meet him where the mail-coach starts for London.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to ask the prisoner to take 2l.? A. Because I had had so much trouble about it; I received 50s. for it, and went to the prisoner - I deducted 10s. for myself, 10s. I left as security, and 11s. for the shoes - and paid him 19s.</p>

Yes, on the Saturday night I took the shoes home to him, and he asked me to come the next morning, and look at the clock; I asked him how he got it, and he said he took it for a bad debt.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Gofton, a pawnbroker, in Gilbert-street, Oxford-street. -On Saturday, the 5th of November, I was in my master's shop, and saw the prisoner there, offering to pledge some table-spoons - I did not hear what he said at first; Mr. Gofton had the spoons in his hand - I heard him say he wanted to raise the money, and if he would lend him 3l. on them he would redeem them again in March; Mr. Gofton asked if they belonged to him; he said Yes, and that he had other plate at home, a small waiter and silver tea-pot - he was asked where his home was; he said in Mount-row, and mentioned a number, which I do not recollect - Mr. Gofton told me to get my hat and go with him; I then asked him if the plate was at Mount-row - he said it was not, but that a friend of his had had it at Lady Elizabeth Talbot's, No. 40, Hertford-street; I went part of the way up the street with him he then said he saw no reason why he should go with me, and he would not go - I had one spoon with me, and the rest were left at Gofton's; I then said, "We will go back to Mr. Gofton's;" he went back with me as far as the door- Mr. Gofton, seeing us coming back, asked one of the young men in the shop to fetch his hat - he went for it himself, as the young man did not bring it directly; the prisoner then walked up the street, and I by his side- be walked quietly till we got to South Moulton-street; he then said he should go down South Moulton-street; I collared him, and said he should not go - he knocked my arm from him and ran away; I ran after him, and called Stop thief! he then stopped in the middle of the road, turned round, and saw Gofton coming after us - he then walked quietly along to the station-house, and we gave him in charge; I heard him say in the shop that he was out of a situation, in very great distress, and wanted money very bad; this was just after I had got my hat in the shop, and was going to start with him - I produce the six table-spoons, which I have had ever since; I took one with me to the station-house - the other five were left at Gofton's, but when I came from the station-house they laid on the back counter, where I had left them; the six spoons would be worth about 3l.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 5th of November the prisoner came to my shop, and gave me six spoons to pledge - he said they were his own property, that he had been to sea, and mentioned the name of a captain, who, he said, had given him the spoons with other plate - he said that was three years ago, and from the apparent freshness of the spoons I suspected that could not be the case, as they were not tarnished, and I asked where he lived - he said in Mountrow; I said if I went to Mount-row with him could the person there give any satisfaction that the property was his own - he said they could not, but if I went to Hertford-street, May-fair, I might see various articles of plate that were his own; I sent Waters with him - I followed him to the station-house after they came back; I saw him searched, and six table-forks found on him - the forks are worth about 4l.; the weight of silver in the spoons is worth 3l. - they may be worth 4l.; I weighed them - I have not weighed the forks, but suppose them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010008"/>at out the same value, or perhaps a few shillings more -I have not a doubt of the intrinsic value of them all being 6l.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was at the station-house on the 5th of November, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon - Mr. Gofton and his man came in with the prisoner; I searched him, and he himself handed to the clerk these six forks - I found on him 4s. 6d. in silver and 5 1/2d, in copper; as Mr. Gofton said he had varied in his account, I told him not to give us trouble, but to tell us at once where he got them from; I did not either threaten or make him any promise - he said if we would go to No. 40, Hertford-street, May-fair, we should hear of them; that he took them from his master Captain Poulett; that he wanted to try the value of them.</p>
               <p>HONORABLE CAPTAIN POULETT. These spoons and forks are all mine - there were but six of each in use.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) After the evidence adduced against me I beg your attention for a very short time, before proceeding to judge my case, while I state that I am a native of Nova Scotin, and having had an early propensity for a seafaring life I entered his Majesty's service, about twelve years ago, and continued to give every satisfaction to my various commanders untill the period I entered the service of Captain Poulett, of his Majesty's ship the Prince Regent, to whom I was recommended by Captain Southerby, of the Seringapatam. I have lived in the service of Captain Poulett upwards of three years, during which time it has been my only wish to serve him honestly and faithfully, in return for the confidence which he invariably reposed in me, and continued in his service until the fatal morning, when I am afraid that I for ever blasted my prospects in this life, and it renders me at the present time truly unhappy in my mind. Upon the forenoon of the day in question a young man, a former acquaintance, called upon me, and as he was going into the country I, much against my inclination, and totally at variance with the rules of sobriety, that I ever have practised, accompanied him to an adjoining public-house, where he called for some rum, and not being accustomed to drink spirits of any kind I was, from the effects of it, rendered quite insensible. When I returned home I had been cleaning some silver plate, and most unaccountably put some of the articles into my pocket; but from what motive I, after mature and deep reflection, cannot state. I could not have done the action from any dishonest motive, as I had a sufficiency of money in my possession, and my master, Captain Poulett, had also a sum of money of mine in his possession as wages, so that it could not proceed from want. I humble pray the leniency of the Court - I feel deeply impressed with a sense of shame for the act I have committed, which I never could have done in my sober moments, and more so, as my character, both as to honesty, attention to my master's interest in every respect, and sobriety, was formerly unimpeachable.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN POULETT. He lived with me three years - I really thought him one of the best servants I had, both on land and sea, and perfectly honest; he had every thing belonging to me in his charge, and I could leave my house with the greatest satisfaction; I never knew him drunk, water was his beverage - he was always ready to do his duty; I certainly feel much concerned to be his prosecutor, but the knowledge of the circumstance coming to me I could not do otherwise than I have - I think, if it had not been for the impulse of the moment, I should have been disposed to look it over; there were wages due to him, and I had given him money that day to pay bills, which he did pay - Lady Elizabeth Talbot rented my house before I came there.</p>
               <p>MR. GOFTON. I did not know him before; I did not observe that he was tipsy.</p>

Gardener's-lane, and there we found the whole of the property - this was an hour or an hour and a half after it happened; the counterpane and one sheet were under the bed - the other sheet, two pillows and two blankets on the bed, and the prisoner's wife had got my night-jacket on; the property is worth 1l.; I have seen the prisoner come to and fro to a house in Queen-street, but only knew him by sight.</p>

On Thursday, the 17th of November, I was at Uxbridge; it was market day - I saw Dowling at the Sun there, kept by Mr. Cherry, and in the evening, a little before six o'clock, I went with her to Mrs. Langdon's house, in Bell-yard, Uxbridge, for a certain purpose - I did not stay above five minutes there, and gave her a shilling; I had about 26s. in silver, in a purse in my watch pocket; I did not pull out my purse, as I had a shilling loose in my breeches pocket - I was sober; I had had a little beer, but was sensible; I am quite sure I had the money about me when I left the house, for before I left the room I felt for it, and not recollecting that I had shifted it from my breeches pocket to my fob, I accused her of having it, but found it in my fob, and she blamed me for accusing her falsely, and said, "If you don't stand half a pint of gin I will punch your head;" I said, "I have accused you wrong, and will stand a drop of gin;" we went down to the Sun, and had some gin together - she followed us from there to the Eight Bells; a man named Weatherly was with me; they followed me up to the town - we both drove our carts up into the town, and at the Eight Bells Weatherly called for a pint of beer; I went in after him, but before I went in the two prisoners attacked me against 'Squire Cox's park, about two hundred yards from the Bells.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners come up to you together? A.She pushed me across the road, and wanted me to go with her again; she wanted me to pull off my great-coat, which I refused - she then said, "You have blamed me for the money, and I will give you a punch of the head;" she hit me a hard blow on the nose with her first, and was going to strike me again, but I caught hold of her arms; I held them, and the male prisoner came up behind me - I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010010"/>sure of him; I have every reason to believe he is the same man - it was quite a moon-light night; I had seen him that evening in the room, taking a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing when he came up? A. No, he put his leg behind me, put his arm round me, and threw me back; we had a scuffle on the ground - I got the better of him, got up, and ran away to the Eight Bells, to Weatherly; it might be one hundred yards from there - I called Weatherly out; my face was all over blood: I said"Philip, come out and see what is the matter;" he came out, but they were both gone; I washed my face, sat down, and took a pint of beer or more with Weatherly, and before we left the house the prisoners had the impudence to come in where we were, and they took part of the beer which we were drinking - Weatherly asked them to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then complain that they had attempted to rob you? A. No, I gave up thinking any thing about it; we seemed good friends; nothing passed between us - we remained there about half an hour - I and Weatherly then went out together, and each got into our cart; after going to the next public-house, kept by Mr. Honey, about a quarter of a mile from the Bells, the prisoners followed us, and we all went in together there; Weatherly called for a pot of beer - we all four drank it together; we had another pot there: Weatherly would not come away without having some more, and we had 4d. worth of bread and cheese- Weatherly and I came out; they followed us directly, and on going down the hill from that house to Hillingdonend, about a quarter of a mile from the house, Weedon jumped up into my cart; Weatherly's horse was going at full trot; I was keeping mine from going too fast, and when I turned my head round Weedon was in my cart- I asked what he did there; he did not answer - I told him to get out, or I would throw him out; he did not get out, but he took me by the collar in the cart, and began feeling outside my breeches pocket for my money; I caught hold of his collar and one of his legs, and threw him out of the cart as well as I could, but he hung to my collar, and we fell out together, and had several tussels on the ground- I got the better of him most of the times while he was by himself; and after we passed the canal bridge, at the bottom of the hill, he got me down again; we had two or three more ups and downs - Dowling stood at some distance, and finding me get the better of him, she said, "Get him down again, or else he will get away from you, and I will assist you;" I did not see her, but could hear what she said - I was not on the ground when she spoke, but we were having a scuffle; he got me down, and she came and helped him - they confined my hands, got hold of my neck handkerchief, and almost strangled me: the blood came out of my nose and mouth with their almost choking me; they cut my purse from me, with a knife - they cut the fob quite away, the lappels of my shirt, and part of my breeches with it; they left me almost insensible on the ground - I did not know whether I was dead or alive; they got 26s. as near as I can tell, within about 6d. - Weatherly was on forward with his horse, and mine followed him; I cried out Philip! twice, but he was laying down asleep in his cart - I could not make him hear, and suspect he was asleep: I overtook him about three-quarters of a mile from where the robbery was committed, which is in Hillingdon parish; I got up in the cart, awoke him, and told him I had been robbed - we both rode home in his cart, and after putting the horses up I went to the cart to take the sacks out, and found a white heaver hat in Weat herly's cart; I do not know how it got there - the prisoner was never in his cart that I know of; I was sober enough to know what happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Are you married? A. Yes, and have two children; I have been married seventeen years - I left home that morning between eight and nine o'clock, with a load and a half of hay; I drank nothing before I started - I got to Uxbridge between ten and eleven; the hill was slippery, and we gave an old man some beer for helping us up - we had a pot among four of us at the Tom and Jerry new beer-shop; we then went into the market, and were there most of the day before we could sell the hay - I had nothing to drink till it was sold; I had no dinner - I went into the Ram, and had two pots of beer among three of us; I had no gin, nor anything to eat - I was paid there for half a load of bay; I then went out to see if Weatherly had sold his hay - I drank nothing till he came; we then went to the Sun, and had a pot of beer there, between himself, me, and Dowling, who was in Weatherly's company; he is married - I drank nothing at Langdon's; I had a glass of gin and a pint, or it might be, a pot of beer - I never pulled out my purse.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure the prisoners are the two people who ill-used you? A. Yes; I have not a doubt of it - Weatherly is not here; he did not see me robbed - I struggled with Weedon, and we hit each each other several times on the ground; I do not think the blood was caused by that - it did not come till I was strangled; I spit blood from my mouth and nose -Dowling gave me a blow on my nose, and made it bleed, but I had washed that off; I had seen her before that day, but was not in her company.</p>

On Sunday night, the 13th of November, I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock - I was the last person up, and fastened the house up myself; I bolted the street door at the top and bottom, and a chain in the middle - I locked the parlour door, hung the key just inside the bar, then bolted the bottom door of the bar; there are two doors to it - I locked the top door; the back door of my house has no fastening, neither lock nor bolt - I got up next morning just after six o'clock; it was dark - I had a candle, it was not light enough to see a person's countenance without a candle in the open air; I found the bottom door of my bar unbolted - I unlocked the top door, went in, and found the till out of its place and empty; it was on a shelf immediately under its proper place - I had left four sixpences and some halfpence in it- they were gone; I missed two bottles off the mantelpiece, then missed my hat, and a pair of shoes, a tablecloth, towel, aprons, two sheets, and a bag, containing pieces of new linen and other things - they were all taken from the bar; I then went out of the bar, and in the passage found a pair of pincers and a pair of woman's shoes - I then went to the parlour door, and found the box of the lock had been forced off, and and old chisel there, which did not belong to me - she must have got over a partition between the parlour and the bar, which does not go up to the top by twenty inches; it is about six feet high from the floor, but there is a seat close to it, on which a person could stand, reach to the top, and get on a cupboard on the other side, and let themselves down; I went to the street door, found it unbolted, and the chain undone, but the door was shut; it has a spring lock - a person opening that could let themselves out and shut it after them - the prisoner had lived as servant to my first floor lodger for about six months, and left about eighteen months ago - I saw her on the Sunday evening, before this, pass along my passage, and go down stairs; the lodger left at the same time as the prisoner, and there was nobody in the house whom she could come to see - I do not know what she came for; I sent a boy to tell her to come up stairs - she came up, and went out; my wife, in my hearing, asked her what business she had there - she laughed, and said she wanted to go down stairs<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010012"/>(meaning to the water-closet) - it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Your back door has no fastening, where does it open to? A.Into a little yard down stairs; a person could not get into that yard without going through my house - there is a chapel behind my house; a person in the yard could not get into the street without getting over a wall, nearly three stories high - I have no kitchen below, only a cellar, which is kept locked - I did not look into the cellar the night before the robbery; I have eight rooms - a person might conceal themselves down stairs in my passage; I, my wife, and three families live in the house - I value the property at about 40s.; I gave the pincers, chisel, and shoes, to Handley - I secured my windows as well as the door, and could find no place where any body could possibly have got in.</p>

On Monday morning, the 14th of November, between four and five o'clock, I was on duty in Long-acre, near James-street, Covent-garden, and saw the prisoner coming from towards Newport-market; I could not know a person at that time without a light - she had a canvas bag on her head, and a hat and tea-kettle in her hand; I stopped her, and asked why she was moving at that early hour is the morning, and where she was coming from, or going to - she said she came from John's-court, Piccadilly, and was going to No.8, Duke-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields; I asked who owned the hat she had in her hand - she said her husband; I then asked what she had got in the bag on her head - she said her husband's shirts and his wearing apparel; I said I knew no John's-court, Piccadilly, I thought all was not right, and should take her to my superior officer for investigation - I took her to the station-house, and on examining the bag, the first thing I found were two bottles of liquor filled up, and a table-cloth partly full of things; I turned the contents of the bag out, and found all the articles which I now produce - she told me the bottles contained cordial belonging to her mistress; I asked who her mistress was - she refused to tell, but said her own name was Mary Elton; she was taken before a Magistrate, and remanded to Clerkenwell prison -I took her there a pair of shoes, which the prosecutor gave me; she said they were not her's - I took off the shoes she had on, and brought them home; I have had them ever since, and the other things also - they have been tied up, sealed, and locked up; I observed to her at the station-house that she had a pair of man's shoes on - she said they belonged to her husband; I have also a chisel, and a pair of pincers, which I got from the prosecutor.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Waugh, a chemist, of Regent-street, about one hundred yards from Mr. Railton's, on the opposite side of the way. On the 4th of November, about seven o'clock, the prisoner came in, and asked for two cathartic pills, which cost 3d.; I served him - he gave me a good half-crown: I gave him two shillings and 3d. - he turned from the counter, then turned again, as I was shutting the drawer the pills were in, and said, "You have given me a bad shilling," throwing one on the counter - I said, "I don't think I gave you that shilling, but I will give you another," and did so - I put the shilling he threw down in the till; there was no other there - Bulpitt came in at the time I was giving him the good shilling, and asked if he had given me a bad shilling- I said, "I think it is;" I rang it, and put a little nitric acid on it, and it turned black - I was satisfied it was not silver; the prisoner said nothing; I detained him while the Policeman was sent for - I kept the shilling in my hand; Mr Waugh came in - I gave the shilling to Burgess, the Policeman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I returned him a shilling, but it was the one he gave me.</p>

            . I am inspector to the Mint. I produce two counterfeit shillings, which I received from Burgess at Marlborough-street, on the 17th of November; one of them appears as if acid had been applied to it - it has left a black mark; there appears to be an indenture on the other - they are both counterfeit, and both cast in the same mould; the reverse side is a crown surmounted by a lion - I produce them; they are both Britannia metal, and dated 1826.</p>

I was returning home on Friday evening. the 4th of November, and went into Mr. Waugh's shop for two autibilious pills; he gave me two shillings -I sounded them on the counter; one sounded lighter than the other; I said, "Is this a good one?" he said, "I don't know; "he took it, and gave me another - I was going out when Bulpitt came in. and said, "Stop;" I said, "What for?" he said, "Has not this man given you a bad shilling?" he said, "I will see:" he went to the till, and said"Yes, what did you return me this bad shilling for?" I said, "Because it was a bad one;" if I uttered the money to Bulpitt I must have had two good shillings and 4d. in my possession.</p>

On Wednesday night last I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock; I was the last person up - I bolied and barred the front door, and my sister or the servant secured the back; the windows are generally kept fastened - we have no occasion to open them in general; they were fastened with a hasp - I know they were fastened that night, for I looked at them; I got up on Thursday morning, about half-past seven o'clock, and found the kitchen window, at the back of the house, open - it appeared they had attempted to take a square out; they broke sufficient of it out to get a hand in, and unfasten the hasp- they could then open the window, and get in; it was open - it was fastened the night before; there were marks all over the kitchen - the table was marked with red;the bricks are generally done over with red ochre - there were red footmarks all over the kitchen, the window of which was opened; we traced the footmarks to a part of the wall, where they got over - six silver tea-spoons were missed out of the kitchen cupboard, which is nine or ten feet from the window; I had not seen them there that night - I saw five of the spoons at tea time: a salt spoon was also missed off the dresser, by the side of the cupboard - I had seen that at dinner time: the spoons belong to my father - I am in partnership with him, but I have no interest in them - he keeps the house, and pays the rent and taxes; I live there</p>
               <p>Q. Are the rent and taxes paid out of his pocket, or out of the business? A.Generally out of the business; my father pays the servants' wages, and the house provisions, and 1 allow 10s. 6d. a week for my board and lodging - I generally pay it every week; we never divide the profits of the trade - I am a tailor by trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Then are you in partnership with your father in the pawnbroking business? A. I have part of the profits- what little money I have in the concern I reap the benefit of, in proportion to the money I put in; when I saw the silver salt-spoon at dinner time it was entire - in consequence of information on Thursday morning I went to Attwell, a silver smith and pawnbroker, at Uxbridge, between nine and ten o'clock, and told him what had occurred; while I was there the prisoner Rogers came in, and sold three of the spoons, which I have in my hand- here is the handle of one spoon, the bowl and handle of the salt-spoon, and one entire spoon; they are my father's - I can only swear to the salt-spoon; we have the fellow, and it has been in the family many years -Rogers received 2s. 11 1/2d. for them. and then left the shop- I borrowed the spoons of Attwell, and took them to my sister; she recognized them.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You closed the front door, and nothing else? A. No; I looked to see that the back doors were fastened - every place was fastened; we are very particular about it - I carry on the business of a tailor in the house; my father and I have settled no account at present - I have been in partnership with him nearly three years; there is a running account between us; the business has been decreasing some time, and I am trying to bring it round - my father pays the servants' wages, but I have nothing to do with them; my father did not sleep in the house that night, only my two sisters, the servant-maid, and myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You pay 10s. 6d. a week, is anything else paid on account of rent? A. No; my father pays the rent out of his own pocket - it is a charge upon him only, and not on the profits.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live at Uxbridge, in the parish of Hillingdon; Davis' house is in the same parish. Last Thursday morning, between nine and ten o'clock, Davis, Jun. came to my shop, and stated this circumstance; while he was there, Rogers came in to sell this spoon and three pieces - I bought them for 2s. 11 1/2d.; he said nothing - I showed them to Davis; he took them away, returned to me immediately with them, and took them away again; he made a statement to me, and I went to look after Rogers - I found him in the market-place; he lives in Uxbridge, and hawks little things about in a basket - I have known him some years; I told him the spoons had been stolen - he expressed much surprise, and told me he had them from the other two prisoners, describing them as Billy, the sweep, and Bagley's brother-in-law; the prisoners were apprehended in consequence of that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have known Rogers some years? A. Yes; I knew where to find him, or I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010016"/>not have bought them - I found him immediately; there was no concealment about it - I have known him three years; I would not have bought them of the other prisoners.</p>

            . I am a bird-stuffer, or animal preserver. Last Thursday, between ten and eleven o'clock, I went to Windsor with Mr. Dorvill, the constable; it is between eight and nine miles from Uxbridge - I saw An' hony and Brown there, who are called Billy, the sweep, and Bagley's brother-in-law; there are three or four mothers, and only one husband in the family - I told them they were the two men I wanted, that they had been into Davis', the pawnbroker's, shop the night before, according to the account given by Rogers, and I did not want to ask them any questions, as the Irishman had split all about the spoons; I did not either threaten or promise them - Billy, the sweep, said they had not been to Uxbridge for a fortnight, and Brown said he was innocent; Billy began to pipe his eye a little - I told him not to fret; I was sent by the high-constable to assist the other constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know them before? A. Yes, well - I used to see them at Uxbridge, but had not seen them for some time; I went after them, from the description Rogers gave - I have known Rogers more than three years; he rents a lodging-house under Mr. Davis - I am certain they said they had not been to Uxbridge for a fortnight.</p>

            . I am a tailor. In October last I lived at No. 40. Great Titchfield-street, Marylebone - I have known Poole about two months, and Gibson about three years; he is <rs id="t18311201-14-deflabel80" type="occupation">clerk</rs>

About a week before the 27th of October Poole and I were at the Crown and Angel public-house: Poole told me he was in want of money - I said I had none to lend him; he said, "I don't mean any thing of that sort; if you can keep your own counsel, we can get money otherwise," and that he knew where to get some silver if I knew where to sell it; he said he could get the silver at Mr. Young's, No. 2, Upper Portland-place; I said I did not know where to make away with the silver, but I dare say Gibson knew - Gibson was not present; that was all that occurred at that time - Gibson and I went to the Crown and Angel on the Thursday night following; Poole came in there, and when we were going home, after we left the public-house, we were all three talking - Poole asked Gibson if he knew where to sell silver; Gibson said Yes, and it passed over till the next Thursday night - we all three met again on the Tuesday at the Angel and Crown, about ten o'clock, not by agreement - it was the Tuesday before the robbery; we then agreed that Poole should go on Wednesday and take a model of the key of Mr. Young's area door - he got a model on the Wednesday; he told us he had got it - he did not show it to us; Poole came to my lodgings on the Thursday night - Gibson was there at the time; we all three went together from Titchfield-street, as far as Portland-road - Poole went on to Mr. Young's; Gibson and I followed close behind him - we kept our eyes on him, and saw him go down Mr. Young's area; I went opposite the area gate, on the same side - Gibson and I walked up and down by the area gate; Poole remained down there about ten minutes; I saw him trying to open the area door, which leads into the house - he came up the area steps, and told us he had broken one of the keys in attempting to open the door; he had got three keys, something like the model; he came up the steps - we went as far as Weymonth-street, and agreed that he should directly go back to Mr. Young's to supper- we agreed to meet at the Crown and Angel, Eden-court, Eden-street, Regent-street, that night, about twelve o'clock - he left us, came to us there at twelve, and we all three went from there to the Black Bull, Great Windmill-street, Haymarket; we had no conversation there with him - there were two females with us; I told him to leave them as soon as possible, which he did, and after leaving the Black Bull we agreed that Poole should go to Mr. Young's the next night, to supper, to come out of the kitchen when the footman went to draw the beer for supper, and slip into the water-closet; to let the footman go and draw the beer, and wait there till he returned past the water-closet door, which is in the passage - he said he would then come out of the water-closet, open the area and pautry doors, go back into the kitchen, and shut the water-closet door, as if he had then come out of there - he said nothing more; we met at nine o'clock on Friday night, at Gibson's lodging, No. 1, Upper Charlton-street (Poole lodged at a milk-shop in Charlton-street) - it is about a minute's walk from Portland-place; Gibson came to my lodging at eight o'clock- we went from there to his house; Poole came to us there, and we all went together, about ten minutes after nine, to Portland-road - we walked all three in a row, till we got into Portland-road, and then Poole went before us- I saw him go down Mr. Young's area; I and Gibson were walking up and down - I did not see the footman; I saw a light - Poole went down, rang the bell, and went into the area door below, which leads into the house - I did not observe whether any body let him in; we walked up and down about twenty minutes, till we saw the footman come out into the area to draw the beer, and go back with it in his hand - I went down the area steps very shortly after that.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any signal to go down? A. No; Poole had been out before the footman drew the beer, and put us into the coal-cellar under the street, and told us to wait there till the footman had drawn the beer, but we came out as soon as Poole turned his back, and went into the street- after the footman had drawn the beer, I went down, and saw the area house door was open - Gibson followed me down, and he (Gibson) went into the house, and brought out a box; I remained in the area - Gibson was not gone a minute; he brought the box up to the top of the steps, with a pair of trousers on his arm - I helped him carry the box from the area gate to my lodging, at Mrs. Lacy's, No. 20, Titchfield-street; we got there about ten o'clock - I let myself in, and took the box up to the back garret, where I and Lacy's son used to sleep together; Gibson helped me carry the box into the garret - Mrs. Lacy lighted us up stairs from the second floor to the garret, and she went into the room; Gibson opened the box with a bodkin- it contained forks, spoons, a ladle, plated asparagus-tongs and silver articles - it was about a foot and a half long and a foot wide; we took the plate out of the box and put it into a handkerchief - I left the box in the middle of the room; Mrs. Lacy was in the room all this time: Mr. Lacy said he would not have it in his house - Mr. and Mrs. 
               <persName id="t18311201-14-person245">Lacy</persName>
             both came into the room, and Mr. Lacy said he did not like it to stop in his house; Gibson and I said we would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010018"/>take it to Gibson's lodging, and Mrs. Lacy said she would take it under her shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to say that? A.Because some of the forks were sticking out of the handkerchief, and I believe I asked her to take it; the bundle contained all the property except two knife-rests and a claret lable, which was left at Mrs. Lacy's - she consented to carry it; I and Mrs. Lacy went to Gibson's with it, leaving Gibson behind - we took it to No. 1, Upper Charlton-street, Fitzroy-square, and left it in the front garret there; Mrs. Lacy went up stairs with me - she threw the plate on the bed; we had met Poole as we were on our way there - he and I walked on before Mrs. Lacy to Gibson's lodging, and we left Poole there with the plate; I and Mrs. Lacy returned to her house - I was to take Gibson back to his lodging, where Poole was; we had a 1s. worth of gin between me, Mr. and Mrs. Lacy, and Gibson - I and Gibson then returned to his lodging to Poole: when I first met Poole in the street, he told us that the butler had missed the plate. and the servants had all consented to go and tell Mr. Young, and the butler told Poole he had better go, for Mr. Young would suspect he was having supper: we all went from Gibson's lodging to the Ball's Head, Dean-street, Soho, (this was about half-past ten or eleven o'clock) and expected to meet a man named Hall there to hear some singing - I knew him by his conducting concert-rooms; he know nothing of the plate at that time - we met there; the singing took place - Gibson then asked Hall if he knew a place where he could sell some plate; he said Yes, (it had been left at Gibson's) - I and Gibson agreed to meet Hall at ten o'clock next morning (Saturday) at the Three Tons, Smithfield; we met - I and Gibson carried the plate between us in two handkerchiefs; we met Hall there - we did not open the bundle there, but went from there to a public-house in Liverpool-street, where we had a pint of beer; Hall went out to fetch a blue bag to put the plate in - he had not seen the plate at this time; he returned with the bag, and put the two bundles into the bag himself, without untying them - I walked with them as far as the corner of Liverpool-street; Gibson and Hall left me, as Hall said it would not do for three to go to sell the plate, for the man would not buy it if so many went; they returned to the corner of Liverpool-street and Bishopsgate-street in about twenty-five minutes - I was waiting there for them; Gibson put both his hands up twice, and said, when he came up to me, that he got 20l. for the plate - I asked if he had given Hall any thing for showing him where to sell it - Hall was present; I told Gibson to ask Hall if a guinea would satisfy him - Hall said Yes; we had some oysters in Long-lane, and went from there to the Three Tuns, Smithfield - Hall was with us; Gibson there gave me 6l., and kept 1l. himself, which I was to spend - he took 6l. for himself, and 1l. he was going to spend; he reserved 5l. for Poole - Gibson gave some money for beefsteaks, which we had at the Three Tuns; we went to Field-lane - Hall bought a great-coat, Gibson bought a greatcoat, I bought a pair of shoes, and the others bought a pair- I forgot to state that at the office; I went to Mr. Lacy's, left a bundle I had there, and was taken into custody at my father's house, about half-past four o'clock that Saturday afternoon - the Policeman took four sovereigns from me, which was part of the money I had received as my share; I afterwards stated the part I took in this affair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Notwithstanding that you were taken a prisoner to the Police-office? A. Yes; there were four examinations - I was examined on the Saturday, at the first examinations, but not as a witness; I was a prisoner all that time; I was in the office as a prisoner during the examinations, but not at the bar - I was not sworn and examined as a witness at the office, only at Hicks'-hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Then before you were examined at Hicks'-hall had you not an opportunity of hearing the distinct account given in evidence by the witnesses? A. Yes, I knew what they had sworn; I heard the different depositions read at the office - I was never taken up for any thing in my life; I live by my trade as a tailor - I was in full business at that time, working with Lacy; I was not in want- I joined in the robbery of my own free will; I did not care who I robbed, but I never robbed any body before -I knew who it was proposed to rob; I had no animosity towards the prosecutor - I know I did enough to be placed at the bar myself.</p>
               <p>Q. It is to avoid standing there that you give evidence? A. Yes, because Gibson said if I did not give evidence he would; I never went by any other name - I can only write a little - I can read; I have written a letter home since I have been in prison - I have written nothing else in prison that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Remember you are on your oath? A. Yes - I wrote a paper this morning, and wrote your name on the top of it; what I wrote was a falsehood - I did not do it deliberately; I did it to save myself from getting ill used by Poole and the prisoners in the prison - that was my only reason; I did not write what is at the bottom of the paper in pencil - I wrote what is in ink; I wrote it in the chapelyard - there might be seven or nine persons there; I cannot swear there were not twenty - I know the officers of the prison were there, but did not know I could complain to them; I did not suppose they would trouble about it: I wrote the paper to satisfy Poole till he was gone; nobody was near us at the desk - they were in the same room by the fire; Poole was going to write it himself, but he said, "Will you write this, for my hand shakes;" he did not threaten me, but I was afraid - I had not been threatened by any body.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you there with persons you were going to give evidence against? A.After giving evidence at Hicks'-hall, I asked leave to be in a different yard to where I was before, and the turnkey put me in the chapel-yard; I was committed as a thief; I gave evidence at the office, but was not sworn.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If Poole did not threaten you, what was there to frighten you? A. Nothing, only when I first came into the yard, I went up stairs to Poole's apartment, and the rest of the prisoners said, "Poole, here is a friend of yours" - Poole said, "No friend of mine, I am afraid;" he had not threatened me with any violence.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet, being afraid some mischief would be done, you wrote this "Sir, Poole knows nothing about the box, only by sleeping with me, as that is the chief thing against him;" you wrote that, and sent it to me, knowing I was Poole's counsel? A. Yes - it was not to mislead you; Poole said his hand shook, and asked me to write it for him - he put the words into my mouth, and I wrote it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know it to be a falsehood? A. No,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010019"/>Sir; he told me you had taken the capital off - I wrote his own words, in his name, not as coming from me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is his name put to it? A. No; Poole asked me to put my name to it; I said I would not, as Mr. Phillips would think it came from me.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not intend me to think it came from you? A. No, I did not think you would have it at all; Poole did not tell me be would send it to you - he intended to send it, but I thought he would not have occasion; I do not know why I thought so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. How old are you? A.Sixteen; my father is a tailor; I did not live with him, because he has not sufficient work to keep me - that was my only reason; we are on good terms at present, and were so then, but are not always so - he charged me with pledging a coat of his about ten months ago; I was not taken before a Magistrate; I gave my father the money it was pawned for - I have only been charged once with robbing him; nobody charged me with selling a plane - I was never charged with stealing pocket-handkerchiefs in the street; I have not been apprenticed - I learned my trade with my father, and have worked with several people; Gibson was not present when the robbery was first walked of, and he stopped at Lacy's while the plate was taken to his lodging - he has not lived there above a month, for he came out of the House of Correction, having been there for three months.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. You wrote the paper under Poole's direction? A. Yes, and gave it to Poole - I did not send it to Mr. Phillips.</p>

            . I am butler to Mr. Young; Poole was in his service, as footman, for seven or eight months, and left on the 1st of April, or about that time - he has occasionally called to see us since, about once in a month or six weeks. On Friday evening, the 28th of October, he came to the house about five minutes to nine o'clock; he was there on the Thursday, but to the best of my recollection I did not see him, but I gathered from his conversation on the Friday that he had been on Thursday, and I was in my pantry on the Thursday night, when he went away - he bade me good night as he went out, but I did not see him; when he came on Friday night, James, the footman, went to the door; he asked if he had not left an umbrella there the night before - he was told he had not; he then came in: I went out that evening while he was in the house, and at that time master's plate-chest, with the plate in it, was in my pantry, in a recess on the dresser, which is the place it was usually kept in while Poole was in the service - I was gone about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes the outside - when I came back Poole was there; as I came in I found the area gate open, the area door and my pantry door were also open - I had left the footman and Poole in my pantry when I went out, and told them I should not be gone more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I left them there, washing up the tea things - when I came back I went into my pantry; I thought something must be amiss, as my fellow-servant had left the pantry, and nobody was there - I missed the plate-box, which contained the articles stated in the indictment,(enumerating them) - the asparagus-tongs and knife-rests were plated; all the rest of the articles were silver, and worth more than 50l.; I have seen none of the plate again- I saw the box at Marylebone office - (looking at it) this is it; I know it well - I saw nothing of Gibson or Lewis.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. After missing the plate-chest did you go into the kitchen? A. No, I came out, and met my fellow-servant in the passage, and then all the other servants came; Poole came out of the kitchen with them, on my giving the alarm - I do not know whether he afterwards went into the kitchen, for I did not go in; I went out to look for a Policeman - he staid in the house a few minutes; I could not see a Policeman, and returned - I said, "I cannot see one, and will go and tell Mr. Young;" Poole was there then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the door fasten in any particular way? A. My pantry door fastens with a spring lock; nobody who was a stranger could open it; Poole merely walked in there with the footman when he was going to wash the tea things.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Young's service in October, as footman. and had lived there eight months. I knew Poole by his coming to the house; I saw him at the house on the Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday - I saw him about five minutes to six o'clock on the Wednesday night- he came into my pantry that night, but he went into the butler's pantry, and had a glass of beer; I saw nothing more of him that night. On the Thursday night, about half-past nine o'clock, as I sat at supper, I heard a key put into the area door, as if it was my fellow-servant coming; the door was fast - I went to the kitchen staircase, and seeing the door was shut I took no further notice, as nobody was there; I saw Poole walk by as I went to the area door, after I heard the noise - he passed by the area gate, on the pavement; he said to me as I was out at the area door, "James, what are you looking for?" I said I thought I heard somebody put a key into the door, as if Mallett had come in and gone out again - he came down the steps into my pantry, and stopped about half an hour - three of my fellow-servants were there; I let him out at the area gate, and he took leave of the butler as she went along the passage.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Poole on the Friday night? A. Yes, at a few minutes before nine o'clock - I first saw him at the area door, down the steps; I said, "Why, Arthur, it is like an appointment, for Sarah is here," (who was an old fellow-servant of his) - he went up to her, and shook hands with her; she had come to return an umbrella which she had borrowed - Poole came back to me, and said,"James, did not I leave an umbrella here last night?" I said No, I had not seen one; I was in the butler's pantry - the butler said, "Arthur, you might as well walk a little way with Sarah;" he said, "I am otherwise engaged;" the butler said, "If you won't, I will;" he went, and said he should he home by nine o'clock; I said, "No you will not, for it is nine now;" he said he should be back in about a quarter of an hour; the butler's pantry was open at this time - he left me and Poole in the pantry; he returned in about twenty minutes - I put out the lamp in the pantry before the butler returned; I know the plate-chest was safe there at nine o'clock - it was safe when I put out the lamp and left the pantry the last time; it was in its place - Poole and I then went into my pantry; I waited there about five minutes till the porter boy came - I let the porter boy in; he delivered the porter in the kitchen - I saw him go out: he could not have taken the box out - I then went and 
               <persName id="t18311201-14-person248">drew</persName>
             the beer, leaving Poole in my pantry; after drawing the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010020"/>beer I shut the area door, returned to Poole in my pantry, and asked if he would take supper; he said, "Thank you"- we came out of my pantry - I saw that the area door was fast; I shut the butler's pantry door and the hall door - we went along the passage, and Poole made a stop to go to the water-closet, which is within the house; I went into the kitchen, leaving him to go to the water-closet, which is about ten yards from the kitchen - he was absent two or three minutes, then returned to the kitchen, and took supper; I had heard a noise at the water-closet door, as if Poole was coming out - that was before supper; he took his seat at the table; the butler came in in about ten minutes, and said, "Jem, the small plate-chest is gone; you must have left the door open;" there was a general alarm, and Poole came out with the other servants.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the area door lock like a common stable lock, opened by pressure? A. No, the butler's pantry opens by the pressure of the finger - I had pulled that door too when I came out with the prisoner; I am positive it was shut - I did not fasten it till I returned from drawing the beer: I had not clasped it - I shut it too before I went to supper; I never saw such a lock before - it does not open so easy as a stable lock; it opens by the pressure of the thumb over the handle - the spring is sunk in; any body looking at it could see that; I saw the beer boy going up the area steps; I was not in the pantry after he went out - Poole was absent a minute or two; the handle of the water-closet makes a noise, and there is a handle to the butler's pantry door - I am sure it was the handle of the water-closet I heard; Poole remained some time in the house - he made no attempt to go away: I do not believe he would have gone unless the maid-servants had told him to go; he staid about half an hour after I had invited him to supper, and about five minutes after the alarm; he said, in the butler's pantry, when the alarm was given, that he was a witness that I had shut the area door, which was the truth.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You heard the water-closet door shut? A. I heard a noise, as if it was shut - Poole staid two or three minutes after I heard that door shut before he made his appearance in the kitchen; the lock of the pantry door projects in - the spring dents into the wood; after the lamp in the pantry was put out it would be darkness; there was a lamp in the passage.</p>

            , at a coffee-house, No.20 or 21, Great Titchfield-street, kept by Mr. Lacy - I asked how he came at my house that night; he said he called about nine o'clock, and asked James, the servant, for an umbrella, which he supposed he had left there; that he went into the butler's pantry, who was talking to Sarah Fulbrook, who had left my service about two months or six weeks, that he could not hear distinctly what the butler said to Sarah, but he asked him to go home with her, and as soon as the butler left the house he went into the footman's pantry with the footman, but did not remain there above five minutes, and was not alone from the time he came into the house till he left; but on recollection he said, "I now remember I was alone while James went to draw the beer, but I was not alone at any other time;" that after he had finished his supper he heard the butler return - that he heard high words in the passage, went out with the other servants, saw the butler go to where the chest usually stood, and point out to the servants that it was gone - he was told by the butler that he had better go out of the house before I came down; that he accordingly went for a Policeman with James, the footman; that he went as far as the New-road, and subsequently returned up Portland-place, as far as Weymouth-street, and met Lewis in Weymouth-street, by Portland-road - Lewis asked him to go to the Bull's Head in Dean-street, and he borrowed 6d. of his landlady, who he had seen standing at the door of his lodging, in Charlton-street - they had three pints of beer at the Bull's Head, and as he did not like to return to his lodging that night he went and slept with Lewis, in Titchfield-street, as he did not wish to disturb the people at his lodging, as he had remained so late at the Bull's Head - that it was seven o'clock in the morning when he left Titchfield-street, and went to Mr. Withers', in Dean's-court, Soho, a shoemaker, who he was in the habit of working with - he there heard the officers had been making inquiry for him, in consequence of which he returned immediately to his lodging, in Charlton-street, gave himself up to the Police, and was brought to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen some knife-rests and a claret-lable? A. Yes, these are them (looking at them) - I can swear positively to the lable, as it corresponds in pattern with mine, and the knife-rests correspond in pattern, but have no particular mark - in consequence of information I went with the officers (Thompson, Harrison, and Clark) to Benjamin's house, in Cutler-street, Houndsditch - we took the prisoner Gibson with us; Gibson and Harrison entered the house a very short time before I did - the house was searched, and Benjamin taken into custody - nothing of mine was found; the officers said they were in search of some plate, which was stolen from Portland-place - he said he knew nothing of it, and that he would know nothing of it; I am not aware that any further questions were asked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You took down, from Poole's lips, what he said? A. I took the substance of it; what he said was voluntary - he had lived with me seven or eight months; I received an excellent character with him, and was prepared to give him one also.</p>

            . I am the wife of John Lacy, a tailor, at No.20, Great Titchfield-street; there is a coffee-shop there - Lewis worked with my husband - I have known Gibson about seven weeks. On a Friday night, in October, between nine and ten o'clock, Gibson and Lewis came to my house; I and my husband were looking out of win<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010021"/>dow at the time - they had a small box, carrying it between them; I believe this to be the box - they went up stairs with it, into the front garret, where Lewis lodged and slept - Lewis came down, asked me for a light, and I went up to the room; I think Lewis carried the light up- I saw the box opened in the room; it appeared to be all of plate - my husband was in the room, and as soon he saw it open he thought it had not come into the house the right way - he said he thought the property did not belong to them, and both of us were in a great fright about it - my husband requested them to take it out of the house directly, and so did I - my husband then went down stairs, and said he would see nothing of it; Gibson took a handkerchief from his pocket, I believe - I know was his; he laid it on the floor, and they emptied the box, at the plate into the handkerchief, tied up the four corners of it, and several articles projected out - Lewis took he bundle off the floor, put it on his arms, and said, I can never carry it through the street like this, without its being seen;" he said, "Mrs. Lacy, will you carry I round to Gibson's lodging for us?" he did not say how, and without any thought or consideration of the danger I as exposing myself to, I said I would - Lewis walked before me, as I did not know my way; Gibson remained at our house - as we went up  Titchfield-street Lewis met a young man, who I believe to be Poole, but when I saw him at the office I should not have known him but for his dress - they walked on some distance before me; I went to a house, which I heard was in Charlson-street, but I do not know - it seemed a good distance from my house; they went up stairs before me to a garret, and I went up; Mrs. Gibson was the only person there before we went - Lewis and Poole. I believe, went up before me (the woman I had seen there the night before, called herself Mrs. Gibson, and she called on me the next day) - as soon as I went into the room I said nothing, but threw the bundle out on the bed, with the plate in it, just as it was - two knife-rests and a claretable were left at my house; I believe those produced to be the same - Lewis went home with me; I know a stranger slept with him that night, but I did not see the person - a person, named Withers, called on me; he was quite a stranger to me - the knife-rests and label were found at my house, but I was not at home then - I was in the yard of the Police-office on the Saturday after, and gave Thompson, the Policeman, information of the matter voluntarily - it was about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you were terribly frightened that night, when you took the things away? A. Yes - nobody but my husband desired me to give information; he was taken up in consequence of the information, and so was I - we were kept in the watch-house from Saturday night till Monday; from the state of mind I was in I should be sorry to swear to a person, unless I had seen him before, and do not positively swear to Poole - I think it was him; he wore remarkable sort of clothes - I had not much view of his face, for I hurried out of Gibson's as fast as I could; he wore a brown coat with brass buttons, and a pair of grey trousers - I knew him by his clothes; I was not sure of his face - I think I went up to the attic (from the appearance of the room), but will not swear it was not the second floor - I was very frightened or I should not have carried it through the street, for the dearest friend I had - I did it from fright and want of thought.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Your husband stood at the bar just now? A. Yes - I do not know of any arrangement that no evidence should be offered against him; I do not know the meaning of it - I heard last night that he was going to have an acquittal.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw a great deal of plate brought into your house, did you ever see so much before? A.

On Saturday evening, after Gibson heard Lewis' confession at the office, he told me Lewis had not spoken the truth - he said there was a pair of knife-rests which he had not named, and a claret-label left behind at Mrs. Lacy's, which Lewis had not mentioned; we then went to Lacy's, and found the rests and lable - Mr. Lacy told his little girl to get them, and they were produced; I and Thompson went to Eden-street - Hall came in with another man; and they had handkerchiefs on which Lewis had described.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q.At what time did you apprehended Gibson? A. About eight o'clock in the evening: he came into the tap-room while I was there - he said Lewis had not spoken all the truth.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found the mutton in several pieces? A. Yes; the prisoners live very near the prosecutor - I heard of the sheep being stolen on the Friday; it was generally known that inquiry was making about it: William occupies the house - he seemed much flurried; the mutton was in a safe in the first floor room - it is common for poor people to have a hatchet; William was very drunk when he made resistance - he did not tell me he had bought the meat at Brentford; the field the sheep was slaughtered in was closed on one side by a wooden fence and a bedge on the other side; I examined the marks on Tuesday, before twelve o'clock - it is a grass field, but the marks were close to the bedge, where there is no grass; I swear one shoe has not had a tip on it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I heard of Minton losing his sheep on the Friday afternoon, and on the Saturday morning I was at Queen-square; before I went away I advised my brother officer to get a search-warrant, as I suspected the prisoner; I returned at night from Queen-square, and went to assist in taking the elder prisoner at his own house - he was very drunk, and made a great deal of resistance, called for his spade, and said he would split our heads in pieces; the mutton was taken to the station-house before I got there - Minton saw it at the station on Monday, and claimed it; I never saw any cut by a butcher in that way: I was present on Monday when George was secured, on the road to Brentford - we had been looking for him from the Saturday, but could not find him; he had a bundle, which he threw away - a girl with him took it up, and went away with it; I heard William say he had bought the mutton, and would clear his robins, by which I understood his children: I went to the field, saw the shoes fitted to the marks on the Tuesday morning, and some corresponded with George's shoe - in my judgment that shoe made the impressions.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You examined them six days after the sheep was slaughtered? A. It was Tuesday morning; I did not search their house; the father was in custody at the time I took the son, and the meat was in possession of the officer; a reward of twenty guineas had been offered for the apprehension of the thieves - I did not see the bills till the Friday; they were at the station-house: I did not see any posted; the shoes were given to the prisoner again.</p>
               <p>MR. MINTON. I saw the tip of the shoe compared, and think the footmarks could not have been made so long as the sheep had been slaughtered.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Turnhamgreen, three or four hundred yards from Williams', and have known him two or three years. I was going to Brentford last Tuesday fortnight, about half-past two or three o'clock, and met old Williams against the Star and Garter, at Kew-bridge, walking towards Minton's premises, and in his road home - he said he had been to Brentford, and had some mutton in his blue apron; I saw several parts of it, part of a neck, and a piece of a loin - there might be 20lbs. or 24lbs. altogether: be bore an honest character - Tuesday is market day at Brentford.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure this was last Tuesday fortnight? A. Yes, the Tuesday before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoners a good character.</p>

            . I am porter at the dissecting-room at King's-college, Somerset-house. On Saturday, the 5th of November, about a quarter to twelve o'clock, the bell of the dissecting-room rang; I answered it, and found Bishop and May at the door - I knew them before: May asked if I wanted any thing - I said not particularly, and asked what he had got; he said a male subject: I asked him what size - he said it was a boy about fourteen years of age; I asked the price: he said twelve guineas - I said I could not think of giving that price for it; we did not care much about it, for we did not particularly want it, but if he would wait I would see Mr. Partridge, who is the demonstrator of anatomy; I left them, and told Mr. Partridge - he said he would see them; I went and told them to go round to the place appropriated for them, and when in that room Mr. Partridge joined them; they did not produce the body - there was a difference about the price at first; Mr. Partridge did not agree with them - he was talking with May in the room; May said he should have it for ten guineas - he went into the dissecting-room, leaving me with them; they asked me how it was to be, if we were going to have it - I went to Mr. Partridge, returned, and told them he offered nine guineas; May said he would be d - d if it should come in for less than ten guineas: he was tipsy at the time - May stood outside the door, for a necessary purpose; Bishop called me aside, and said, "He is drunk, it shall come in for nine guineas within half an hour" - whether May heard this I cannot say, but I think he must; they then left; May and Bishop returned the same afternoon, about a quarter-past two o'clock, in company with Williams and a person named Shields; they had a hamper - they came to the room appropriated for them; I was called - I went to the door, unlocked it, and to the best of my recollection the hamper was off the head of Shields, the porter; (I knew him as such) - all four persons stood round the hamper: it was on the ground; they all four came in - I told two of them to remain there: I could not let them through the body of the college - May and Bishop carried the hamper through into the other room, they opened it between from, and in it was a sack, containing the body in question; May turned it out of the sack very carelessly, as he was tipsy; I looked at it, and both May and Bishop observed that we could not have a fresher, or that it was a very good, one - I said Yes, it was certainly fresh; I observed that it was particularly fresh, and made some remarks upon it to myself. in consequence of which I went to Mr. Partridge; I asked the prisoners what the body had died with: they said they did not know, it was no business of mine or theirs - I cannot say which said so; it was said in the hearing of both.</p>
               <p>Q. When the body was produced from the sack was it in such a form as it would he if it came from a coffin? A. No, the left arm was turned up stiff, and the fingers clinched - I went to Mr. Partridge, and detailed to him what I had seen, and what I thought; he returned with me to the room where the body was, but before that I had taken the prisoners into another room where there was a fire, and told them to wait there - after Mr. Partridge saw the body he went to the secretary - the prisoners remained by the fire; some of the students saw the body, and their suspicions were created - Mr. Partridge returned to the prisoners, showed them a 50l. note, and said he must get that changed and he would pay them; he had some gold in his purse, and Bishop said, "Give us what money you have got, and I will call on Monday for the remainder;" May said if the note was given to him he would get it changed - Mr. Partridge smiled and said, "Oh no!" and left them without giving them any money - they remained there; Partridge returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - he did not see them; Mr. Mayow came in with the Police, and they were all taken into custody - before that, as I left the room the body was in, Bishop said that when I paid them I was to give him only eight guineas, in the presence of Williams, and to give him the other guinea, and he would give me half a crown; I delivered the body to Rogers, also the hamper and sack - I accompanied them, and delivered the same body, hamper, and sack to Mr. Thomas, the superintendent; I know the body had not been laid out in a coffin, for there was no saw-dust about the head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. The conversation you have detailed was with May and Bishop only? A. No, Williams was in the college, but not in the same room - he was present when the 50l. note was offered.</p>

            . I am demonstrator of anatomy at the King's-college. On Saturday, the 5th of November, about two o'clock, Hill made a communication to me, in consequence of which I went and looked at the body - the prisoners were not present, but Hill was: the external appearances were suspicious, which induced me to go to the Police - I observed the swollen state of the face, the blood-shot eyes, the freshness of the body, the rigidity of the limbs, and a cut over the left temple; the lips were swollen - no other circumstance attracted my attention; I did not observe the tongue particularly - I do not recollect whether I saw the prisoners before I went to the Police; I returned to the college, and showed May and Bishop a 50l. note - I found them near the stairs leading to the anatomical department; I proposed that change should be got for the note, with a view to detain them till the Police arrived - I more particularly observed the body on the fol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010025"/>lowing day, Sunday, at the Police-station, Covent-garden, where it was in the possession of Mr. Thomas, the superintendent; Mr. Beaman and several medical gentlemen were with me - the external appearances were, the muscles were still flat, and rigid, though not so much so as the day before; there was a wound on the temple, which did not injure the bone - that was the only appearance of external injury; on the scull, beneath the scalp or bone there was some blood effused; on opening the body the whole contents of the abdomen and chest were found to be in a healthy condition - the stomach was full; before the chest and abdomen were examined, the scull was taken off, and the brain examined - that was perfectly healthy, as well as the spinal part; in cutting down to remove the bone which conceals the spinal part at the back of the neck, we found a quantity of coagulated blood within the muscles, and on removing the back part of the body canal, some coagulated blood was found laying in the cavity opposite the blood found in the muscles of the neck - there was blood uncoagulated within the rest of the spinal canal; the spinal marrow appeared perfectly healthy - these are all the remarkable appearances; I think these internal marks of violence were sufficient to produce death - I believe violence had been exerted to have the effect on the spinal cord.</p>
               <p>Q. Must those appearances have been produced by some cause inflicted on the back of the neck? A. I believe so; I think a blow from a stick on the back of the neck would have caused those appearances, and think it would produce a rapid death, but perhaps not an instantaneous one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Upon the external examination you saw nothing to lead you to judge that he had come by a violent death? A.Nothing but suspicion - the blow over the temple did not cause death; I think the coagulation of blood at the back of the neck and the spinal marrow might produce it - I do not say positively that it did, it is my belief.</p>
               <p>Q.Might not this have been caused by other means as well as by a blow - by pressure otherwise applied? A. I think not - I cannot conceive any thing but a blow would produce those appearances; if he had fallen it would have been a blow - it might have been done otherwise than by a blow with a stick; I do not think it could have been done by a strong pressure of the knee on the neck.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you observe any other circumstance whatever which could cause death? A. The heart was empty and the countenance flushed, now death has occurred, and only those appearances found afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you infer from the heart being empty? A. I do not infer any thing from it, except that that accompained with blood-shot eyes, has been found in persons who have died suddenly, and evidently from no violence, but what is called a natural death - I am not aware that the appearances on the spinal cord would be found in persons dying a natural death; they could only be caused by violence, as far as I could judge.</p>

            . I live in James-street, Covent-garden, and have been a surgeon nine years - I am employed professionally by the parish of St. Paul, Covent-garden. I first saw this body on Saturday night, the 5th of November, about twelve o'clock - it appeared to have died very recently; the weather was very favourable for its preservation - I should say it had not been dead more than thirty-six hours; the face appeared swollen, the eyes full, prominent, and blood-shot, the tongue swollen and protruding between the lips - the teeth had been extracted; the gums were bruised and lacerated, portions of the jaw broken out with the teeth, and at that time there was appearance of blood having issued from the gums - I should think the teeth had been taken from the gums at most within two or three hours after death; I examined the throat, neck, and chest very particularly - no marks of violence were apparent; I made no further observation at that time - I observed a wound over the left eye-brow, about three quarters of an inch long, through the skin to the bone- I pressed that part to ascertain if there was a fracture, and a small quantity of blood oozed from the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Could that blood have oozed from the wound if it had been made after death, by carelessly tumbling it out of the sack? A. I think it might; it was a red coloured bloody serum, not coagulated - I saw the body again about two o'clock on Sunday afternoon, but made no further examination then; the limbs were stiff - they were very stiff on the Saturday night, but not so stiff on the Sunday; I think the body had never been laid out - it was placed in an irregular position, on a board, near the station-house, in the church-yard; it was not opened when I saw it on Sunday, but soon after eight o'clock that evening I further examined it, assisted by Mr. Partridge and other gentlemen - I first, with a sponge and water, cleaused the neck and throat very particularly, but found no scratch nor any mark of violence; I then removed the skin covering the scull, and on the top of the scull we detected a patch of blood about the size of a crown - this appearance must have been produced by a blow given during life; the brain was next examined, and its appearances were perfectly healthy, as described by Mr. Partridge - the body was then turned, for the purpose of examining the spinal marrow, and on removing the skin at the back part of the neck, I should think from three to four ounces of coagulated blood were found among the muscles; that blood must have been effused while the subject was alive - on removing a portion of the spine to examine the spinal marrow a quantity of coagulated blood was laying in the canal, which, by pressure on the spinal marrow, must cause death - there was no injury to the bone of the spine, nor any displacement; all these appearances would follow from a blow with a staff, stick, or heavy instrument - the chest and the cavity of the belly were minutely examined; there was no disease - I should think there was about an ounce of blood in the spinal marrow; the intestines were perfectly healthy - the heart was empty, which is a very unusual circumstance, and denotes sudden death, by which I mean nearly instantaneous, perhaps in two or three minutes, not longer; the stomach contained a tolerably full meal, which smelt slightly of rum - digestion was going on at the time of death, and from the appearance I should think death had occurred about three hours after the meal; I removed the stomach for the purpose of having its contents analysed - the coats of the stomach appeared perfectly healthy; I ascribe the death to a blow on the back of the neck - that observation is verified by experiments I have made on animals, and in every case there was precisely the same appearances.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010026"/>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you use the sponge on the neck and throat to ascertain the extent of any external injury? A. I did it to cleanse the skin perfectly, to detect a scratch if it had been there - the body was not dirty; I found no external mark of injury on the back of the neck - if he had received a blow, and lived some time after, external marks would not necessarily he produced; it would be probable if he had lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you agree with Mr. Partridge, that only the heart being empty and the flushed state of the countenance, such appearances might present themselves where death had not happened from injury? A. I think it might - I never found the heart empty before; I consider that more a proof of death being rather sudden: I think no blow on the top of the head would produce the appearance on the neck which I have described; any injury on the back of the neck, accidental or not, might produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person in a fit of apoplexy fell into the arms of a person or on a hard substance, might these appearances present themselves? A. I should hardly think it possible - I will not say it could not have happened if he had fallen with his neck on any projecting body; I will not swear how long after death the teeth were extracted.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long after death should you suppose they had been removed? A. I should think within two or three hours; I never knew death from apoplexy to leave the brain perfectly healthy, but I believe such cases have occurred in serous apoplexy - there was no serum in this boy's brain, nor the smallest symptom of apolexy; he was about fourteen years old, in very good health, not predisposed for apoplexy: I have opened many bodies which died of apoplexy, and always found marks to account for it, but I have read of some cases where there were no marks; if he received a blow on the neck, and died within a minute or two, there would be no external mark.</p>

            , ESQ. I am one of the surgeon's of St. Thomas' hospital. I have heard Mr. Beaman's evidence, and took notice of it - I agree with the conclusion he has come to in all material points; I never knew an instance of serous apoplexy in which the brain has not denoted some appearance of that kind; I have examined many - there has always been a certain quantity of fluid found sufficient to denote the death from that cause; the fluid acts by pressure on the brain generally. I hold some public appointments, and have lectured on anatomy for some time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have heard the appearances described on the post mortem examination of the spinal canal, and the extravasted blood found there - in your judgment could those appearances have been produced but by violence? A.Certainly not, only by violence; it is not necessary that there should be any bruise, even if the patient survives many days - it is not necessary that there should be a blue or bruised state of the skin.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the Police division F. On the 5th of November I received information - I sent Rogers, Wilson, and others to King's-college; they afterwards returned with May and Williams in custody - I sent Rogers more particularly for the body - I think Bishop and Shields were the first persons brought to me, and then May and William; Rogers afterwards came with Hill, bringing the body, sack, and hamper - when the prisoners were all at the station, and the body and hamper in the back room, I told May he was charged on suspicion of having improper possession of a subject - he said, in the presence of the others, that he had nothing at all to do with it, that the subject was that gentleman's property, pointing to Bishop, and that he had merely accompanied him to get the money; I asked Bishop how he got the body - he said he was merely removing it from Guy's-hospital to King's-college; I asked whose it was - he said it was his own; I then asked Williams what he had to say - he said, "I know nothing at all about it; I merely went to King's-college, out of curiosity, to see the building:" I asked Bishop, when he said the body was his own, what he was - he said he was a bl - y body-snatcher; I should observe, that the prisoners were under the effects of liquor in my judgement; May and Bishop more particularly so; May was carried in on all-fours, and his frock over his face - he was scuffling; I ordered the body to be taken out of the hamper, which was done in my presence, and laid on a table; it struck me it was the body of a person who had recently died, as there was blood trickling from the mouth; the front teeth were all out - in consequence of further information I went to the house of Mr. Mills, Newington-causeway, on the Tuesday following, and received from him twelve teeth, which I now produce; I went on Tuesday, the 8th, to a cottage, No. 3, Nova Scotia-gardens, and in a back room, on the ground floor, I found a trunk; I went to the same cottage on the 20th of November, to make further search, and in the front parlour I found a hairy cap, covered with dirty linen, but I think that was by accident, as the things had been turned over before - I think I had seen the cap hanging up on the 8th; I produce it with the sack and hamper.</p>

Williams made no answer - Bishop asked Shields to go over to the hospital, and get a hamper which was inside the rails; Shields refused to go - Bishop went out of the house himself, and returned shortly after with a hamper; Williams and Shields remained till he returned - they then left the house together; I did not see them again till they were in custody.</p>

            . I drive a cabriolet. On Friday evening, the 4th of November, I was at the stand in the Old Bailey, with my cab, and at twenty minutes before six o'clock I went into the watering-house to have my tea - Allcroft keeps the house; the waterman fetched me out for a fare, and I saw May and Bishop - I am sure of their persons; May asked if I wanted a job - I said I did not know; he said he wanted a cab, "a long job or a short job," and he led me by the tip of my coat to the near wheel of an errand-cart - Bishop remained by my cab; May told me plainly that he wanted me to fetch a stiff one, by which I understood a dead body - I told him I did not know, what would he stand - he said he would stand a guinea; I said I had not finished my tea, and the horse had not done his corn; May said, "Then we will take tea together;" I went into the watering-house to my tea - May and Bishop followed me, and took their places at the end of the table - they called for tea for two; a person in the room gave me a nudge on the elbow, and gave me a caution, but not in their hearing - I had resolved before not to accommodate them, but had given them to understand I would go; I directed the waterman to get my horse ready, and after tea I went out, got into my cab, and drove to the bottom of the rank, out of their way - I looked round, and saw May and Bishop going up the rank among the coaches, and I left them apparently bargaining with a coachman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.How do you know this was on Friday? A.Because the person I drive for had a summons that day to attend at Essex-street before the Commissioners - there might be four or five persons in the watering-house.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. The conversation was by the errand-cart outside the house, when you and May were alone? A. Yes; Friday is the day the Commissioners hear summonses.</p>

            . I live at No. 39, Bridgehouse-place, Newington-causeway. On the 5th of November May called and offered me a set of twelve human teeth - there were six of each jaw; I think it was between nine and ten o'clock - he asked me a guinea for the set; I said one of the front teeth was chipped, which leasened the value, and I would give him 12s.; I said the chipped one lessened the value of the teeth, and I did not believe they belonged to one set; he said he declared, upon his soul, to God, they all belonged to one head, and not long since, and that the body had never been buried - he at last agreed to take 12s., which I gave him, and he left; I examined them particularly afterwards, and found a portion of the gum, and some part of the socket attached to them - I cleaned it off: from that circumstance it appeared to me that the teeth had certainly been wrenched from the jaw by violence - they were so firmly attached I had great difficulty in separating them; I remarked to May that they had certainly belonged to a young subject, or a female - he said, "The fact is, they belong to a boy between fourteen and fifteen years old."</p>

            , by seeing him about the street: on Tuesday, the 1st of November, I saw him in Oxford-street, and spoke to him; I saw a dead body at the station-house in Covent-garden on the following Monday - it was the body of the same person as I had seen in Oxford-street; he had a cage, with white mice in it, and a tortoise - he had a cap on his head, something like the one produced; it was torn on one side - I believe this to he the same cap; he had on a blue coat and grey trousers - (looking at a pair of trousers) I observed a large patch on the left knee, and by the patch on the left knee of these trousers I believe them to be the same he had on; they are the same kind - I did not so particularly notice the colour or patch as I did the stitches being so great a distance from each other as these are; I do believe these to be the trousers - I have not seen them since I saw them on the boy in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>JOHN KING. I am ten years old, and live in Crabtree-row, Bethnal-green, facing the Bird Cage, near Nova Scotia-gardens; I live with my mother, who is now confined. I remember one day when my mother was wash ing, seeing a foreign boy near Nova Scotia-gardens - I believe it was on the Thursday before Guy Fawkes's-day, and between one and two o'clock; I was looking down upon him from the lost window, and could not see whether he had a cage or a box, as my mother would not let me to go down to him; I believe it was a cage, for I saw some wire on the top of it - he was standing still, with the cage hanging round his neck, by a string; he had a brown hairy cap on his head - the peak of it was lined with green; the cap produced looks exactly like it - I do not know how long he remained there; I was looking at him a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Were you in the first or second floor? A. On the first, not very high from the ground; I was looking out at the lost door, and could see the green of the peak.</p>
               <p>MARTHA KING. I am eleven years old; the last witness is my brother - I remember seeing an Italian boy near the Bird Cage public-house; I was at the front part of the house, it was on the Wednesday or Thursday before Guy Fawkes' day, and about twelve o'clock, I am sure it was either Wednesday or Thursday - he was standing still opposite the Bird Cage, with his box slung round his neck, and a cap on his head; the cap was just like this: Bishop's house is about a minute's walk from our house - I have never seen the boy since.</p>

            , cabinet-maker, of Virginia-row, Bethnal-green; I live opposite the Bird Cage. On Thursday the 3rd of November, about a quarter before twelve o'clock, I saw an Italian boy-(I know the day, because on Wednesday I was at Mr. Bird's sale-room, and it was the day after the sale) - he was very near my own window, standing side-ways; I could see the side of his face and one end of the box, which he had in front of him: I think it was slung round his neck - he had a brown for or seal skin cap on, a small one rather shabby; I could see the peak was lined with green, and cut off very sharp (looking at the cap), it was this colour, but the front appeared to me, to come more pointed - it was a cap much like this; I cannot swear whether this is it: he had on a dark blue or a dirty green jacket, and grey trousers, apparently a dark mixture, but very shabby - about a quarter of an hour after; I had occasion to go to the

On Thursday morning the 3rd of November, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw an Italian boy standing under the window of the Bird Cage public-house, near Nova Scotia-gardens - he had a box or cage with two white mice, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010030"/>cage part of the box went round; I turned round to the boy; I saw he looked very cold, and gave him a half-penny, and told him he had better go on - he had on a blue coarse jacket or coat, apparently very coarse, and a brown cap with a bit of leather in front; I did not notice whether it was for or not - it was similar to this in colour, and the jacket was this colour; I did not notice his trousers.</p>

            . I went to live at No. 2, Nova Scotia-gardens, on the 17th of October - Bishop lived at No. 3, and I have every reason to believe Williams lived there also - I lived there till after they were apprehended - I do not know that I ever saw Bishop till after he was at the office, but I have seen Williams in the garden of No. 3. twice; the first Sunday after I moved in, and the second Sunday also - I am never at home in the week day, except from one to two o'clock; the first Sunday I was there I was digging the garden up - Williams came, and conversed with me over the rails; he took me away from the part I was digging, and pointed to another part where I could get some lilies - I had been digging directly at the bottom of the garden, and he drew my attention to a spot close to the house, and more particularly within reach of the gate. On the Thursday, before the 5th of November, I went to bed about half-past nine o'clock, which is my usual hour I generally go to sleep almost directly, and suppose I had been asleep four hours, or four hours and a half; when I was awoke, (I was half asleep) - I sleep in the front parlour; I heard footsteps, and thought it was somebody at the back of my premises - I thoroughly awoke myself to be satisfied; I found it was not in my house, but in the adjoining parlour, No. 3 - I distinctly heard three men's footsteps; I remained laying in bed, and did not sit up - I heard a scuffle, which might last about a minute or two at the furtbest, and then all was silent - the scuffling was in the same room as I heard the foo'steps - before I entirely went to sleep again I heard the side gate open; it is a side gate, at No. 3, leading to a path-way, at the left side of the house, called the private-way - I could distinctly hear the footsteps of one person in the room, and heard the footsteps of two persons run by my window - I am positive I heard the footsteps of two leave the house, and I heard them run back again - before they returned I heard the footsteps of one person within the house; the two returned in about a minute, and then I distinctly heard the voices of three persons -I knew the voice of one to he Williams; after that all became silent, and I went to sleep.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Do you know the thickness of the wall between the houses? A. No -I believe about four inches; they are brick - I only suppose Williams lives in Bishop's house, from having seen him twice; he is Bishop's son-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the struggling like three men struggling together? A. I cannot say - I heard a struggling, but considered it a family quarrel; Williams had conversed with me for above two hours on the second Sunday - I am certain of his voice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q, What period was there between the footsteps leaving the house and their returning? A. About a minute or a minute and a half.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 9th of November I went to No. 3, Nova Scotia-gardens, about five o'clock in the evening, I searched the house, and found two crooked chisels, a brad-awl, and a file - there was some blood all over the brad-awl, which looked fresh - it is now more dried on; I went on the 11th to May's lodging, No. 4, Dorset-street, New Kent-road - I found some tools, and among other things a pair of breeches, which are here, and when I got to the station-house I observed marks of blood on the back part of them, which appeared fresh - I also found a waistcoat, which appears to have a quantity of clay on it, and some tools - on the 19th I went again to Bishop's house, with Wadey - we searched the garden, behind the house; we tried it with an iron rod, and found something rather soft - I told Wadey to dig there, and the first thing that came up was a jacket and trousers, and a small size shirt - they were close to the palings, about five yards from the back door; we dug in another part of the garden, and found a blue coat, a pair of trousers, with braces attached to them, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010031"/>striped waistcoat, which appeared to have been a man's, but was taken in at the back, as if to fit a boy - it had marks of blood on the collar and shoulder; also a shirt, which was torn right up the front - they are here; the jacket has been already produced, and spoken to by the witnesses - these are the trousers which have been spoken to; here is the waistcoat - the stains of blood are not near so plain now; this is the shirt - the whole of these things were found buried in the garden, about twelve inches in the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they clothes likely to be useful to children in Bishop's family? A. The coat would be very useful, and has not got a rent in it; it would be very useful for a working boy - there were cinders and ashes over the ground, which would prevent my noticing its having been turned up.</p>

            . I am vestry-clerk of St. Paul, Covent-garden. I was apprised of the discovery of this body about five o'clock, on Saturday afternoon, the 5th of November, and have taken some interest in the investigation; I attended the Inquest which was held from day to day - it met on Tuesday afternoon, the 8th of November, and adjourned till Thursday, the 10th, when it closed; in the course of the examination Bishop was produced, and made a statement, before which he received a very strong caution from the Coroner, that he was not obliged to say any thing, but that the evidence affected him, and if he chose to make a statement of a voluntary nature he might, but what he stated might he made evidence for or against him hereafter; I took the liberty of telling him that I was about to take down every word he said, and informed him before I did so, that the inquiry might affect his life - he made a declaration, which I took down from his mouth, read it over to him, and he offered to sign it; May and Williams were also cautioned, and examined the same as Bishop - Williams declined signing his statement.</p>
               <p>The statements being read were as follow:-</p>
               <p>Bishop said, "I cannot account for the death of the deceased; I got the body out of a grave: the reason why I do not like to say the grave I took it out of is, there are two watchmen in the ground - they entrusted me; they are both men of family, and I do not wish to deceive them; I took it for sale to Guy's-hospital, and as they did not want it I left it there all night and part of the next day, and then I removed it to the King's-college. That is all I can say about it."</p>
               <p>May said, "I live at No. 4, Dorset-street, Newington. I went in the country last Sunday week, and returned on the following Wednesday evening; I brought home a couple of subjects with me - I took them to Mr. Grainger's, in Webb street, the same evening, and on the following morning, which was Thursday, I removed them to Mr. Davis', at Guy's, and after receiving the money went away; I went to the Fortune of War in Smithfield, and I staid there I dare say for two or three hours - between four and five o'clock, to the best of my recollection. I went to Nag's Head-court, Golden-lane, and there I stopped with a female till eleven or twelve the next day, Friday; from Golden-lane I went to the Fortune or War again, and there I stopped drinking till six o'clock, or past - Williams and Bishop both came in there: they asked me if I would stand any thing to drink, which I did - Bishop then called me out, and asked me where I could get the best price for things - I told him where I had sold two at Guy's, and he told me he had got a good subject, and he had been offered eight guineas for it; I told him I could get more for it - he said all I could get over nine I might have for myself, and I agreed to it; we went from there to the Old Bailey, and we had some tea at the watering-house in the Old Bailey, leaving Williams at the Fortune of War: after we had tea we called a chariot off the stand, and drove to Bishop's house- when we came there Bishop showed me the lad in a box or trunk; I then put it into a sack, and took it to the chariot myself, and took it from thence to Mr. Davis', at Guy's; Mr. Davis said, "You know, John, I cannot take it, because I took two of you yesterday, and I have not got names enough down for one, or else I would;" I asked him if I might leave it there that night, and he said, "Certainly"; Bishop then desired Mr. Davis not to let any person have it but himself, for it was his own subject, which Mr. Davis said he would not, and told his man James not to let any person have it besides himself; I told Mr. Davis not to let it go until I came as well, for I should be money out of pocket if it went before I came - I went home that evening, where I slept, and in the morning I went to Mr. Davis', and had not been there many minutes before Bishop came in, and Shields, with a hamper, and took it from thence to King's-college, and there I was taken in to custody.</p>

               <p>Williams said, "I live at No. 3, Nova Scotia-gardens, and am a glass-blower. In the first place, I met with Bishop last Saturday evening, in Long-lane, Smithfield; I asked him where he was going - he said he was going to King's-college - we then went to the Fortune of War public-house, instead of going to King's-college we went to Guy's-hospital, and he came out of there, and went to the King's-college; then May and the porter met him against the gate, then Bishop went in, and I asked him to let me go in with him - a porter took a basket from the Fortune of War to Guy's-hospital, and I helped him part of the way with it. That is all I have got to say.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was attending at the station-house, in Covent-garden, at the time the Inquest was held on the body of the lad; I saw all the three prisoners in the front room - there was a printed bill stuck up there, referring to this supposed murder; it was behind where they sat - Bishop looked at the bill, and then sat down; Williams was between him and May - Bishop leaned his head over Williams to speak to May, and observed, in a low tone of voice, "It was the blood that sold us;" I heard no answer made to that - he then got up, looked at the bill, read it over a second time, and sat down with a sort of forced laugh, and said, "This states marks of violence, the marks of violence were only breakings out on the skin;" nothing was said in answer to that.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS re-examined. When I first saw the body. I observed some patches of dirt on the breast, the side, and front of the legs - I particularly observed dirty marks on the left arm, which bore the appearance of fingers having grasped the arm; I now recollect that did observe on the breast a sort of falling in, as if it had been crushed if not broken- there was a continued stream of blood from the wound in the forehead, down the chest and body; it seemed as if it had been smeared off the breast, but sufficient was left to show that it had been blood.</p>

               <p>Bishop's Defence (written.) I, John Bishop, am thirty-three years of age, married, with three children, twelve, five, and three years of age, born at Highgate, was for some years a carrier, but have been engaged in procuring bodies for surgical and anatomical purposes twelve years; I have carried bodies to St. Thomas'-hospital, St. Bartholomew's-hospital, Guy's-hospital, and most of the private schools in London, at which places I am known - I declare that I never sold any body but what had died a natural death; I have had bodies from the various workhouses, together with the clothes which were on the bodies - I occupied the house in Nova Scotia-gardens, fifteen months; it consisted of three rooms and a wash-house, a garden, about twenty yards long, by about eight yards broad, three gardens adjoin, and are separated by a dwarf railing; I could have communication to either cottage, or the occupiers of them to mine - the well in my garden was for the joint use of all the tenants; there was also a privy to each house - the fact is, there are twenty cottages and gardens, which are only separated by the paling already described, and I could get easy access to any of them; I declare I know nothing at all about the various articles of wearing-apparel that have been found in the garden, but as regards the cap that was found in the house, and supposed to have belonged to the deceased Italian boy, I can prove that it was bought by my wife of a Mrs. Dodswell, of Hoxton Old-town, clothes-dealer, for my own son, Frederick - the front I sewed on myself after it was purchased; the front was bought with the cap, but not sewed to it - they were sold to my wife along with other articles; Mr. Dodswell is a pastry-cook, and has nothing to do with the business of the clothes-shop - the calling of Mrs. Dodswell, therefore, as evidence to prove the truth of my statement, will put it beyond a doubt that the cap never did belong to the deceased boy, and Mrs. Dodswell should also prove how long she had the cap in her possession, and how she came by it: as much stress has been laid upon the finding of several articles of wearing-apparel, and also the peculiar manner in which they appear to have been taken off the persons of those supposed to have came in an improper way into my hands, I most solemnly declare I know nothing whatever of them; the length of the examinations, and the repetition of them have been so diligently promulgated and impressed on the public mind, that it cannot but be supposed that a portion of the circumstances connected with this unfortunate case (if not all,) have reached and attracted the attention of the Jury; but I entreal them, as they value the solemn obligation of the oath they have this day taken, that they will at once divest themselves of all prejudice, and give me the whole benefit of a cool, dispassionate, and impartial hearing of the case, and record such a verdict as they, on their conscience, their honour, and their oath can return: May and Williams know nothing as to how I became possessed of the body.</p>
               <p>Williams' Defence (written.) I, Thomas Williams, am now twenty-six years of age; I am a bricklayer by trade, and latterly worked at the glass-blowing business, as a fireman - I was never engaged in any instance as a procurer of dead bodies or subjects; into the present melancholy business I was invited by Bishop - I know nothing whatever about the manner in which he became possessed of the dead body; Bishop asked me to join him on the Friday - I made no inquiry about the nature of the business; I shall, therefore, leave my case entirely to the intelligence and discrimination of the Jury, and the learned and merciful Judge; but trust I may be allowed once more to state, that I am entirely innocent of any offence against the laws of my contry.</p>

            , am thirty years of age, am married, with one child four years old, born at the New Inn, Strand, London, in the parish of St. Clement Danes, and received a moderate education; I was not apprenticed, but followed the calling of a butcher in the earlier part of my life - I was engaged by several masters, who carried on their business in Clare-market; men, who are circumstanced as I was, are backwards and forwards from one master butcher to another, as may be required: I first became engaged in the traffic of anatomical subjects six years since, and from that period, up to the time of my apprehension, have continued so, with occasionally looking after horses; I accidentally met Bishop at the Fortune of War, a house that persons of our calling generally frequent, and are known there as such - Bishop wanted to speak to me, called me outside the door, and asked me where the best price could be procured for things; I told him where I had sold two for ten guineas each, at Mr. Davis', and I had no doubt I could get rid of that thing for him at the same price - he said if I did I should keep all I got above nine guineas to myself; there was no question asked as to the manner in which the body had been procured, and I knew nothing about it: as to what has been said in the public papers, or the prejudice that exists against me and the other prisoners, is of no moment; I here declare, that during all the years that I have been in this business, I never came into possession of a living person, nor used any means for converting them into subjects for the purposes of dissection; I admit that I have traded largely in dead bodies, but I solemnly declare that I never took undue advantage of any person alive, whether man, woman, or child, however poor or unprotected - I have not been accustomed to make application for bodies at the different workhouses, and I now solemnly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010033"/>declare that I know nothing at all of the circumstances connected with the procuring of the body, which is suspected to be that of the one named in the indictment, nor did I ever hear, nor understand, how Bishop became possessed thereof: I shall, therefore, leave my fate entirely to the intelligence and discernment of the Jury, and the learned Judge.</p>
               <p>ROSINA CARPENTER. I have known May fourteen or fifteen years, but have not seen him for four or five years till within the last four months - on Thursday, the 3rd of November, he came to my house, in Nag's Head-court, Golden-lane, between four and five o'clock in the evening; I am sure it was Thursday - he stopped with me till between eleven and twelve o'clock next morning, which was Friday: I am sure he never left me - this was in Nag's Head-court, Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you live by yourself in Golden-lane? A. Yes - nobody was present during the time May was there; several people drank with us during that time - I am sure he did not go away till between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day on Friday; I know the Fortune of War - he was never out during the time; I cannot particularly name the persons who drank with us -I had frequently seen May for about three months, but before that had not seen him for four or five years; he had passed several nights with me before this - he had no human teeth in his possession, to my knowledge.</p>

On the 19th of November, in the afternoon, about an hour before this happened, I wiped the window outside - there was no pane of glass out then, but one was cracked, and these things were in a tray close to the glass; the Policeman brought the prisoner into the shop about twenty minutes to nine o'clock that evening, and showed me a snuff-box, which I knew to be masters; I then found a corner of the pane had been broken out, large enough to admit a boy's hand - I missed five boxes, two cigars, and tubes; I had been this box on Friday morning, but cannot say whether I had seen it afterwards - one of the boxes has master's private mark on it; four of them were yellow, and the other a kind of tortoiseshell.</p>

            . I am a constable of the City. On the 18th of November, about five o'clock, I was in Aldermanbury, and saw the prisoner there with this cloth on his arm - he was going from Basinghall-street, and about three hundred yards from the prosecutor's; a man, who is of a suspicious character, was about two yards behind him - I followed him up Philip-lane to London-wall; I was disposed to let him go as far as the door beyond Deacon's yard, on account of there being a strong gas-light - I turned round towards him, and seeing me look at him, he threw the cloth down, and ran away; I had said nothing to him - I called Deacon's people to take care of the cloth- I pursued, calling Stop thief! he ran up Aldermanbury Postern; I secured him, without losing sight of him - I took him back to Deacon's, found the cloth safe, and then took him to the Compter; on our way there he asked me if this job could not be made up - that he had got a few pounds of his own, and money should be no object; I said it was of no use to trifle with me - after leaving him at the Compter I got the cloth from Deacon's, and have had it ever since; Hedges tripped him up, which enabled me to secure him; I did not hold out either threat or promise to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You know that what he said could not be given in evidence against him, if you said any thing to induce him to say it? A.Certainly I do - it was dark; the cloth was wrapped up, but I could see it: he put his hand over the front, which was uncovered; I never lost sight of him - nobody was between me and him; he ran in the middle of the road.</p>

On the 18th of November I missed an end of green cloth, containing twenty-three yards, worth about 11l., and a blue one, measuring twenty-four yards; I have not seen the green one since -I had seen it safe about one or two o'clock that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How do you know you saw it on the 18th? A. I recollect seeing it on the table - it was covered with paper, except at the end; I saw three cloths laying there with the tickets on them - a customer came in, and looked at this about one or two o'clock; I missed it at half-past five in the evening, when the officer came to inquire - it was a bright clear evening, about five o'clock; I cannot tell whether it was moonlight - my partner had put a private mark on the cloth, in my presence - I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Fox. On the 18th of November, about five o'clock, I was at the door, and saw the prisoner pass the private door, and go into the warehouse; nobody was with him when he went in, but before he went in he was standing at the door talking to the former prisoner - I saw him go into the warehouse, but did not see him come out; I am quite sure he is the man - I did not know whether he had business there or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The dustmen were at the door? A. Yes, taking the dust out - I was not paying particular attention to who went into the warehouse; I had not seen the prisoner before; I remarked him more than the other prisoner, because he looked at me as he passed the door, and they both stood at the door with their hands in their pockets, and kept continually looking at me; they were there three or four minutes - I paid as much attention to one as the other; they stood sideways; I could see both their faces at the same time - the prisoner had a black handkerchief, and was dressed in black, or very dark clothes; I could see his features as well as his clothes- I knew him by his features, by his clothes, and his person - I did not notice his feet; I should have known him if I had met him in the street or in the country - I saw him again on the 22nd of November, at Guildhall; I was told to go there to see if he was the man I had seen on master's premises - I left the door when I saw him turn into the warehouse, to put a candle on the stairs; I noticed him, because he kept looking at the door; I thought he went in on business - I had no particular reason for looking at him; the dustmen were down in the cellar when the prisoner entered the warehouse - I am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I am a paper-hanger, and live in Three Herring-court, Redcross-street - I know the prisoner well by sight. On the 18th of November, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Basinghall-street, and saw the prisoner come out of the passage of Mr. Fox's house; he had a piece of cloth under his arm about the size of that produced on the last trial - he proceeded from the passage, right opposite, up Church-passage, leading to Aldermanbury; I went down Basinghall-street and London-wall, and saw him cross from Aldermanbury to Aldermanbury-postern with the cloth under his arm - I there lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How near was you to him? A. I was close to him when he came out of the passage; it was not a very light night - it was gloomy; it was rather before five o'clock, I think; I work for Mr. Cooper, of St. Mary-axe, and a great many more people in the City - I was passing down the street, having done my work; I have known the prisoner for some months, but never spoke to him - he had dark clothes on; there was nobody in the street but the party who was with him, and I was rather afraid of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were with him? A. I believe three or four - they were standing opposite; I walked after him some distance - he had a close bodied coat on; there was nobody with him, when I saw him again in Aldermambury; he did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010036"/>not speak to the persons opposite, but one said to the other as I passed them, "They have only got two pieces:" it was too soon for me to see a watchman - I did not go into the prosecutor's to give information, because there was nobody passing in the street, and I thought I was in danger, as the others were standing opposite the door - I thought my life in danger, that was my only reason; it was too far to go to Cripplegate watch-house - I saw the end of the cloth out of the paper; I was asked to describe the colour before the Alderman, but could not: there was no dust cart at the door when I passed - I did not see the other man go in; I saw the prisoner come out, and two men opposite the door; it was a darkish evening, but I could see the features of the man by the gas, which shone on him in Aldermanbury Postern - he was at one corner and I at the other; I was about six yards from him.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.About how long have you known the prisoner? A. About eighteen months, but I had not seen him for ten months; I saw him at the warehouse door for about five minutes.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information the prisoner was brought to me at Aldermanbury watch-house, on Monday, the 21st, between twelve and one o'clock at night; he was shown to Earl and Lewis, who both identified him directly they saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Is there an officer named Norton? A. Yes; he brought him into my custody - he is not here.</p>
               <p>MR. PRESTON. I am in partnership with Mr. Fox. I was on the premises on the 18th of November, and saw the green cloth about eleven o'clock in the morning; I never sold it - I left about four o'clock; I sleep at Pentonville.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you have no shopman? A. No.</p>

On the 18th of November, I went out at half-past one o'clock, to dinner, returned about half-past two, and was at work till half-past eight: I can prove I was at work at that time - I had regular work from my uncle for three or four months, and had no occasion to steal.</p>

             TODD. I have been a satin-dresser, but am now in the watch-motion way, and live in Clark-street, Little Sutton-street. I have known the prisoner about two years; he makes pinions for watches.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You knew where he worked perhaps? A.In the same shop as I do, at Mr. Pink's, his uncles; I occupy the first floor in the house: his uncle is now confined with the rheumatism - my wife is his daughter, she is here: the prisoner went out to get his dinner about half-past one o'clock that day; he had his meals in the house, but sometimes went out to dinner - he returned about half-past three, and worked till about eight, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did he not leave the house long before nine o'clock? A. I cannot say, for I left the house to meet my wife about a quarter-past eight - I swear he was constantly in the house, from half-past three till about eight; he was taken up on the Monday, but I did not hear of it till the Tuesday, when his aunt went to see him - I did not go to the Magistrate to state that he was at home at the time - I did not know what he was in custody for till his aunt came back, between two and three o'clock: she did not go there till twelve - a person had been sent to our house about eight that morning to let us know he was in custody, and the aunt went to the Compter about ten or eleven; she returned about half-past eleven o'clock - I heard her say he was taken on suspicion of robbery; I did not ask when it was committed - I thought if he was innocent he would get off; his aunt dressed, and went to Guildhall - I heard the robbery was committed somewhere in Basinghall-street; she said so before she went to Guildhall - I did not inquire what time it was done, nor on what day; I believe he was only examined once - I believe the aunt did not appear before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>MR. FOX. There is an inner door to our warehouse, which opens into a passage.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. I was formerly in the service of the prosecutor - I was well acquainted with his plate; the initials on it are D. M. - I received some communication from the prosecutor, and went to his chambers, in the Albany. on the 29th of October: the prisoner was there, in his service - I wished her to produce the key of the plate-chest; she said it was all right, but refused to show it to me - I threatened that I would search, and take her into custody; after some persuasion she produced the key, and showed me the chest; there was some plate in it - some of the articles were plated, but I did not discover that at that time; I do not know whether the plated articles were the prosecutor's; I asked if she had any duplicates, and she said she had not - in my judgment some of the plate was then missing; I asked where the remainder was - she said that was all that Mr. Macdonald had - I then commenced searching, and found thirty-eight duplicates; about half of them were in the top drawer of a chest in her sitting-room, and the remainder on a shelf in her bed-room - among others was one for this fish-slice, which I marked; I gave her in charge - she afterwards said she pawned the articles, intending to get them out again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. When was this mark made on this duplicate? A.In St. James' station-house, in my presence, by Clements - there was a person named Shingler there; I do not know whether he had lived in the prosecutor's service - I told the prisoner it would be better for her to confess, as I only wished to obtain the articles, and then she made the confession I have stated.</p>

               <p>JOSHUA FREDERICK CLEMENTS. I was at St. James' watch-house on the 29th of October, and received the prisoner in custody; I found some of these duplicates; the articles are here - here are five table-spoons, two sauce-ladles, and a fork.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner at his lodging, in Windmill-street; I accused him of stealing the flute - he made no answer, but when I told him we had found it at the pawnbroker's, he said he would give up the duplicate, which he did; he said he did it through distress, and he meant to redeem it again - I found 6s. 0 1/2d. on him, which he said was part of the money he kept to redeem the flute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not find my apartment in great distress? A. I did - I know his wife went away about four years ago. and left him with an infant family, which I believe preyed on his mind.</p>
               <p>The prisoner delivered in a written Defence, pleading extreme poverty - he received a good character.</p>
               <p>MR. HARVEY. He was employed on the job I spoke of from the Wednesday till the Saturday, and he received a guinea for it.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to a pawnbroker, in Berwick-street. I have a tea-pot pawned on the 2nd of August, and a cloak on the 5th of August, by Hodge.</p>
               <p>MR. BUNN. I believe Roberts came into my service, on the 3rd of February. I had not missed any of these articles till the prisoners were taken; I cannot say when I lost them - when I had discharged Roberts, I commissioned Hodge to examine if my things were all right, and he said they were; that was about a week, before he was taken - these cups and other things are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect using the teapot? A. I do not think I ever did use it; there is no crest or arms on these coffee-cups, but they correspond with the pattern of a set I purchased - here is my crest and name on this salt-spoon, and the other articles I know by having similar ones; I had the management of the Dublin theatre: Hodge was at that time in my service, and he then had 1l. a week - I knew he was married and had a family; when I came to England, I paid him 10s. a week; the 1l. a week was not continued - I am not in debt to him for wages - I told him I could not give him the same as I had at the theatre; I cannot say that I fixed any sum with him, but to the best of my belief, I told him his wages would be 10s. a week - there is something due to his wife for washing, which has been witheld merely because my things were not returned, and there may be something due to her as a dresser at the theatre; Hodge did not sleep at my house - Roberts was not accustomed to pay for mangling and other things for me; I never left her without money to pay current expences: I was never absent for any length of time, but when I went to France for five weeks - I left some money with her then, but only enough for a few days; I do not know that she then pawned some articles to pay expences, for when I found my stay in France was protracted, I wrote to my solicitor to supply her, which he did - I found some letters had come while I was away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.From the time you returned from France did either of the prisoners make any communication to you on that subject? A. No, Hodge did ask for some advance to his pay, and I got his wife a situation as dresser in a theatre; I have found my stock is deficient of six cups and saucers.</p>

On the 5th of November the prisoner, who was a stranger, came to my shop, and said he wanted some cards similar to one I had in the window; it was a dinner-ticket, engraved in the usual way, "Request the honour of company to dinner;" he desired to have one hundred of them struck off - I asked in what name; he said the Honourable Charles Kemp, <placeName id="t18311201-39-crimeloc219">Raggett's-hotel, Davies-street</placeName>

I showed them to him - he put the diamond to his tongue, and said that was the test they had in China, and if it would feel cold as long as he could hold it to his tongue, it was a diamond, if not it was only imitation; I said,"Does this one answer the test?" he said Yes - he then asked for a piece of glass to try it on, and said it was a good one; he then said, "I have not time to stay this morning, but if you will bring this and two or three others up to Raggett's hotel, I will look at them," and smelling by his breath that he was a smoker, I produced a case to him; he looked at it, and said, "If we do any business together I shall expect you to give me this," and then recollecting himself, he said, "Have you any gold pen and pencil-holders?" I showed him some, but they were not good enough for him, and I was to take him some others, and be at the hotel at six o'clock; I went out, returned home at six, and scarcely had I got home, when the prisoner opened the door, and asked if I was at home - I said Yes; he said, "I have a call to make, make it five or ten minutes later:" I went to the hotel, and found him there, attended by his hair-dresser - he begged I would not feel any disappointment, and said he would soon dismiss his peruquier; he soon came out, and said, "Now, Sir, to business, pray take a chair;" I took a chair, and sat down by his side, at a table which was covered for dinner, on which was a great quantity of plate - he then took a pencil-case and a diamond ring, and agreed for them at a price; when he was at my shop, he asked if I had any ladies gold chains, and as I had three ladies' gold watches, I took them in my pocket, and showed them to him - he looked at them, took up the best of them, said that would do, and he wished to have a watch and a chain for himself - he then said, "I have two Trichinopoly gold chains in the next room, which I should like to exchange with you," and with my ring on his finger, and the watch in his hand, he went to the door of the room; he then said, "Shall I bring one or two?" I said, "Bring them both;" he went away, and I never saw him again - the waiter came into the room, and I said, "Where is Mr. Kemp?" he said, "I think I saw him go out;" I did not see the prisoner again till the 13th of November, when I was sent for to Tetsall's hotel, in the Adelphi - I said, "Well, Mr. Kemp, where is my watch and diamond ring?" he made no answer: I said,"Are they pawned?" he gave no answer, but he afterwards said they were, and he gave me an address, which I wrote down; he said, "Mr. Collins, my life is at your mercy, will you prosecute me?" I do not know whether I made him any promise or threat - he produced the duplicates from his fob.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was that in the presence of Mr. Tetsall? A. He was present part of the time; I did notmake him any promise before he said that the articles had been pawned; he did not order the gold watch - I had taken all the property from my pocket, and put it on the table.</p>

Yes, between three and four pails; I did not see you in the back kitchen - it was regularly fixed; you had emptied part of the water out with a large baking-dish, lifted the rest out in the copper, and poured the water out.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I had used the copper on the Friday before, and when I went into the back kitchen on the day stated, the prisoner had the copper out, and was pouring the water about the kitchen - I ran back, and told my husband; he went out with me - the prisoner placed the copper loosely in its place, and my husband stopped him in the passage; the copper was fixed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010043"/>near my door, but my child was crying, and I did not hear it taken out; our street door is open, but not the back kitchen - it is only for the use of the lodgers in the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sent to the house, to a tailor named Conner, to tell him to call on a person about a coat- I met a person coming out; I asked if Conner was at home - they said they did not know, but I had better go up stairs; I went up, and left my message, and when I came down I was stopped on suspicion of stealing this copper; but I would ask if it were possible for an individual like me to remove a copper with four pails of water in it? and again, it was a very dark place; the woman could not distinguish my person.</p>

The prisoner had worked as a labourer for him for five weeks; on the 24th of November I watched in the yard, and saw Spikesley go to the potato-house; between four and five o'clock in the morning - the prisoner took a ladder, and set it against the window of the potato-house; Spikesley got in first, and then the prisoner - they were in there a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes: they had taken an empty sack in with them - the prisoner then came out, and I saw a sack with potatoes in it lifted out of the window; the prisoner took it on his back, and walked away with it a few yards - I then took him, and Spikesley got away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Did you not state that the potatoes were yours? A. No - I am not in partnership with my father; the window of the potato-house ought not to have been opened but by me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say you went to the counter with it? A. No, I did not; if it went to the counter it was before I arrived - I did not see it shown at the counter.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You received this from Lovick? A. Yes, and then I allowed Burrows to have it, but I did not lose sight of it - I got there about four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

            . I assist Mrs. Mariner. On the 7th of November I put out this vinegarette; I know it by my figures being on it - I had not sold it; I recollect its being missed - the prisoner was at the counter that afternoon, and went round to the other counters; I heard there was a person taken - the Policeman produced this vinegarette to me in the room adjoining.</p>

               <p>CATHERINE LOVICK. I am inspectress of the Bazaar. I recollect the prisoner being there on the 7th of November - I followed her down stairs; she went through a door to a private door, and asked to go to a back place -I was close to her; she went into a room, and threw these articles behind a basket, out of her muff; I asked why she threw them there - she said, "They are my own, what have you to do with it?" or something of that kind- I said, "Why have you thrown them there?" I picked them up, and gave them to the officer - this vinegarette was among them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you quite as sure you delivered this to the officer, as you did the brooch? A. Yes - I did not see Mr. Burrows; she said she had bought these things, or something of that kind - I cannot undertake to state every word she said - I heard afterwards that Mr. Burrows had the brooch; I saw him that day, after the things were taken.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do you keep cows? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it extraordinary for a cowkeeper to have wet boots? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you have many sacks of this description? A. Yes, and whether that was taken from my premises that day, or any other, I cannot tell; black oats are not uncommon - when I spoke to Dunford he said he knew nothing at all about them.</p>

            . I keep the Admiral Keppel. Dunford supplied the horses there with corn, on his account - he had been with me about three years; the sack was found in the small shed, which is used to keep sacks and small articles in - there were a few black oats in the sack, and some white ones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did this shed belong to Dunford? A. It is appropriated to his use, and is generally locked, but was not then; the sack appeared to have been used both for black and white oats.</p>

               <p>Witness. He ought to have paid this in on the same day, but it is not down in the cash-book, but about a year and a half after this date, he paid 50l., which he stated was paid on account of this money, and I have no doubt he gave me a written memorandum of it - here is the entry of it in the cash-book, in the prisoner's hand-writing, "Nelson, Adam, and Nelson, 50l,"; the other 15l. 12s. has not been paid - there were particular periods at which he used to render a balance-sheet; here is his balance-sheet to Midsummer, 1826, and in this he has entered the sum of 65l. 12s., as due from them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Where did you get this receipt from? A. From Mr. Stevens - I cannot tell whether they paid the money or not, but by the receipt- Mr. Weston has been dead about sixteen years; the prisoner was about two years in his service - I do not know on what terms he was engaged by him or by Mrs. Weston; he has been active in their service certainly - I did not ask him to make up his account, and to bring forward any sum of money which might be deficient, but there was an opportunity about Midsummer last, when Mr. Heard the executor, asked him to settle, but I was not present.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q.Were you present when the prisoner was called upon to explain his accounts? A. I have no recollection of it - I heard Mr. Stevens ask him respecting a deficiency in his accounts; he had then an opportunity of explaining any deficiency.</p>

            . This receipt is the prisoner's handwriting - it is dated the 28th of April, 1829, for 21l. 17s. 6d. - the prisoner's salary was 200l. a year; he was paid a little over that - on one occasion he applied to me for some money, and I made the observation that he had overdrawn his account; he acknowledged that he had; he never claimed, as his right, more than 200l. a year; he should have accounted to me for this 21l. 17s. 6d. on the same day, but he has never accounted to me for it - I have examined my books; in the next balance-sheet, which the prisoner rendered at Midsummer, 1829, he has charged Messrs. Nelson, Adams, and Nelson with 54l. 1s. 6d., which includes this sum of 21l. 17s. 6d. - here is an account in the ledger of 104l. 1s. 6d. due from them, and against it 50l., paid on account, which left the balance 54l. 1s. 6d.; the items are partly in my writing, and the casting up is the prisoner's - he stated, in October, that he had received the 54l. 1s. 6d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever speak to him about this specific sum? A. No; I got this 54l. from the ledger, which is taken from the journal; the latter part of which has been kept by Mr. Thomas Weston.</p>

            . I am executor under Mr. Weston's will. I had a conversation with the prisoner about deficiencies in the accounts - there was a long list of sums stated to be deficient, amounting in the whole to near 1500l. - this is the list; I saw it produced to the prisoner, and in it there is "Messrs. Nelson, Adam, and Co. 54l. 1s. 6d.;" I can tell by the ledger that this included the 21l. 17s. 6d. - the account is made up of five items, which amount to 104l. 1s. 6d., and on the other side, in the prisoner's hand-writing, is "October 20, 1827, cash 50l.," leaving a balance of 54l. 1s. 6d. - his salary was 200l. a year, and his account is in this book, in his own hand-writing, from which it appears that he has sometimes over-drawn his salary; I think in April last he applied to me for an advance of salary, and stated that 200l. a year was not enough for him to maintain his family - he certainly never said he had a right to more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you tell that this sum of 21l. 17s. 6d. is part of the 54l. 1s. 6d.? A. Yes, because the two last items in the account amount to 21l. 17s. 6d., which are on the 8th and 10th of December, and in teh October before he had received the 50l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When was this meeting with respect to the deficiencies? A. I think the last week in last October - he was desired to explain his accounts.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he explain? A. Yes; he was 1476l. deficient in his accounts, which he explained by his having been sixteen or eighteen years in the house, and considering himself entitled to 300l. a year.</p>

               <p>MR. LOVELL. I spoke to the prisoner several times about these accounts; he sometimes said Mr. Lacy was out of town, at other times, if I would send a stamped receipt it would be paid, but I never received the money - I gave him in charge in November; he begged me not to prosecute him, that it would be his ruin, and he knew I could transport him; we were then talking of the sums of money which he had received and not accounted for.</p>

On Sunday, the 6th of November, the prisoner was in my service; I went to church about a quarter to eleven o'clock that morning, leaving him in the house - I left this property in a drawer in my bed-room; I locked it up there that morning - he has seen me put money into that drawer; about half-past twelve o'clock, while I was in church, I received information of this robbery; I went home, and found a 5l. note on the bed-room carpet; there was half a sovereign and some silver left in the bowl, where the money was kept - the rest of the money was gone; the drawer had been forced open- there was the mark of some instrument having been applied; the prisoner came home soon after me, but I had no conversation with him - as I left my bed-room to go to church I observed the shadow of the prisoner in the watercloset.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have the servants access to the water-closet? A. Yes; he was four years in my service; the room adjoining mine was broken into in March last; the back of the house was broken open- I have one female servant; the prisoner came home earlier than I expected him from church - the 5l. note laid open on the carpet; any body might have seen it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When your house was broken open, did the same female servant live with you? A. No, the prisoner did; the 5l. note laid flat on the carpet - I had left it in the bowl, folded up with the other money: I had left the female servant at home.</p>

            . I am a brush-maker, and live in Duke-street, Grosvenor-square - the prosecutrix is also a brush-maker. I was called out of church about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve o'clock; in consequence of this, (church is generally over about one) I went to Bedford's house, and on her bed-room carpet I saw a 5l. note, several loose keys, and a key ring, broken; I then turned round and saw two chests of drawers, two drawers of each were open - I saw Mrs. Bedford go to the wooden bowl, in which was 20s. in cash, and a piece of paper with 59l. written on it; after remaining in the house about twenty minutes, I went out, and met the prisoner in Mount-street - I called him, and gave him in charge on this robbery; he then declared, (holding a very small Prayer-book in his hand,) that he had been to chapel and no where else - he was taken to Mrs. Bedford's; I searched him, and in his waistcoat pocket found 1l. 16s. 1/2d and a key - he appeared much agitated, and asked for some water; I afterwards went to Castle-street Long-acre, and received information.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons did you find in the prosecutrix's house? A. Five, one man and four women - I met the prisoner coming towards home; it was about one o'clock; I found no tools on him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Who was the man? A. The female servants' brother-in-law - her sister was there, and Mrs. Bedford, and Mrs. Turner, the second floor lodger; the prisoner had the Prayer-book in his hand very conspicuously.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Bedford. On the 6th of November mistress went to church, Mrs. Turner, the prisoner and I, were in the house - my sister and brother-in-law were on the step of the door at the time Mrs. Bedford went out, they came in - they were in the habit of calling with mistresses knowledge; they had come to Mrs. Turner, who is a mantua-maker, to give orders about a dress - I went into the kitchen with them; I then took my sister up and left her with Mrs. Turner - as I came down to the bottom of the kitchen stairs, the prisoner was suddenly behind me; mistress had then been gone to church about five minutes - I told him my brother was down stairs; he said, "Oh, is he?" he did not come down after me, but went from the bottom of the stairs somewhere; but in ten or twelve minutes he came down stairs very quickly, and had hardly entered the kitchen when he asked for his book; I told him it was on the end of the dresser - he reached it hastily, knocked down some halfpence, and did not stay to pick them up; when he got near the street door he called out that he would leave his great coat, as it did not rain - I did not hear the door opened or shut, but saw no more of him; my sister came down stairs in about two minutes after the prisoner left the kitchen, and asked me to show her the watercloset, which I did - we staid there about eight minutes; I took her to show her Mrs. Bedford's bed-room, and on opening the door, I was surprised to find a door open which is never opened except when the room is scruhbed, and another door was shut, which is not usually shut in the day time - I felt alarmed, and the first thing I saw was some keys on the carpet - I did not see the ring; I then saw a piece of paper rumpled up - I called my sister to look at it; I took the paper up, it was a 5l. note - I called Mrs. Turner, who came down, and advised me to put it down again, and not touch anything - I did so; Mrs. Turner proposed that the house should be searched - I called up my brother-in-law; we all searched, and found nobody there; a few minutes after Mrs. Turner's son came to the door - I went and let him in, and the door was closed - I then went to St. George's church, for Mrs. Bedford; she came with Ashmead.</p>

               <p>Q.From the time the prisoner took his Prayer-book<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010055"/>till you went to the room, had your brother or sister been out of your sight? A. Not at all - my brother did not go up to the water-closet, but I stood in sight of Mrs. Bedford's bed-room door, with the water-closet door open, and nobody went there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know your brother and sister were coming? A. No; I found no instrument in the bed-room - none of us were searched; I laid the note down, crumpled up, as I had found it - I went to show my sister the room, as she said the water-closet was clean; I did not look at the drawers for marks - I opened the note to see what it was; I crumpled it up again, and put it down as I had found it - I went into the room with Mrs. Bedford, but left again without seeing the note taken up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the prisoner said he would leave his great coat, did you see what had become of him? A. I did not.</p>

On Sunday, the 6th of November, I went to Mrs. Bedford's house, about twenty minutes to eleven o'clock, with my wife: I had lost a child, and we went about getting some crape put on a dress - my sister did not know we were coming: she let Mrs. Bedford out as we rang the bell; while I was in the kitchen the prisoner came down, reached out his hand, took his Prayer-book off the tea-chest, and knocked a 1d. down - I was afterwards called up; I had never been up stairs before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was drunk enough not to walk steady? A. Why, the blows might have made him worse, but he walked to the station without help - when I first saw them they were all standing together, as I thought in conversation, but when I had walked six yards further, the prosecutor fell; I was about eighteen yards off - I did not see his pocket picked; I heard some words spoken before I got up, but do not know what nor by whom - I saw one or two run away; the prisoner said,"Let me go, and let this man take me into custody" - so I thought the one who ran away was assisting the prosecutor to secure the prisoner; I did not hear the word cut used to my knowledge - they were standing very close together.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever recollect how much he said he had lost? A. Never; I know he mentioned a sum - I never stated that he said he had only lost one half-crown; he said at the station, that he had lost three-I do not know what sum he mentioned when I took the prisoner; he never, in my hearing, said he had lost only one half-crown - the prisoner did not refuse to be searched till he said what he had lost; I never told the prosecutor to stick to his story - there was a prostitute by, and somebody tried to trip me up; two prostitutes and a boy followed him to the station - I saw no woman within a yards or two of him when I got up.</p>

            . I sell fruit in Whitecross-street. I do not know the prisoner; I was present on this Saturday night, and heard the prosecutor say he had lost half a crown - that was close against the Cat, at the corner of Whitecross-street; the Policeman was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there? A. I saw the prosecutor wrestling with a young man in the street; the young man got away, and ran away - I saw the prisoner come up to them; the prosecutor was very drunk; I heard him say he had lost half a crown - I followed them to the station, and waited outside the door; when the prosecutor got there, he said he had lost three half-crowns - he staggered very much indeed.</p>

            , Rickmansworth, was on it - I left it there, keeping myself on the alert, and about half-past ten o'clock I was in Belgrave-square, and heard a cart going in the direction of Halton-street; the prisoner was in the cart, alone, driving it - I stopped the horse, and asked if it was his property; he said it was -I asked him the name on the cart; he said if I wished to know I might look - I said that would not satisfy me; he said I should have no further satisfaction - I said he must go to the station with me; he immediately jumped out of the cart, and said he did not know the name; that he had been drinking with the driver of it at the Feathers, in Grosvenor-place, and he wished him to drive it to Pembroke-mews, and to wait at the Sun public-house, Chapel-street, a few minutes, when he (the driver) would come to him, but he had not seen him since that time, which was seven o'clock; I asked where he was going to take the cart - he said to a livery-stable; I asked where - he said to no one in particular; I said then he was my prisoner - he immediately turned round, and ran off as fast as he could; I followed, springing my rattle, and he was stopped by another constable - I asked his name; he said if I would allow him three minutes to go to the Sun, he could give every satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the Sun at the corner of Chapel-street and Belgrave-mews? A. Yes; the door is in Chapel-street - Grosvenor-place is a more public road than Pembroke-mews, which runs out of Chapel-street, and I consider there is more light in Grosvenor-place; there is a lamp nearly opposite the Sun - I first saw the horse and cart in the mews, just behind the Sun, as it were; I had not gone by there before that night - one or two persons said they did not know who it belonged to; I went on duty at nine o'clock - the prisoner was quite sober; he said he had been drinking at the Feathers, not at the Talbot, in Chester-street; he might say that at the watch-house.</p>

            . I live in Chapel-mews, at the Sun. I saw the horse and cart there, between nine and ten o'clock, at the corner of Pemberton-mews - I told the Policeman I should take it home, if there was any inquiry for it, as the horse was shivering; I went into the parlour, and said, "Does any body belong to this horse?" nobody answered - the prisoner sat in the parlour, and asked me to drink; he was tipsy and could hardly stand- the Policeman said I had better not take it home, as I should get into trouble - I am a stable-keeper.</p>

On the 4th of November, at half-past eight o'clock at night, I heard a noise at the door - I went up, and found the prisoner laying in the hall, with his head under a chair; I took him - he had his shoes in one hand, and these six spoons in the other; two of them are plated and four silver - they are my master's, and had been in a little room, up two pairs of stairs from the hall; they had been safe an hour before - it is supposed he got in by a back way, from Wilson-street, which is left open till five o'clock in the evening.</p>

On the night of the 25th of November I was passing at the time Oakes had Richardson and Lee in custody; he gave me information, and I took Western the next morning, at her own lodging, which is some distance from where the prosecutor went to - she said she knew nothing of the robbery; I took her to the watch-house - she then wanted to speak to the prosecutor, and said she had been with him, but knew nothing of the robbery - I searched her room, and found some duplicates, but not belonging to the prosecutor - I found on her 1 1/2d., which she said was all the money she had, and that she was going to pawn a cloak that morning to buy her some soap, but on seaching her room I found three shillings in a card-rack over the fireplace.</p>
               <p>Richardson's Defence. These two females know nothing of the robbery - I was passing the row, and met a girl and a man - they said, "There is a man up in your room;" I told them not to go near the place, but let him be - I went and had half a pint of beer - I then went back to see what man it was. and just as I got to the door the prosecutor ran out, and said he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Western's Defence. I met the prosecutor at the Royal-hospital - he asked me to drink; I staid about a quarter of an hour, and then came out - he came, and asked me where I lived; he was very much in liquor - I said I could not take him to my lodging, but I could go to another room, which we did; Lee came up - he said he preferred her, and I left the room, as he was going to bed.</p>
               <p>Lee's Defence. He asked me if I would go with him; I said Yes, if he paid me - he gave me 1s.; I said I would not go for that, but if he would give me half a crown, as he had the other girl, I would; he would not - Carter then came in, and he asked her to go to bed with him, but would not give her any thing.</p>

            . I returned from my work about four o'clock in the afternoon on the 9th of November, and found the prisoner at home; I am a French polisher, and had worked that day for Mr. Nobbs, at Hampstead - the job only lasted the day; I had lodged with the prisoner a little time, for about a month, in the back room on the ground floor, only I and the prisoner lodge there; we have not lodged together above a month; we do not always eat and drink together - we do at night, and sometimes when I am at home; I had not worked any where the day before - I have not had work for nine months -I had been a gentleman's servant; I lived with a captain in the army named Blades - I left him about twelve months ago; I was then doing jobs at French polishing with a young man who had learned me the French polishing - his name is Gorman; I then lodged at another place - I received half a crown for my day's work; I went away about six o'clock in the morning, and got there about seven o'clock - I returned about three o'clock from Hampstead, and got home about four o'clock; I do not reside in the kitchen; it is a ground-floor room - the landlord's name is Delaney - I believe he has not long been married; he does not occupy the kitchen - I believe the house is full of lodgers, but I do not live there now -I have left; when I got home the prisoner and I sat there till the officer came and took the prisoner away - there was only me and the prisoner in that room; Delaney came in afterwards for a candle - the prisoner and I had not been doing anything, only he smoked a pipe occasionally; our door being open, we heard a noise at the door, and the young man who stole the trousers came running up to our door, and said "I am sailed;" he went over the wall, over the water-butt - he had lodged in the house I have learned since; I do not know the meaning of the word nailed; upon my oath I have not the least idea what it meant - I did not ask the prisoner what it meant; I never heard the word nailed before - I never walked about the place much; I should know that man - I had seen him several times; he would have rushed into our room - I did not assist the landlord in the rescue; I sat still and never said a word; the prosecutor ought to know the man very well - the officer told him he was wrong, but he said he was not wrong.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I come up out of the area? A. Yes, with this bundle; you threw it on the step of the adjoining house - I suppose you got two hundred yards from our house, but I was close to you.</p>

            . There was a cart coming up, and the prisoner had another lad with him, covering him with an apron - I am certain I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the gentleman's left-hand pocket, and put it into his trousers pocket - here is the letter L. on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010067"/>it; the gentleman looked round, but took no more notice - the prisoner ran down the yard, and I caught him about fifteen yards off; there was a great crowd about the gentleman - I had known the prisoner before, and had followed him down the Strand and Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What time of day was this? A. About half-past two o'clock; I was on the other side of the street, and could see plainly - the prisoner was in the service of his brother-in-law for some time, who is a coach-carver.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. How can you undertake to swear that no other person published these works? A.Because I am the proprietor of the copyright, and there are no other such works in existence - the printer's name was not on the sheets of paper; I can swear to the paper itself - I did not make it; it is possible another person may print this "Medical Adviser," but that they can copy these blocks and arrive to such a similarity, that I cannot see the difference, I cannot well imagine that; the prisoner never was left in management of my business - I never sold waste-paper, nor did any of my boys, by my permission: there is a cupboard in my room, in which there was waste-paper, but not such paper as this - I never gave the prisoner permission to sell waste-paper; I have sometimes got tipsy - I went home one night when his mother was there, but I did not tell her that he had no occasion to spend any of his money. as he might have waste-paper to sell; the fact is the cupboard was full of waste-paper for lighting the fire and making mattresses for other parcels, and recollecting that I had lessened my insurance, and this cupboard being so contiguous to the fire-place, I desired the boy to remove this waste-paper - he said, "Where shall I put it?" I said,"Where you like, but don't let it be there."</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 17th of November, at half-past five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our lodging; the watch hung by the window - he went away about seven; he called again about a quarter past two o'clock next day, and was not up stairs more than twenty minutes - the watch hung in the same place as before; while he was there my bell rang - I was obliged to go down to answer it; I was not absent more than five minutes - the prisoner passed me as I stood at the door, and said he was going to call on his uncle, who lived in Warwick-street, and would call again in the evening; he had said up stairs that he was going to Wakefield, that he had booked his place for Thursday, and would take anything down for us - my husband came from there; I missed the watch the instant I went up stairs - I went out to look for him, but could not see him; he did not come in the evening - I gave information at several station-houses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Had you been out of your room that day? A. Yes, once, but am certain the watch was there when I went to answer the bell.</p>

            . I live in Chapel-place, Brompton, with my father, who was door-keeper at the Italian opera-house, but is now out of employ; I am a shop-boy or light porter. On the 5th of October. I heard a noise at <placeName id="t18311201-126-crimeloc674">No. 14, Chapel-place</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know the prisoner? A. Only by sight; I never spoke to him -I went into his passage, seeing the neighbours there; I know the people were tormenting him night after night, but I had nothing to do with it - I made a noise with the quart pot: I knocked it against the opposite wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not been irritated by a gang of boys in this manner? A. He had been irritated the night previous - I did not intend to make a noise when I went, but seeing other people do so, I did so for my own amusement; they were all grown people there - some of them were tormenting him; six or eight people were there - I heard the Policeman say if any body made a noise outside he would take them, but if there was a noise inside he could not prevent it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not the Policeman tell them if they went inside they might make as much noise as they liked? A. It was something to that effect: he did say so - I believe the prisoner had been married the day previous; he had given the persons no provocation.</p>

On the 5th of October I was going to bed, about half-past ten o'clock; my father was at the door, and called me down - I saw a few people assembled outside No. 14, where the prisoner lives; he had been married the day before - I went, and mixed with them; the Policeman said the first that made a noise outside should be taken to the watch-house, but if there was any noise inside he could not prevent it, they might make what noise they liked - I went in; six or eight people were there - I had a tea-board, and there was a person with a bell; Miles had a pewter pot - they were all making a noise; the bell was put into my hand - I began ringing it; this continued three or four minutes - I then saw Pearson open his room door, and come out; he stabbed Miles in his right side, then came, and stabbed me in the left side<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010071"/>with a knife; I have seen the knife since - it went through my coat and waistcoat; I was taken to Dr. Anderson's, Brompton-road - he dressed the wound, and I was taken to St. George's-hospital; he stabbed us the instant he came out - he had no malice towards me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were ringing the bell three or four minutes? A. Yes - it was a little hand-bell; I heard no kettles - Weller and Driver were beating the teatray with their fists; the Policeman said we might go in and make what noise we liked - we made as much noise as we could, and no doubt irritated him very much.</p>

            . I live in Chapel-place, and am a paper-stainer. I went to the house to see Thompson, the landlord, but was not one of this party: I saw Miles and Allden there - the noise continued four or five minutes; the prisoner came out of his room with a knife in his hand - I saw him stab them both; I caught hold of Allden, unbuttoned his clothes, and put my hand on the wound - I took him to Dr. Anderson's, and then to the hospital; it was a pointed shoemaker's knife - the doctor said the wound was an inch and a half deep; the prisoner might be irritated - I have heard the boys in the street making a noise; he has insulted people as they passed his window, and children have made a noise - he has come out with a strap, and hurt a boy very much, which I believe caused it; there were grown up people there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Who were the grown up people? A. I knew Miles and Allden, but not the others; Mr. and Mrs. Driver were there - one of them had a tea-board; the prisoner lived in the front parlour, and this was done in the passage - it is a lodging-house.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Chapel-place; I heard a noise, and went to quiet them - when I got to No. 14, it was over; five or six people were standing in the street - some at their own doors, and some looking out of window; I inquired what the noise was about, and understood there had been a wedding - I stood there a moment or two; some person came out of No. 10 or 11 with something in his hand, and hit it - I went to tell them the very first who made a noise in the street I would take them to the watch-house - I saw Miles and Allden go into No. 14; a female said, "If the Policeman won't let us do it in the street, we can go inside;" the landlord was standing in the door-way of his apartment, and I believe I said the landlord was master of his own house - I believe I said they might go to their own apartments and make a noise; I was standing a little distance from the door, and heard somebody say Allden was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you not know the persons did not live in that house? A. Yes; if I told them to go in, and make as much noise as they liked, it is more than I recollect - I was on duty in the street, and should think the landlord master of his own house; if he had called me to prevent it, I should.</p>

               <p>SIR ROBERT GRAHAM, BART. I carry on business in Walbrook. On the 9th of November, about three o'clock, I was within two or three doors of the London coffee-house, on the footpath, at the time the Stationers' Company were passing: there were a great number of persons - I felt myself surrounded by several well dressed men, of whom I had no suspicion; they squeezed against me very closely for some time - I had left home about ten minutes, and had in a purse in my trousers pocket 9l. - my watch and seals were in my fob, and the chain concealed in my trousers; I had also a pocket-book of no value - my watch and appendages were gold, and worth about 36l.; as soon as I got relived from the pressure, I missed my watch and pocket-book; my purse was not taken - I thought the men who were close to me were larger than the prisoners; I saw them before the Magistrate next day, and my pocket-book was produced; the memorandums in it are my own writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. No doubt many persons were there innocently? A.Certainly; my pocketbook was in my left-hand trousers pocket - I tucked my chain and seals into my right hand trousers pocket; I did not see the prisoners - one person had very large whiskers, and another was a tall man.</p>
               <p>

             - I asked how he came by that letter; he then said, "I had the pocket-book given to me;" I asked who by - he described a person dressed as Lane; his description corresponded with the appearance of Lane, who was among the party when I took Smith; I put him into the Compter, went into Cheapside, and saw Lane standing by the pavement in a crowd - I told him he must come with me; he said, "What have I done?" I said I would tell him at the Compter - I took him there, and had Smith called up; I said."Is this the person who gave you the pocket-book?" he very reluctantly said, "I don't think he is the man," and hesitated several times; Lane said, "Do you say I gave it to you?" he said, "No, I don't say so;" I detained them both.</p>

I searched his waistcoat pocket, but not minutely; he was not out of my custody - I let go of him, but kept close to him; I knew him before, and he knew me - he is in the newspaper line.</p>

I was going up Ludgate-hill, and had not been there five minutes before the officer, who I well knew, took me; he searched all my pockets, and told me to go about my business - I walked from the coffee-house to the Old Bailey, and stood looking at the prison; if I had known of a robbery, I should have escaped; I picked the book up on Ludgate-hill, as a crowd was passing.</p>

            . I am a City-officer. A gentleman came to the corner of King-street, and gave me information; I went with another officer, and found the prosecutor holding the prisoner - we took hold of him; a great many persons were closed round the prosecutor; I had hard work to get up to him - I did not know the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to see the procession, and had the misfortune to be shoved into the crowd; the gentleman accused me of robbing him of his pin - I said,"Take me into a shop and search me," but he would not; I am not the man who robbed him - when a man is taken a crowd generally follows.</p>
               <p>MR. GADSDEN. He asked me in the middle of the crowd to search him; I am positive it was him who thrust his hand and took my pin.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Nichol. I saw the waggon come to the wharf; it had a hogshead and some small goods in it, which were put on the wharf, not in the warehouse; both the prisoners came with the waggon; I saw them lifting the bag of hops into the waggon, and asked them if it had fallen out of the waggon - they said Yes, it had; they were both in the waggon - I then told our foreman I thought it had not; he went to look at the direction - if there had been a bag of hops in the waggon when it came in I must have seen it; there was none - Westbrook threw it out; Poulden had run away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Which of them said it had fallen out? A. I cannot say which - some goods were still in the waggon; the hogshead was being taken out at the time - any body who went to the waggon must see them.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper. I took charge of Westbrook on the wharf - Patterson said he and another had put the hops into the waggon, and asked Westbrook why he did so; he said he did not know who they belonged to - that some person asked him to put them up, and he supposed they wanted him to give them a cast some distance; I asked who the person was, or where he was to take them - he said he did not know: I asked where he was going next - he said to another wharf; I did not then take him, but watched him, and in a quarter of an hour took him in charge; I saw Poulden join him at the corner of Brick-hill-lane - I went up, and took him to the watch-house, then went with Westbrook to deliver a cask at another wharf, and then took him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is common for one man to ask another for "a lift?" A. Yes - I have known him two years driving for Mr. Dale, a town-carman, who employs eight or ten men - he was about three quarters of an hour delivering goods; he might have escaped, after I took Poulden, if he chose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see any body but Poulden speak to him? A. No.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I was instantly pressed close, my arms thrown up, and at that instant, as soon as I could get my hand down, I found my watch was gone - I immediately seized the prisoner; he got from me, with the assistance of those who surrounded me; I tacked about, immediately pursued, and seized him as he went on the pavement - I held him, and called the Policeman, who secured him; my watch and chain were worth about 23l. - I have not found them.</p>

I considered that the procession had passed: there was no crowd whatever on the road where I was - the Lancers were a head: the men in armour,&amp;c., were at the foat of the bridge, not on it - it was quite still and quiet; I heard no shouting; I found the Lord Mayor had not arrived from Westminster - there was no rush of the crowd near me - the prisoner came and stopped me; I said, "What do you mean, are you an officer?" he said No, and then the others came round me - I do not believe there was any body off the pavement at the time - I looked at my watch in Stamford-street.</p>

               <p>Q. You were examined before the Magistrate, do you mean to say, that when the prisoner first ran against Mr. Nash, the road was not clear? A. The road was not filled; it was clear then except that the horses were close at the side - there was a space between the horses and footpath; the place Mr. Nash was in was clear, and then the prisoner ran against him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the Lancers wheel round at the time? A. One of them turned and made a plunge, as he spurred his horse.</p>

I went to Cranston's dwelling-house - Cranston was not at home; he was at his shop, which is about a hundred and fifty yards from his house - I went there, and saw Cranston in the counting-house at the shop; I asked if he had had some yarn brought there that morning - he said Yes, in the name of Thompson, and it was to be made up into points, or something of that kind, and it was so expressed in the note; I asked who Thompson was- he said he did not know, nor where he lived, but when it was done, he supposed he would come and fetch it away - I then said I had stopped that boy with some yarn that morning, and he had told me it came from Mr. Robertson's; I was then speaking of a boy who was in the shop at the time, similarly dressed to the boy I had stopped, and I thought it was him; Cranston then said he had spoken to Faulkner on Saturday night, and that the yarn came from Mr. Robertson's - Mr. Robertson, who was with me, then desired me to take Cranston and the boy into custody, and I did so; there was only the pad of new yarn in the counting-house - Cranston said the other pad was at his dwelling-house; we went, and found it there - I then took Cranston and the boy to the station-house, and went to Mr. Robertson's, where we found Faulkner getting his breakfast; Mr. Robertson questioned him whether he had sent any yarn away that morning - he said he had not sent any away, except two coils of rope, which went by a cart to some boat; Mr. Robertson said, "Here is a Policeman, who has stopped a boy with some yarn this morning, and he rather suspects it came from here;" he said he had not sent any thing away - I then asked if he had not sent any to Cranston's; he said No - I asked if he had made any arrangement or seen Cranston on Saturday evening; he said No, he had not seen him - I then left him with Mr. Robertson, and went away; I went to the station-house again, and found Faulkner there - Mr. Robertson came there soon after; I went with Cranston to Mr. Robertson's, and Mr. Robertson called all his men and boys down - Cranston said none of them had brought the yarn to him; Swansbury was the last boy that came down - Cranston looked at him, and said he was not the boy who brought it; I said he resembled the other boy, and they were so much alike that I could not swear which was the boy, nor can I now; it was a dark morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you (Anderson) the boy you took into the counting-house, in custody? A. I could not swear to the boy - I told the Magistrate so; I never said positively he was the boy - I could not see his features; the yarn was so much over his face - I spoke from his dress; I said, at Cranston's place, that he was the boy - that boy was in custody, I suppose, three or four hours; Swansbury had a hairy cap on, and a fustian jacket and trousers; the boy I met had the same; he was stooping at the time,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010075"/>but his hairy cap came through the yarn - I will not swear that the boy did not tell me that Faulkner had sent the yarn to be done for a Mr. Thompson; he might say so - this new yarn was laying just on the left-hand side at Cranston's counting-house, and the other in a back wash-house at his dwelling-house.</p>

Two; the first on the 21st of November, and the next on the Thursday following - it was on the second examination that Anderson was let go; Faulkner can write - when I went to Cranston's house I asked Mrs. Cranston for the note, which the boy had shown to the Policeman, and I believe she gave it into the Policeman's hands - the Policeman gave it into my hands; I did not know the hand-writing; Cranston does not spin yarn like this - he lives about a quarter of a mile from me; he said the boy, who took the yarn to him, worked for me, and he thought he could point him out -I took him there for that purpose.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mr. Robertson. On the morning in question some yarn was pointed out to me, and I took it, but I cannot swear whether it was Faulkner pointed it out to me - it was dark in the morning; I carried the yarn from Mr. Robertson's premises, but I cannot say who I received it from - Faulkner was there, but I cannot swear whether any one else was.</p>
               <p>Q.You know you were examined before a Magistrate; what you then said was taken down, and my Lord has it, mind what you are about; what did you do with the yarn? A. I took it to Cranston's house, as I was ordered by the foreman, to the best of my knowledge - there was a note on the yarn, and I suppose the foreman put it there; when I got to Cranston's I saw a man in his night-clothes, who took it in of me, but I cannot say who it was - I believe it was Cranston; I was stopped by the Policeman, as I went there; I showed him that note, and he let me go on- I was called with the other boys and men for Cranston to see me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you put down the yarn when the Policeman spoke to you? A. No, Sir; it was on my two shoulders - I did not look up in the officer's face; the note was in my pocket - my head was not through the yarn; it was dark in the morning - I gave the note to the person I saw at Cranston's, and then went to my work; I saw Anderson on the Monday - I do not know whether he is younger than I am; I had fustian trousers on that morning, and a baragan jacket - I do not know whether Anderson was pitted with the small-pox; there was no disguise about the person who took the yarn of me.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What is the difference between a baragan jacket and a fustian? A. It is thicker, but they are the same colour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did you say when you gave in the note? A. I told the man who took the yarn in, that I had been stopped by the Policeman, and I had shown him the note - I believe the man I saw was Cranston; I had never been there before - I saw Cranston the same morning; I had never seen him before - I knew the house he lived at, by the same party who gave me the yarn directing me there; I cannot swear who that party was, it was very dark - I have worked for Mr. Robertson three years; I thought by the voice the person who gave me this yarn was the foreman - I know what I carried was yarn, and that there were two bundles of it; the person who gave me the yarn told me to go up Limehouse-causeway, and then across Spread Eagle-street, and to take it to Cranston's house; it was the first job I had that morning - I cannot swear whether there was any more than one person present when I received the yarn; I cannot swear who it was gave it me.</p>
               <p>Faulkner's Defence. I never sent any thing out of the premises of Mr. Robertson in my life, unless it was by his orders; he can testify that himself.</p>

            . I am a Custom-house officer. On the morning of the 27th of October, about eleven o'clock, I was on board a Spanish vessel in the Union-tier, on the Thames, - a Spanish boy gave me information; I jumped into the lug boat, and went on board the brig John, which was about twenty yards off; about five minutes before I went on board, I had seen a person leave the John in the revenue boat - I do not know whether he saw me; as soon as I got on board the John, I saw Miller standing in the cabin, with his head out of the hatchway, and I smelt a smell of whiskey coming from the hold; I said to Miller,"What have you got in this craft?" he said spirits, which he was going to take to Dundee-wharf: I said,"You have been broaching these spirits" - he said he had not; I said, "I know you have" - I was preparing to slip down a small space between the casks, when the boy Ramage came from underneath; I went below, and saw a bladder, containing about three pints of whiskey: one of the casks appeared to have been recently spiled, and it was in tears; I took the bladder on the deck, and went into the cabin; my surveyor came on board - he sent for an officer, who took Miller.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you see Metcalfe's brother going along the river? A. I did; I inquired of him about the prosecutor, and he told me.</p>

I said, "You have a parcel belonging to a gentleman who you set down in Ratcliff-highway" - he said he had, and gave it me from under the seat where he himself was sitting - it was between the cushion and the hay, not inside the cab.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. In these permits, is the name of the ship mentioned? A.

               <p>COURT. Q.These permits related to the goods in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010082"/>possession of the East India Company? A. Yes, they relate to these teas, but the names on the permits are not what they asked for.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 24th of October, a little before six o'clock in the evening, I was at the Crispiana, in Golden-lane, looking for a person, whom I could not find, in the tap-room; I went to the back parlour, and knocked at the door - I found it fast, I went to the back part of the premises; I returned to the door, and knocked again - some one inside said, "Who is there?" I said Attfield; I then stood back; Crowder, the landlord, and another man came out of the room - I went in, and saw this clock on the table, and the prisoner standing near it; I said, "What is all this, does this clock belong to you?" he said No, but a man who came there, had taken it out of the cupboard for Charley Crowder to buy; I said, "I would take him into custody - he was shifting, and wanted to go out; I said I would search him," and I found at the bottom of his trousers two skeleton-keys - he said he had picked them up in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010083"/>Aldersgate-street; a lock was produced at the office, and I tried one of these keys to it, which turned the bolt of the lock, as well as its own key - Crowder shut the house up, ran away, and has not been heard of since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Then the landlord and another man ran away, and you took the prisoner, who said he knew nothing about the clock? A. Yes; a small skeleton-key will open a large lock, if it is the same length.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at lckenham, close to Ruislip. On the 4th of October, a friend said some suspicious characters were lurking about my premises, and he thought they wanted my poultry; about three o'clock in the morning my wife was awoke by the dog barking - I got out of bed, went to the window, and could see one person in my yard, going into my barn; I then saw another - I said, "Halloo! what do you want there?" they said, "We want to lay down here," and that they had come from Pinner; I said, "If you move a step I'll blow your brains out;" I put on my breeches; my wife went down and opened the door - I went out, and the two stood just inside the barn; I said, "How many of you are there?" he said, four - I sent for a constable, who came and took them in charge; it was the prisoners - there was another man outside, with a sack on his back; we found a knife on Gregory, which he claimed, and on the way to the cage he threw the knife away; my boy picked it up - I went to my barn, and close under where they stood, found this hatchet, and next morning the bill-knife, four skeleton-keys, and this glove, all close to where they stood; it was not in the barn over-night - the magistrate committed them as vagrants.</p>

I said not till I got home; (I got a friend to go to Castle-street, but he could find no such person;) he bid me good night, and in about ten minutes two Policemen charged me with robbing him.</p>

On the 1st of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoners came into my shop, and asked to see some black silk handkerchiefs for a gentleman: I showed them part of several pieces - they were about ten minutes in the shop, and left suddenly, without buying any thing, or saying a word; I immediately looked over my goods, and missed a piece, containing three handkerchiefs - I went out, and met them in Barbican; they had got thirty or forty yards, and were coming back - I desired them to come into my shop; they wanted to know what they had done - I took them into the shop and sent for an officer; before he came in, Collins took the handkerchiefs from his person, and threw them on the counter - they were some I had shown to them.</p>

My daughter, but nobody was there on this occasion; I am positive these very handkerchiefs were in my hand not four minutes before - I had no others of that description; it was Davis asked to see them - they were close together, and left together; I never left the counter - they both left together; Davis might have said they were too dear.</p>

I do not know whether the driver heard; they did not call loud - I did not call, for I was alarmed; I should think the driver might have seen her, but cannot be certain - the wheel went over her legs; she was near the footpath, but none of her person was on the footpath; we were on the right-hand side of the way - the cab was on its right side; she screamed out several times - the man drove on ten or a dozen yards, and then stopped; I cannot say whether he came back or not - Mrs. Easy was taken to the hospital, and died in about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She attempted to cross to the coaches, instead of calling one? A. Yes - she turned back to come on the pavement again; I cannot say whether the driver heard the gentlemen call; the cab itself made a noise going along - I did not see a gentleman in it; it was not a light night.</p>

            . I am carman to the prosecutor. On the 3rd of November I was taking the load of hay to London; I was coming up Windmill-hill, on the other side of Kilburn; I saw the prisoner, who said my master and he had dealt for that hay, and that hay he could have drawn where he liked, if he gave 50s. for it; I said my master had not said any thing to me about it - I then went on to the Black Lion, at Kilburn, where I generally stop - I set off again from there, and overtook the prisoner again near the Bell, at Kilburn; he called me, and said I was to go along with him and unload it; I said I did not know what to do, but if he had bought it I supposed he must take it, but not to bring me into any trouble; I went with him to Lincoln's Inn-fields, where I helped him to unload it - when I got home my master was very angry with me; I saw the prisoner the next day, and told him my master wanted to see him, if he pleased - he said he would go that night to my master's, but he never came - I saw him again the day following; he said he would come, and pay my master for it; I went home, and told my master - he desired me to go and fetch him; I went to him on the Sunday morning - he would not come, but he told me to tell my master to come to him; I told my master, who said he should not go; I went to the prisoner again on the Wednesday morning, and he gave me a sovereign to take to my master, and said he had no more then - I took it to my master, and he refused it.</p>
               <p>MR. TOMLINSON. I had not made any bargain with the prisoner about the sale of this hay, or any other - I knew him before; I had never authorized my servant to sell it- I would not have sold it for 50s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He told me that if the load of hay would do me any good at 50s. I might have it; that was the last word that passed between us the night before.</p>


               <p>S. TOMLINSON. No such word was ever mentioned; he never proposed to buy it - we were at work in our yard, and the prisoner was going by; he came into the yard, and said,"What do you ask a load for your black hay at Harrowweal" - I said 50s. at the rick; he said, "I can buy it cheaper of your salesman" - I said, "If he sells it under price, he shall never sell another load for me;" he then turned away - this hay was no part of that; I sent this hay to be sold at the market price.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This was a load of hay from the same rick.</p>
               <p>MR. TOMLINSON. It grew all on the same land, but was not all of one sort; we cut the rick in half, and half was saved, but the other half was damaged; the damaged hay we sold at 50s.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I received the prisoner in charge on the 24th of October; I asked how she came to rob her mistress - she said she did not know; she was a very ungrateful girl, and her mistress had been very kind to her, but she did it on purpose, and she said "Don't hurt my father, he is to meet me to night at Spitalfields church"- I took her to the office, and went back to the church, and from her description I took her father, but found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>HANNAH WEBB re-examined. Q. Had you employed her to pawn any property?" A. Yes, a week or two before - a pair of boots for 1s. 6d.; and on the 24th of October I went to the drawer to take out the duplicate, and missed it; I told her to go to the pawnbroker and get an affidavit of them - she went, returned, and said, they were quite safe, and if I wanted them, the pawnbroker would let me have them without an affidavit; I then gave her 1s. 6 1/2d., which was what they were in for - she went and brought them; while she was gone I missed another duplicate of some articles which were pledged for 5s. - I desired her to go and get an affidavit for them; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010087"/>to make my children's bed, and missed a blanket - I closed the door, and asked the prisoner what she had done with it; she said there never were but two - I said, "Yes, there were three, what have you done with it? if you have pawned it tell me the truth;" she then said her father came for sixpence and she had not got it - that he then asked for a slice of bread, and there was none out, and then she took the blanket and gave him the sixpence.</p>

The prisoner came to lodge with us on the 22nd of October, with her husband; they hired a furnished room, and left on the 14th of November: I went up to the room, and found it locked - I looked through the key-hole, and missed the chimney-ornaments; I then went in, and missed the blankets, sheet, and pillow, which were part of the bedding let to the prisoner with the room - the shirts I had to make for a gentleman, and gave them to her to mark; she and her husband went away together -I never authorized her to pawn any thing for me; they left a small box behind them, containing some implements for printing; I found the prisoner in Holborn the next day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the Monday morning I asked her to lend me a shilling - she said she had no money, but I might take four of the shirts, and pawn them for 7s., and if they were wanted, and I could not get them out she would help me - I did so, and took her a half-crown's-worth of halfpence, and she returned me 6d. of it. Witness. It is false - I never allowed her to pawn any thing, and she never brought me any thing as the produce of what she had pawned; she was constantly borrowing money of me.</p>

The articles stated were hanging in my shop to dry, on the 19th of November - the prisoner came in with two other boys; he asked one of them if he would have any oysters - the other said he did not care; I said, "What is it young man?" he said, "Let us have a pennyworth of oysters;" I opened one, and at that moment I heard the chairs rattle in my room - I said, "Who is in my house?" I then saw the prisoner run out with the things under his arm - I cried Stop thief! he ran round a corner; I ran to the corner, but returned, for fear any body should go into my house - two Police-officers were brought to me by my neighbours; they afterwards brought the property - these are the articles.</p>

I knew he had lost two pairs of shoes on the 12th of November, and in about an hour afterwards (about nine o'clock) I saw the three prisoners go to his shop, and look in at the window - McClew put his hand in at a pane of glass, which had been broken the same evening, by the persons who stole the other shoes; he took this one shoe out, and was in the act of taking another - I ran out, and took him and Denham; the other ran off, but was pursued and taken.</p>

I said, "Of a sovereign and two half-crowns;" she positively denied that she had a sovereign or any half-crowns in her possession; I said she should not go out till she was searched - the servant of the house and the master came into the room; the master sent for the Policeman, who opened the front of her gown - he found the two half-crowns inside her stays, and the sovereign in her left sleeve near the wrist; I had been drinking a little, but was quite collected.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw the prisoner in the watch-house afterwards? A. Yes; I did not then say that I knew him by his swivel eye; I said by the cast in his eye - there was a great rush of people about me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How long had you had him in hold? A. I suppose a minute; I had a full opportunity of viewing his face; there was a gas-lamp at the end of the passage, and a hair-dresser's-shop at the corner; I have no doubt of his person.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q.Were there many persons passing? A. There were men and boys passing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How many persons were in the street altogether? A. I cannot say, there might be ten or a dozen; it was darkish, but the lamps were lighted - the place was light enough for a person to see; I took hold of the prisoner, and no one else -I did not observe any thing of a cast in his eye; I heard Mr. Jones say something about his eye here, but I never heard him say so before; there were from twelve to twenty persons in the watch-house.</p>

            . I heard the cry of Stop thief! as I was entering St. Michael's-alley; a person in the crowd said,"That is him without a hat;" I followed the prisoner, overtook him at the end of Finch-lane, and secured him -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010095"/>I took him to the watch-house; his hat was brought in, and he said, "That is my hat;" there were several persons there - he was running from Cornhill towards Threadneedle-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He was taken to the watch-house? A. Yes - his hat was brought in, and he owned it; his observation to me was, "I am not the thief;" Mr. Jones was sitting in a chair in the watch-house - the prisoner said, "I am not the man," and Mr. Jones said, "I know you by your swivel eye," or some such observation - the prisoner said he had no cast in his eye, and he appealed to me; I said I had known him for some time, and there was a peculiarity in his eye-sight - there is a fulness about his eyes; they stand rather out - if you have ever seen a person of his description, I should think you would know him again; he was running fast - I had known him for some time.</p>

            . I am an agent for Scotch ale - I live in Cornwall-road, Stamford-street. I have known the prisoner five years; he owed me a little money. On Saturday week last, I met him in Gracechurch-street; I went across the road, and told him I thought he behaved in a very ungrateful manner - we had some angry words, and I told him if he did not pay me the money, or some part of it, I would give him in charge of an officer; I laid hold of him by his breast coat, and he walked with me as far as Bell-yard - he then put up his hand, knocked my hand off, and ran up Bell-yard; I followed him till he came to St. Michael's-alley - there was a crowd, who were hallooing Stop thief! or something of that kind; I saw the prisoner's hat fall from his head as he turned the corner.</p>

            . I live at No. 29, Laurel-street, Chelsea; I deal in building materials - I do not know the prisoner. On Saturday evening, the 26th of November, I was with Mr. Hill, a solicitor; we went through Bell-yard, into St. Michael's-alley - there are a great many little alleys and turnings there, and there were a great many people - it was quite light; as I went into St. Michael's-alley there was a crush of people, and I was pushed a little way forward towards the wide part - I heard a gentleman say, "I have lost my watch, Stop thief!" several persons at that time passed me - I seized one, who appeared to be the suspected party - I exclaimed, "Here he is! I have got him!" I was then struck several times - I was struck over the nose, and the man I had hold of got away; he had himself struck me, but I do not know whether he struck me on the nose - he got away from me, and I followed him as well as I could; I dare say a dozen persons at least followed with me - I had an opportunity by the light of the court of observing the man I caught hold of, and I noticed that he had a cross-eye; he looked with one eye towards his nose - his right eye was fixed towards his nose, it was a squint; the prisoner certainly is not the man I took hold of; when that man got from me he went the way I had come, through the narrow part of St. Michael's-alley, through Bell-yard, and into Gracechurch-street; I followed him to the corner, and there lost sight of him.</p>

            . I am a solicitor, and live at No. 119, Fore-street, Cripplegate. I was in company with Mr. Anderson; just as we were coming from the narrow part into the wide part of St. Michael's-alley, Mr. Jones, the prosecutor, called out that he had been robbed of his watch - several people passed at full speed; Mr. Jones followed a person who was running, and a porter in a white apron stopped him, opposite the George and Vulture door - a violent scuffle ensued, and the porter was knocked down; the man he had hold of broke loose, and Mr. Anderson caught at him with one hand - he broke from his hold; he caught him again, and held him nearly half a minute - a scuffle ensued, and several persons struck Mr. Anderson; among the rest the man he had hold of struck him, broke from him, and ran down Bellyard; he then eluded our pursuit round some coaches - we returned back the same way, and heard that a man had been taken in Cornhill, which was the contrary way to that which the man we saw had run - I had observed that that man squinted; he had a strong cast in his eye; there was a gas-lamp over his head, and he turned round under the gas-lamp - I had a full view of his face; the prisoner certainly is not the person.</p>

             BROOMHILL. I am beadle of Whitechapel. I was in the watch-house, and saw Peter Hall there, and Mr. Jones, the prosecutor - I remember Mr. Jones told the prisoner he knew him by his swivel eye - my attention was called to him from that circumstance; I looked at the prisoner's eyes, but I could not perceive it - the prisoner denied any knowledge of Mr. Jones' robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had you any thing to do with the apprehension of the prisoner? A. Yes; I took him in Finch-lane, about half-past five o'clock, on Saturday week; a great many persons were following him - I had no knowledge of him before; he had no hat on at the time - I do not recollect seeing any thing of Mr. Harris, Mr. Anderson, or Mr. Hill - I can only recognize Mr. Jones, the ticket-porter, and the street-keeper; the other persons might have been there, and I not see them - there was a rush of people; I saw the prisoner running; I crossed, and took him - he said, "What do you stop me for? I have lost my hat in pursuit of the person;" I did not see him go near any coaches; I do not know who brought the hat in.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. JONES. Q. Did you lose sight of the man after losing your watch? A. I never lost sight of him from the time he took the watch out of my pocket till I was pushed down, after the rescue, and after I had followed him the second time; he lost his hat between the time of the robbery and my losing sight of him in Bellyard - I only lost sight of him, because I could not run<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010096"/>so fast; I was a little agitated, but I should think not more than four or five minutes elapsed from the time I lost my watch till the prisoner was taken - I left my residence at five o'clock, the whole of it was over, and I went home by the six o'clock coach.</p>

On the afternoon of the 3rd of October I was in Gracechurch-street, and was surrounded by a number of persons, but I cannot swear to the prisoner at all; I had my watch attempted to be taken, and then I heard Mr. Nicholas say he had lost his watch; I was standing by Sheppard, and heard Toole say, "I know the man who has got the watch;" the officer then went into Bishopsgate-street, and about five yards beyond the London tavern there is a gateway; I there saw the officer take a person by the collar - I do not know who the person was, but I saw Toole put his hand into his pocket and take out a watch; there was then a cry on', and I heard some person say, "He is one of them;" Sheppard let the person go, and he walked off very deliberately - I was surprised that he should take hold of a person walking as he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were a little shy of them? A. Yes; I had not known Toole before - it appeared that he was edging off with the watch.</p>

            . I am a merchant, and live in Church-court, Clement's-lane, Lombard-street. On the afternoon of the 3rd of October I was at the corner of Gracechurch-street, and was surrounded by a number of persons - I lost my watch, and it was returned to me, by order of the Lord Mayor, by the street-keeper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did any thing remarkable occur before you missed your watch? A. No; there was a placard, and my watch was whipt away in a moment - there was nothing touching my hand or arms; no one held my arms.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What happened to you when the gang was about you? A Nothing, but when I got out of the crowd I missed my watch; I was hustled.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL SHEPPARD re-examined. I delivered up the watch - I said the prisoner was the man I had hold of, but I never saw the watch in his possession.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to THOMAS TOOLE. Q.Have you sworn to day what you swore before the Magistrate? A. Yes, as near as I know - I there stated that the prisoner was the man; I was not asked to swear positively - I was asked if he was the person, and I said Yes; I was not asked if I looked into his face - I did not say I looked full in his face; I am not an officer - when Sheppard went down to the office the officers told him who I was, which removed his doubts about me, and he said, "Why did you not tell me that?" I have been several times examined in a Court of Justice - I was examined this morning; I was examined once last Session - I will not swear that I was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010097"/>here the Session before that; I do not think I have been here twenty-five times - I think I first began to be a witness about five years ago, when my father and I had both been robbed; I have got about 2l., perhaps, within this last twelve months for my expences, about 6s. a Session; I never said to any one that I knew the whole set of them, and could pull them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say so to this gentleman? A. I said I knew a good many of the parties; I did not say I knew the whole of them - I said I had seen a great many of them in the City several times; I might have said that I knew the whole of them, and could bring them up - my reason for going back with the watch was, I was afraid of having a knock down, and the people said, "That is not the man, look after the man that has got the watch," and I saw several of the gang coming towards me.</p>
               <p>MR. BONSER. I saw Toole in the watch-house; he told me he knew the whole of them, and could bring them all up.</p>

            . I am the wife of James Saunders. On the morning of Saturday, the 12th of November, I observed the prisoner walking by the door several times, and while I was measuring some coals I saw him come out of a little room at the back of the shop; he went up to the counter, and asked for 1d. worth of apples - I went, and asked what he did in my room; he strongly denied it, and said he came in for 1d. worth of apples - I closed the door, and took hold of him - he gave me a blow on the face, got from me, and tried to get over the railings of the cellar; I seized him again - I sent one of my children for an officer; the watch had been under a glass in the room - I found it in the cellar, and I suppose while he was over the cellar he dropped it; this is it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did not the person you served the coals to jump over the rails? A. I did not see that - my attention was taken up with you; I suspected you might be acquainted - I thought he pushed by me to lay his cloth down, that I might not observe the prisoner - the prisoner was never out of my sight, nor a yard from me; his hand was cut with the glass of the watch.</p>

On the 5th of November I was in the first floor, and saw the three prisoners separately leave the passage of our house, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning; they were all strangers - the street door was left open; I immediately suspected they had been in the back parlour, where this caddy and cap were three minutes before - I came down, and they were gone; I followed the prisoners to the first turning, and there observed them looking at something - Tayler and White immediately turned up Goswell-street; Bray went up Wynyatt-street - I called Wright, who stopped her, and I saw her deliver him the caddy and cap.</p>

On the 19th of November I missed five watch-cases, which should have been in Taylor's hands, to be worked on in my shop; I asked Taylor, in Evans' presence, what had become of them - he told me they were not properly sprung, that the bowls were loose, and they were returned to Mr. Allen, from whom they had been received; I went to Allen, and not finding them, I returned - I told Taylor they were not at Allen's, and asked what had become of them; he then said he had given them to Evans to take home to his wife at dinner time, to instruct her to give them to Allen - Evans said he took them home, and was surprised his wife had not delivered them; I then went to Evans' house - they were not found there: I then had the prisoners taken into custody, and, in my presence, was found on Evans, two duplicates; I went to the pawnbroker's, and found one case, which I knew, and have since seen two others in the hands of Mr. Moss, which are mine; my wife also gave me two duplicates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Taylor is the person in whose custody they should be? A. Yes; he is my foreman - it was his duty to examine the eases: I send them back if not perfect - workmen do not take work home without permission at any time; I had seen them in Taylor's possession - he keeps them in a box in the shop, of which he has the key, and at night the boxes are put into the iron chest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROE. Q.Have you a large shop? A. No - I had only the prisoners at that time in my employ; Evans is a finisher of movements, and had nothing to do with cases; he has had work home to finish.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q.What are you? A.

            . I am a Policeman. King gave me information on the 29th of November, and I took the prisoner in bed with another man; he said he knew nothing about any stones - I asked if he had got any in a court, at the back of his house; he said, "No, I have no stones there;" I said, "Well, this boy says he saw you take some there;" he said, "Oh, they are my stones;" that he had bought them of one person and another - he could not exactly say who; I went with Mr. Howell, and brought the stones from the court to Newway watch-house; King pointed out where they were taken from - they are large flag-stones - we compared them with the place, and four exactly fitted the place; we found fourteen - after he gave me information I went to a court in the Almonry, and found some large flagstones; I watched, and the prisoner and another man came out of the house; King immediately said, "These are the two men;" they went towards the stones - I afterwards went and found them in bed, as I have stated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he go up to the stones? A. No, because he saw me - I am certain he faced and saw me; they were regular square stones - one in particular fitted in the joint; King at first charged the prisoner's brother with this.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the prisoner claim the stones, and say he had bought them? A. Yes; I told him there were fourteen; he said he had bought them all - no stone would fit, unless it was the size of the one taken up -King pointed out a small stone to me, which fitted exactly.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL JOHNSTON. I live in Addle-street. On the 20th of September the prisoner came to my house, and said he wanted a piece of black cloth, and black kerseymere for a cash customer of his westward; I sent them by a porter - the prisoner and I met the porter at Dimsdale's, St. Ann's, chop-house; the goods were delivered to him, in my presence: we dismissed the porter there, and the prisoner took the goods out under his arm - he did not tell me where they were going, but said it was a cash customer in that neighbourhood; he said he was going to sell them for cash to a customer of his; he came back with the goods, and said he had failed in selling them; he proposed as we had dismissed the porter, that he should leave them at Dimsdale's all night - I agreed; I saw him two or three days after, and proposed sending for them - he said I was not known at the house, and they would not deliver them to me; I saw him again in a few days, and said they ought to be sent for - he said he would send for them; I saw him again in a day or two - he told me he had sent Cleasby for them with a written order; on seeing him again, he said he had sent Cleasby with a note for them, but they refused to deliver them, not knowing his hand-writing - I called at Dimdale's the next day but one; I saw the prisoner in the City afterwards, and told him he had told me a falsehood, for Dimsdale had told me they had been gone this ten days or a fortnight, and that he, Sykes, had taken them away - he said I was mistaken, that he had taken them from Dimsdale's, and left them with Burrows, a tailor, for cash: I inquired who Burrows was - he said he was an intimate friend and companion of

            's, who I knew; I said, "If so he must be a highly respectable man" - I saw him again in a day or two afterwards, and urged the necessity of his calling on Burrows, for the cash or telling me where he lived, that I might call myself, and get it - he said Burrows was gone over to Boulogne on an excursion with Mr. Thompson, and would not be back for a week; I at last called at Thompson's, and when I met the prisoner again, I told him Mr. Thompson's man did not seem to know Burrows - he said that was all nonsense,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010104"/>that the foreman did not know all Mr. Thompson's acquaintances; he told me afterwards that Thompson and Burrows had returned, and he would go for the money - he came back, and told me they had slept but one night in town, and had gone out on a shooting party; I at last gave him into custody - I was to have had the money immediately after the 20th of September, but for his representations; Cleasby was taken up by me on another charge, and in his possession was found a duplicate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he returned and said he had not met with the cash customers, why did you not have the goods back? A. He proposed that they should be left at the house, and we should send the porter for them next day, as he was gone; I conceived he was then bound to send them home - if he had sold them for cash the next day, I should not have found any fault.</p>
               <p>Q. You would have given him credit for them if he had sold them? A. No; he was my agent only - he was bound to sell only in my name, and with my invoice; that was our general agreement - he never sold on his own account, to my knowledge; I did not furnish him with an invoice, because I expected the goods back - if he had met with a customer he was to make out an invoice in my name, and give a receipt in my name, as my agent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you keep a warehouse in Addle-street? A. It is a warehouse for me and others; a general deposit for two or three different people - Wilkinson keeps the warehouse; I have been there about six months - I took the benefit of the Insolvent Act about eighteen months ago; I seldom have so little as 50l. worth of goods at the warehouse - I dare say I have that amount now, but will not swear it, as I have been so engaged in this business; the prisoner was in my employ- his employment ceased when I discovered this; it commenced about the 10th or 12th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not some dissolution of a connexion between you before? A. I trusted him with some small commissions, and gave him credit for some small sums; I never employed him to pawn goods for me, or to get them pawned - there was a written agreement between us when I dismissed him, which was about the 8th or 10th of November; and after I made a charge against him at Worship-street, I destroyed that agreement, because I dismissed him; he had lost my confidence, and I tore it up in his presence - the charge at Worship-street was about two other cloths; I think that was on the 2nd of November -(looking at three papers) these are my hand-writing; I believe this invoice is all my writing, except the signature of Sykes - here is my own signature; the prisoner came to Worship-street of his own accord one day, and I agreed to let him go, on the 2nd of November, without bail, and he was to come on the Monday - he came again in the meantime, and was detained on another charge; he came one day when I did not attend; I had told him I would not, in consequence of promises - I preferred this charge at the Mansion-house, on the 24th of November, I think; I had my suspicions about this cloth when at Worship-street, but had not seen Thompson himself - I knew a duplicate had been found on the 5th of November, but did not know it was for my cloth; I received the duplicate from Cleasby, about the 8th or 9th of November - 9l. 10s. had been obtained on the cloth: the prisoner was not present when I received the duplicate - I got a duplicate for 10l. from Sykes, about the 8th of November; it was after I had got the first from Cleasby, and after he was at Worship-street- it is dated the 29th of October; I had both these duplicates when I agreed not to appear at Worship-street - I got the one dated in October after he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not get that ticket from him the very morning of the day you was to appear against him? A. No, I am certain I did not get it till after I was to appear against him at Worship-street; I will not swear it was not on the same day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who did you receive it from? A.From the prisoner, about the 8th; I did not prefer this charge till the 24th - I had seen him several times between the 8th and 24th, and never took any steps.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you not receive from him, 4l. in money? A. I did after his discharge - I mean after the time I had appeared against him; I received it on the 3rd or 4th; he was discharged on the 7th: I advanced him 10s. 6d. when he was discharged - I do not know that it was to pay his fees; I knew my cloth was gone, but I had not seen Thompson to ascertain if he knew Burrows.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. About the 4th of November, 1830, I was returning from Stamford-hill, and saw the prisoner in the high road, going to London, with master's cart; I got up in the cart - there were two bundles of paper in it - he went to Old-street-road, and left the paper at Riley's house; the prisoner gave me 6d. - he had before that spoken to me respecting some paper which I saw him take; he held up his finger, and said, "Never you say a word, or you will ruin me and my family;" that was one day when we took some paper - that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. A word about what? A. About some paper that was in the cart, I suppose; he took some six or seven times - I do not know when he said that; it was some time before, when we were taking paper there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in your master's service? A.Three years next May; I do not know where this paper came from - the first time I saw it was at the top of my master's lane; I had before been with him when he took paper - I did not mention this to my master till after the prisoner was in trouble.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in Old-street. Shortly before Christmas, 1830, the prisoner brought some printed paper to me, in Mr. Smallfield's cart, which I bought of him; it was, I think, between 30 lbs. and 40 lbs. - I sold that paper, with others, to Faulkner, Mr. Wilson's man; the prisoner did not make any representation to me - it was in two bundles, and I paid him 3d. per 1b. for it; I sold some of the best at 4 1/2d. per 1b., and used the inferior part at my own place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what hour of the day was this? A. He generally came between ten and one o'clock- I saw his master's name on the cart, and he brought it openly into the shop.</p>

             - he lives in Upper Thames-street, and deals in waste-paper. I bought some paper of Mr. Riley the latter end of March, or the beginning of April; I took it home to my master's - I remember Mr. Smallfield coming and seeing the same paper which I got from Riley - this is it; I am sure it is part of what I bought of Mr. Riley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What is your master? A. A rag and waste-paper dealer; we buy a great deal from various quarters - we frequently buy volumes of booksellers; I took this home, and it remained there six or seven weeks; I took other paper with this, but of a different size - this is of a particular size; I think this paper remained at my master's from March to October; there is another man who weighs the paper, and stows it away in piles.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you quite sure this is some of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010106"/>the paper you got from Mr. Riley's? A. I am quite confident of it.</p>
               <p>MR. SMALLFIELD. I have no hesitation in saying that this is the property of the Rev. Mr. Aspland, intrusted to my care - I never authorized the prisoner to sell it; it is gathered into volumes - these are half volumes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Can you possibly identify this paper as coming out of your possession? A.Certainly; I have the work in this state for sale, and send it in this state to different booksellers, when I have orders for it - there is a running account between me and the prisoner - I cannot state the balance, but there was never any running of the paper sold by him; he always brought me the money for that; the account was only 1s. a we he requested me to keep for him against his - I do not often send out copies of books which are out of point, not oftener than once in two or three years; I have not taken stock of some of my articles for three or four years, but I think I have of this work.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever give him permission to sell Mr. Aspland's hymns? A. No, never.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever give him liberty to take paper and sell it without showing it to you? A. Never- this had not been considered as waste-paper; this had been in my possession ever since the prisoner has been with me; it is not much in demand, as there are two cheaper editons - this had lain by, and I was less likely to have my attention called to it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 23rd of October I saw the prisoner in the Strand, showing some new knives to another boy, and having seen him before in bad company, I took him; he said his father made the knives, and sent him out to sell them - he begged hard of me to go to his father with him, to convince me that what he said was true; I went with him, and as soon as he got to the house he ran up stairs as fast as he could - I heard him say, "Mother - knives - say you gave them to me;" I went up, and he then said he found them in Covent-garden-market - I took him to the watch-house, and found these seven knives on him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do you swear to them by the maker's name? A. I gave an express order to a man to make these particular knives for me, and they have the stamp on them - I swear they had not been sold.</p>

On the 25th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010109"/>November, I saw the prisoner on the square side, with these loaves under his arm; when he saw me he ran fast -I went and took him, and asked where he got the bread; he said, "Where did I get it?" as I was taking him along, he threw the loaves into a basket at the corner of Orchard-street, and said, "What is a fellow to do?" he said he had had nothing to eat for two days - he had not a farthing on him, and was nearly naked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the greatest distress, and seeing the basket, I took them; I should not have taken three, but they were stuck together.</p>

On the 21st of October I had a sovereign, which was a part of my pension-money; I went to the public-house where I lodge- I was quite capable of taking care of myself; the two prisoners were sitting by me - I took my sovereign out of my pocket; it was in the corner of my handkerchief - I was going to get it changed; Alberdine took it from me - she gave it to Upchurch, and he went away immediately - Alberdine staid a little time, and I argued with her about the money; they had been sitting by my side, but I took no notice of them - I had not known them before; I did not follow Upchurch, because I had a bad leg - I cried out, and threatened Alberdine; I have never seen the sovereign since.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FARLEY. I am a labourer, and a pensioner. I was at the public-house where I lodge - I saw Upchurch, and three of his comrades with him; he went out for half an hour, and then returned with a shilling - the prosecutor was drinking there, and Upchurch said, "I will show as much money as you;" the prosecutor said, "If you will show a shilling, I will show a sovereign" - the prosecutor then showed the sovereign from his handkerchief; Alberdine took it and gave it to Upchurch, who started with it- I ran to the bar; the landlord was not at home - I told his daughter; she said, "What can I do? I can't stop him"- Alberdine then got up to go out; the prosecutor held her for a minute or two, but she got away; they were taken the next morning.</p>
               <p>Upchurch. Q. Why did not you accuse me of it? A. I did, and tried to stop you; I had heard you say in the morning where you lodged, and I gave information.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. I believe this was a smoking-club? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.This was a club? A. Yes; there were thirty or forty persons in the room - it was the time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010110"/>to break up; there were some before and some behind us; I was not exactly close to my brother - I cannot say whether there were any other persons exactly on the stairs besides him and the three prisoners; I was behind my brother- there was no one between him and me; I saw him hustled from the top of the stairs to the bottom - some persons might have gone before me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had you been acquainted with the prisoners before? A.

            . On the 12th of November I was in Regent-street, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening- I did not feel any thing taken, but I heard a noise; I turned, and saw the two prisoners laying down on the ground near me; the officer had knocked them down, and had my handkerchief in his hand.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOBBS. I was on duty in Regent-street; I saw the two prisoners and another person with them - I had watched them, and seen them attempting several gentlemen's pockets; I said to my brother officer, "We will follow;" they attempted the prosecutor's pocket several times - Stewart took the handkerchief quite out; the other two were behind him, trying to hide him - I run them all up, knocked them all down, and fell upon them; I secured the two prisoners, and got the cap of the third one, but he escaped.</p>
               <p>Jefferson's Defence. It is false; I never was in Stewart's company till we were taken.</p>

I took the prisoner on the 17th of November, on account of her having sold my wife a duplicate; while we were at the office the prosecutor came, and claimed the apron, and afterwards the shoes which the prisoner wore: she at first denied that the apron was the prosecutrix's, but when she claimed the shoes she said she had lent them to her.</p>

             I am an officer. The witnesses sent for me, and gave the prisoner into custody; he had a new jacket on, which he said he bought in Golden-lane, and he said that he had bought a pair of trousers which he gave to another boy, and the rest of the money he had spent in a coffee shop - he said he might as well take his sisters money as any body's; he has been dreadfully neglected: the two young woman bear good characters, and one of them left her place, at Mr. Baker's, to attend to the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer. I met the prisoner on Eyre-street-hill on the 25th of November; I passed him, looked back, and saw the caddy under his arm, and an old waistcoat round it; I followed him to Leather-lane, and asked where he brought it from - he said from his mother's, at Islington; he could not tell me where she bought it, nor what was given for it; I took him to the station - he then said he would tell the truth, that it was given him by a boy at the corner of a street in Islington.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

The prisoner came this day fortnight to purchase a waistcoat, and I showed him several - he came again on the 2nd of December with a young man; they asked for waistcoats, and I gave each one to try on - my daughter was in the shop; I went out, and when I returned she said to me, "Mother, they have put something into their hats;" I said, "Young men, if you are honest, you will pull off your hats;" the other one ran away, but the prisoner was detained - when the Policeman came he threw down his hat in the shop, and in it was this waistcoat - I believe the other man took one, but I would not swear it.</p>

I have lost my shoe;" she came running towards me; I had a lamp in front of me - I turned the light on, and saw one of her hands grasped; I caught at it, and, to the best of my belief, I heard three sovereigns fall - I then searched her, and found two half-crowns and three sixpences in her bosom; I searched the place and so did others, but we found no sovereigns; the prosecutor said,"That is the girl that robbed me of five sovereigns, two half-crowns, and three sixpences."</p>

               <p>- DEVERELL. I was attorney for the defendant in this action; he is the prosecutor to-day - I attended a Judge of the Court of King's Bench, upon the delivery of the second particulars of demand - the agent to the plaintiff's attorney also attended; I said the general item as to the balance must be struck out, unless the account was furnished, to which the Judge agreed; they delivered no account at any time, but a third bill of particulars was delivered with that item struck out. On the 15th of June Mr. Justice James Parke made a rule to strike out that item.</p>

            , ESQ. I am the prosecutor of this indictment, and am the grandson of the late Sir George Vandepant; I spent the early part of my life in the East Indies, till 1806 - I then returned to England,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010117"/>and married a lady in Yorkshire; I went with her to India, and came back in 1813 - I resided at a place called Skelton, in Yorkshire, up to March, 1830, being absent occasionally. I first saw the defendant about thirteen years ago; I saw him as any other person about my house - he then lived at Rawcliffe, a village near me; I was arrested at his suit for an alleged debt of 130l. in 1829 - that was settled; he afterwards commenced a suit for 500l.; I put in bail to that, without being arrested - I never had any business transaction with him, and never purchased any thing of him; I swear that positively - I remember in 1824 his acting as agent to his mother, who kept a little farm near my residence; I purchased 5l. or 6l. worth of straw of her that year, and he acted as her agent - I had no other dealings whatever with him; I paid for that straw.</p>
               <p>Q. I need hardly ask you, whether up to this instant you ever owed him for goods sold or delivered, or for any thing, the sum of 500l? A. I never did, I swear so most positively; I am living on my fortune, the result of my service in India.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Do not you know that the defendant has a farm, for which he pays 200l. a year rent? A. He had nothing to do with the farm - it was his mother's; she is now dead: the defendant is a member of the yeomanry corps of the County, which is commanded by Lord Grantham; I have heard he was an overseer of the poor - the action for 130l. was settled before the declaration was filed; I paid the costs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a receipt in full, demanded of the defendant, before the money was paid, and did not he refuse to give it? A. Not before the money was paid; I only know that from what I learned from those who were engaged in the business - I instructed my attorney to demand a receipt in full, but never got it; I had paid him money before the 130l. in 1825 and 1826, under circumstances of threats; I paid him various sums - I paid him 200l. at Aberford, in 1825.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to meet him on the 7th of November, 1824, at a place, not at your house? A. I did on the road to York, in a field - I had a person with me; I was walking - I had not been sitting down at all; the person with me was the defendant's brother - he is now living: I have not brought him here - I did not request the defendant to call at my house the next day; my brother-in-law went to him with that request, in consequence of the representation I made to him - my brother-in-law is not here: I saw the defendant at my house on the afternoon of that day - nobody was present at the interview, not even my brother-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not request the defendant, for God's sake, not to repeat to any body what he had seen the day before, but to keep it secret? A. I did not, on my oath - I positively swear I did not tell him I must make him a friend, and if he would keep it secret I would introduce him among gentlemen in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you to swear you did not at that time solicit him to keep a secret for you? A. He obtained money from me - from the nature of his threats, I paid him money; I did not solicit him to keep a secret - nothing was said to him about keeping a secret; I swear that positively: there was a Bible in the room, and it might be on the table - there were very likely other books there, for the conversation was in my study.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not at that time ask him to swear on the Bible that he would keep the secret? A. When he had received the money - he had received the money - I do not recollect whether it was before he had received it, that I asked him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he swear on the Bible? A. He might have done so - Yes, he did; he swore he would not mention any thing which, of course, would have affected my character.</p>
               <p>Q. Any thing he had seen the day before? A. Any thing he might devise for money; he swore he would not make any more demands for money; this was in November, 1824 - my brother-in-law, Mr. Thompson, was in the neighbourhood at the time; the prisoner was there a very short time - I did not ask him to take some wine: he might be treated hospitably, as any other person, by my servants; he was not treated with cake and wine - he lived about three-quarters of a mile off; I did not put any thing into his pocket - I put the money into his hand - I keep a butler, footman, and other servants.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to leave home at that time for a few months? A. I was going a journey; I went to Scarborough, with a niece who was ill - I was there about two months; I returned home for a few days - my niece asked me to accompany her to the South, and I went; on my return home, I stopped at the

            , Aberford, a few miles from my house - it is the principal inn; my lady and niece were with me - I did not send for the prisoner to come there to me; I waited for him - I found him there; I had not sent him word that I was coming home - I was not in correspondence with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not come there in consequence of an invitation - no matter how it was conveyed? A. Yes - I saw him in the principal sitting-room; my niece was walking in the garden; my wife was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not there, in the presence of your wife, request him to take an oath that he would still keep the secret? A. I made no request - he did take an oath; the Bible might be in one corner of the room, or probably it was on the table: I did not promise to give him 250l., and promise a further payment of 500l. to him - I did not prosecute him for extorting the money in 1824; I had a little boy named Cooper in my service, he is the son of a poor woman in the neighbourhood: he lived with me about seven years, and left to better his situation; my wife is here. On my oath, I did not request the prisoner, that if he should arrest me for 500l., to say that it was for goods sold and delivered; I did not see him, and never said a word on the subject to him, nor has any body by my authority - I have not seen him to speak to him for three years and a half.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. In what state of health is your brother-in-law, Mr. Thompson, at this instant? A. In a most wretched state of health - he generally has very bad health; I do not think he could attend here without considerable risk to himself in a case like this: this is the receipt for the 130l. - (read)</p>
               <p>King's Bench, Hague against Drury - Received on the 9th of November, 1829, of the above-named defendant, by payment of Mr. Russel, 140l., in discharge of the debt in this action, brought to recover the balance of a promissory note, drawn by the defendant for 250l.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on your oath, had you ever given that man any promissory note whatever? A. No - before the receipt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010118"/>was given, a demand was made on the defendant to give up the promissory note, if he had one; I never received one.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been asked if you implored the defendant never to mention what he had seen - had you done anything that you was afraid of being seen or told of? A.Certainly not, he had no secret to keep if he told the truth; I gave him the money because I dreaded even the name of what he threatened, which was to charge me with an unnatural crime with his (Hague's,) own brother; there is not the shadow of a foundation for such a charge; I did not prosecute him, as I acted entirely from beginning to end under the advice of a solicitor in the country; (looking at two letters) these were received by Mrs. Drury; I know sufficient of the defendant's hand-writing to swear they are his - these other two are also his. - (read.)</p>
               <p>York, 2nd of June, 1829.</p>
               <p>To MR. DRURY. - The time has now elapsed) which will render all further correspondence in private; between you and me, unnecessary; you will find by the enclosed, its meaning - I have been this morning to Mr. Preston, to prevent all unpleasant consequences, but he has given me a determined refusal; I have asked, at your hands only, a favor, which I care not if all your family were witness to - I have no clandestine secret in view, but what I care not if all the world knew; I am sorry it comes to pass under your present family affliction, but I must take care of myself - I shall expect a personal interview to-morrow; coming to your house, under present circumstances, I do not wish, unless compelled to do so. THOMAS HAGUE.</p>
               <p>Q. What family affliction were you enduring at that time? A. My niece, whom we had taken to the South, had died; we had numerous afflictions, and some deaths in the family - (the following letter was here read.)</p>
               <p>2nd of February, 1830.</p>
               <p>To MRS. DRURY. - Honored Madam - It is with the utmost reluctance I again address you, particularly when I think of the handsome manner your generous conduct has been to me; I have this moment received a letter from a corn-factor at Leeds, remitting me 30l. instead of 50l., and our rent day being next Thursday, I have no means of raising the amount without assistance: it will greatly oblige me, if Mrs. Drury will add another obligation to those already conferred by the sum of 12l., on or before Saturday, at the post-office, York, till called for; to see you is impossible, for I cannot ask for it personally, after what has transpired.</p>
               <p>MR. DRURY. Mrs. Drury has been subpoenaed here to day on the part of the defendant, and is in attendance; with the exception of 5l. or 6l. which I paid the prisoner for his mother's straw, I never paid him any other money, except under threats; he obtained 120l. at my house, and gave a promissory note for the re-payment - I came here last Session, prepared to prosecute this indictment; the defendant, from first to last, has had some thousands from me under threats.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q.Where is the 120l. note of hand which he gave? A. It is mislaid; it was given three years and a half or four years ago; the letter written to my wife was not in answer to one written by her to him, by my desire - I was out; I am a native of Suffolk, but have lived in Yorkshire from 1813.</p>
               <p>MR. DEVERELL. I am attorney for the prosecution, in the case of Hague against Drury, on which the affidavit in question arose; I was not attorney in the first cause - I did not know Mr. Drury then; the cause in question stood for trial at the last Lent Assizes at York - here is a letter, dated the 17th of July, 1831, which has been proved to be the prisoner's hand-writing; it is dated on the Sunday previous to the day on which the cause was to come on - (read.)</p>
               <p>To HENRY THOMPSON, ESQ. - Sir, - I have this moment received a note from Mr. Anderson, requesting me to send him the letters I have in my possession, from Mr. and Mrs. Drury, to be at his office this evening at six o'clock; I think you know so much of this business, it is possible to satisfy both parties; without it coming into Court - if you will honour me with an interview before six o'clock this afternoon. I can give plenty of written demonstration to satisfy both parties; an answer by your servant will oblige.

               <p>WILLIAM HILL. I entered Mr. Drury's service, as butler, in April. 1819. It was my business to purchase the goods used on the farm, and in the house; the defendant's mother held a small farm under Lord Grantham - she has been dead about twelve months; the defendant and his brother attended to her business; in 1824, 5l. or 6l. worth of straw was bought off their farm; I always understood it had been paid for - I took the mother some money, and

             came to offer the straw in part payment of 25l. which had been lent to him; nothing else has ever been purchased of Hague for my master - the defendant had no appearance of being worth money; he had two brothers and two sisters, and what the mother left, was between them - she had nothing but the farm, and a little property left by Mr. Ratey.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you recollect one night in November, 1824, the defendant calling when Mr. Thompson was there? A. He frequently called in an abusive manner; I and the other servants were about- I do not recollect Mr. Thompson ever going and fetching him back; I have occasionally carried letters to the defendant to the gate - when he has come with letters or messages, I have brought him out the answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not meet him when you were in a gig, and tell him Mrs. Drury wanted to see him? A. No, I met him once; he had borrowed some money of master, and I went to ask when he was going to pay it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010119"/>RICHARD LAWRENCE. I am in Mr. Drury's service, and have been so about thirteen years; I have known the prisoner about that time - I remember 5l. or 6l. worth of straw being bought once at the farm; nothing else was ever bought of him for our house.</p>

            . I keep a public-house, at Clifton, near York, about a mile and a half from the defendant - he has frequented my house for fifteen or twenty years; he was not able to pay his way - I have applied to him for payment of a score, which was never more than 2l., time after time; he once paid me 11s., which had been running eleven years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you ever hear that he had had thousands from the prosecutor? A. If he had one would have supposed he might have cleared a pound off his score, if he had been an honest man - he used to pay me by a little corn at a time.</p>
               <p>An affidavit made on the part of the defendant to put off the trial last Session, on account of the absence of Mr. Russell, was here read, and Mr. Alley admitted that Mr. Russell was now in attendance.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY addressed the Court and Jury on the part of the defendant.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q.When are you paid your wages? A. At uncertain times; I had then been at work for Mrs. Lewis, North-bank - I had taken 24s.; I was not very drunk: when I get a little liquor it takes my head, and I have been desired by publicans to stay away from their houses; I had another pint of porter at Maida-hill, and one at the Portman Arms, in the afternoon - I had had no ale nor spirits that day, and I had one pint at the Champion; I carried my silver in my coat pocket, because both my trousers pockets were torn - I went in behind the door of the Champion; I did not see any one but the prisoner - he sat between two women in a box in a corner; there might be other persons in the room; I sat by myself - there was no one in the next box- I did not want any man in the room to fight, that I will swear; I was not exactly asleep - I should have been asleep if I had not been disturbed; the prisoner's hand was in my pocket, and I caught hold of it - he twisted it from me, and went back to his seat; I told him I would serve him out - I went out in a moment for the Policeman; I do not know how many persons were there - there were several persons in the room when the Policeman came; I was very much agitated - I sent an Irish labourer for a Policeman; he was a stranger to me - I gave him a shilling yesterday morning - the prisoner did not attempt to run away, but staid in the room between the two women - I have charged several persons with robbing me; I never took any body up - I have been robbed there before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many persons were in the room when you went out for an officer? A. I did not take any notice - the prisoner and the women were there; there might be other men.</p>

            . I am waiter to Mr. Lawrence. I saw the prisoner in my master's coffee-room - he had a glass of ale, and then asked me to give him another - I left the room to do so; there were some silver spoons on the centre table of the room - when I returned with the ale I picked up two spoons at the door; the prisoner was then just gone out, and my master after him - I took the two spoons to the table, and found that one was then missing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure there were no forks among them? A. Not among the spoons; there were at another part of the table - he did not appear intoxicated.</p>

               <p>MR. LAWRENCE. I saw the prisoner stopped, without losing sight of him; the third spoon has not been found - these are the two.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going out, but finding I had left my gloves upon the table I went back, and called for another glass of ale; finding I had had enough before I went out without it - I made a stumble, and pushed the spoons from the table on the floor.</p>

Mr. Powell, the solicitor of the Mint, said they would attend to it, but I heard no more of them, and I was forced to go before the Grand Jury - I there saw Mr. Powell and Mr. Field, who said the Mint did not think it worth their while to prosecute unless there was a second uttering.</p>
