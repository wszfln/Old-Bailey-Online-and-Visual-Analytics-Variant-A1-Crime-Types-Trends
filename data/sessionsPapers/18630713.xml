                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Bradfield, and reside at 14, Westmorland-place, City-road—I know the prisoner, and knew his wife Hannah Webb—I knew them between six and seven years—they had been married about five years—he is a cow keeper at 3, Cross-street, Hoxton—I lived at No. 14, not far from them—I last saw the deceased alive on Whit-Monday night, at twenty minutes past 1 at her own street-door—I had seen her at 9 o'clock that evening—the prisoner was not then present—she was perfectly sober at that time, and also when I saw her at half-past 1—at that time the prisoner was sitting in his kitchen with his head lying on the table—that is about six or seven yards from the street-door—I could see from the street-door into the kitchen, but I could not see him, because he was near the fire-place—the street-door was open, and the kitchen-door also—I don't think that anything said at the street-door could be heard in the kitchen—the deceased wished me to go into the kitchen, and I went to the door and saw the prisoner with his head on the table—I went back to her and had a little talk about her sister, she then wished me good night and closed the street-door, and I went home—I never saw her after that alive—I had seen her about half-past 11 that night, and she then showed me her apron where a woman had thrown a pot of beer over her—the prisoner was not present then—he keeps a milk shop—I heard the prisoner say that he would strangle his wife—that was at the street-door—a woman named Robinson came and put an empty beer pot in her face, Mrs. Webb shut the street-door, and Mrs. Robinson said, "Is the drunken b—sober now?"—the prisoner said something, but I did not hear what—I have been given to understand that he was acquainted with that woman, but I don't know it—they stood a. little at the street-door—the woman then left, and the prisoner pushed his door open, went in and shut it—I went and listened at the street-door, and I heard him say, "Kiss me, Hannah"—she replied, "No, James"—I heard a scuffle in the shop—I looked through the key-hole—I could not see them, and I went and looked between the gates into the yard close by the street-door, and saw him have her partly by the head or shoulders, dragging her into the yard—he was pulling her out down two steps into the shed, and she said, "Don't, James; don't James;" in rather a faint voice—he said, "Come along"—I then knocked violently at the street-door, and all</p>

I am a physician, and a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, 163, City-road—I was called to see the body of the deceased on Whit Tuesday, about ten minutes to 7—the boy James came for me, accompanied by a man—I went immediately—I found her lying on the bed on her right side, in her day clothes—the prisoner was not in the room at that time—I thought that only one person had been lying in the bed, I judged so from the pillows not having been disturbed, but I did not take very particular notice—she appeared to have been dead between five and six hours—I removed the clothes and made an external examination of the body—I found six bruises on the right forearm, one slight one on the left forearm, an old bruise on the left eye, which was blackened, and a large bruise under the right collar-bone, just above the breast—the tongue partially protruded between the teeth, and a quantity of frothy and bloody mucus was issuing from the mouth and nostrils—the left leg was partially crossed over the right—the hair was very much disordered—I made a further examination next morning—I found four bruises on the head, they were hidden by the hair, and were more easily detected by removing the scalp; there were cor<lb/>responding bruises on the skull—the substance of the brain was perfectly healthy—I found a slight effusion of blood on the right side corresponding with the external injury on that side—that proceeded from the rupture of a</p>

               <p>small vessel, and, in my judgment, was caused by external violence—I opened the trachea, or windpipe; I found it filled with frothy or bloody mucus, and on tracing the course of it still further, I found extravasated blood in the substance of the right lung immediately corresponding to the external bruise under the right collar-bone—the left lung was perfectly healthy, and the heart also, and all the viscera—I consider the death to have arisen from extravasation of blood in the substance of the lung, producing suffocation by the blood becoming infiltrated into the air-tubes which run through the substance of the lung—the suffocation arose in the bronchial tubes extend<lb/>ing up to the trachea—suffocation in the lungs would be the immediate cause of death, resulting from the extravasated blood—that would be caused by external violence—a blow or blows would be quite sufficient to cause it—if the woman was rolling about and falling in an intoxicated state, that might possibly cause it—the effusion in the head bad nothing to do with the death, it was so circumscribed, not larger than a shilling—there was nothing at all like apoplexy—there was no disease apparent in the lungs to cause the effusion—I cannot tell whether it resulted from a blow or a fall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the coroners for the county of Middlesex—I held an inquest on the body of Lucy Redhead, on Saturday, 28th March—Mary Ann King was called as a witness upon that inquiry—she was sworn, I have here notes of the evidence which she gave and which I took down—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "Mary Ann King having been sworn, said, 'I live at 78, Euston-road, and the deceased, Lucy Redhead, lived with me as general servant. The deceased had had a cough for some time, but she never had any medical attendance; she left my service this day fortnight, on 3rd March, the deceased received a blow from a person named England; she never laid down in her bed after the blow, and never did any work after<lb/>wards, she never complained to me before the blow. She did the work for a 10 roomed house, and never gave up, on 23rd March, England came to my house and asked for me. I was dressing in the next room, and heard the conversation in the next room. Mr. England afterwards struck me on the chest, and also the deceased, the deceased went to fetch a policeman; she sat on the window ledge the whole of that night, because she could not lie down in bed, she remained in the same state, and two days afterwards she spat blood. She went once to the University College after that; she fell up against a large dining table when she was struck, she wore stays"—There was a post-mortem investigation at my instance, made by Mr. Devereux a gentleman in the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Clarendon-square, Somerstown, and manage a loan office—in the early part of last year, Mrs. King the defendant called upon me, and after some negociations I consented to lend her 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a bill of sale of some furniture—it was executed, deducting 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for interest—she was to pay me by instalments of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—at that time the furniture was at 44, Clarendon-square—she then lived in that house—I went there and saw the furniture—I told her if there was any rent due to let me know, and I should pay it for her—the bill of sale was executed in August last year—I think about the beginning of March this year, informa<lb/>tion was brought to me, and I went to the house in Clarendon-square—I found nearly the whole of the furniture gone—all the best of it was gone, leaving the rubbish—after making inquiries, I found that it bad been taken to 78, Euston-road—I got Mr. Hay and three carmen to go with me between 6 and 7, on Tuesday evening, 3rd March—I knocked at the door and asked for Mrs. King—I was directed to the first floor—we all went up, and I just knocked with my knuckle at the door—a little boy opened it with a candle in his hand—he said Mrs. King was not in—she was in the back room when I first entered—she came out—I removed the furniture—it took us half an, hour or it might be three quarters, with the assistance of the men—I saw a young girl sitting on the sofa with some children—I believe it was Redhead, the deceased—a policeman was sent for. by Mrs. King, when he came we showed him the bill of sale, and he went away—he said he could not inter<lb/>fere—I never touched Mrs. King during the whole time I was there—the other men were in the room the whole time—it is not true that I struck Lucy Redhead a violent blow on the chest—I never touched her on the chest—I never touched her—I was not near enough to her to strike her—the men were in the room, and by the door the whole of the time—I swear I never struck Mrs. King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Lucy Redhead speak to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She did not till afterwards, when I asked her who she was—not before the policeman came—she was desired by Mrs. King to go out and fetch a policeman—Mrs. King had her back against the door to prevent us removing the things—I afterwards saw her on the floor—she slipped down and I helped her up—there was not a struggle and a scuffle between us, more than I lifting her up and putting her on a chair or a box—there were no screams of murder that I heard—the children were making a noise—Mrs. King afterwards said she had been badly advised, and she was sorry she had removed the things—I did not charge her with stealing the things—I said it was very bad of her to take them away—she did not say they were her daughter's at that time—I think Lucy Redhead was out of the room when Mrs. King was on the floor—I don't know—the table was not always between me and Lucy Redhead, because when she came out to go for a policeman, she had to pass me—I do not know Mr. Dobbin, Mr. Knight's agent—I was at Westminster when the action was tried—I believe a man named Dobbin was examined there—he gave me the information, that the things were taken away from the house—he said they were distrained for rent, and the things had been taken away—I believe he said they had been given by Mr. Knight to the daughter—I will not be positive—I had known Mrs. King some little time</p>

               <p>before this transaction—I never saw her husband when he was living—she kept a chandler's shop in Wells-street, when she borrowed this money of me—I told her the furniture at Clarendon-square was worth between 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was afterwards arranged that the furniture at Wells-street should be included in the bill of sale—I know nothing of Mrs. King's sister dying, and the orphan children coming to live with her—I did not take away a single article of wearing apparel on this occasion—I have not had to pay for the removal of those very articles—I had a summons to go to the police court—I employed Mr. Begbie on that summons—I asked him to go—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) might have been written by him, but not by my direction—I instructed him to get an adjournment on 7th March—a witness could not come because the Princess came into London on that day—before that summons I was served with a writ at the suit of Mrs. King, and I received this letter from her attorney—that was before the adjournment, the writ was served on me some time after the receipt of that letter—it might have been the 12th, I cannot say the day—I knew there were actions pending—I believed by the daughter and by Mrs. King—the officer brought me this summons on the Thursday evening, about half-past nine—I told him I could not attend because I was summoned to the Divorce Court—I did not know I was summoned to give evidence—I thought it was for a juryman, and I also said it was out of the district, and there must have been some mistake—the officer might have said, "Mind I have served you, and you stay away at your peril"—I had a subpoena from the Divorce Court just before, and I showed it to him—I never heard of Lucy Redhead's death till I saw it in the papers—my solicitors, Walker and Twyford, applied to Mr. Tillett, and I went with them before him for a summons—it was refused because the case was pending, and we were to wait till that was over—after that we went to Mr. Knox, the Magistrate—I went with Mr. Ribton twice, I believe—Mr. Knox refused me the summons—I did not. afterwards threaten Mr. Tillett with a mandamus—Mr. Ribton did, I believe—it was then adjourned over from the first inquiry when Mr. Hay and I were ex<lb/>amined, until after the trial at Westminster Hall—I was examined on oath at the trial, and so was Mrs. King—a sum of money has been paid in respect of that action—I forget what; it might be 155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a great deal of money—I don't know how much—an execution was put in my house by Mrs. King—my solicitor paid the amount—he had the money—I was not at home all day—they were in and out of the house in about five minutes, I think, or something like that—I took away everything from Mrs. King's, except her wearing apparel—I took no linen whatever, or clothes—I realised about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the goods that were left in Clarendon-square—the furniture might have come away in three vans, but there was not a van load altogether—I afterwards got paid back a sum of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. running from August to March—Mrs. King said she could not pay 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and asked me whether I would allow her to pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and sometimes she paid 100. sometimes 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and sometimes nothing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing—I did not get this last item of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from her—I paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the court for her—there was a distress in her house—the execution creditor finding that I paid the money for her, abandoned it, and the court gave it up to me again—it was her debt, not mine—I did not make any other charge but the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not charge her a guinea for the inventory—I stated before the Magistrate that I had not touched Mrs. King to strike her—after the action was tried I attended the adjourned hearing before the Magistrate, at the Marlborough-street, Police-court—I don't think I was examined on the second occasion;</p>

               <p>my men were, and they had been examined at the trial—I did not hear the Magistrate say he would give me no assistance at all—the girl on the sofa was a little thin girl—I have stated that the table was between me and the girl all the time—I was not in the room at any time without Mr. Hay, and the men being present—they were there from first to last—they followed up the stairs close behind me—Mrs. King said that evening that the furniture belonged to her daughter—I heard of that before about 12 o'clock, from a man named Dobbin, I believe—I did not know his name.</p>

With regard to the three deeds, I believe there is a question whether they are legally forgeries; Mr. Lewis has given it as his opinion, that the case resting on the transfers alone would not stand, and for that reason the charge of forging the declaration is brought before you; but although the transfers were carried up to my very bed-room door, I will show that they were not forged by me, for after sending the porter away from the door, I took the three documents to Crompton's bed-room, and he affixed the signatures; he is proved to be not an imaginary accom<lb/>plice, but to have existed. If you will examine the signatures to the deeds and the declaration, you will see a marked difference between them and the letter to Mr. Cleghorn; of course they are somewhat similar; they are in<lb/>tended to be; the reason is obvious.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Park-place—on the evening of June 10th, I was called to 6, Alsop-place, and found the prisoner lying on the sofa in the front parlour, totally insensible—I examined her carefully all over to ascertain whether any of her bones were broken by her fall—she had received severe injuries on both legs, but no bones were broken; also injuries on the arm, and slightly on the head—she continued insensible seven or eight minutes after my arrival, and I directed treatment, under the in<lb/>fluence of which she revived—I then inquired how she met with the injuries—she said that she had fallen off the doorstep on to the paving-stones, and injured herself—I asked her if she knew anything with regard to her child being dead—in the first instance she did not appear to know that it was dead, but afterwards she muttered something about having killed it, though she was rather incoherent—she had no recollection of having fallen or thrown herself from the window—she was sufficiently sensible to recollect antece<lb/>dent facts, but she did not recollect the attempt made by cutting her own throat, or the attempt made by swallowing laudanum—as soon as she was sufficiently recovered to be left, I went up to the second floor back room—I found the bed-clothes thrown down to the foot of the bed, and the body of the child lying on the side of the bed, with its throat cut completely across, and a pool of clotted blood in the centre of the bed—the body was warm, but the extremities had got cold—the wound had been recently inflicted—I sent information to the police; a constable came, and I saw him pick up a common table-knife, which had blood on it, but it appeared to have been wiped, and we found the paper that it was wiped with—I went to the open window, and noticed that a small flower-pot, on one side of it, had been overset—we then went down to the back yard, and saw three little patches of blood on the paving stones—I returned home shortly afterwards, and sent the prisoner some medicine—there was no apparent evidence of her having taken</p>

               <p>laudanum, or other narcotic poison, but a bason was brought to me by the constable which was analyzed, and found to contain laudanum—I returned at half-past 10, when the prisoner informed me that she had been for some time past in a very low and depressed state of mind—all the information I obtained was elicited from questions put to her—she said there was no cause which she could tell me of why she was so depressed—her husband was in permanent work, and a good husband, but that she had been in a very low state of mind during her first pregnancy, and was now four months gone in the family-way—I asked her where she had obtained any laudanum; she said that she had two-pennyworth of one, another two-pennyworth from another chemist, Mr. Greenish, and had called on a third chemist, and could only get one pennyworth from him—she said that her child was with her at the time—she had taken him out with her in the afternoon, and returned with him to her lodging, and left him down stairs at play with the landlord's children—that she felt ill and depressed, and afterwards called the child up from below before she went to bed—both she and the child were undressed—she said that the child was out with her all of the time—she had no recollection at any period of throwing herself from the window, nor did she repeat the observation about falling off the doorstep—there is scarcely any doorstep, not anything which would injure her by a fall.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was not deep, was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was very super<lb/>ficial, but quite recent—laudanum has not only a narcotic effect, but it will produce something analogous to insanity—pregnant women are sometimes in a morbid or deranged state of mind, lasting only during pregnancy, and recovering themselves afterwards—the prisoner is four months gone—there are, no doubt, cases recorded in which persons in that condition have inflicted deadly acts, on persons most near and dear to them—the low, depressed con<lb/>dition, which has been deposed to as having existed in the former and the present pregnancy, would be indicative of that state of mind.</p>

               <p>Hospital, at Hammersmith—on 27th June, I saw Collins at his residence, 3, Albert-place; he was in a half-conscious state—there was an incised wound on the top of his head, which was strapped up with plaster—it was just above the forehead on the right side—it might be done by falling on a stone—there were two or three other wounds, but they had quite healed—he died on 30th June—next day, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there was an abscess on the brain directly under the external wound—there was also a wound at the back of the head—that had nothing to do with his death—the abscess on the brain was the cause of death; and that was, no doubt, caused by a blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not the abscess arise in consequence of the wound not being properly attended to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not mean to say that he would hare got well if he had been properly attended to; but he would, no doubt, have stood a much better chance—there was no fracture of the skull, but the bone was exposed—this took place on the 6th, and I did not see him till the 27th—I did not notice any marks about the face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the wound one that could not not have been given by the knuckles? In all probability he had something in his hand at the time; but the deceased was bald where the wound was, consequently a good sharp blow with the knuckle might have caused it; it was a clean out—it is possible it might have been done with a knuckle, but not likely; it is much more likely to have been made with a stone, or something of that sort—I think it would have been a very difficult matter for the wound to have been caused by a fall, unless he fell against something, because a man does not generally fall on the top of his head—I am twenty-three years old—I am a member of the College, and of the Apothecaries' Company.</p>

Q.</hi> Was it Collins who originally challenged the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he first talked about fighting—when he came at a quarter-past 11 he made no complaint—he said he should go to West and call him up at 5 o'clock, and fight it out—the road is gravel in front of my house—I have known the prisoner twenty-two months; I never knew him to be in trouble; he is head man in a brick field.</p>

On 9th June, about half-past 2 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners and two others at Eve-terrace, about 100 yards from the workhouse—about half-past 7 o'clock, I received information and went to the workhouse—I found a square of glass broken in Mr. Cole's room—I saw a screwdriver there which fitted some marks on a drawer which was broken open—I found footmarks in the yellow clay near the outer wall; a mark of a boot and other marks, as of a person having stockings over their boots—in one mark there were twenty-two nails plainer than the rest, as if they had been recently put into the boot—I covered the footmarks over, and after apprehending the prisoners, I took Smith's left boot off, took it to where I had seen the impression, and compared it—this is the boot, and here are twenty-two nails fresh put into it, which correspond with the marks—I told the prisoners the charge, and they denied it.</p>

Batger's premises, 15 and 16, Bishopsgate-street, with another officer named Whitney—I saw Jacques and Vanner both come out Jacques was carrying a bag—it appeared to contain one of these boxes—I only judge from the shape and size—they went through Spitalfields into Brick-lane, and then Jacques gave Vanner the bag with what it contained—we still followed them, into Thames-street, Bethnal-green, and Vanner went into No. 30—we remained there some time—it came on to rain very hard, and we left watching them then—on the next day, the 6th, I saw both of them again coming out of the prosecutors' premises, in the evening-Jacques had a bag, with apparently one of these boxes in it—they got up into their master's cart, and went away with him, with the bag in the cart—on the Tuesday after we watched them again, and about 7 o'clock we saw Jacques carrying a bag; Vanner was with him—we followed them into Union-street, and there stopped them, and took them in custody—we examined the bag, and it contained this box of peel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) unopened—we afterwards went with Mr. Arnold to the house where Baylis lives, 2, Winchester-street, Bethnal-green—Baylis was out in the street opposite,</p>

               <p>and we went into the house together—I told him we were officers; that we had two lads in custody for stealing some peel, and, from information we had received, we believed he had been receiving it—I then asked him if he had any peel about the place in any quantity—he said no; he bought his peel a box at a time, of Mr. Gregory, of Shoreditch, where he bought his plums and currants—I told him we must search the place—we went to go up stairs to do so, when his wife flew at me, and Baylis at the other officer—they had a scuffle together, and Whitney got up to the top of the stains, and the wife was scratching and flying at me to prevent my going up, and then Baylis and Whitney came tumbling down again with a barrel of flour all over them—we were smothered—we afterwards got a light, fetched Mr. Arnold in doors, and proceeded to search—in the parlour, between the bake-house and the shop, I found this full box of peel standing by the fireplace, on a shelf—in the bake house I found two boxes partly filled, and a quantity of empty boxes, and up stairs, in the back room, I found, in a sack, about 1 cwt. and some odd pounds of peel, which was identified by Mr. Arnold—I asked Baylis how he accounted for the possession of it—he said the peel he bought of Mr. Gregory—the boxes he could not give any account of; he could not tell who he bought them of—we flaw the name on the boxes—we then took him to the station.</p>

I was with Gaylor on this morning—I saw Mr. Allen's cart loaded and driven away by the carman towards Blackfriars-bridge—I saw Hardy follow at the near side of the cart—I saw him return by the side of Woodward's cart, in about two minutes—Woodward was driving, and he drove down Rutland-place—we were watching nearly opposite Rutland-place—we could see down it—there is a door there out of the prosecutor's premises—the tail-board of the cart was taken down by Hardy and Woodward in a very hurried manner—at that time I saw Adams standing at the corner of Thames-street and Rutland-place—he was standing there at the time the cart turned the corner, and he remained there until it was loaded and backed out—just before that Hardy joined Adams, and they stood talking together until Woodward, after back<lb/>ing out, turned his horse's head towards Blackfriars—I could not see the person inside the door, but I could see that some portion of the metal was handed to Hardy—directly Woodward started to back out, I left the room where I was, and ran down stairs, and got into the street before he had entirely backed out—I then followed the cart, Hardy and Adams being between me and the cart going towards Blackfriars-bridge—they crossed the road towards St. Andrew's-hill, and I crossed too, so that I almost touched them—I followed the cart and lost sight of them—the horse was going at a trot—I overtook it in Farringdon-street, and told Woodward to stop, and he did—Gaylor then came up, and told him we were officers, and said, "Have you any invoice?"—he said, "No, I have only part of my order; I ordered six sets, and I have only got two"—Gaylor said, "Where have you brought it from?"—he said, "From a warehouse in Thames-street"—he asked him the name; he said he did not know the name, but it was close by the mill—Gaylor told him he must consider himself in custody, and he was then conveyed to Fleet-street police-station—this was on 4th June—on that same day I met Mr. Hutchinson at Woodward's house, and searched the lower part of the house—I have a list here of the property found: 8 kitchen ranges, 16 register stoves, 7 fronts, 6 backs, 7 oven shelves, 6 bar fronts, 8 sets of bars, 1 oven, 1 boiler, 6 backs, register, 3 sets of backs fitted, 2 fire bricks, 10 iron bottoms, 115 pieces of register metal, 14 fall doors, 6 inside backs, 2 triangles, 2 trivets, and 1 eliptic stove, which Mr. Hutchinton iden<lb/>tified—there was a quantity of other metal there, but I only brought away that which Mr. Hutchinson identified—I have been looking after Robert Adams—I have not succeeded in finding him yet—he was in the prosecutor's employment at this time, and I have seen him at work there since these parties have been in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the gaolers of Newgate—I received this letter on Saturday last from the prisoner Hardy (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Newgate, 8th July, 1863. Sir,—I have been in your employment, now, turned twelve years, and can sincerely say I have never wronged you till within these last three months. I have been a faithful, true, and honest servant to you. As a last resource I ask, you to pardon me this time, if you will. I am a broken-hearted man, have mercy on me this once; I have been in prison now five weeks, I now begin to feel my situation, for I never saw the inside of one before; extend your mercy to me this time, I have a family of young children crying at home for bread, and an aged mother nearly broken-hearted, which, of course, I ought to have thought of before. If it was possible that I could come to work for you to-morrow, Sir, I would do so, to pay you back all that I have wronged you of I am going up for trial on Monday, I expect the sentence will be severe, unless you do something for me. I earnestly entreat you to do your best for me to release me from this place, for I am a wretched and miserable man. If you will be kind enough to address a letter to me, for I am a truly unhappy man. "Signed, "James Hardy. Newgate goal."</p>

On 20th June, in consequence of information I received, I watched Mr. Roberts' house, a pawnbroker, in Old-street-road—after a short time I went into the shop, and saw Elizabeth Stevenson there—I asked Mr. Roberts, in her presence, if he had any silk and crape brought in to pledge—he said, "Yes, this person has just brought some in," and gave it to me—it was on the counter—I then examined the crape and silk, and asked the prisoner how she came by them—she said some man left them with her to pledge—I then told her they were stolen, and I should take her to the station—she begged of me to go with her to show me where the young man lived—I told her I could not do so, and she must go to the station with me—I said I should charge her with receiving the things, knowing them to have been stolen, and I took her to the station—I afterwards went with Hancock to the address she gave—I stopped in the shop with the male prisoners, and the other officers searched the house—Stevenson said to Fleming, "This is a fine job"—the servant went up stairs, and brought down a hat and coat—Brewer told the servant to go up in her room and get John's hat, and John Fleming wore it.</p>

Phillips—on 3d June, I was in charge of a lighter, called the "Sarah Ward"—in the afternoon I went into St. Katherine's Docks and got on board seventy-six bags of coffee and three casks—I then "brought up" to the "Fyenord," and lay my barge alongside—I delivered there the three casks of coffee, leaving the seventy-six bags on board the barge—I then went to tea about half-past seven—before doing so, I secured the tarpaulin, and nailed it down—a man named Hitchcock was in a barge alongside—I spoke to him before I left—I came back from tea about a quarter to 9—I then saw Fitch and another man off in a skiff, and go from my punt into a red lug-boat two or three times—shortly after that they came ashore in the skiff—I had been standing about five minutes, when Finnis came and stood alongside of me—the other two men took him off in a boat—I asked them to take me off to my barge—the two men asked Finnis what I wanted—he replied, "He wants to know if you will take him off to his barge"—they said, "No, we cannot be bothered with him"—they then went to the red lug-boat and took her away—they fastened the skiff to the lug-boat—about ten minutes after, I got a boat and went on board my barge—I saw the tarpaulin had been shifted, and I missed something, but did not know how many bags—afterwards I counted, and found four bags of coffee were missing, which would be about two hundredweight—I afterwards went with the police-inspector to Newcastle-wharf, Wapping, to see the red lug-boat—it was the same—I saw the prisoners on 13th June on Tower-hill—I followed them to the Monument—I did not give them, into custody—I did not know whether land policemen would be allowed to take them, as it was a robbery on the water—I afterwards had some directions from our foreman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, in the employ of Messrs. Phillips—on this evening I was on board a barge at the <hi rend="italic">Fyenord</hi> called the <hi rend="italic">Mary Ann Hall—I</hi> saw the last witness go ashore to tea—he asked me whether his craft would be safe not to watch it; I had a case to leave at the Victoria Dock—I kept an eye on the punt while I was on board, and I left at twenty minutes to 9—the tarpaulin was then secure, and had not been disturbed—there was a chain-lighter on the outside of the punt at the head of the <hi rend="italic">Fyenord</hi>—I did not see anybody come on board the barge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Finnis. Q.</hi> Could you not tell the difference between a lug-boat and a barge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think so—the pumps of a lug-boat are in the cabin—sometimes when you are alongside a vessel there may be a dozen craft to take their turn before you—then a small quantity of goods is put across the other vessels, instead of a man waiting until his turn comes—if there is a hole in the bag the contents then sometimes drop out into the other craft—it is not common to find coffee or anything else under the boards of the craft.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever find any coffee? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and goods of all des<lb/>criptions in these boats after they have been stacked, rice, coffee, pepper, or anything that won't dissolve, and which the boat may have carried.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman's apprentice, and live at 4. Barge-street, Tower-hill—the lug-boat <hi rend="italic">Ann</hi>, belonged to our firm—she was a red boat—on 3d June, she was opposite the Custom House at Joyce's Wharf, lying there empty—I saw her that evening, between 6 and 7 o'clock, and missed her next morning, between 7 and 8—the prisoner's had no right to take her away—when she was found I saw that the cabin doors had been broken open—the stuff had been taken out of the cabin, and the tarpaulin had been rolled up, and put under the <hi rend="italic">head steppers</hi>—I did not observe any<lb/>thing in the boat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Finnis. Q.</hi> On the 8th of June was she not brought from Limehouse-cut? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; she was delivered up on 8th June at Limehouse-cut—I had my suspicion raised as I heard of the robbery, that the goods had been con<lb/>veyed in this boat—she was not examined before she was taken out of the cut to my knowledge—I believe she was taken to Baltic Wharf—that adjoins Newcastle Wharf, and the other witness may have made a mistake—she was then taken to Fresh Wharf to load—I did not examine the barge before she was examined by the police—the cabin was kept locked up—I do not know whether the fastenings were broken—I did not notice her suffi<lb/>ciently for that.</p>

I am book-keeper to Mr. Allan, and am second in autho<lb/>rity under Mr. Hutchinson, the general manager—I am cognisant of the marks on our goods—I went to Parram's premises in the Queen's-road, Dalston, on 9th June, at 11 o'clock—he has a sort of smith's shed there, a little off the road—I went into the shed, and saw Parram's son—he sent another lad for his father, and while he was gone I saw several pieces of metal and Stoves, which I recognised as belonging to our firm by the marks on them and by the patterns—when Parram came I said I wished to pur<lb/>chase a few stoves—he said, "Very well"—I pointed to one in the shop, which I knew was one of our pattern, and said that was the pattern which I wanted—I said I should very likely want six, and I asked him what he would charge for them—he named our lowest wholesale price, 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per inch</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186307130089"/>
               <p>—we sell that metal at that price to the trade only, to sell again—I then said that he should hear from me in the course of the day—as I was coming away he said that he would make them less; he would make them 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. if I took six of them—I believe the retail dealers sell them to the public at about 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him when he could let me have six—he said the following morning—I then left, communicated with the officers, Gaylor and Whitney, and came back with them in about ten minutes—they were about 200 yards away—when we came back I observed a pony and cart at the door—it was a very small pony, and a very large cart in proportion—"Parram, Queen's-road, Dalston," was on the cart—the pony was brown, I believe—Parram was carrying out some of the metal which I had observed in the shop into the cart—there were pieces of two ranges which I saw in the shop—I cannot really say how much there was in the cart, perhaps thirteen or fourteen dif<lb/>ferent parts of stoves—the officers were in plain clothes—I heard part of the conversation between them—Gaylor asked Parram where he got this metal—he said that he could not tell, but he had invoices at home for it—Gaylor asked me if I could identify that metal as belong<lb/>ing to Mr. Allan—I said I could—we then went to Parram's house—he showed us three invoices, which he took from a file, but none of them referred to the metal we found in the shop—Whitney remained in charge of the cart while we were away—the three invoices were for very small amounts, one for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and another for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we left them in the house in Mrs. Parram's custody.</p>

I saw the invoices when they were produced at the house—I did not examine them very particularly—the amounts were small, but I could not say what they were—they related to no goods that were found on the premises—whilst I was there a person named Tully, a builder, came in—he said that Parram had supplied him with stoves for some houses he had been building—I went to four of the recently-built houses to see those stoves which were so supplied—they are patterns belong<lb/>ing to Mr. Allan, to the value of about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the four houses—the value of the metal found in the cart is about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>to his house in Hertford-street, close by, and left Whitney behind in posses<lb/>sion of the metal—Parram got down three files with bills on them, and took off three from the lot; they related to some small dealings with Mr. Allan; one was for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., another for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other for some small amount—I should not think they exceeded 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—they did not relate to any of the property we had found in the cart or on the premises—I told him that, and said I wanted to see the invoices for the metal he had fetched away that day week—he could not find any other, and we went back to the cart—he said before that that he had not been in Thames-street for more than a fortnight—we took possession of the metal in the cart, and all that in the shed which Mr. Napier identified—I told Parram we had two men in custody, who were coming up on the next Friday, and that he had better bring those receipts and come up to Guildhall, and then he could account for how he became possessed of the metal, and have it back again if the Alderman thought proper—he said—n Here is a person who will be answerable for my coming," alluding to Mr. Tully, who came in at the time—Tully said, "I don't know about being answerable, but as far as I have had dealings with him I always thought him straightforward"—Parram said he would come to Guildhall, and we left—there was an examination at Guild<lb/>hall on Friday, when Hardy, Woodward, and Adams were in custody—I did not see Parram there—there was a remand—he did not attend at the remand—I went to his house several times after the Friday, and left word with his wife for him to be there—I did not find him at his house—he appeared, at the last examination, and was taken into custody—we left a summons at the house for him.</p>

If the witnesses who have been examined had been there at any other time in the day they would have seen plenty of other carts loading in Smith's-ride. I had no authority to load there. I used my own judgment, and had done so long before Mr. Napier or Mr. Hutchinson came there, to avoid Messrs. Smith's waggons which were in front. On this 2d of June, I think it was, I took a boiler; it might have been that one. It was not whole, and I handed three pieces of metal into Mr. Parram's cart that morning. It was Adam's place to account for it; it was in his department. I merely handed the metal in, and never before but once in my life did I ever load anything into Mr. Parram's cart. I will swear that; only twice. As to the copper doors and other things, I know nothing about them.</p>

On 10th June I went with Whitney to 15, I think, Back-hill, Clerkenwell, James Thomas's place of business—it is a little shop with stoves in it, bell-hanging materials, and so on—I saw him there with his son George—I told him we were two officers, and had received information that his sons had fetched a quantity of iron away from Mr. Allan's, Upper Thames-street, and we wanted to see his sons—he said, "Here is one," pointing to George, "and the other is on a holli<lb/>day"—I asked him if he had any invoices relating to the things brought away—he said, "We have no dealings with Messrs. Allan, except we might have bought an odd bit now and then"—George was near enough to hear that—Mr. Napier was with us—he searched the place but found nothing that belonged to him, and we went away—on 25th June, Whitney and I went to his shop again—we told him that we had received information that his sons had brought a deal of metal away from there, and we wanted to see them—he said they were both out—I then asked him if he had any invoices or papers—he said he was sure he had not, they had no dealings with Mr. Allan, whatever; they might have bought an odd bit now and then—he then came out into the street, I followed him, and I then said, "Our infor<lb/>mation is that your sons have received a deal of metal away from this place, have you sold any in the shape of stoves, or made it up into stoves and sold it?"—he said no; his business was not to sell stoves, but to fit them up for other people—I said, "Have you not sold any stoves or ranges to Mr. Kilby or anybody else?"—I told him candidly that we had seen two ranges at Mr. Kilby's—he said he had not sold a dozen stoves for more than a twelve month, and he mentioned the names of one or two persons round the neigh<lb/>bourhood whom he fitted up for—I said to him, "If anybody says you have sold those stoves, they say that which is wrong?"—he said, "Yes, they do"—Whitney was not with me all this time, I left him in the shop waiting for the sons—I then told James Thomas that he must consider himself in cus<lb/>tody, he would be charged with receiving the goods, and his sons with steal<lb/>ing them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's son—he is about fifty-nine years of age—at times he appeared to be strong in mind, and at others weak—about seven years ago he was thrown from a cart, and was confined eight days in the London Hospital, and was afterwards attended by Dr. Jones at home—I can hardly say how long it was before he was able to resume his business; it was some considerable time before he was right again—he has been stranger at times since then—he seemed more worried at times with regard to work—he wanted a greater quantity of work out than could possibly be done—that troubled his mind—my brother was at times very imbecile—my father was very much devoted to him, as well as to my mother—I remember his suffering from another accident between three and four years ago—he lay underneath a cart for three quarters of an hour, the hone kicking him in the head occasionally—it was in a bye-way where nobody was passing, and late in the evening—he suffered for some time after that—on the Saturday evening before this occurrence he was very strange—I went in to him as usual with the men's time, and he told me to pay them—I asked him where the money was, and he said he had given it to me—he then went to writing, and took no more notice of it for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, then he said, "Have you not paid them?"—I said, "No, you have not given me the money"—he said "I have;" instead of that he had given it to my mother—on the Sunday morning again he would have that he had given me the money to pay the men—he was lying in bed, and he said, "I feel very ill; I think I shall not get up any more"—I said, "What is the matter with you?"—he said, "It is the worry and bother"—I left him shortly after, and the next I heard was this tragic occurrence—I saw my father and mother together on the Sunday, and they were very comfortable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I now reside in Hanover-street, Hanover-square—I used to live in the Southwark-bridge-road, close by the prisoner's house—I have known him for seventeen years; the first occasion of my attending his family was at the birth of the boy who is now dead—that boy was an imbecile and a cripple—I always found the prisoner's conduct to his wife and child most affectionate and considerate—he was always a strange, odd man, peculiar in his manner, taciturn, uncommunica<lb/>tive—he sometimes would not reply to a question—he would frequently pass me in the street without taking any notice, even if I recognised him—I remember both the accidents that occurred to him, one took place in March, 1856—the history I had of the case was, that a week previous to my being called in to see him, he was thrown out of his cart and taken up in a state of insensibility, and carried in that condition to the London Hospital; there he remained a week, and on his being brought home I was called in to see him—he had very extensive injury to his head and face in the shape of wounds and contusions—I thought that after that his perceptives were less acute, that his strange way was stranger—he took longer to appear to under<lb/>stand a question before he replied to it—the second injury was in 1859—I. had then removed to where I now live, and my partner was called in to see him—he had fractured his arm—I saw him the next day, and continued attending him—there were contusions about the head on that occasion, but no destruction of surface, no wound or serious injury apparent; it was such as might be produced by the kick of a horse—that would jar the brain undoubtedly—I have since then met him occasionally, professionally in public places, I mean parochially, and so forth—he was overseer, I think, some time ago, a member of one of the local boards—he was very much respected—his strangeness of manner has increased—on the last occasion of my going through his shop to see his wife or child, he did not take the slightest notice of me or reply to my ordinary salute—I thought him originally a poor feeble thing, and the shock received by the accidents would aggravate that originally feeble state of mind—I have not seen him since this matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe maker, of 5, Bradley-terrace, Wandsworth-road—on 4th June I went to bed at 12 o'clock, fastened up my house, and saw that all my property was safe—next morning, about 6 o'clock, I came down and found the kitchen window and shutter open, and the things all gone—an entrance had been effected by getting over a wall at the back and opening the shutter and window—I saw the things at Wandsworth police-court the same day—the window and shutter were closed, but not fastened.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my brother, at 9, South Lambeth-road—on Friday morning, 5th June, about half-past 6 o'clock, I saw the prisoner go to a hole in a field which is fenced in, take out these things, and run away—I ran after him, and asked him what he had got—he said, "A bit of bread"—I said, "Let <hi rend="italic">us</hi> look?"—he refused, and I followed him—he put the bundle down and ran away—I went and told the police, and he was taken—I took the things to the police.</p>

On 5th June, about 7 in the morning, I received information from Nash, and stopped the prisoner—Nash gave me the bundle, which contained two candlesticks, a teapot, a table-cloth, and a towel—he said. "Not speak no English at all:" and I do not know that he can.</p>
