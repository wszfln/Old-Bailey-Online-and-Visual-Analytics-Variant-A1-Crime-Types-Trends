                  </hi>. I live at 18, Whitcomb Street, Leicester Square—I was tried and acquitted on a charge of stealing a cistern, in which a man named Wilson was prosecutor—I don't remember the date—I think it was somewhere about the 15th December last—I afterwards instructed my attorneys to bring an action against Wilson for false imprisonment, that action was pending at the time I was taken into custody on a charge of receiving a watch, knowing it to have been stolen—I know Sheldrake and Row<lb/>land—they were on and off in my employment, up to last September—since then Sheldrake has often been at my place in the ordinary way with his brother—on Monday, 7th May, the day before the policeman took me into custody, I saw Sheldrake—he had been in the habit of coming to me to borrow tools, and I have occasionally assisted him—on Wednesday, 8th May, about 8 o'clock in the evening, I was just coming home, entering my door, when I was accosted by the Detective Butcher—we went into the house together—we went straight into the shop parlour—I had a conversation with Butcher, in consequence of which I searched the pockets of the clothes I was wearing, and also the pockets of a coat that was hanging behind the door—during this transaction Mrs. Gowley, my housekeeper, came into the room where Butcher and I were, and in my presence she searched the coat that was hanging behind the door—she took out from that coat a small parcel, wrapped up in dirty paper, which turned out to be a little Geneva watch—that, watch was afterwards identified at the Middlesex Sessions by</p>

               <p>the prisoner Wallace as his—I was then and there taken by Butcher to the police-station, on the charge of receiving that watch, knowing it to be stolen—about 10.30 that night, I saw Wallace at the station—next morn<lb/>ing an examination took place, and I was remanded—at the second hearing Sheldrake was called into Court—then the trial followed—on Wednesday, 22nd May, when I was at the Sessions House, I saw the two Sheldrakes—I saw them again on Thursday—my trial took place on the Thursday—I heard the evidence of Samuel Sheldrake—it is not true that on 7th May, I went and had a pint of beer with him at Mr. Sewell's; it is true that I went and had a pint of beer with him, but not at Sewell's—it is not true that I asked him to buy a watch, or that I produced a watch and asked 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and that it would take half-a-crown to repair; it is not true that he said he would go and see if it was worth anything—I was not in the house with him quite five minutes—he had brought back a tool that he had borrowed—I had never seen the watch until it was produced from my pocket by Mrs. Gowley.</p>

               <p>—Sheldrake was not employed there by me—a man named Ayres was—there was a lead cistern there over the counting-house—I instructed Ayres to cut out the lead—I did not find that Ayres was not a skilful man, and I did not employ some one else to go at 5 o'clock in the morning to cut it out—I did not take Sheldrake at 5 o'clock in the morning and help him with a ladder whilst he cut out the lead of that cistern—I did not tell Sheldrake not to make a mess, either on the roof or on the pavement, because Mr. Wilson's men might see it; besides, the cistern was my own—I did not tell Sheldrake to put zinc there in place of it, it never was put there—I did not sell that cistern for a penny a pound at a shop in Whitcomb Street; I exchanged it for some lead with Mr. Pickersgill, it would not do to sell old lead for a penny a pound in the trade—a man named Scott was my partner at that time—a complaint was made by Mr. Wilson that the water was coming through the roof into the counting-house—I did not say to Wilson, in the presence of Henry Scott, that it was a b—thing of a squint-eyed bricklayer who had been drunk two or three days, who must have stolen the cistern; nothing of the sort; it was not stolen, it was my own property—Wilson did not say in my presence and in Scott's presence, that if ever he found out who had taken the cistern he would prosecute them—I did not say in Scott's presence that I was very sorry, but I could not account for the cistern being gone—I afterwards told Scott that I had taken out the lead according to contract, but not that I had sold it to any party—Scott did not tell me that he had seen the cistern in the marine-store dealer's shop, in Whitcomb Street; he told somebody else, not in my presence—I did not say "Yes, I sold it there"—Scott said "It is a good way of doing business to sell a cistern for a penny a pound when the value would be 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to us," but I told him quite different—he did not say that to me; I had no conversation with him about it; he was about leaving me, and he was vindictive—I did not beg Mr. Scott not to say anything about it to Mr. Wilson—Mr. Scott ceased to be my partner about five or six weeks afterwards, I think, according to my recollection, I can't tell you exactly—it was after that conversation I was prosecuted by Mr. Wilson for stealing the cistern—I recollect Butcher taking me on that charge about the cistern—I said to Butcher "What cistern do you mean?"—we had several of them, three or four—Butcher came and asked me about it; he said he was sent by Mr. Wilson—I should think that was four or five weeks after I had had the cistern cut out; it was in September, I think, that it was cut out—I told Butcher I did not know what cistern he meant, because I had repaired three; as soon as I remembered I told him "Yes, that was in the contract"—I had taken it away by contract and replaced another—I did not tell him that I had never seen it—I was committed for trial for stealing the cistern—I said then that it was under a contract, and I proved it—we took it away and repaired the lead flat on account of the water coming in—it rained tremendously, and of course we had not the means of getting it done; as soon as it was fair, we repaired it—between my com<lb/>mittal and my trial, Rowland called at my house; I did not request him to see Sheldrake, and beg him not to come to the trial; I knew too well what Rowland was—Sheldrake did not work at Mr. Wilson's previous to the time the cistern was taken away—I never went with Sheldrake with a ladder to Mr. Wilson's premises, and go up the ladder on to the roof—Sheldrake did not point out to me that the lead over the cistern had been partly cut; he had nothing to do with it—I said Dick, meaning Ayres, did cut it out; I</p>

               <p>had no conversation with Sheldrake about it; I never said to him that I wanted it done before 6 o'clock in the morning—I was present when it was removed, and Wilson was there too, at 10 o'clock in the morning, by contract—I never saw Wallace before—I saw him in Court and never spoke to him—the coat that was hanging behind the door I had last worn the night before, out of doors in the street; I think Mrs. Gowley took the watch out of the pocket, according to my recollection; I think she took it out and gave it to Butcher, it is not the fact that she went through several pockets, and after that Butcher went to a particular pocket and produced the watch; I went to several pockets, and could not find it; I did not dream about a watch—Mrs. Gowley felt and found it in a little pocket on the right-hand side; a tail pocket I think—I was represented at Marl borough Street by Mr. Froggatt, the solicitor, on this charge—I heard Mr. Froggatt ask Butcher who gave him information; he was asked some questions, but he did not think proper to answer—I think he was asked if he knew Sheldrake, and he said he did not—I think Sheldrake was then called in by my solicitor—I don't know that Butcher then said that was the man that gave him the information; I did not hear—Sheldrake was not made a witness against me at that time—I think Mr. Knox gave Butcher some little under<lb/>standing to the effect that he was not to disclose who gave him the infor<lb/>mation—I was out on bail—I saw Samuel and William Sheldrake at the Middlesex Sessions before the trial came on—I heard they were to be witnesses against me—I heard also that they were going to be witnesses in Mr. Wilson's matter of the action, but no witnesses were required, they were never there, and knew nothing at all about the transaction, not the slightest—I believe William Sheldrake was charged with these persons and all the evidence gone into against him—I heard him swear at the Sessions House that he was at a public-house where the watch was produced.</p>

I live at 18, Whitcomb Street, and am house<lb/>keeper to the prosecutor—I was at home on 8th May—the day before that Sheldrake came to the house and brought back a putty knife that he had borrowed—on 8th May, he came to the house after breakfast, in the fore<lb/>noon; I think it would be about 11 o'clock—he also came in the afternoon—we had some conversation; he was in-doors, at the centre door, the parlour door; he remained there between half and three-quarters of an hour; he remained just at the door—I did not remain in the room all the time; I was obliged to go up stairs to one of the lodgers just for a minute or two, and I left Sheldrake there, and when I came down again, I found him there, and he remained about ten minutes or so afterwards—Mr. Moorhouse's over<lb/>coat was hanging on the door; it was a coat that he sometimes wore over his house-coat—on that day, while Butcher was there, I heard a ring at the bell, and heard Sheldrake's voice asking if Mr. Moorhouse was in—in Butcher's presence, I searched three of the pockets of the great coat; I took the watch out of the coat—I searched the last pocket in consequence of something that Butcher said to me—on a Friday night, about 9 o'clock, about seven weeks before this occurred, I remember Wallace coming to the private door and asking if Mr. Moorhouse wag in—I told him he was not</p>

               <p>that must do"—I then left, and met him at the station at 10.30—Moorhouse was then charged, and Wallace signed the sheet—the watch was produced—he was asked if that was his watch, and he said yes—Sergeant McGilli<lb/>cuddy, who was the inspector in charge, held out the watch in his hand, and said "Is that your watch?" and the moment, before the words were out of his mouth, Wallace said "Yes, that is my watch"—next morning, as I was on my way from where I live to Vine Street, I met Sheldrake at the corner of Grafton Street, Bond Street—he said "Well, how did you get on last night, did you get Old Johnny?"—I said "Yes, and the watch too"—he said "I told you would, I was sure it was there"—he asked where I found it—I said it was found in a coat hanging behind the door—I then left him, and went to Marlborough Street—Moorhouse was remanded for a week—on the remand, on 16th May, I saw Sheldrake, and his brother William, and Wallace, at Marlborough Street—it is not true that Wallace pointed out the two Sheldrakes to me, saying "There are two young men who know something about the watch;" nothing of the kind—I had no conversation at all with Sheldrake at Marlborough Street—it was upon Sheldrake's information given to me at the Vine Street Station, that I went and took Moorhouse into custody—Wallace did not tell me that the Shel<lb/>drakes were coming to the Sessions—I saw all three defendants at the Middlesex Sessions on Monday, 20th May—I went before the Grand Jury on the Tuesday, and a true bill was returned that day—the two Sheldrakes and Wallace were in company together on the Tuesday—the case was fixed for trial on the Wednesday, but was tried on the Thursday—I saw all the three defendants there on Wednesday, in company together—on the Thurs<lb/>day, shortly after 10 o'clock, just before the case was called on, Sheldrake said to me "My brother and me are come down to speak what we know about the watch"—I said "Are you going to give evidence?"—he said "Yes"—I then took him to Mr. Sawyer, the clerk to the County Solicitor, to take his deposition—it was a prosecution by the county—I left him with Mr. Sawyer, and went up stairs into the Court—while Wallace was being examined I and the two Sheldrakes were on the balcony, outside the Court, and Samuel Sheldrake said to me "What about if I am asked who gave you the information, must I say or not?"—I said "Please yourself," and turned away from him, and never spoke any more—he said "Then I shall deny it"—I was subsequently called into Court, and in the prisoner's presence asked from whom I received the information—I had known Rowland many years, ten years at least, but never spoke to him—I had not known Wallis or Sheldrake.</p>

               <p>the informer I think if that was to be done—I did not demur or object; I only appealed to the Court whether I was to give it—I mentioned Mr. Knox's name, because at the first examination, when I was asked by Mr. Froggatt who gave me the information, Mr. Knox told me not to answer the question—I told that to the Judge at the Middlesex Sessions, as a reason for not giving the name, and I have been told so by Judges and Magistrates many times—I told Mr. Sleigh, before Sheldrake gave his evidence, what he had said to me, and I said "He will deny it."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After I told Mr. Sleigh, he withdrew from the prosecution against Moorhouse—the number of the watch was given by Wallace at the station, but I believe not at the same time as the loss—it was entered in red ink in the book—when asked who gave me the information, I appealed to the Judge, and said, "My lord, ought I to give the name of this person or not?"—I think he said, "You ought in this case," and I did—in cases of felony we sometimes get our information from persons connected with robberies—I don't always give the source from which I derive information; it would be very serious, I think, if I did.</p>

               <p>Wilson. I was at work with Mr. L. one day, and he said he'd got a job to do in the evening, would I help him and stop to tea. I finished the job. Mr. L. went out, and came back and asked me to go and have a drop of beer in at Clark's public-house, St. Alban's Place, where Mr. Wilson came into afterwards. He spoke to me, and I told him all about when I cut out the lead cistern. Mr. Wilson said to me that he had got a young man to introduce to me who had been in the employ of Mr. Moorhouse. That was Rowlands. From that time up to the proceedings connected with the watch case we were often together. When I was at work for Mr. L., Row<lb/>lands used to come and call me away often, and one afternoon said: 'I've bought a watch; this (showing me the watch) is going to be put into Moorhouse's pocket. I bought it of a young chap that sells coins. It will be a proper thing to have Johnny, as he's trying to get you into prison.' Two days after that he came and called me away from work, and showed me the man he had bought it of, and showed me a bad shilling he had in his pocket, and wanted some bad money to put in as well. He said, 'I am going to pay this young chap to put it in.' I was playing at bagatelle at Barnell's public-house, and he came and told me I must go and give infor<lb/>mation to Mr. Butcher that the watch was in Mr. Moorhouse's pocket, or else he'd give us five years. I've been in company with Rowlands and Wilson several times in connection with this matter. He (Wilson) told Rowlands in my presence that he would give Rowlands 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if the case against Moorhouse came off. The same night I gave information to Mr. Butcher, and he (Rowlands) said, 'Something must be done for Bottom; you go down there (to Moorhouse's) and try and get him (Bottom) into Saint James' Square,' and showed me a key and said, 'Look, this is what will do it; we can do it with this.' I said, 'I won't have anything to do with it; you can do as you like about it.' Rowlands asked me one day to ask Ludbrooke if he had a coat to put into Johnny's (meaning Moorhouse's), and I said no, I wouldn't. Rowlands gave me the watch, and said, 'Show it to your brother,' and I was to show it to my brother and tell him that Moorhouse had offered it to me for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I showed it to my brother in Sewell's public-house; the same day I saw Moorhouse, and had beer with him. I gave the watch back to Rowlands, who was waiting at Surrage's public-house. Moorhouse never had the watch. I did not put the watch into Moorhouse's pocket; it was put there by the man of whom Rowlands stated to me he had bought the watch. My brother knew no more of it than that I did show him the watch as directed by Rowlands.

                  </hi>. I am a foreman in the employ of the Great Western Railway, at Smithfield—on 2nd July, about 3.40, I was walking down the yard, between the trucks at the goods station, under Smithfield Market, and saw the prisoner pulling some parcels about on the platform—I watched him for a minute or two, and then went on with some tools which I had and placed them in the lobby—I returned in a minute or two and the prisoner was still there; I saw him pick up the parcel and throw it under the trucks at the platform, then he got down under the waggons, caught hold of it, drew it 40 or 50 ft., and placed it under the platform—I told Rutherford.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">G. W. R. Detective</hi>). On 2nd July, Daniels made a communication to mo, and I went underground at the station—the prisoner has been a police-constable there a very short time, but he was a porter before—I saw him come in at the Farringdon Street end of the station, and go on the line opposite to where the parcel was concealed—he stooped two or three times against the platform and then went on his duty, and I concealed myself under the platform where I could see the parcel lying, and in about half an hour he came and took the parcel, brought it up to the light as near as he could without being detected, put his hand in his pocket and brought out what I supposed to be a packing-needle and some twine, and commenced sewing the parcel up—he left it lying very handy so that he could take it up again—he was going to lift it on to the platform, and as he was doing so I jumped out and took him, and the parcel too—I took him to the station and charged him—I returned to the place and was groping about to find the needle, and found these two pieces of muslin concealed under the platform.</p>

On 19th June, about 3.30 a.m, I saw the prisoner running about 150 yards from the prosecutor's house, and away from it—I followed him to the corner of Edward Street, where he turned a corner when I was nearly overtaking him, and I lost sight of him for about five minutes—I saw him again in the closet of a yard at No. 14, St. Ann's Court, and am sure he is the same man as I saw running—as soon as I opened the door he sprang from the closet to a pair of steps, and then to the top of a wall 7 ft. high—he then went across two or three cisterns, and jumped down into the area of No. 13—I was still after him—I can jump pretty well—he went up a staircase, and through a small window, on to the roof—there was no means of my getting to the roof except by going to the second floor back, and I had to jump upwards to a stack of chimneys,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187207080026"/>
               <p>and on to the roof—someone told me something, and I saw him lying crouched by the stack of chimneys, holding the far end of the chimney pots—he said "Are you coming after me?"—I said "Yes"—he said "I am b—d if I don't throw you over into the court"—I said "Here goes then," and by the time I reached the stack he sprang across the alley, which is 40 ft. deep and 5 ft. wide, into an aperture 44 ins. wide—I jumped across the alley after him, and into the aperture—he ran along a corridor, and I after him—he dodged me on the landing, and slipped down the second landing—I got hold of him, and he slipped away like an eel, through a passage, and in at several doorways, and got into an old lady's bedroom—the whole of the tenants ran out in their night-clothes, and it being rather dark I caught hold of an old gentleman in mistake, and the prisoner slipped out at the doorway, and went on to the first floor, and I after him—he looked over into the court below, but thought it was too far to drop, and ran into the entrance of the building, where I caught hold of him tight, and took him to the station—he was wearing the prosecutor's coats—he said, going along, "You might as well have given me a b—good hiding, and let me go"—he did not attempt to throw me down; he found it was no use.</p>

A lot has been stated to-day which has not been stated before, the inspector took him to a private place and persuaded him. The man with the black moustache has got away. The robbery was committed at 3.30, and at 3.30 I picked the coats up. My brother is an acrobat, and I was running to see him; he is the only friend I have in the world; the coat was stolen, and I unfortu<lb/>nately put it on. When the policeman halloaed after me I would not come because I didn't want to be locked up, I only ran for a bit of a game to let him see he could not take me; he knocked me down and made me bleed, then he said I did it myself; he broke the cartilage of my throat, he bled me all over with his staff. When he first came he could not say I was the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Marylebone Police Court—on 31st May, between 11 and 12 o'clock in the day, I went with Mr. Mansfield, the Magistrate, to the University Hospital—I there saw James Brown, who was a patient—the prisoner was brought to his bedside, and in his presence I took the examination of James Brown, after he was sworn in the usual way—the charge then was feloniously wounding—the prisoner had an opportunity of cross-examining Brown, and he availed himself of it—the cross-examination was taken down, and the deposition signed by the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased was very ill indeed at the time—he had some difficulty in giving his evidence—the prisoner was very much affected, and so was the deceased.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The deposition of James Brown was read as follows</hi>: "About 12.30 on Monday night, Whit Monday, I was in Stanhope Street. I had had a quarrel with the prisoner about half an hour before; we were both three parts drunk. I do not know what the quarrel was about. The prisoner had gone about half an hour, and when he returned I was standing talking to a girl. Newman, the witness in this case, was in front of the public-house. The prisoner came up to my left hand side, when this girl that I was speaking to, said 'Mind him, he has got a knife in his hand; I said 'If he has got a knife I will soon take it away.' Before I could turn round I felt myself stabbed in my left breast. The prisoner walked away, and I was taken to this hospital. I had known the prisoner some time, but had had no quarrels with him.' <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> 'I came up to them, he did not come up to me. I did not say at the Hen and Chickens that I would do for the prisoner before long. I did not take out a knife first; I had no knife.')</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Grafton Street, Kentish Town—last Whit Monday, about 6 o'clock, I was in Henry Street, and met the prisoner—he asked where Brown was—I said he was at work—he said "Nonsense"—I said "Yes, and I am going to meet him now, at Jackson &amp; Graham's"—he said he would go with me, as he wanted to see him, and we went—the book entrance to Jackson &amp; Graham's is in Newman Street, Oxford Street—Lee went down the yard to look for Brown—Brown came out shortly after—Lee was then standing in the street, at the corner, with me—this was about 6.40—he came up to us, and went back again to work; he had not done work—there was some conversation between Lee and Brown—I could not say what it was; all I heard was how long he would be, and he said he could not leave work till 7.30—they seemed on very good terms—Lee and I waited there till 7.30, when Brown came out again, with four of his shop<lb/>men—they joined us, and we all went into a public-house in Newman Street—I don't know the sign—we were still all very good friends—there were six men and myself—they had two pots of ale—nothing was said between Brown and Lee at that time—we remained in the public-house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187207080031"/>
               <p>perhaps half an hour or more—we then went in the direction of Brown's lodging in Henry Street—the other shopmen went away, and left me, Lee, and Brown—we did not go anywhere, we only walked about the street—I should think it was then about 8.30—we went into the Cock public-house, at the corner of Henry Street, about 9.30—they had a pot of stout—Mrs. Brown, the sister-in-law of the deceased, was there; she is Lee's sister—I went across the bar to speak to her; she was at the further end of the bar—I was talking to her, and all at once Brown and Lee had a quarrel, and she turned round, and saw them quarrelling—I had not been away from them two minutes—Mrs. Brown went and parted them—I saw that Lee's nose was bleeding—I took Brown outside into the street—Mrs. Brown attended to Lee; she bathed his face—I did not see any blow struck; I had my back to them at the time—I went out, and talked to Brown, and asked what they quarrelled upon, and he told me to mind my own business—he only remained two or three minutes with me—I then lost sight of him for about twenty minutes or half an hour—I stood outside, talking to Mrs. Brown—this was about 9.30 or 9.45—there were no marks on Brown's face—he had a slight black eye—I did not observe it till he was lying in the hospital a day or two after—I did not notice any appearance of blows at the time or previously—as I was talking to Mrs. Brown, Lee crossed the road—I crossed after him, and asked what they wanted to quarrel for—he made use of foul language, and said God strike him dead, he would do for him that night—he called him a b—y f—g <hi rend="italic">sod</hi>—I said "Nonsense; what is the use of talking that fashion?"—Brown came up at the time, and said "Have not you done yet; you had better go away"—Lee then drew out a knife—I said to Brown, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, come away, for <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> has got a knife"—Brown said "If he has got a knife I will take it away from him"—Lee did not say anything when he drew the knife—they faced each other; Brown was sideways towards Lee—he was going to take the knife from him—he did not strike any blow or say anything—Lee then struck Brown a blow under the left collar-bone, with a brown-handled knife—I saw the knife when he took it out of his pocket—it was shut when he took it out—he opened it—after Brown was struck, he put his hand up, and said to Quiltey, who was Standing by, "Oh, Jack! he has done it!"—Quiltey said "Done what?"—he said "He has stabbed me," and he then reeled back—I had hold of Brown previous to Lee stabbing him, and Quiltey said "Leave go of him, Emma; I will see fair play with them," and then Lee struck the blow—I was endeavouring to keep Lee from him—I had hold of Brown; I wanted to keep him back—he was not trying to get at Lee, but I wanted to prevent him being struck with the knife—Quiltey knew Lee had the knife, because I told him—I took hold of Brown almost directly I saw Lee take the knife out—when Brown reeled back he threw his coat open, and I saw blood fall from him—then Quiltey and Brown ran away in the direction of University Hospital—Lee went away—I did not see him any more after that till he was taken into custody—I went after Brown and Quiltey—I saw them in a chemist's shop, and then they went to the hospital—I had known Brown for many years; I was an intimate friend of his—I was not a friend of Lee's—I had known him also, but I was no friend of his—I had known him for several years by knowing his sister, Mrs. Brown—Brown would have been thirty-one years of age on the 25th of next September.</p>

               <p>was rather passionate when in drink—I believe Lee and him were on very good terms always—Lee would never keep away from him, he was always following him about—Brown was not frequently at my house nor I at his—he only came once to my house—we were not on very intimate terms of late years; we were some years ago; six or seven perhaps—I was married at that time—my husband was not sent to penal servitude for fifteen years—it was not my husband at all who you are alluding to—my husband is dead—he has been dead some twelve months, or more than that—he was convicted here—my mother, my sister, and I were tried with him—my mother was also convicted, for uttering counterfeit coin—my husband's sentence was seven years—the next time I was tried in this Court was two years ago—the first time was three years ago—I was convicted the second time—that was for uttering—I don't know anything about my sister, because I had been away from home, I can only answer for myself—I believe she was convicted—those are the only occasions upon which I have been convicted—I have never been in custody for other cases—I have been tried twice and convicted once—I know a man named Copeland—after my trial with my husband I went and lived with Copeland for a short time—I had not seen Brown for several years then—I knew him—he had been a friend of Copeland's, but had been away for several years—I don't know where Copeland was tried—he was sentenced to fifteen years' penal servi<lb/>tude—I can't tell you what it was for, it was some time before I was with him—it was for an affair at Battersea—I believe it was for coining—I was told so—I believe when Brown was away he was undergoing penal servitude—I don't think he was on ticket-of-leave at the time he met with his death—his last sentence was eighteen months—he had been convicted more than once—I can't tell you when he was first convicted—Lee can tell you better than I can—it was some years ago, I could not say exactly how long—it was for felony—I can't tell what kind of felony—I was not so acquainted with him as to know—I can't tell you the next time he was convicted—I should think it was in 1864—he was absent from me then four or five years—how I knew him was living in the neighbourhood; that was all the intimacy at first—I was not living with Copeland at that time—I only lived with him a very short time before he was convicted—I knew that Brown was undergoing some punishment when he was away in 1864—I don't know what it was, I believe it was for felony—the next time I knew of his being convicted was three or four years ago—I think that was the last—I don't know what that was for—he had eighteen months then, I believe—he was not on ticket-of-leave at the time of his death—they sent him back to do the remainder of his time the last time he was convicted—I can't tell exactly how long he had been out of prison before 20th May—perhaps a twelve-month—my name is Emma Newman Wilson—I did not think it mattered my dropping the Wilson—I always go in the name of Emma Newman—my husband's name was Edward Newman Wilson—I did not call myself Wilson in his lifetime—I always called myself Newman when I was living with him—I never knew counterfeit coin made in my house, in the house where I used to dwell—it has not been finished or polished in my house, or the house where I lodged—I have uttered it, and I have been punished for it—Brown did not give it me to utter—I have not been in the habit of doing it lately, not for some time—it was Copeland that I uttered them for the last time—I have never seen Brown do it, but I believe Lee and him have done it together—I did not utter any on the night of 20th May—I believe Brown</p>

               <p>did, and Lee also, it was not in my presence—I don't know what it was for—I was told that three of Copeland's friends were convicted and sentenced to fifteen years', but I know nothing about it—I was not associating with Copeland at that time—I was not living with any one—I did not know the three men—I did not know Copeland at that time—from what I have been told they were friends of his—on the night of 20th May, between 6 and 7 o'clock, I met Lee at the corner of Henry Street—I did not ask him to accompany me to Oxford Street, and show me Jackson and Graham's work<lb/>shop—I told him where I was going, and that I had promised to meet Brown there—I scarcely know why I went to meet Brown—when we went into the public-house a pint of porter was drawn, and Brown and Lee drank out of it—I had a glass of brandy, for which Brown paid—Brown then went back to his work, and Lee and I remained in the street—he finished his porter before Brown came out of the public-house, and we came out together—I did not swear that I had nothing to drink on the first occasion I saw Brown—I did not have anything myself then, it was the second occasion we went in that I had the brandy; I swear that—Lee did not go into any public-house while we were standing in Newman Street—when Brown came out again four of his fellow-workmen were with him—I did not before that go into a public-house and pass a counterfeit Shilling at Brown's request—I had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and a few coppers with me that day—that was all I had—Brown had not given me any money that day—I had not seen him—I had nothing that purported to be money—when we met Brown and his four friends they invited Lee and I to go into the Blue Posts, and have something more to drink—they remained drinking there for some time—they were drinking ale—they had no gin, to my knowledge—I had some brandy—I never touched their ale, nothing but brandy—I can't give you the names of the other men—I don't know them—we were not there more than three-quarters of an hour, perhaps not so much—I did not see any<lb/>thing pass between Brown and Lee—I did not hear of his giving Lee three counterfeit florins to tender in payment—I only know what Brown told me when he was dying—he said that he himself had passed two counterfeit half-crowns, and that was what they quarrelled upon—we went from the Blue Posts down Marylebone Street, through Cleveland Street, into the Euston Road, through Stanhope Street to the Cock public-house—Brown and Lee did not go into any public-house on the way; I swear that—they were not tipsy—Lee was the worst of the two—I believe he had had the most to drink—Brown was sober, I believe—he had no appearance of being the worse for drink—he had been drinking—I could not say he was sober—the prisoner was not—I discovered that before we got to the Cock—we got there about 9.30—I am not a very good judge of time, whether it was 9.40 or 9.20 I would not pledge myself—only Lee and me and Brown went into the Cock together—there were several there, perhaps seven or eight—the four friends left us in Newman Street—they called for a pot of stout when they went in—I did not have anything to drink there then—I did not have another glass of brandy—I sat down, and Lee sat down for a few minutes—Brown was standing amongst a lot of people, drinking the stout—Lee was not talking to me—he sat some distance from me—I did not see Brown go up to Lee and ask him what he intended to do—I went to the further end of the bar to speak to Mrs. Brown, and then the quarrel commenced—they were perhaps half a dozen yards from me then—I was in the large bar—I turned my head and saw them quarrel<lb/>ing,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Brown, and live at No. 4, Henry Passage, Henry Street, Hampstead Road—the prisoner is my brother—the deceased was my husband's brother—he was about thirty years of age; the prisoner is between thirty-one and thirty-two—on Whit Monday I was in the Cock public-house in Stanhope Street—I went there about 8.30 or 9 o'clock, with my husband and one or two friends, and had some drink there—while there, the prisoner, the deceased, and Emma Newman came in together, between 9.30 and 10 o'clock—they called for a pot of stout, and asked me to drink, which I did—I then turned my back to them, and went across the bar to the same department, and was standing talking to a woman, and Emma Newman came over to me, and asked me how my chil<lb/>dren were getting on, and she said to me "Oh! Jane, they are fighting"—I turned round, and saw Lee and Brown entangled the one with the other—I could not say whether Newman's face was towards them, my back was towards them; she was standing aside of me—she told me they were fighting, and I turned round to look at them—she said "Part them, for I can't"—I went across to them, to part them as well as I was able—Brown</p>

               <p>had my brother up against the partition of the bar, and they were close together, and fighting—I did not notice which struck the blows; I saw that they were fighting, struggling together—I believe they were parted, and Brown was turned out, I think, by the barman—my brother was bleeding from the face, I think from the nose, and there was a place over the eye, I could not say which side. that was bleeding as well—I did not see what became of Newman—I should think she could see them fighting from where she stood; she was quite close to my shoulder—I asked for some water, over the bar, to bathe my brother's face, and I wiped the blood off with a handkerchief; I then put it into the water, and squeezed it two or three times, and they gave me some more water, and I bathed him again—Mrs. Quiltey assisted me—after a few minutes, I and Mrs. Quiltey came out, and I think my brother came out with us—I could not swear whether he came out with us or not—I think his nose had left off bleeding then; the mark on his face was still bleeding a little, the blood was running down—from the time Brown was turned out, to the time Mrs. Quiltey and I came out, I should think was about ten minutes—after I came out I stood at the corner of the Cock, with Mrs. Quiltey and my brother—Newman came up and spoke to us, and while we were talking, Brown came up and stood at the post; I did not see which way he came—my brother did not say anything about him before he came up, not to my knowledge—I asked Newman what they were quarrelling about—she said she knew, but she would not tell me—my brother did not say what they had quarrelled about—I said to him "Why don't you keep away from him, you don't seem to agree, why don't you keep from one another?"—I cannot say what he said, they both began to jangle, and I was shoving my brother away to go away, I was afraid they were going to fight again—they began to talk one to the other, what it was about I could not say—I then lost sight of them both; they both went away, I went over to the other corner; some vans came on with a pleasure party—I believe Mrs. Quiltey went across with me, I stood talking to some persons, there was a lot gathered together—not for many minutes, I should say about twenty minutes—and all at once I heard them say that James Brown was stabbed, and I turned round and saw him, and saw some men taking him towards the hospital—I had heard nothing be<lb/>fore that to attract my attention—I did not see anything of my brother at that time—both the men seemed to have had something to drink—but of the two I think my brother was the worst—they were both I should say about half drunk, and Lee was the worst—I am not aware that Brown used to carry a knife—I don't know that my brother did, I have never seen him with one—I was examined at the inquest not before the Magistrate—I saw my brother in Newgate after the inquest was adjourned—I asked what the quarrel was about—he said it was all through Emma Newman, she met him at the Cock public-house, and they went together to meet James Brown, and when they met him they had something to drink, that she carried the bad money, and gave him three to pass, he passed three and then Brown passed same, Brown made him give him his share out of one, and then he passed some and he would not share it, and then the quarrel across—Brown wanted him to pass three more 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces, to pay him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that he owed him—he said he did not think it would be so bad as I thought, for the chaplain of Newgate knew all about her career, for she had been convicted at Newgate and likewise her mother and her husband—he also said that Brown used to go to her house and they used to make the money between</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think my brother is of a very warm heart and kindly disposition, and as a rule very good tempered, I never saw him out of tem<lb/>per much—as far as I knew he and Brown were always good friends—I did not hear Brown call for a glass of brandy at the Cock and give it to New<lb/>man—I don't whether she had any brandy—I did not hear any of the con<lb/>versation that took place until Newman called my attention to the fact that they were fighting—my brother was not sitting down then, Brown had him up against the partition—a deal of blood came from him, there was a great deal of blood all over his face—I did not see that his mouth was cut, only the place over his eye, and next day as he was going into the police-van at Marylebone, I saw that the blood was dried on his face—I did not, whilst bathing his face, hear anyone say, "Here he is coming again," but I turned round and saw Brown in the door, looking in, and he said something, and put up his fist to my brother—that was after he had been turned out—he came back again—I should think that was ten minutes afterwards—I don't remember my brother telling me, in Newgate, that Brown said if he did not give him the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that he owed him he would take it out of his head—I did not hear my brother say that if he came at him again he would set a big man, or somebody else, on him—I have told you all that I know—my brother seemed very much distressed—there was great con<lb/>fusion at the time, and a great crowd—I do think freely from my heart that it would never have happened but for that woman.</p>

I am the wife of John Quiltey, and live at 8, Henry Passage—on the night of Whit Monday I was in the Cock public-house, about 10 o'clock, as near as I can guess—I had known Lee about ten months—I knew James Brown and Mrs. Brown—I did not know Newman—I did not see them come in—I was talking to a friend, a woman I only knew by sight—Brown was sitting down, and he asked me how the child was—I afterwards heard Lee and Brown having a few words; I did not hear what they were about—I saw Brown stand up and strike Lee with his fist, and the blood came from his face; he was sitting alongside of Brown—I and Mrs. Brown separated them—Lee struck back when Brown struck him; he did not get up from his seat; Brown kept him down, he had not power to get up—I could not see for the crowd whether there were more blows struck or not—a lot of people rushed in at the door to see the fight—Mr. Carnell, the landlord, handed some water over the bar to bathe the prisoner's face—one of Mr. Carnell's servants had put Brown out at that time—I did not notice him before he was put out; the crowd was too great—I did not notice whether he had any marks—the prisoner was bleeding from the face and nose—Mrs. Brown and I washed the blood off his face with a pocket-handkerchief, and squeezed the handkerchief—I don't believe there was any second water; I don't remember—we were attending to him for a few minutes—his face stopped bleeding—I remained in the public-house about five or ten minutes—I heard the children shout out that the vans were coming, and I went to look after my husband, who had been to Riddlesdown—I did not see Lee after that night; he left the public-house before me, and I don't know what became of him—I saw my husband, and gave him the baby; he stood talking to some friends, and I went round the corner, and I heard no more till I heard the people shout out that Brown</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Henry Passage, Henry Street, Hampstead Road—on Whit Monday I had been out with a van—I came home with it, and drew up at the Hen and Chickens, in Stanhope Street, about 10.30—I have known the prisoner for a number of years; he was not a friend of mine—I knew Brown about the same time; he was a friend as far as this, he stood for my child—when I drew up with the van I did not see Brown or Lee—I saw Newman standing at the corner by herself, six or seven yards from the van—she told me that Bob and Jem had been having a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and that Jem had cut Bob's face, and they were frightened if they came to fight outside that Bob's <hi rend="italic">mob</hi> would <hi rend="italic">slip</hi> into Jem—I said, no it would not be such, for I would see Jem righted—I then walked away; my wife came up and I took the child, and went and stood on the kerb by the side of the vans, talking to the man with the horses—I saw Newman talking with Lee, on the area railings of a shop next to the Hen and Chickens, three or four yards from me—I heard some one say, "Here comes Brown," and I saw Brown coming straight down on the pavement on the same side; he came direct facing Lee—he said to Newman, "Mind yourself, Emma;" she was between them—she said, "Here comes Jem"—Brown was moving towards Lee, as I thought, in the attitude of fighting; he had his hands up in a fighting attitude—I did not see whether he struck any blow or not—I did not see what was done next, because I turned round to get my child away—I did not observe whether or not Brown had anything in his hands; I did not notice anything in Lee's hands—I did not hear any more till I turned back again, and Brown turned round to me and said he was stabbed—I took him before the light and opened his shirt, and saw that he was stabbed in the breast—I don't know where Lee was then—I took Brown to the chemist's, and afterwards in a cab to the hospital—both Lee and Brown had been drinking, but of the two I think Lee was the worst, by appearance—I had known them both for a good many years—I never knew them quarrel before—I helped to undress Brown at the hospital; I cut his clothes off, his coat and waistcoat, not his trousers; they took them into the ward with him—I did not look in to his pockets or examine his clothes—I did not see any knife.</p>

I examined Mr. Rengrove's house on Friday morning, 31st March—an entry had been effected by forcing the catch off the back kitchen window—on 2nd June I went to 38, Devonshire Street, Mile End Road, which is about a mile and a half from the Roman Road, with Lambert—I saw the prisoner there and told him we were police officers, and we were going to take him in custody for being concerned in breaking and entering the premises of Mr. Rengrove, 44, Roman Road, on the morning of 31st—he said he knew nothing of it—I then asked him if he had any property in his house which did not belong to him—he said "No"—I found a cupboard in the kitchen which was locked—I asked him twice for the key—he said he had not got it, it was lost—I told him if he did not unlock it I should break it open, which I did with a poker—I found in it 33 juvenile suits, 19 pairs of trousers, several coats, and six jackets, and some other things were found in different parts of the house—I asked him to account for the possession of them—he said he did not break into the house, the other man broke in, but he brought the things away, he was there—I took him and the property to the station, and it was iden<lb/>tified.</p>

Chance Brothers, Finsbury Circus—on Friday afternoon, 21st June, about 4 o'clock, I was in Princes Street, near the Bank, intending to go into an urinal, but I changed my mind, and came out on the northern side, in Lothbury—the prisoner and another man came up to me; I thought I had seen the prisoner before</p>

               <p>—I examined his face carefully, and watched him—when he got up to me I was pinioned up against the wall of the urinal, and immediately found a hand going to my watch; it was removed, and I saw it go in the direction of the other man, but could not see what was in it—they both pressed against me, and the prisoner removed my watch from my chain—I dashed into the street, holding up my umbrella and shouting, "Stop thief!"—I am a little lame—I do not think I lost sight of the prisoner—I am certain he is the man I saw running, and I think I saw him all the way, but I can only judge by his back—I have not the slightest doubt the prisoner is the man who took my watch.</p>

I was about twenty or twenty-five yards from the men—mine is rather a confused sight, but I can see objects at a considerable distance—I did not ask to have another look at the prisoner at the station because I was not sure of him, but as I did not know how long it might be before I had to appear against him I wished to examine his face clearly and fully, that his features might not go out of my mind—he was brought in, and I had a good long look at him for about three minutes, that I might keep him in my mind.</p>

I am not the man"—I said "Well, we will wait and hear what the people have to say"—the prosecutor came up, saying "I have lost my watch; that is the man—I said "Your watch has gone round the corner with the prisoner's friend"—I should know the other man again.</p>

On Monday morning, 26th May, I was on duty in the Essex Road, Islington, about 5.15—from information I received I went to a low wall where I could see the backs of the houses in Cross Street—I looked over the wall, and I there saw the prisoner Holmes and a man named Llewellyn who is now under sentence—they looked me straight in the face, and I asked them what they were doing there—they made no reply, but immediately went to the back kitchen window of 35, Cross Street, and forced their way through that window into the house—I ran round to the front door—that house was untenanted, but there was some one minding it—the door was open, and Holmes and Llewellyn stood in the doorway; it was partly open; when they saw me they pushed the door to again—I forced it open with my shoulder, and seized hold of Llewellyn in the hall—at that time Holmes was about two yards from him—it was quite light; the sun was shining—three gentlemen came in to assist me, and they seized hold of Llewellyn too—I let them hold him, and pursued after Holmes—he made his escape down the back kitchen stairs, and out of the window he had got through—I saw a third man standing behind the door in the passage, and when I went in he ran out the front way—I can't speak positively as to that man being Dennis—Llewellyn was taken to the station—I found property tied up in three large bundles in the garden at the rear of 35—I took it to the station, and Mr. Carruthers identified it.</p>

I live at 13, High Street, Bow—on Tuesday afternoon, 18th June, I went with my brother Stephen and a young man named Jackson down to the River Lea to bathe, near the Hackney Marshes—when we got there was a crowd of people, about on the bank and bathing—they tried to put their hands in my brother's trousers pocket, as they were lying on the ground, and we came away—as we were walking along the prisoners and the others threw stones at us, and they kept on for about a quarter of a mile, until we came under a railway arch—we waited there for them to pass us, instead of passing us some went in front and some behind us, and before I was aware of it I was throttled and thrown on the ground—I could not say who did it—there were seventeen or eighteen of them—I was on the ground from five to seven minutes, and while I was on the ground I was kicked on the head and about the body—Wood kicked me on the head—Standley kicked me in the back, and one, not apprehended, hit me in the eye with a stone—they tried to put their hands in my pockets, but I kept my hands in—I had two half-crowns—they threatened to dash my brains out if I did not take my hand out, and I would not—I had hold of the towel with one hand and the other was in my pocket—Wood jumped upon me and kicked me in the head, because I would not take my hand out—I said I would give them all I got if they let me get up and did not murder me—they let me get up, and then those on the outskirts of the mob began to run away when they saw some men coming over the railway bridge—one of the crowd, not any of the prisoners, snatched my pin out of my scarf and said "I will have this," and my hat was lying on the ground, and they took that—one of the men put an old hat on my head which did not belong to me—after that they ran away—my brother and Jackson were standing about three yards from me, not being touched—when they ran away I went on the opposite side of the bridge, and we went over the bridge and followed them—the prisoners were amongst those we were following—they weat</p>

Office at the Bank of England—all the luggage he brought was a little paste-board box carefully tied up—he said his brother was coming up, and he was going to bring his luggage—in consequent of what he told me, I let him have the rooms, and tea and sugar and supplies—he never paid me—I have enquired at Eaton Square, he had not got a brother living there—I enquired at every place—I could find out nothing about him—the prisoner stopped from the 2nd December till the 13th—on the 13th he went out in the morning—he was pressed every morning for payment, and he said on the 13th that his brother would sure to be up on the 15th—he ordered his fire to be lit—I never saw him again until I picked him out at the Lambeth Police Court—I believed what he told me, and I took him in because he represented that he was in a position to pay.</p>
