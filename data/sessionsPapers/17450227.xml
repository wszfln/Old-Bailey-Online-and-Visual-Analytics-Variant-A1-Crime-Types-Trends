My wife was afraid I should take the money, and she hid it behind the bed - as she told me: the Prisoner went to make the bed, when she had done she went away, and has not been seen for a year and a quarter till the other day - I saw her take the money from under the bed's head.</p>

            . The Prisoner came to my house for a lodging that night, and several other nights - That night was about five weeks before last Christmas was twelvemonth. My husband wanted to go out, and I was not willing he should, and he being angry, for fear he should take the money which I had in my pocket, I put it behind the bed between the wall and the bed's head - There were fifty four shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go out for?</p>
               <p>Currey. For a minute or two, in order to pacify my husband; and he said, if I went out, I should stay till I was cold: the Prisoner came out in two or three minutes after, and says to me, do not go in till I come back again; she then had her hand under her apron; said I, where are you going? she said she was going for water, which was about eight or nine yards off, but she did not come back: when I went in I looked for my money, and it was gone. I told my husband of it, and asked him who had been there; he said nobody but Mrs. McCardell (for the Prisoner went by that name then) - When she was before the Justice she denied she took it, but about two days afterwards in New Prison she owned she saw me put it behind the bed, and that she took it away.</p>

            . On the 28th of January between the hours of nine and ten, the Prisoner picked me up at the corner of Crown Court Soho, and asked me for something to drink: she kept a long side of me, and entreated me to go to her lodging in <placeName id="t17450227-2-crimeloc9">Peter's Street</placeName>

I called for a quartern of shrub, and paid for it: she asked me to lie with her, which I was weak enough to consent to. I asked her what she must have; she told me a shilling; I gave her the shilling; I had three guineas and a moidore in my pocket before I lay with her; after she got off the bed, she went out of the room under pretence of calling the maid of the house to bring a chamber-pot; I immediately missing my money, went after her, and told her she should not go out of the house, for I had lost so much money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she gone out of the room before you missed your money?</p>
               <p>Puckett. Yes; without the door; she came back into the room, and said I might search her clothes. I searched her; she pulled off her clothes, and I could find no money about her. I told her, if she knew any thing of the money, and would let me have it again, I would not trouble her any further; but she still denied it, and I charged the watch with her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray, Sir, was I out of the room?</p>
               <p>Puckett. Yes; you was out of the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not out of the room.</p>
               <p>Puckett. You was out of the room-door as far as the top of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You searched me, and I pulled all my clothes off: the landlady was present at the same time: I took off my shoes and stockings too.</p>
               <p>Puckett. That is a story, you pulled your shoes off, and you would have pulled your stockings off, but I said it did not signify any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking?</p>
               <p>Puckett. No; nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that this money might not seatter out of your pocket while you was upon the bed?</p>
               <p>Puckett. I took the clothes off the bed, and searched, and there was no money upon the bed - after I had searched her. <rs id="t17450227-2-verdict10" type="verdictDescription">

            . The Prisoner was my servant, and absconded from my house the 25th of January last; I wondered she did not return, but I had then no suspicion of being robbed. I went the 26th at night to a press to change a guinea, and missed the rings and the money which I saw the morning she absconded her service: the press did lock, but I found it open.</p>

            . The Prisoner came to my mother's house on a Friday night, and said she had got some money, and was to go to Westram in Kent, and desired to lay there all night: my mother let her lie there, she said she was to go out in the morning at four o'clock. The next morning my father and I went with her to the inn, for she said she was to go down in the coach. When we came to the Borough, she said it was too late for the coach, and was afraid she must walk it: when we came to the turnpike we went into an alehouse, had a pot of beer, and two peny worth of bread<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174502270004"/> and cheese; there was a coach going by the door, and she desired me to ask the coachman where he was going; he said to Croydon; she agreed to go with him: when we came to the coach door, she desired I would go with her; I went with her: when she came there, she desired the coachman to enquire for somebody, but there was no such person to be found: we went to the Cross Keys and had tea for breakfast, and some beef-stakes for dinner; then she went to a shop keeper in the town, and bought several things, a gown, a petticoat, and some handkerchiefs; then we went to the Cross Keys again, and she told me there was no carriage to Westram till Monday, so I staid with her Sunday and part of Monday, then she paid for my coach hire, and sent me up to London.</p>

             where the Prisoner was gone, and about one o'clock on Tuesday morning, January 29, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Barber, and I set out after her from Mr. Barber's, and found her at the George Inn at Westram standing in the drinking-room; I called her on one side, went into another room, and said, how could you use your master and mistress so as to rob them? with that she laid down these two gold rings before us, then she went out and told me she had not made any use of her master's money, but had left the money and rings at the Bell at Westram: Mr. Roberts and she went out together, and she made her escape from him.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the woman of the house say?</p>
               <p>Horsefield. She said she never saw a farthing of the money, and that the Prisoner spent but three pence in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether these are Mr. Barber's rings ?</p>
               <p>Horsefield. I believe this is Mr. Barbers wife's wedding ring; Mr. Roberts could read writing, but I cannot.</p>

            . On Monday the 18th of February I went over the way to a neighbour's, and she desired me to stay with her a little; I told her I had left my door open. I went over again, and saw the Prisoner in my room with my husband's coat in her hand; she had taken it off a nail, but had not time to put it cross her arm. Seeing a strang person there, I was frightened, and asked her what she did there; she said, that either Mr. Williams or Mrs. Williams had sent her for the coat; I said the coat was mine, and she should not have it; she said it was hers, and she would have it; I told her I would take it away; then she took hold of me by the handkerchief which was about my neck, and shook me. I called to a woman who was in the house, and she said she would have me send for an officer; I said I was but a stranger in the place, and did not know where to get one: I said the Prisoner was an impudent jade, and I would get an officer for her; she said, if I did not get an officer for her, she would get one for me, so I staid and kept the Prisoner, and Mrs. Treddell went for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner do with the coat?</p>
               <p>Drayton. She laid the coat down, and said, D - n you, there is the coat, I have not robbed you of any thing,</p>
               <p>Treddell. Mrs. Drayton called me down stairs, when I came down, the Prisoner had the coat in her hand, she laid the coat down upon the dresser, and said, D - n you, I have not robbed you of nothing; D - n you, you are a saucy jade to stop me without a constable, I will have one for you: I said she should have one in a little time, and that I believed it was not the first time she had deserved one, so I got a constable, and she was taken up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had received some money of my mistress, and went to buy a gown, and the gown was too strait for me, and I went in there to enquire for one Mrs. Williams, a mantua maker, and a woman shoved by me (I do not know whether that gentlewoman [Mrs. Drayton ] is the person ) and said, What do you do here, how came that coat there?</p>
               <p>Drayton. I did not say how came the coat there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had not I a new gown on?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The gentlewoman insisted upon my company, kept me three quarters of an hour, and then charged a constable with me. <rs id="t17450227-4-verdict18" type="verdictDescription">

I went to seek after him, and found him behind Old Street Church wheeling of bricks: I charged him with stealing the wig, went with him to a publick house, and he delivered me the wig out of his pocket. I had some knowledge of him, he had been shaved there at different times.</p>

I went up into the warehouse, and there was the head of a hogshead open, and it seemed to be the same sugar of that hogshead. I take it to be the property of Mr. Eliakim Palmer. I would have drubbed him with a hoop stick, and have sent him about his business; but he threatened us if we meddled with him, for he said the sugar was given him at Smart's Key.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you perceive there had been any marks of violence on any part of the house?</p>
               <p>White. There was a hole cut in the window-shutter of the kitchen, and it was unbarred on the inside. Here is the handle of an instrument which the coopers use in boring, which was found on the outside of the kitchen window. They had let themselves out at the street-door, and taken the key with them; so that we could not get into the street without taking off the lock of the door. We found the key in our own area, and a boy found the drawer, which the money was in, in a neighbour's area.</p>

            . The bureau was broke open: there was a glass case upon the bureau, and in this glass case there was a drawer with money in it, which they took away. I believe there were between five and six pounds. There was in that drawer a small buckle and some pieces of silver. I lost a great deal of linen, but have not heard of any of it since. - I was sure the house was fast when I went to bed, for I always look to it. - I was not the last person up. - There was a hole cut in the kitchen window shutter, through which they put a hand in, turned a screw, and the bar fell down upon some pewter, and that, it seems, made a noise.

            . I am servant to Mr. White. The kitchen window was fast when I went to bed, which was about two minutes after my master and mistress went up. I was the last person below stairs. I got up about seven o'clock in the morning, and when I came down into the kitchen, I saw the casement open, and a hole cut in the window shutter, and the bar was down. It was an iron bar, which screwed in the middle: it was unscrewed; half of it was up and half down, and several things were pulled about the kitchen. - I did not hear any noise in the night. The shop was stripped, and the tea taken away. There were about ten canisters with tea taken out of the shop. - The canisters were found in a gardener's ground near Aylosse-street. - The shop is in Little Aylosse-street, Goodmans-fields.</p>

            , and I, broke open this Shop. One of the Jews told me, about three days before, there was a great deal of tea in it (Saunshus and Boyers are both Jews.) We went there about twelve o'clock at night, and there was a light above stairs; so we went to an ale-house just over against the house, till it was a proper time, and had four or five full pots of beer and some bread and cheese, and staid there till about one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the house?</p>
               <p>Mecum. I never was in the house before. I saw this young woman in the house then [Mrs. Spring's daughter.] After we had committed the robbery, we went to Stansbury's house: I lodged there at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Stansbury's house?</p>
               <p>Mecum. I kept a house in Whitechapel, and he lodged with me there. This tool was broke in breaking into the house [the cooper's tool, mentioned before.]</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174502270008"/>Q. Who broke the house open?</p>
               <p>Mecum. Stansbury did it, for none of us could do it so well as he could. We got down into the area: Stansbury took a pane of glass our, and then fell a boring some holes in the shutter with the iron that belonged to this instrument; then he put his hand in, and the bar fell down upon some pewter. The pewter fell down and made a vast great noise: we stood two or three minutes, to hear if any body came down, but we could not hear any body. Stansbury used to take snuff, and in his snuff-box he had some tinder; we had a flint and a steel, and so struck a light, and then put a bit of candle into a dark lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you the candle?</p>
               <p>Mecum. We never were without it when we went to do such things, we always carried it in our pockets. Then Stansbury and I accordingly got in, and let the other two in at the street door. There was a great latch and a screw over the latch. of the door, which we unscreweed; the key was in the street door. Then we went directly to the tea canisters, took about six or seven of them off the shelves, and put them on the counter. Then we saw a thing like a scrutore (there was an ink bottle in it, and that we threw down.) We took out a drawer, and there was a little white canvas bag with some gold and silver in it; afterwards we went to the till, and took about seven or eight shillings out of it, chiefly in half-pence: there were some drawers underneath the scrutore, which we broke open, and there were ruffled shirts, handkerchiefs, aprons, and several other things of wearing apparel - I believe there might be eight or nine shirts (we sold them in a hurry for fear of having the house searched:) then we took to the best of my knowledge six canisters of tea, and two bundles of linen (there were two pair of bran new pumps) which we carried home: when we carried them home we locked the street door, and took the key away with us; we came back again, and then we took away about four canisters of tea. There was some silver which was not brought to light; I know nothing of that; and they broke something, I believe it was a pair of tea tongs: then we locked the street door, and somebody threw the key down the area, and said, D - n them, let them find the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry these things?</p>
               <p>Mecum. To my house in White Chapel; Boyers, (for he used to buy stolen goods as well as go a thieving) gave us 3 l. for the clothes - what silver there was he had with the clothes for that money - we moved the tea to Boyer's house in Houndsditch, and he moved it to an empty room that he had in Houndsditch: we emptied the tea before we moved it, and put it into different parcels, because we would not mix it, and threw the canisters into a garden near a dunghill as you go from London to Stepney.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire the witnesses who have given their evidence may be put out of Court, because I have some questions to ask him about some pieces of coin. [At the Prisoner's desire the witnesses were ordered to withdraw.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was pleased to say there was gold in the bag. I desire to know what coin it was?</p>
               <p>Mecum. To the best of my knowledge there were two guineas, half a guinea, half a moidore, and the rest was in silver. I had a guinea, and nine pence in half pence for my share of the money. I had not done these things if you had not persuaded me to it. When your wife was under sentence of transportation, you came to my house to get money this way in order to save her - He lay there upon the account of going out with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire to know whether he has any body to prove this, for he will say any thing to save himself, as this sort of people do. Have not you been tried for theft in this Court before?</p>
               <p>Mecum. Yes; and I was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says I made him go a thieving with me.</p>
               <p>Mecum. You asked me the question, Mr. Stansbury.</p>
               <p>[After Mr. Stansbury had asked the Evidence what questions he thought proper, the witnesses were called into Court again.]</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. White. You was mentioning that there were some pieces of money in a drawer in a bureau: what were they put in?</p>
               <p>White. In a linen bag - a canvas bag, I think with red strings to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was there in the bag?</p>
               <p>White. There were three guineas, a half guinea, and half a moidore in gold; I believe I put in that night about twenty five shillings in silver, and there was a half crown and some six pences in it before I put the other silver in.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the street door key when you fastened the door?</p>
               <p>White. I left it in the lock.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the door fastened?</p>
               <p>White. There is a bolt and a latch which screws down.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the screw over the latch?</p>
               <p>White. The screw is in the latch.</p>

               <p>Q. In what month did you see the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Spring. It was in October - the sixth day of October.</p>

               <p>Spring. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he with the Prisoner at that time?</p>
               <p>Spring. I believe he was - I think there were six of them - they came in between ten and eleven at night, and staid I believe till nigh twelve, and they all went out together - they did not come back again - they had only three tankards of beer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How came you to take such particular notice of me?</p>
               <p>Spring. Because the people in the house took notice of you, and did not like any of you; the gentlemen thought you were slippery rogues.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What clothes had I on?</p>
               <p>Spring. I believe you had that coat and that wig you have now, and you sat and slept with your head against a pair of bellows by the chimney corner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mr. White. Has not there been two of the persons taken up on this account, and one now in custody?</p>

               <p>White. There were three persons taken up on suspicion, but I do not know what became of them, they were not taken up on my account: I had a warrant to take up Mecum, Stansbury, and Saunshus.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What was it that induced you to take out a warrant a gainst these persons and me?</p>
               <p>White. There is a person that pretends to be a thieftaker informed me of these three men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I think the gentleman who is aggrieved, says, that his house was broke open the eighth or ninth of October.</p>
               <p>Mecum. It was in the night between the sixth and seventh of October.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what month it was in?</p>
               <p>Mecum. I did not take any account of it; I remember they came home on a Saturday night about one o'clock; Stansbury came in first with a white bundle and other things, then my husband came and the other two came after him - I believe my husband brought in some canisters of tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were there besides?</p>
               <p>Mecum. Boyers and Saunshus - there were two bundles brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they bring them at once?</p>
               <p>Mecum. No; at twice - The bundles came in first and some canisters, and then the other canisters.</p>

               <p>Mecum. Five years last Borough Fair.</p>

               <p>Court. Look on the Prisoner, are you sure he is the man?</p>
               <p>Lane. I know him very well, my Lord; he rode up to me on the right hand side, offered a pistol to me, and demanded my money, or I was a dead man; and that I might be certain what he did say, I asked him, and said, What did you say; he repeated the same words again, and said, Deliver your money, or you are a dead man, or words to the same purpose: I do not justly know, whether he said he would blow my brains out, for I was a little surprised: then I rode from him down the town, and called out a highwayman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he meet you or overtake you?</p>
               <p>Lane. He overtook me. As I was telling my story to some journeymen carpenters on this side of Bow Bridge, and describing the horse, I saw a man come riding down the town; he walked his horse, and was whistling: I imagined it to be him, and it was him. He came up; I let him go a few yards past me, and then challenged him, and said, You are the villain that just now offered to rob me by the church: he made answer, I am just come from the Bell in Warwick Lane; I said, Come from where you will, I am sure you are the man; he said, that cannot be, for you were describing him to be upon a black horse, and I am upon a bay horse, (but it was a dark chesnut horse, I thought it had been a black horse.) I was describing the horse to the men, and he overheard me; this was not above five minutes after his first attacking me. I said, I am very positive you are the man; he said, will you swear that; I said, yes, I will; with that he set spurs to his horse and rode very hard down towards Essex; I rode after him, and pursued him, and he got into the marshes, then some other people rode after him, and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Are you sure it was a chesnut horse?</p>
               <p>Lane. I believe it was, but I am very sure you are the man.</p>

            . I live by Bow Bridge in the Parish of Westham: on the 8th of December between seven and eight in the morning, Mr. Isaac Lane came riding up to my door, and asked me, if I saw a highwayman; I said, I did not see any: says Mr. Lane, then he is turned down some of these ways. I looked down, but could not see any body: as I was going into the marshes, I was told there was a man rode into the marshes: there is on osier ground, and I saw a place where a horse had leaped over. I tracked the prints of a horse's feet about 20 yards into the osier-ground, and suspected that the highwayman was there. I called more people to my assistance, and we went up all on a-breast and took him in the osier ground; another person laid hold of him first, but before he was laid hold of he opened his great coat, and said, he had no fire arms: we searched him, but could not find any about him.</p>

I went up to the deceased and spoke to him as he lay upon the bed, but he was not able to give me any answer with relation to what had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the deceased in his behaviour?</p>
               <p>Elers. He was always addicted to quarrelling, but as to the Prisoner, during the time he lived with me, he always behaved civilly, and was not given to quarrel.</p>

             (surgeon.) On the 22d of January I was called between two and three in the afternoon to visit a patient who was very much hurt, and they believed the man was dying. I made haste, and found the patient in a dangerous condition; the blood ran out at his left ear, and out at his mouth too: upon the left side of his head behind the ear there was a contusion wound, of an inch and a quarter in length, and half an inch in breadth. I asked the deceased how he came by this misfortune, but he would give me no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in a condition to speak?</p>
               <p>Deickman. It will come by and by. I asked the people of the house how he came by that wound; they said he was fighting with the Prisoner at the bar. I asked the Prisoner if he had not given him this dangerous blow, and told him, I was afraid the man would die: the Prisoner answered me, he was very sorry for it if he should die, but he could not help it, for the deceased struck him twice before he struck him again. I asked the deceased, whether it was true what the Prisoner said; the deceased would not answer me the question, but doubled his fist, and said, Hounsfoot , (that is a word of resentment) and I believe if he had had strength he would still have sought with him; so the Prisoner himself said, Did not you strike me twice before I struck you? he would not answer that question neither, but repeated Hounsfoot. When he was in bed he vomited a vast quantity of blood; the convulsions seized him so strong, that three or four men could not hold him. I told Mr. Elers how it was, and desired he would send for another surgeon; so Mr. Pye was called, but he only assisted me; so we consulted, and I scalped his head in order to have trepanned him the next day, but he died that night.</p>
               <p>
             The same as if he had called him dog in English. The deceased was a Swede.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think by the manner in which he pronounced the word Hounsfoot twice, that he could have spoke more if he had pleased?</p>
               <p>Deickman. Yes; I believe he could; for he asked afterwards, whether his master was come home.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend the contusion was occasioned by a blow or by a fall?</p>
               <p>Deickman. I believe it was by a blow, for he vomited so much blood, that I believe the internal sinus was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the blow was given by a fist or by an instrument?</p>
               <p>Deickman. I believe it was given by an instrument: the Prisoner had a hurt upon his hand, - it was done by an instrument to be sure.</p>
               <p>Elers. There were two wooden oars broke - they are things that we stir the sugars with. <rs id="t17450227-17-verdict89" type="verdictDescription">

The first man I saw was Mr. Perry, the person my master bought him of. I asked him if he remembered such a horse he sold to a gentleman in May last, and described it: he said he remembered the horse very well: then I told him the horse was lost out of a field belonging to my master, and desired if he should see any thing of him to detect the person, or stop the horse; he told me he would, and I heard nothing further till the horse was advertised. My master and I went the next day to the King's Head in Smithfield, and saw the horse.</p>

The first of this instant February Mr. Thompson's servant came to me in Smithfield, and asked if I remembered such a horse that I sold his master in May last; I said very well; he said the horse was lost, and desired I would endeavour to find him out. About half an hour afterwards just by Long Lane in Smithfield the horse crossed me; what Mr. Thompson's man had said came fresh into my mind, and I took hold of the bridle; I said, friend, where are you a going? he said he was going home - his name is

Presently after, Mr. Dunn met the seller of the horse (the Prisoner at the bar.) Mr. Dunn had paid him part of the money, but would not pay the whole till he had him tolled. There was a voucher brought, and the voucher said they gave him a shilling to vouch for the horse, and pulled the shilling out of his pocket, but he said he did not know any thing of the horse, so we secured the Prisoner, but the voucher run away. I had forgot Mr. Thompson's name, and did not know where to find him without sending down to great Marlow, so I published an advertisement the next morning, and Mr. Thompson came and claimed the horse.</p>

            , You lived a servant with the Duke of Bolton, you may get something out of my Lord Duke's. Said I, I don't know but I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174502270015"/> may. Between ten and eleven at night, we went there with an intent to rob the house, not the stable. We all put our hands to the bottom of the stable door, and broke the bar, so as to get in, and got into a room where a helper or postilion lay, and took two pair of stockings and a work'd linen waistcoat. We intended to break open the house, but there was a servant in the laundry. We went into the stable, got a pitch-fork, and endeavoured to break open the door where the coachman lay, but did not. Says I, Let us go about our business, with what we have got. Said the Prisoner at the bar, Don't let us go. D - n my eyes, we will tie the people in the house, before we will do that. Said I, Don't do that, because I shall be known; and I shall be taken one time or other. Accordingly we came about our business: the bar not being quite broke through, we brought it together, as a red hot poker would come, and shut the door after us. Then we came to the Prisoner's lodging, and agreed how to dispose of what we had. We sold the waistcoat for half a crown to an old clothes man (I think) in Thrift-street, Soho, and spent the money; and the stockings we tossed up for, under an arch in Peter's street, where the Prisoner lived, and I won them.</p>

I had no servant in the house but himself. When I came down in the morning about seven o'clock, I opened the parlour door, and the first thing that presented itself to me was the parlour window broke open and entirely taken away, and the bar was cut at the bottom. I was vastly surprized, turned to the bureau, saw that broke open, and all my papers ransacked and turned reply turvy. My man was then in the kitchen putting up his bed. I called out to him, Harry, I am robbed and ruined. Is it possible you can lie here, and know nothing of the affair? He made his excuse, quivered and shook. He said, he heard a little noise in the night, and got up, and a cat came and purred about him, and he went to bed again, and did not hear any thing of it. This pistol was loaded and primed, and lay upon the outside of the bureau. The thing was very artfully managed: there were marks of clay upon the bench, and the mark of a man's foot upon the lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Not the mark of a man's foot upon the lock?</p>
               <p>Dalton. There was some clay, not the mark of a man's foot entirely (as if he might put his toe there) the same mark upon a chair: there was a bundle of linen tied up in order to be taken away; there was a great deal of linen in the kitchen, which was untouched; this silver medal and this copper medil lay in the drawer where my money was untouched. In short, my Lord, there was no individual thing that I missed at that time, but the guineas and the Portugal piece. On the inside of the garden wall there is a support of brick work; those bricks were loose, which I suppose was done to favour the notion of somebody's coming over the wall: this was in the height of the street robbing, and I concluded it must be some of those creatures, and did believe somebody had broke into the house, and should have believed so till this day, if it had not been found out in a very odd manner. I went to the City Marshal, and did my endeavour to find out who the people were. I sent this very man (the Prisoner) he brought me several messages, and seemed most industrious to find out the rouges; and one favourable message that he brought me from the City Marshal was, that there was a scent of the rogues, and that twelve men were gone after them, and that they had set them in a wood, but they got from them. I spoke to Mr. Jones about this formal story, and he said he did not tell him so.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell how this was discovered.</p>
               <p>Dalton. The Prisoner continued with me very near five weeks after this, and asked to go into the country to see his friends. I gave him leave to go for three weeks, he did not return to his time, nor in nine weeks: in this interval one

Her telling me that he had wronged her of three pound of tea, opened my eyes, and made me believe he was the person that did this, and then I made my enquiries. He said he was going to Sheffield in Yorkshire. I got a recommendation to a gentleman, and found he had been there: upon examination I missed half a chest of Florence wine, thirty pound weight of indigo, which stood in a cask in the parlour open. He stole as much sattin as made him a waistcoat, - two yards of sattin; mine was a yellow sattin, but he has got it died green (he had nothing but a frock when he came to me) he bought a new suit of clothes, a black coat, a pair of buckles, which cost 28 s. some china, which he sent into the country.

               <p>- Mulliner. I am servant to Mrs. Giles in Addle-street. I think it was on the 15th of October, the Prisoner came into the shop, and asked Mr. Giles [my mistress's son] if he sold nails. Mr. Giles told him, he did. He said, he wanted a parcel of nails, and if he would sell him as cheap as another, he would buy them of him. Mr. Giles asked him, what sort of nails he would have? I think he said, ten-peny nails. Mr. Giles asked him, whether they must be rose-headed nails, or clasp headed nails. He said, he could not tell; but they were to go into the country. Then I concluded they were to be rose-headed nails. He said there was a vessel lying ready for them. He pulled out a paper, whereon was wrote down what he wanted. He desired they might be looked out, and said, he would call for them in the morning. I told him, they would come to about 13 or 14 l. I went into the counting-house to Mr. Giles, and told him what the Prisoner said. Mr. Giles said to him, You are a stranger to me, and I shall expect the money. He said, he should have the money before the goods went away. Here is a note, said he, on one Mr. Simpson on Tower-hill. I looked on the bill, and there was not the name of any town upon it. Says I, Where had you this bill? He said, he had it from Yarmouth in Dorsetshire; and that he had done work, as a carpenter, for this Mr. Pierce, near Yarmouth Mr. Giles said, he would take the bill, and send it to Mr. Simpson's. The Prisoner said, he would go with him himself. Mr. Giles said, he was busy then, and could not go. There were some brads in the order: I asked him, what sort. He could not tell, but I should know in the morning. I went to Mr. Simpson's, and shewed the bill to one of his clerks, and asked, if it was a good bill. He looked upon it two or three minutes, and said, it was not a good bill: Mr. Simpson looked upon it, and said the same. I told him how I came by it. He said, he should be glad to have the person who brought it apprehended. I told him, he was to come in the morning. I went home, and acquainted Mr. Giles with it, and went afterwards to Mr. Simpson's, to desire he would send his clerk to be there, for we did not care to apprehend him ourselves. Mr. Simpson accordingly sent his man to our house, and when the Prisoner came, we sent for a constable, and secured him. [The bill was produced and read.]</p>
