A man then came up to me on the whip side, I was driving; he presented a pistol to me and demanded my money; by that time they all had taken their stations; there was one man at the horse's head, another had hold of the reins, there was another by the side of the gentleman that was with me, that is Mr. Swabey's side; he presented a pistol to him. There was a general cry, perhaps of them all, I cannot say how many of them, out with them, out with them. Soon afterwards, or perhaps during it, Mr. Swabey was forcibly dragged from the chaise; the chaise flap having been torn, he was dragged into the road. I had by that time got my hand into my pocket and delivered money to one of the robbers, the man by me with the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was it - A. From the best calculation I could make, I believe it to be upwards of three pound; to the value of three pound I am certain in gold and silver; he said that would not satisfy him; I told him it must, I thought it sufficient. He demanded my watch, and desired me to be quick in giving it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it him - A. Yes, I did. It was a gold watch, gold chain, and two gold seals; the watch was capped and jewelled. He then stood upon the step of the chaise, desired me to unbutton my coat, and rifled my left hand waistcoat pocket, from which he took a pair of scissars, a small paper parcel containing cards, addressed to a brother of mine, and a small piece of liquorice. I merely mention this to state the scissars and piece of liquorice were returned to me as of being of no use to them; he returned them at my stating they were of no use to them, but kept the cards. He then felt the slash pocket of my driving coat, and asked what was there, I said nothing but halfpence for the turnpike; he said he did not want these, but he put his hand in there and took the halfpence; and I believe there was a six pence there, I am not certain; at such a time I believe it is impossible to be collected: shortly after that I found somebody coming on the step of the chaise of the other side, which I was glad to see; it was Mr. Swabey getting in after having been rifled. I looked round anxiously for my friend, it disengaged my attention from the men, after hearing one of the prisoners say, do not kill him; previous to that I saw three men engaged with him; they had quitted my horse and reins and were engaged with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you heard one of the prisoners say do not kill him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that - A. Shortly after they had dragged Mr. Swabey out of the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it - A. I was just going to mention it; I should name it as Carr, the man who robbed me; it was the man that robbed me, he said do not kill him.</p>
               <p>Q. His name is Carr is it - A. Yes; except roughly handling, he used no improper language. Mr. Swabey got in the chaise and I drove away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else taken from you - A. Yes; I concluded the currants were taken out of the chaise; my whole attention or the greatest part was taken up with the man that held the pistol to my head. The currants did not appear to have dropped on the road; when they were brought to Bow street they were not soiled.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pound - A. Six pound; I cannot swear that they were taken out of the chaise, the parcel had not the appearance of being dropped in the road. I am certain they are my own; they contain my address and the stables were I put up; I did not miss them till the next morning, my confusion was too much to enquire what was taken out of the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. You said there were four persons, were there - A. Yes, I know none but Carr; that is not to be positive of them, they have the appearance of the men; I am sure of Carr to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not swear positively - A. I do not; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150004"/>would rather he would be let loose upon the public than my conscience be burthened.</p>
               <p>Q. Then according to your best knowledge and belief you will swear no further - A. No further; under such circumstances it is impossible to be collected at all times, perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. You were quite alarmed I suppose - A. I cannot say I was; I was more alarmed for the fate of my friend, who was dragged by the three men so far; I did not know what became of him; the other three I could only see their persons generally; as to their faces I had no opportunity of seeing.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take any notice of their dress - A. No further than there were two in jackets and two in coats; one man was in a light coat; the man in a light coat is not taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Carr on - A. The same jacket he has on now; Carr and Kelly were in jackets; I did not know it was Kelly until I saw him in Bow street, then I did not know his person except from his figure and his dress, then I thought that to be the man. Carr I believe to be one of them, and he had the same jacket on he has on now.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say of the other prisoner, had he the same coat on he has now - A. I believe so; they were too soon removed out of my sight; it is impossible to speak precisely, they were at some distance.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Alley. It was on the 9th instant you were robbed - A. Yes; on Thursday, a little before six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the length of the place from where you was robbed to Ratcliffe Cross - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were you from Whitechapel, was it an hundred yards - A. I should suppose two or three miles from Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Ratcliffe Cross is a considerable distance from where you was robbed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Upper Clapton in Middlesex - A. I believe Upper Clapton is in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>MR. SWABY. Q. Where you in the chaise with Mr. Samuhda on Thursday last, in Upper Clapton road - A. I was; I saw four men, one particularly caught my attention, who was on the wrong side of the road, where there was no foot path. Mr. Samuhda was on the whip side, he called out to Mr. Samuhda to stop, and directly pointed a pistol to him; and another man came on the other side to me with a pistol, and another man unarmed. They desired me to get out of the chaise; the flap being up they tore it open, and dragged me out on the road; two came to me at first, then another one came up to me; having my chaise coat on, they broke it open, it being buttoned at the top; they felt in my waistcoat pocket, they found no watch nor money in my right hand pocket; in my left hand waistcoat pocket there were three pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any pistols with them - A. One had; that man is not taken; after I was dragged out, I took notice of one man in particular; his name is Kelly. I am quite sure he is one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the other - A. Nothing further than his height and size, generally; I cannot speak assuredly to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you will not swear as to the others at all - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the man that presented the pistol to Mr. Samuhda - A. At first I saw him, I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he like one of the prisoners - A. In form he was; that was all I could discern, he was like Carr.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Alley. When was Carr taken in custody - A. I understood since, he was taken the morning after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Bow street the next day - A. (Mr. Sumuhda). We went to Bow street the same evening.</p>

            . I am one of the patrols of Bow street office.</p>
               <p>Q. On Thursday night were you in the road between Newington Green and Ball's pond - A. Yes; Loyd and Upton, two patrols, were with me; I saw four men coming from Newington Green way, towards town. Loyd was first, Upton next, and I was last; I saw four men pass by, I said to Loyd, let us go and frisk these men, I think they are the men that did the trick on the Hampstead road; accordingly I went back to Carr, who was the last man; I said do not be alarmed, we are officers, I must search you; before I had got the words well out of my mouth, he gave a jump and went towards Newington Green.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run - A. A little he did; I pursued him, he put his hand between his jacket and waistcoat, as if he was going to pull something out; he took a short turn round, and went towards Ball's Pond; I pursued him towards the turnpike, I called out stop him; when I came near the turnpike, a man in a soldier's great coat fired a pistol at me; he was one of the four men, he had a light coloured soldier's great coat on; he has made his escape. At the shock of the pistol going off I did not know whether I was not shot; I lost sight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it - A. It was about seven o'clock, to the best of my recollection; we did not take Carr till the next morning about seven o'clock at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they both made their escape for that night - A. Yes; we apprehended Carr the next morning; we went to one Kelly in Vine court, Broad street, Ratcliffe Cross; there were five patrols went with us.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go there - A. About two o'clock on Friday morning; when we went there we found Carr in bed; there were two more in the room, we brought them with us; the name of one was Mullins, and the other was Welch; they were discharged by the magistrate, and Carr was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Carr say to you, or you to him - A. I asked him where Conner was, he said he was not come home; I then told him he must go along with us.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Alley. You do not mean to say it was Carr that you saw - A. By the waistcoat and breeches it was the same; it was on Thursday night we stopped them. I found on Kelly a knife and some money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you sure it was Carr you saw on Thursday night with the men - A. Yes, with respect to his dress it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same man that you saw the next morning - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you found Carr the next morning at two o'clock at his lodgings, that was Carr - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same man that you met the night before - A. His dress answered the same description, being dark I could not possibly see his face. Here is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150005"/>pound note, eleven shillings in silver, a crown piece, a half crown, two shillings, and three sixpences; there is a gentleman in court that has spoke to one of the sixpences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Samuhda. The half crown piece appears to be what I had in my pocket; having no idea of being robbed, I took no further notice of it; I would not attempt to swear to it.</p>

Yes, about as high as the calf of his leg; I asked him how it came so; he said it was a pair of half boots that he wore that made them so. When he was at our office his shoes were no higher than mine; I saw his shoes that he had by the bed side, they appeared to be wet all over at the time. I cannot say that they were as wet as though they were dipped out of a tub.</p>
               <p>Carr. On Wednesday last I worked in boots on account of keeping the gravel and the wet from my feet. I keep the boots in the barge; my stockings were not wet, they were dry as they are now.</p>

               <p>Q. What day of the week was it - A. On Thursday last. I was coming along by myself, I heard some people before; I could not see; I came on further, I saw one laid in the road, one next him, and one of the side of him; they were all in the road, I came by them as they were there; one jumped on the path and ran by me, he seemed to have something between his legs, so that I could not see what it was; he sung at the time rumti-de-udledy; he said, Jack, put your hat on, you'll catch cold; that was to one of them behind; then I began to be in fear; I came on, looking over my shoulder, I gained ground upon them; I had not gone many yards before he called out Stop; I took no notice, but went on, looking behind me; he holloaed out Stop, the second time; I kept on my pace as usual, and the third time he holloaed out Stop, the person by the side of the watch box sprang out; they had all three pistols, which they all three cocked against my head; then they demanded my property. I told them I was only a working person, I had nothing to lose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop - A. I was compelled to it, they demanded my property; they said there was no time to be lost; they said they must have it. A person in a great coat pulled out my watch from my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a great coat had he on - A. A light coloured great coat, seemingly to me like a soldier's.</p>
               <p>Q. The man in a light coloured great coat pulled out your watch - A. Yes; having done that, they took hold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150007"/>of me by the shoulders, swung me round, and told me to go back to Hampstead. The same man that had the great coat on took the watch; took a seven shilling piece, two shillings, and a sixpence, from me. I went back; they told me there was a party more in the road, and if they stopped me, to tell them that my business was done, and they would let me go. I went nearly about thirty yards back. I met some gentleman, I said are you going to town; I came to town with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the prisoner was one of the three that you saw - A. I think he is by his person, and his dress, and his height, I think he is the person that holloaed out stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at that time make sufficient observation, to be able to speak to him - A. Not further than by his dress; I was in too much fright when I saw the three pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner at the bar - A. On Friday, in the same dress that he is in now. When I came down the road, at the pound, I saw some of the gentlemen of Bow street. I told them what happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since seen any of your property - A. There is a sixpence in the hands of Mr. Frost, which I think is the same I had, but I cannot swear to it. I never saw the watch afterwards.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's parish. On the 30th of January I was on my duty in Greenhill's Rents; I saw the prisoner sitting on a cask, he said he was going to carry it to the Pied Bull, Islington; he wanted a coach for his master; and while I was speaking to him, a coach came to the corner of Greenhill's Rents; he took the cask up, I said where did you get that cask from, he said a man gave it him at the corner of Long lane; he wanted me to lay hold of it, and lift it upon his shoulder; I would not; I thought if I took the cask, he would run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure the prisoner - A. Yes, I took him to the watchouse. This is the same cask.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Windus. Mr. Windus lives about four or five hundred yards from where the cask was found; it had been in the warehouse, I had seen it within the hour; I cannot say whether the door of the warehouse was open or not; there were some people that came in the warehouse when the cask was supposed to be taken; it is Mr. Windus's cask, it contains six gallons; I marked the cask myself; it is valued at three pounds, that is less than prime cost. The warehouse adjoins the dwelling house, there is an internal communication.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that in Middlesex - A. Yes; I saw the gelding about three or four o'clock in the afternoon of the 4th; I missed it about five the same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of it - A. Fifteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not lent it to any body - A. No, it was standing in the field. On the Wednesday following I saw the horse again at Hanwell, in the custody of Trott, an officer of Hatton garden office; he brought it me to look at; I am sure it is my own horse; it is a very remarkable horse, he had a good many white hairs in the tail; he had a cut tail.</p>

I did, in Cow cross, in the parish of St. Sepulchre; about half after six o'clock at night, as near as I could judge; he had a horse with him; what occasioned my curiosity of stopping was, his being in conversation with a person we call a knackner, that buys horses to kill; he was trying to sell it; I went to him and asked him the price of the horse; he told me he did not know what he could take for him at that present moment, if I would let him have two guineas, and when he called again to London I was to let him have the remainder what I thought it was worth.</p>

On Friday night last, in consequence of suspicion, we were induced to get the police officers to attend the premises against the time the labourers left work, which was about eight o'clock in the evening, and after they went out they were instantly brought into my partner's house, and the search of their persons commenced instantly. On the prisoner was found three cakes of soap placed in the waistband of his breeches before, two half cakes from his pockets, and two half cakes were in the crown of his hat; upon this being found in his possession he begged for mercy, and said it was the first time he had committed any offence of that sort.</p>

The prisoner was my servant; there had been several things missing; I had no suspicion of the prisoner till I was told by one of the servants, that she had a person come to her of a morning, that took things from her; in consequence of that I went into her room; I saw in a bundle of her wearing apparel a body of a chemise; on the Saturday morning I was led to suppose that this woman would come again; under these circumstances I was up before the servants were; she did not come. Mr. Debatt in the course of the morning forbid her going behind the counter, which she had been in the habit of doing; she said she would not stay without she did; I was up stairs; she came up and said I shall leave you this evening; I made no answer; about ten in the evening she came down, she said she had done what she had to do and was going; she asked if I would wish to see her clothes; I said most assuredly I should; she then went up stairs and brought her clothes down in a bundle; I opened the bundle on the table; she asked me if there was any thing that belonged to me; I said there was not what I expected to see; I said I want to see the body of a chemise, and I think you are making it of one of my sheets, I saw it last night; she said no, I could not see them last night for they were gone to Lambeth to be made; she refused to turn out her pockets; I sent for an officer, and while the officer was coming she began to unpin her things from under her gown; when the officer came she dropped the things; there were this body of a chemise and the remainder of the sheet; on comparing the two together I am sure it was my sheet; it was marked D. at the top, I. and E; it is worth five shillings.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Lime street ward. On the 18th of January, about a quarter past six in the evening, I saw the prisoner pass me with a carcase of mutton on his shoulder; I turned round and asked him where he got that sheep from, I collared him, and stopped him two or three doors down St. Mary Axe; he told me he brought the carcase from Mr. King in Leadenhall market. Mr. King is a carcase butcher and salesman both, I believe; I took him back into Leadenhall market; Mr. King's shop was shut up, there was no sheep out nor nobody killing; I then took him to the watchhouse; I thought it was stolen, because he throwed it down coming down Lime street; I got a young man to take it up and to assist me; when he threw it down he begged I would not hurt him; I put him in the Compter; I kept the sheep at the watchhouse till the next day; I produced it before the lord mayor.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the sheep that you saw before the alderman was the same sheep that you slaughtered - A. Yes; we put our mark on every sheep that we kill.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the value of the carcase - A. About thirty shillings; I have seen the prisoner in the market, but not that day; I believe he was a drover.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been on that night before six o'clock - A. No; my wife was just coming out with the lamps to take charge of it; I am paid sixpence a score for watching; sometimes we set up for two pence halfpenny a night, and less than that when the weather is very cold; on that night I went in pursuit of a carcase of mutton they had been taken the preceding night.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150011"/>There is eleven salesman that I have the watch over.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going round Leadenhall street, I saw a man, he had a sheep on a rail; he asked me where I was going; I said to Whitechapel; he said he would give me sixpence to carry it to the bottom of Houndsditch; I told him I would. This man stopped me at St. Mary Axe, he asked me where I was going: I said I did not know rightly; I told him there was the man that I had it of, and when I turned round I did not see the man; I suppose he had ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. to Shuter. Was any person by him at the time - A. I saw a little man or a lad walking behind him, they were saying something as they passed me, but what I did not know; I did not see him afterwards; after I stopped this man he did not make his appearance.</p>

            . I am an officer of the city. On Tuesday, the 7th of this month, about half after six o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another against Mr. Boyer's shop; I saw the prisoner go into the shop, he came out and went and spoke to his companion, who was waiting at the end of Skinner street, about two or three doors off; I saw the shopman come to the door, then I heard a whistle; I ran directly and fetched Shephard the constable, I shewed him the prisoner and his companion; the prisoner was then standing at the window, the window was not open, the door was; I was on the other side at a little distance; Shephard crossed the way; in a few minutes I saw the prisoner running with a cheese under his arm, he was about two doors from Mr. Boyer's shop when I first saw him with the cheese; a cart coming by prevented me from seeing whether he went into the shop or not. Shephard ran before me and catched hold of the prisoner; the prisoner twisted about to get away from Shephard, I took hold of him; I requested Shephard to take up the cheese, the cheese was then lying on the ground.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any other cheesemonger's shop nigh there - A. No. I never lost sight of him sufficient for him to go by any other cheesemonger's shop; I took him in the shop and searched him, I found this whistle. I saw him put his hand upon a cheese before I fetched Mr. Shephard.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 7th of January did you lose a cheese from your shop - A. Yes; it was taken from near the door: in less than ten minutes before it was taken I saw it safe. I saw the prisoner come into my shop, there was another man in the shop at the same time; the prisoner went up to where some bacon was and looked at it; I turned myself round to weigh some bacon for the other man and the prisoner was gone; that gave me a suspicion that he had taken something, his not asking for any thing. I came round the counter to see whether I had lost any thing, I perceived the cheese was missing; I then met the two officers with the prisoner and the cheese in their hands; the officers asked me if that cheese was my property; I told them it was. The prisoner asked me to forgive him, he said he was told to do it, and he would never do so again.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of your cheese - A. Thirty shillings; it weighs thirty four pound and a half.</p>
               <p>- SHEPHARD. I am a constable. In consequence of information from Thrubshaw I saw the prisoner next door to Mr. Boyer's shop, passing with a cheese under his arm; I got hold of him; he dropped the cheese.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming past the gentleman's shop between the hours of six and seven, this affair happened; this gentleman took hold of me, and after I went in the house they put me in confinement; another man was brought in, and when I was taken up before the gentlemen that other man was acquitted and I was sent here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

Yes, the last purchase was 15 l. 12 s. it was the week before Christmas; they carried them to the warehouse and deposed them there.

               <p>Q. Did you lose any property there - A. I did, on the 1st of February last; I lost a twenty pound note; I saw the note on the evening of the 31st of January, and missed it on the 1st of February; it had been placed in a writing desk which had been locked up in a cupboard in my drawing room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your writing desk locked - A. No; the cupboard was locked, and the key kept in a small drawer in the glass; the prisoner lived in the house, she was Mrs. Atkins' <rs id="t18090215-19-deflabel105" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Did she know that you used to keep the key in the glass in the drawer - A. I do not know. I have seen the bank note since in the possession of the officer. The money belonged to some money which Mrs. Atkins sent down to Oxford for me; I went down to Oxford on the 27th of January; I received it on the next day at Oxford.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bank notes did you receive of Mrs. Atkins - A. One hundred and twenty six pounds I received of Mrs. Atkins.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all in bank notes - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the bank note you lost was one of those you received of Mrs. Atkins - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any account of the number or the dates - A. Not I, but Mrs. Atkins did before she sent them me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say that which you lost was the one you received from her - A. Yes, because I had no other money, except that I had from her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If Mr. Holmer will forgive me this time I will never do so again.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at Mrs. Atkins' house, in Cork street, on the 1st of February; I searched her; I asked her if she had heard any thing of a twenty pound note that Mr. Holmer had lost; she said she had heard of it; I asked her if she knew any thing about it; she said she did not, she knew nothing of any note but a one pound note which she had in her box, I was very welcome to look at it; I then asked her if she would let me look at was in her pockets; she put her right hand in her right hand pocket; I supposed she was pulling something out; I laid hold of that hand and pulled it out myself; in her hand was this green leather purse; I asked her what she had got there; she said nothing; I said I must see what was in it, I opened it and in it was this twenty pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Atkins. Is that one of the notes that you sent - A. I believe it is the same note; it is the same number, 1464 for twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you took the number of the notes - A. I wrote no more than twenty pounds, 1464.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner lived with you - A. She came to me on the 20th of January, she had been with me a fortnight; I made a mistake, she came to me on a Friday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners before the shop was broken open or after - A. After. I saw three or four of them at Mr. Aireton's window, I heard a noise when the shutters were pulled down, I was but three doors off; there was a great noise of the shutter, and then a breaking of glass in a moment; I ran to the place, I saw three or four people run; I pursued Stevens, I saw him with one hand coming out of Mr. Aireton's window, and one of these fiddles dropped out of his hand; I catched hold of Stevens' collar, we had a good roll in the snow; I took Stevens to the watchhouse; I saw the others brought into the watchhouse, they were apprehended by other people.</p>
               <p>Skirrard. I wish you to speak whether I was one of the party or no - A. No, I do not pretend.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 14th of January I was on duty; this patrol and me were on duty; he just came up and challenged me whether all was well; we heard a shutter come down as plain as though we were by it; in about a minute we heard the glass fly; we went up immediately, I struck at Bremmer with my stick, he throwed his arm forward, and let a fiddle drop; I pursued him, I was not fifteen yards from him all the time; I saw Bremmer stopped by Buckley, another watchman; I went afterwards and picked up the fiddle and took it to the watch-house. The fiddle was given to Brixley, the constable of the night.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you on duty on the 14th - A. I was, in St. Giles's parish, about an hundred yards from Mr. Aireton's; I heard the rattles sprung, and the cry of stop thief; I saw two men run from the place where the shop was broken open, I stopped Skiddard; the other man run away. When Skiddard saw me coming he cried stop him, they were running towards me; the other man changed his direction, the prisoner Skiddard stood still and cried stop thief; Skiddard had nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150014"/>with him, he told me he was coming from a club, and that he was not one of the persons at all.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of these two violins - A. Not so much as forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Stevens' Defence. I was coming by that place, this man ran after me and catched me; I had been to a public house with my father, my father had left me and I was going home.</p>
               <p>Bremmer's Defence. On Saturday evening I went to Well street with an acquaintance, and after having a supper with him I was returning home to my lodgings in Drury lane; on my going on I kicked my foot against something, it proved to be a violin: a watchman knocked me on the back part of my head; I heard the cry of stop thief, and for fear of being thought one of the party, I run.</p>
               <p>Skiddard's Defence. I was passing from Baker street, Manchester square; coming along I heard the watchman say, there is thieves, pursue them; I ran behind this watchman ten yards; he ran after the man down a court; I run back again and passed the place; he turned back and ran after me; I stood still and said I am not one of the part.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes; he had lodged with us a fortnight. On the 21st of January he took the things away; on that day he was apprehended at the Jane Shore, Shoreditch; he confessed he had sold the things, and had three shillings off on the bed; the bed was worth about five shillings. I went to where he had carried them and claimed the property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I own I took the things; it was so cold I could not work; I had been without bread two or three days. Mr. Baker told me if I would tell him where the things where he would forgive me; I told him; he had them sent back immediately.</p>

Yes; I was with him at the Welch Harp on the 30th of January; we went into the public house to get a pint of beer; at the same time we had some things that we bought, we looked them over; the prisoner came up to me and asked the price of the jacket, he tried it on; it did not fit him! she gave it to another man; the other man tried it on, it did not fit him; then they began to talk Irish, I did not know what it was; the prisoner and the other man went towards the door; my partner came up and said give me my jacket; the prisoner gave my partner and the man a shove, and shoved them both out of doors; I saw no more. I went and put my things in the bag.</p>

I had suspicion of the man, I watched him; I saw him lurking about the copper, something disturbed him, and he walked away from it. I went up to him and asked him why he did not go and look out for work, why he loitered about there, we had nothing for him to do, I told him; he went away. Then I went into the counting house upon my business; when I came out I saw him come away from the copper again; I had suspicion that he had got something, I was standing and talking to him; he said only look what a lot of ice there is in the river, it is enough to overturn a barge; I turned my head to look at the ice, he stooped, I heard the copper fall; I turned round and saw the copper falling, one corner just touched the ground just as I saw it; he said halloa; I said you shall go before Mr. Pigeon now; I have looked after you some time; he said, don't let me go, bless your eyes do not; I called a man on the wharf, and he called Mr. Pidgeon; he was then taken to the counter.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went down to look for work as usual; I staid on the wharf twenty minutes, I stood talking to this man just by where the copper was piled; one of the pieces of copper fell down; when I turned round he said you want to steal the copper; I said I did not; he said you shall not run away, you shall see Mr. Pidgeon; I said I would as soon see Mr. Pidgeon as any one; I had touched nothing, nor nothing had I upon me, nor never laid my hands upon the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hall. How far was he from where the copper stood - A. About six yards from the copper from what I saw; he had the copper behind him, under his great coat.</p>

            . I am porter to Messrs. Brown and Wallington. I went from the inn yard with the cart; the cart left me in Cheapside, I delivered two parcels there. In going down Milk I observed the prisoner get upon the near wheel of the cart, I saw him take the box out and get down again and walk towards Cheapside; I met him; he put the box under his coat; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said nothing; he threw the box in the cart and ran down Milk street.</p>
               <p>COURT. I thought he had left the cart when you saw him - A. He was about ten yards from the cart when I first met him; when I spoke to him he turned round towards the cart and threw the box in immediately and ran towards Aldermanbury; I pursued him and catched him in Aldermanbury, by the Baptist's Head; he desired us to take him to his father and mother. I delivered him to Mr. Frost the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you see the box that he had throwed into the cart - A. Yes; it was the box that I had seen before to be delivered in Houndsditch; I am sure of the person of the boy; I never lost sight of him; I was nearly within an arm's length of him all the way.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the boy - A. No; he told me his father lived in Black Eagle street; I went there; I could not find him; the next day he said his mother was dead; he still persisted his father lived there. I searched him at the inn; I found a knife, a penny, and a letter; the letter he said he picked up in the street.</p>

               <p>Q. Then that is the 22nd of January - A. Then that is the day I marked it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you placed it - A. In a drawer in the iron book case, in my accompting house, it was in a bag; it was there safe a fortnight; I counted it every morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she access to your accompting house - A. No. On Sunday the 15th of February I missed thirteen shillings out of two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your money been changed in the course of that fortnight - A. No; it had never been out of the bag only on the place where I counted it; I sent for an officer on the Monday and called the servants together, and told them what was the officer's business; the money was found in this prisoner's box; her box was unlocked. I have another maid servant and an apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she get at this chest of your's - A. That I can only speak to from conjecture. I had one key in my pocket, and the other in the drawer in the accompting house.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any body get at it - A. By taking it out of my pocket in my bed chamber while I was asleep when the children were taking away between seven and eight o'clock. Sunday morning I lay late; I laid my clothes in the chair, I suppose she took it out of my pocket and returned it again; but that is all supposition. There was no violence in the least upon the lock. It is a good lock, I do not think it could easily be picked.</p>
               <p>Q. When you charged her with it what did she say - A. She said she had put a few shillings in her box, part of the last quarter's wages, and begged to be forgiven after it was found.</p>

Mr. Figgins sent for me on Monday morning; I went to the house; the prisoner said Mr. Figgins was very welcome to look at what money she had in her box; a man brought the box down stairs; I asked the young woman if she had any money in her box; she said half a guinea and some silver; she put her hand into the box and took out a morocco purse; I emptied it on the table; there was half a guinea and some shillings; Mr. Figgins looked at the shillings and said they were the shillings he had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shillings - A. Thirteen shillings; she seemed confused at the time; she said she hoped her master would forgive her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Figgins. The man that brought the box down happened to be a jobbing carpenter, that happened to be in the house at the time; my wife and he went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the carpenter been in the house - A. He had not been in the house half an hour.</p>

On the evening of the same day I took the prisoner on suspicion; he lodged at the public house the corner of the gateway; there is a door from the public house into the yard; he was seen in the yard that evening at eight o'clock. When I charged the constable with him, I wanted to know how he came by them good clothes he had on. The next morning we asked him to confess if he knew any thing of it.</p>

On Saturday evening the 14th of January, between seven and eight o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my shop and told me that he had got a second coachman's place, he would sell his box coat what he brought from Yorkshire; the clothes he had of me came to three pounds five shillings; I took the box coat for three pounds five shillings; the same coat I received of the prisoner was claimed by the coachman on the Monday morning.</p>

No; he made his way to the door; with that I run towards the door to him, to insist upon him telling me the meaning of that letter in his hand; with that he came into the room to me, he swore if I came after him he would knock me down; this was on the ground floor.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him while he was in your bed room at all - A. I saw him packing up my linen in the bed room; I could see him in my other room; when he was in the bed room he was packing the things up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any letter did you say - A. No. I insisted upon his giving it me, or upon his telling me what it was, but he would not leave it me, nor let me see what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you must enumerate the different articles that he put in the blanket - A. Five gowns - they are worth three pounds, they were almost new, every one of them.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Did you see him pack any of the things up - A. I did; the two shirts he threw at me when he came in the front room; then he took them out of his pocket; there is no marks on the shirt; I took them in of a man; they were to be mended; there is some holes on the shoulder; I am certain these are the shirts.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in your shop in the month of December last - A. On the 9th of December in the evening, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner came in the shop; when he first came in I was not in the place; I was called into the shop, and then I saw the prisoner in the shop: I am perfectly certain the prisoner is the person, though he is differently dressed now; he said he wanted something of a diamond broach and a ring; I then showed him the assortment we had; he could not suit himself, and said he was going out of town; I said if he would call again in about forty minutes I would endeavour to shew him some more; he then went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your son continue all the time the prisoner was in the shop - A. Not the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any of the goods after the prisoner went away - A. Not at this time; we missed them the next morning. The prisoner returned in about forty minutes, I was in the shop; he then looked at several articles that I procured, there was none that quite suited his mind, he wanted something of a cluster of diamonds; there were none that suited him; my son made a drawing of one that he thought would suit him; he then went away without purchasing of any thing. The next morning we missed a double row diamond half hoop ring, a pearl and amethyst broach, an amethyst and serpent ring, a diamond and chased, and a diamond ring; that was for hair; that is four articles; we advertised them by hand bills. I did not see them till the prisoner was taken to Bow street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the articles you have mentioned were in the shop at the time the prisoner was there - A. Yes. When he came into our shop he had his hair very neatly powdered, and appeared very much like a gentleman; wore an eye glass; he was vastly clean; I never suspected a person less than him, and he wore whiskers then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Have you any other partner besides your son - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any other name besides Matthias - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150022"/>Q. A considerable part of the time the prisoner was in your shop, Mrs. Bilger was there - A. The first time she was in the shop, but when my son came down she went away.</p>
               <p>Q. She was there at the time the prisoner was there a second time - A. She was in the parlour behind the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Which room is all open to the shop - A. Yes, there is only a curtain.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any shopman besides - A. We have a porter, he was in the shop, the furthest part off.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your son here - A. He is.</p>

               <p>Q. What articles are here that you know are yours - A. There are two rings; I missed them the next morning; that was at the time my son was going to return the articles that we had borrowed. When he came in the last time and saw the articles that we had borrowed, then them rings were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. The rings that were missed the next morning, were they missed by your son or by you - A. By us both. When we found one article missing, then we searched over the shop.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. I live in Brydges' street, Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the man at the bar - A. I do. On the 15th of December he left a ring with a coloured stone, I advanced him three guineas upon it. On the next day, a hand bill from Bow street came in, I carried them forward. I have a double cluster ring that I took in of a female, on the 10th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner at any time about that ring that was brought by the woman - A. I had. On the 14th of December I had a conversation with the prisoner about this ring; I then asked him whether his lady, a few days before (I supposed the woman to be his wife) had not pledged a ring for five guineas; I supposed him to be the husband of the female who left the ring; to which he seemed surprized.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was that ring pledged for five guineas - A. It was; the prisoner, I think, came the next day, at the time he left this ring with me; he then said that he had made enquiries at home, and learned that the ring which I had mentioned the day before, was left by his wife, and enquired the reason for my asking the question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Did he describe the ring - A. No, he did not; he only said the other ring. I lent three guineas on the ring the prisoner brought; I suppose that is near the value of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bilger, senior. Look at that ring, and tell me whether that is your property - A. I am quite certain of this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It is one of the rings that you borrowed - A. No, I have had it a considerable time; it is an article that was bought, and then I had it altered; it was done to my own fancy; I could almost venture to say there could not be another like it</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews, to Bilger junior. Look at that ring, and say whether it is your property - A. I a can venture to say, I am positive that it is my father's property. It is an amethyst and rose diamond ring.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You did not work upon it, did you - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>MR. BRUCHART. I am a working jeweller and diamond merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that ring that is produced - A. I do; I made it for my own stock, as I supply shopkeepers. It is a double row brilliant half hoop ring; I manufactured it. On the 9th of December Mr. Bilger, the elder, called on me between six and seven o'clock; he borrowed that ring of me with several others.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Bilger, the elder, has swore that he saw no more of me after I was in the shop that night, till I was apprehended. He swore at Bow street, that I came again on the Monday night, which was the 12th of December, to look at some articles.</p>
               <p>COURT. No such thing - I have got the examination.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I said, I did not see the articles till I saw them at Bow street; I saw the prisoner; he came again on the Tuesday afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it he came first - A. It was on a Friday, and he came on the Tuesday after; he wanted to know the estimate of the ring; that a drawing of was shewed him; however he wanted to see some watches, and he wished also to see some loose diamonds, not set. I have another son, that son went out because he know of the robbery; I thought that my son went for a constable in order to stop him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send him - A. No; then he had measure taken of his finger, and left directions; he called himself Mr. Deacon, No. 13, Cursell street, May fair; that is the direction I took from his own mouth; he left us without purchasing any thing; giving the order I went to the house, it proved to be an empty house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to stop him - A. I had a doubt in my own mind what to do; my son went out and observed an accomplice; that son is not here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of some conversation with a person did you expect the prisoner to call upon you, about the purchase of a horse - A. According to Mr. Bott's directions. On the 16th of January, on Monday, about a quarter before three, as I stood at the gateway, the prisoner came and asked me if my name was Young, or if I knew such a person as Young; I told him my name was Young; he said he had come to me from a person of the name of Bott, concerning of buying a horse; I told him Mr. Bott had been waiting for him three quarters of an hour, he could wait no longer, he was obliged to go, but that he had looked out a horse which he wished Cooper to buy; he said he hoped that I should not take him in, for that he had bought a horse, a little time ago, of Mr. Marsden in Tottenham court road; he said he gave forty five pounds for him, he had but kept him a little while and he was not worth ten pounds; therefore his father would not suffer him to buy any other horse but what Mr. Bott approved of; then I shewed him the horse; he very much disputed the horse's age; I told him he was rising six years old; he said he thought he was older, but he was not a judge; he asked me the price; I told him forty five guineas; he said he thought it was too much; he said Mr. Young who will you leave to be the arbitrator of this horse; I told him I did not see that he wanted any body, any further than Mr. Bott, the farrier, and if he thought it too much money, as he was recommended by Mr. Bott, I would let him have him at forty five pounds, and if Mr. Bott said that was too much, he should have him for less, and if not, he was to give it; Mr. Bott was to set the price; then Mr. Cooper and I walked together to Mr. Bott; Cooper said he hoped I should not deceive him and take him in; his father was in want of a good gig horse, most likely he would be a good customer to me. Mr. Bott assured me that he knew the prisoner and his father very well, that he had done business for the father sixteen or seventeen years; and that his son went seven years to the school with the prisoner, that he knew it to be a worthy family. The prisoner asked Mr. Bott if he would pass his word to permit him to ride the horse to Hammersmith to his father; Mr. Bott said he had good parents, I need not be afraid; the prisoner said his father was so very ill, he was not able to get out; we parted on the Monday; on the Tuesday, about three o'clock, the prisoner came to me at my yard in Ormond street, and said that his father was very ill; he should be much obliged to me if I would let him ride the horse to Hammersmith, to shew his father; that he would call on the Wednesday, the day following, and tell me what his father said; which he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him have the horse on the Tuesday - A. I did; I let him him have the horse, saddle and bridle that he rode off with; he did not return the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. On the Thursday, in Red lion street, Holborn; I saw him upon the horse; he said oh, Mr. Young, I was just coming to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was he going - A. Towards the Foundling; he was going down Lamb's Conduit street, towards my yard; he said he supposed I was rather surprized that he did not come yesterday; I told him I was; he said his father was so very ill that he was not able to get out; he said he should not have come then, but business called him, that he was obligated, and he was going to take a ride as far as Barnet; but the weather was so very bad, that he did not think he should; I said if it is not particular business turn back, you will get your death, and the horse's too; he said he would, the weather was very severe; he said he hoped that I would go to Hammersmith on Sunday morning, and to be with him time enough for breakfast, and to spend the day, and then his father could settle with me concerning the horse; I asked him if he liked the horse; he said very well; we parted; I then went to Mr. Bott; the younger Mr. Bott, and me went to Hammersmith on the Thursday; the prisoner directed me to a white house, behind Hammersmith church; we went there, we found the house, but no such person lived there; we were directed by a Mr. Price to Chelsea; when we came to Chelsea we met the prisoner's father in the street; he lived at No. 1, Cheney row.</p>

               <p>COURT. When did you see your horse again - A. On the Friday, at Mr. Dixon's repository, Barbican; I came to London and searched for the horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This young man belongs to a very respectable family - A. He does.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have parted with the horse unless it had been for the recommendation of Mr. Bott - A. I certainly should not; I certainly parted with the horse from the respectability of the prisoner's family, and the recommendation of Mr. Bott.</p>
               <p>Q. You said there was a price agreed upon between you, of forty five guineas - A. Yes; he never abated me a shilling; I asked him forty five guineas.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you sell it for forty five guineas - A. I never sold it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you met him on the Thursday - was there nothing said between you and him of meeting on the Sunday for the payment of the horse - A. No further than I was to meet him on Sunday at his father's, and his father would settle it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by the term of settling with you on the Sunday - A. Of course I thought if he was an honest man he would settle with me on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood you were to be paid the price of the horse on the Sunday - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had brought you the money you would have been satisfied - A. If he had brought the money I should have been satisfied.</p>

On the 19th of January I was going up Brewer street, between five and six in the evening, I saw the prisoner pass me, I went after him directly, knowing him before; he had this under his coat; I asked him what he had got there; he said it was his own property. I took it from him and took him to the office; I did not ask him any questions. That is all that past.</p>

Yes, two guineas in my breeches pocket; I put my breeches under the bolster, we had not been in bed above five minutes before I missed my money; the candle was put out; I heard the two guineas rattle in the purse that I had; I directly got up and accused the prisoner with taking the two guineas; I missed my money, I could not find it in my pocket; it was in a purse; she said she had not done any such thing; there was no other person in the room; I got up and made a noise, the woman of the house came up, I do not know her name; I asked her for the purse; she said here is the purse if that is what you want; she said she had no money at all; I said I was sure she had, and if she did not give it me I would charge the watch with her; when we got out I charged the watchman with her; he took her to the watchhouse.

               <p>Prisoner. Were not you drinking with two more, a young man and a young woman that was in company with me - A. There was a young woman in company with the prisoner, I was not in company with her; one of the young chaps that was with me went with this young woman.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Foulkes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the shop when the prisoner came in on the 28th of January - A. Yes; the prisoner and a woman came in together; the woman asked to look at some printed cottons; I shewed them some; they were close together at the time; they bought seven yards; I shewed them a vast deal of different patterns; the prisoner bought three yards of linen at two shillings per yard; he paid me six shillings for the linen; he gave me a seven shilling piece, the shilling was to be left on the gown till nine o'clock in the evening; they asked me to shew them some silk handkerchiefs, I shewed them a great many different patterns; the prisoner bought one silk handkerchief at seven shillings, which he paid for; they went off; the boy in the shop saw the silk handkerchiefs under the coat.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150025"/>Q. Is the boy here - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy had seen him take them perhaps - A. I cannot say whether he did or not; Mr. Foulkes came in at the time, and saw the same as the boy. I went to Bow street for an officer.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met with a woman in the street, I asked her if there was a linen draper's shop nigh hand, she said yes; she went with me into Mr. Foulkes' shop; the woman looked at a piece of cotton for a gown, I looked at some Irish linen at two shillings a yard; I told him to cut me off three yards; I paid seven shillings for a handkerchief, and six shillings for the linen, and a shilling was paid for the woman's gown. I was coming out of the shop, the woman asked me to carry the coat while she tied up her apron; the little boy came to me, and said, I had some of his master's property. I went and laid the coat on the counter, and what I had bought, on a great many things; they searched the coat, and told one of the gentlemen of the shop, to go to Bow street for an officer. I was brought into this business; I was quite innocent, I know nothing of the woman; I never met with her before.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you in your custody a box belonging to Barrs - A. Yes, it was in the one pair of stairs; the prisoner lodged in the one pair of stairs, there are two rooms on a floor; whether the box was in the first room I do not know; you go into one room to get in the other where he lodged. I missed the property on the 5th of January.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the property gone out of Barrs' box - A. Yes; there were some things left, paper and other things; every thing of any value was gone. The prisoner quitted my house immediately; he was in the room when the box was discovered to be broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner leave your house - A. On the 5th of January; on the morning the box was discovered to be broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left your house, did you discover whether Barrs' box was broken open or not - A. No; it was on the next day, or in two days after I discovered it; Barrs' box was corded; I found it out by it being light; I undid the cord, and found that all the things were gone. Barr's box had been uncorded and corded up again. I suspected the prisoner, and as soon as Barrs came from abroad, I sent for a constable and apprehended him; he was searched at the watchhouse, and duplicates were found on him at the office. Barrs said the stockings that he had got on were his.</p>

            . Previous to the prisoner going to Mr. Steele's she came to my house, she came down in the bakehouse; there was a bit of beef standing on the board, she said that is my beef; I asked her for the ticket; she said her sister had not brought a ticket. Just at the time she said it was her's a person came in with the ticket, the fellow of it was in the dish, and claimed the beef. There was another piece of beef drawed out of the oven; she said she had made a mistake in the first; she owned the second dish; the first was a round dish, and this was a long one; a person brought a ticket and claimed that; she stood five minutes and there was another bit of beef drawn; she said that is mine, I know it by the dish. I did not let her have it, as I always give tickets.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. On the 22nd of January I carried a bit of beef to Mr. Steele's myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it worth - A. Two shillings and ten pence. The prisoner's sister produced the stand; it is my own making.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday night my mother bought a bit of beef and gave two shillings and six pence for it. On Sunday she sent my little sister to the bakehouse with it; when she came back I asked her where the ticket was; she said they had not given her a ticket; I did not ask her particular which bake-house she had taken it to; she told me she had taken it in James street; I went to fetch it; I went to this gentleman's, the corner of a court in James street; he said I do not let bakings go without a ticket; I asked for my dinner; I paid the two pence in the shop; I brought it home and knew nothing but what it was the same.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

            . Q. Were you with Mr. Cooke on the 3d of February last - A. I was standing behind a place ready waiting for them, I saw Smith come in first, he tapped with his finger at the door three or four times, we could hardly hear him; then he walked up towards the parlour door, about ten or twelve feet; then Cole came in and handed the carpet down from the window and handed it to somebody else; I ran immediately across the shop and took him by the collar; Mr. Cooke took Smith in the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. You have no doubt about their persons have you - A. No doubt whatever; I had seen them several times about the street before they made the attempt in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long time had elapsed since you saw them first, and the time they came into your shop - A. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them speak together at all - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cole's Defence. I never was in Mr. Cooke's shop in my life. I was going along Margaret street when the person laid hold of me; he said he saw me take it out of the shop; I said it was false.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I was passing by Mr. Cooke's door a man observed to me that there were three or four people round the shop; he said it was a pity but that somebody would let them know it; I knocked at the door; nobody came; and then I walked in, and stamped with my foot; nobody made answer; then I immediately walked up to the parlour window; Mr. Cooke and Mr. Jones ran out immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing - A. I followed the two women to Grafton street to a chandler's shop; I looked in the window, I saw part of a ham on the counter, I went in; the prisoner was in the shop; I asked the landlady if the ham belonged to her; she said no, she said the prisoner offered to sell it her; the prisoner denied the fact.</p>
               <p>MRS. STONELY. I keep a chandler's shop; I live in Little St. Andrew's street, Seven Dials. The prisoner came in my shop about half after seven o'clock, I do not know the day of the month, it was on the day the constable came in and apprehended her.</p>
               <p>Q. On that evening did the prisoner offer you any ham to sell - A. Yes; I did not chuse to buy it; she asked for a farthings worth of beer, and while she was drinking it the constable came in; he left the ham in my charge till he came again.</p>

I told her I was very dry, I would go in and get a farthings worth of beer; I was drinking when the gentleman came in; when the ham or something, I did not know what it was, was on the counter; I asked the gentlewoman if she would buy that; I did not know what it was.</p>

On a Saturday last month, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, both of the prisoners came into my shop to look at some ribbons, lying in a basket on the counter; they asked me the price of one of them; I told her ninepence a yard; there was a yard and a half of it; she asked me to cut her off a yard, and bid me less than the yard came to; I could not take it; they both walked out of the shop; there were a quantity of lambs wool gloves and socks laying at the end of the counter, close by both of them, they stood together; Murray, when she got out of the shop she was running along the window, and the other after her; seeing a deficiency of socks on the counter, I ran after them; when they saw me following of them, Kelly dropped a single sock on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they look back to see you - A. Yes; I came up to Kelly and told her I wished to search her; Murray walked into a door place, that led up to a billiard room; it was in Earles court that I stopped them; Murray had a milk pail in her hand, she cried out milk there; when she returned out I saw a sock laying on the ground from where she came from: I then took them both back to my own house; before I searched them one of them flung three odd socks on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you counted the socks and the gloves before they came into the shop - A. No, not to know how man there were; I found nothing upon either<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150029"/>of them.</p>
               <p>MR. FITZPATRICK. I am a milliner and straw manufacturer; I live in Earles' court. On the 28th of January, I found a quantity of socks and gloves behind my street door, when I came to shut it at night. I delivered them to Mr. Kenyon.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. You received them socks of the last witness - A. Yes; I can swear to these being mine, a pair of lambs wool socks and gloves; there is a ticket to the socks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where Fitzpatrick lives - A. Yes. That is where Murray went to cry out milk.</p>
               <p>Kelly's Defence. Not being accustomed to speak in a court like this, I have taken the liberty to state a few lines in writing. It is truly unfortunate in me, not having it in my power to employ a counsel; I was never out of the prosecutor's sight from the time I went out of the shop till he laid fast hold of me; he conducted me where I was searched and nothing was found on me; all this time I was either under his hands or his eye, so it was impossible for me to drop any thing without his seeing it; I was searched and nothing was found on me. I trust this will perfectly convince you of my innocence.</p>
               <p>Murray's Defence. I was going about my own business. I met this person, we went into the shop to buy a bit of ribbon; she did not purchase it; they searched us and found-nothing on us; there were a great many people in the shop besides us.</p>

I took particular notice of the man from various circumstances; about two or three minutes afterwards I felt a sort of a twitch at my pocket, I did not immediately take notice of it, not being used to carry my book in my outside pocket, till about a minute afterwards, when I exclaimed to my friend, I have lost my pocket book, and I added, that vagabond that is behind me has taken it; I then observed the prisoner cross the street, and my friend wanted to persuade me that I had left my pocket book at home; I told him that I had not, and we agreed to follow the man; when he got on the other side of the way to Lawrence lane, he was joined by a tall stout man, at least a taller man than himself, and shouter, they went down Lawrence lane in conversation; the prisoner turned round and saw myself and my friend following them; one went on one side of the way and one on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. They divided - A. Yes; and when they arrived at the end of Castle court they turned sharp round there, this prisoner and the tall man; we immediately ran as fast as we could in order to obtain sight of them; we lost sight of them about two seconds; I saw them in close conversation, justling something between them; and when we came up to them at the end of Castle court that leads into Monkwell court, my friend swore at the man, and said you have robbed the gentleman of his pocket book; they appeared both of them very much confused; I observed they were in the act of dividing the spoil, and the appearance of the pocket book, the lock is nearly torn off; the pocket book was in one of their hands, but their back being towards us I could not see which it was; one of them threw the pocket book on the right hand up the court; my friend went immediately after the pocket book, and the big-man slipped under my arm and went back through Castle court; the little man immediately ran down Monkwell court, I after him, full cry; he was stopped by a man in Lad lane; I came up and took him; my pocket book contained twenty three pounds in bank notes, which at present they are in the same state as when left, and two bills of exchange, one for fifty and the other for thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the man that was by you - A. I will swear that this is the man that was behind me, I took particular notice of him, he had got a pair of sporting garters on.</p>

               <p>Mr. Arabin. This occurred if I understand you right in Cheapside - A. Yes; about noon, it was one or two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. We, that know Cheapside, know that there is a great concourse of people there about noon - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that there was a stoppage there - how long did the stoppage last - A. I think it lasted about a minute and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. That would collect a great number of people - A. Perhaps about thirty.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not know every person in the crowd - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. A person inclined to go on might slip through the carts - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner throw the pocket book away - A. I have been given to understand since it was the big man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Although you cannot swear to every man in the crowd, you can swear this was one of them - A. I can.</p>

            . Q. You were in company with Mr. Huffam - A. I was: we were walking down Cheapside till we came to Bread street; a cart was passing down, which caused a stoppage; we had not proceeded above ten or twelve doors further down, when my friend said he had lost his pocket book; I asked him if he had not left it at home, he said no, I have lost it, and that is the man that I suspect that is going across the street; we crossed the street after him, and observed a man as big again as himself; he joined this man, and they went down Lawrence lane in conversation together; the stout man made a stop once about half way down; the prisoner at the bar then looking back, and seeing of me, pulled his companion by the elbow and went further on till he came to a court; they turned suddenly up; we both ran towards the end of the court; when we got there we were very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150030"/>much surprised to find these men very near at the top of the court; we agreed both to run after them up the court, which we did; I got there rather first, perhaps a yard or two, and to my surprise I found this prisoner and the stout man-with the pocket book in their hands.</p>

               <p>Q. Who had the pocket book - A. The stout man; they both had their hands together; the big one had the book, the prisoner's hand was to his; I immediately exclaimed he had robbed the gentleman of his pocket book; they appeared in great confusion, and the stout man threw the book away; I ran and picked up the book, at the same time calling out stop thief; we pursued him down Monkwell court into Milk street, and he was stopped in Lad lane; the stout man made his escape; he ran back in Castle court; we immediately carried the prisoner to the Mansion house.</p>
               <p>MR. WESTON. I am a warehouseman in Monkwell court. I saw the prisoner at the bar, he was in company with another man; their hands were together; I did not see the pocket book at that time; it appeared more than a common bustle; I looked very attentively, and I saw the pocket book thrown by one of them up the court on the right from where they stood. The prisoner ran down the court, and the other man up Castle court; one ran one way and the other the other.</p>

             to watch this man - A. Three or four days previous I was. On the 4th I was directed to observe him and to inform Mr. Price when he went out of the yard; I observed him, through a key hole, to go up into the loft after he was clean.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it customary for persons in his kind of employment to go there after they were cleaned - A. I conceive they have no occasion to go there after they are clean. I immediately gave information when he was going out of the yard.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 4th of February I searched the prisoner, I found this tin cannister upon him, I took it from his small clothes, under his apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it inside of the waistband or outside - A. Rather inside, covered over with his apron; I took it out from that part; the cannister contained two quarts and better than half a pint of spermaceti oil; the tin cannister of oil was was kept up by his small cloathes, and covered over with his apron. There was another accused as well as him; he was discharged by the magistrate. The prisoner did not say any thing as I observed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Price. The cannister contains sperm oil, such as we have in our premises.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I am now truly sensible of my error, and hope that when your lordship and the gentlemen hears my case, you and they will have mercy on my unfortunate situation. The oil for which I am here was, as I am led to believe, among the men in the warehouse, a perquisite that they in general had themselves, it was the drainings of every returned cask; my wages being little, and my wife and young child being dangerously ill, I unfortunately took the oil to keep a light for them; and that down to this time I always bore a good character for honesty and sobriety. I have a wife and three children. I crave the clemency of the jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Price. The oil is good oil, it is not drainings from the casks; I never heard of such a thing as perquisites in my life.</p>

            . I am a warehouseman.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the truss contain - A. Sixty four bags of buttons, and upwards of thirty seven pounds weight of twist; the whole was worth about an hundred pounds; it was coming to me. It came from Leek in Staffordshire.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was going down Wood street, a man asked me which way I was going; I told him down Barbican; he put it on my back; he told me he would satisfy me; I carried it down Maiden lane; the carman came and laid hold of me by the collar, and said I had his property. I did not see where he got it from; he had a white apron on, and apparently a fustain jacket. I live at No. 2, Bell court, Bell alley.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Thurlwell. On Tuesday last, the 14th of February, I was serving a customer about half after five o'clock, I heard a noise at the door; in consequence of which I ran towards the door; I observed the prisoner folding up a cloth pelisse, which hung up inside the shop, about three feet from the door; I saw her in the act of giving it to another person; they found they were pur- pursued; they let the pelisse fall between them; I overtook the prisoner about six yards from the door.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Holborn last Tuesday evening, to see a friend of mine in Glay's inn lane; I was five doors past his door, he tapped me on the shoulder and said he wanted me to come back; he took me back to the shop where there was a pelisse; he said a woman came to his door and took that pelisse; I said I knew nothing of it; I went on my knees and begged his pardon; he was going to let me out, an officer came and took me. I know no more of the pelisse than a child unborn.</p>

No. The contents of it were two five pound notes, three bills of exchange of sixteen pounds each, and a banker's check of seven pounds seventeen shillings; I had the book at the other place; when I came to this place I lost it; the check was in the book to the best of knowledge; Mr. Moore gave me the check four days before; I had not seen it since.</p>

            . On the 28th of January, Mr. Phillips and I were coming to London; just by the debtor's door at Newgate, there were three or four ran against Mr. Phillips; as soon as we got inside of the debtor's door of Newgate, he observed that he had lost his pocket book; I then observed to him that he had a check of mine for seven pounds seventeen shillings, that I had given him some days previous; it was payable at Mr. Lefevre's; I immediately ran off to Mr. Lefevre's as fast as I could; I was desired by the clerk to stop a little while, in all probability it would be brought into the house; I stopped about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and the check was brought in by one Farmer, a ticket porter; I followed the porter at some distance, until I was at the Antigallican coffee house; when I came there, the porter said he was not in the place; in consequence of waiting three or four minutes, I saw this young lad, the prisoner, he was standing inside of the outer door, as if he was looking for the porter; I went and took hold of him, I said my lad, I believe you are the gentleman that I am looking after; the porter came out and said this is the man that gave me the check; I went immediately to Mr. Lefevre, and from there to the Mansion house.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to the Mansion house; I searched him; I found upon him five one pound notes, and a sham bill for one hundred pounds; he gave no satisfactory account to the lord mayor, how he came by these notes; the lord mayor ordered me to keep them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Moore. Look at that check - A. The 14th of December, that is the date of it; that is the check I gave to Mr. Phillips on the Thursday before this happened; I have no doubt of it in the least; I took this check in payment; I kept it till the 26th of January, I gave it to Mr. Phillips, as he was going in the City, for him to call at Mr. Lesevre's and get the money for me.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a boy came into the banker's shop - A. When Mr. Phillips was stopped; I noticed two boys; I suppose there were four or five; these seemed to be about ten in all; I was noticing a man asking Mr. Phillips if that was Newgate; he said it looks like Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner near him then - A. I did; I told Mr. Churchyard; I saw no boy in the office; there might have been a lad; I never saw any lad there.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, this note you gave to Mr. Phillips on the 26th of January, you were with him on the 28th - A. Yes. On the 27th Mr. Phillips was coming to town, he did not come; on the 28th I said I would come with him. I know the note was dated the 14th of December, and payable at Mr. Lefevre's, seven pounds seventeen shillings. I told Mr. Lefevre so in his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. to Phillips. What did you do with the bill that you received from Mr. Moore - A I put it in my pocket book, and to the best of my knowledge never saw it any more; I never took it out to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the date of it - A. No; I know when the check was produced; he told me it was payable at Cornhill, and when I was at Cornhill I should have looked to see where it was drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any of the persons that were about you at Newgate - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any of your other property been found - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. In your pocket book had you any notes of the value of one pound each - A. No; I had two five pounds notes, no lesser.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the time when you received a bill from Mr. Moore - A. I recollect it was on the 26th, and I recollect putting it in my pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken the book out of your pocket for the purpose of looking into it - A. Many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your pocket book in the course of that time been out of your possession - A. Not to my knowledge; I never make a practice of taking my pocket book out of my pocket; when I take my coat off I leave my pocket book in it; I had in my pocket book a great number of memorandums and receipts, that I cannot show now.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 28th, at the time when you were before Newgate, you lost your pocket book, might not you have lost the note that I have in my hand, between the 26th and the 28th - A. I do not know but I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you took out the pocket book for various purposes between the 26th and the 28th - A. I had; I went back to the chambers to see whether I had left it there; I knew not where I lost it; at No. 10, Furnival's inn I knew I put it in my pocket; when I came to Newgate I found I had lost it; I went back to Furnival's inn to see whether I had left it there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you apt to lose notes out of your pocket book - A. Never before.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep your notes so careless in your pocket book - A. Yes; I put it among papers, where I do not put notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Because it belonged to your friend - A. I cannot say whether it was there or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is the burthen of your story, you cannot say whether it was there or not.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Clark. On Thursday the 9th of this month, between the hours of one and two, the cask was standing on the outside of our door, for the purpose of being removed into Wood street; it contained thirty one gallons of raspberry brandy; when I came to the door I missed the cast and the man; from information I found the prisoner coming out of a stable yard in Moor lane; I took hold of him by the collar; I asked him what he had done with the rasberry brandy; he said follow me, I will shew you were it is; he shewed me where he put it; he had put it in a corner of the yard and covered it with horse dung; he was very much in liquor; in fact he was so much so, if he had not been in liquor I do not think he would have done so; he bore a very honest character.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the cask was your master's - A. Yes.</p>

At the hour of ten o'clock we met the two prisoner's both together about an hundred yards from Mr. Whitwell's soap manufactory; I stopped Harris and asked him what he had got in the bag, and where he was carrying it from; he said he found it on the road near the turnpike gate; I took him into the public house to see what it was, I thought it was salt; they said they did not know what it was.

            . Q. I believe for some time past you have been employed by Mr. Whitwell - A. Yes. I know Toombs, I lodged in the same house with him; I knew Harris before the 2nd of this month. On the 2nd of this month I was in a public house along with them in Long alley, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any transaction passed between Toombs and you - A. Yes; I had lent him money at the time; I was in the public house, I told him I was very short of money, I had not enough to keep me the week; he asked me if I could not contrive some means for his paying me; he asked me if I could not get some soap down at Mr. Whitwell's; I told him I could not; he said he must have something got and something done; I told him there was nothing but some soda and some pearl ash where I watched; then they said they would fetch some bags; they did, and I put them in my pocket, and took them with me to the manufactory; they told me they would be there by nine o'clock, or soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had got there what did you do with the bags - A. I put these articles in. They came about half past nine, I unlocked the gate and put these bags down just by the gate post. Harris came and took the bags; there was another man at a distance, I could not see who it was; after they were gone I locked the gate and went in to watch. A day or two after I was apprehended and taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. So you were a watchman set to take care of this property - you thought it as well to be a thief as a watchman - A. They took me by surprize, gave me some liquor, and made me foolish.</p>
               <p>Q. They gave you some liquor, made you foolish, and then you thought you would be wicked - you got the property in the bags ready for them - A. They swore if I did not get it ready they would murder me.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that pearl ash - A. It is white ash in an unfinished state, it is not in a state for sale; I had a quantity of that in an unfinished state in my warehouse; the pearl ash is of the value of six or seven shillings; the other is soda, undried. I had a large quantity of that in my warehouse; the soda is of the value of twenty shillings.</p>

            , my brother in law, came back and told them to make use of better words; directly this here man struck Clements in the face, and the other hustled me a little farther in the road from them; he struck me, I had a stick, I knocked him down with it; he came again, and I knocked him down the second time; I heard a voice say, you b - r, draw your knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it said that - A. The prisoner. As soon as I heard that voice I immediately turned to the left, Jonas followed me; I had the same clothes on then as I have now; he struck me with a knife, I suppose. The officer took the knife away from him when he got him to the watchhouse. I was cut through my clothes, it ran into my back as far as the back bone. I have the shirt I had on here; he cut through my coat, waistcoat, breeches, and shirt; after he had done that I believe I knocked him down; I walked away; I saw no more of them; I have never seen Jonas since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. As to the man you call Jonas he was an entire stranger to you - A. He was; I never saw him before, nor since.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether his name was Jonas or Smith you know not - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did this last altogether - A. A very short time.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of which short time you knocked him down twice or three times - A. Twice, I am certain of; I did not like to stop after the word knife was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150034"/>mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you knock him down after that - A. I am not sensible whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that the other man was knocked down more than once - A. I cannot say, he was at a distance from me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go away until the prisoner, whom you had knocked down twice, called watch - A. He made a noise when he was down, I do not know what.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not both knocked down, and did not both call out watch - A. I cannot say; the one that came to me I knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath did not they both call out watch - A. The man that I knocked down, he called out watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon his calling out watch you and your companion went off directly - A. No, we did not; we did not make any stop; we moved on the same as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not, upon your oath, move to go off until they called watch - A. I do not know that we did; after the word knife was mentioned I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perceive at first that you were cut - A. I shortly after did; as I was going along I said I feel the blood running.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of your party was taken up for assaulting of them - A. I do not know any more than I am told.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking freely, had not you - A. I had been drinking about two hours and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner charge you with tripping him up - A. No; only with knocking him down.</p>

I did; about six o'clock in the evening I heard the door pushed open; I immediately went to the door and found the tea tray out of its place; the tray was taken from behind the street door, and on my looking up Queen street I saw a man going along, I run after him, I saw he had a tea tray under his arm. I took hold of it and said, my friend that is my property; he gave it me; I then stepped into the middle of the road; I told him he must not depart from me, he had stolen it out of my shop; I did not lay hold of him, I was alarmed; he walked on very fast and I after him; I told him if he did not stop I should have him apprehended; he ran, and I called stop thief; he stopped and made an attempt to come to me; I ran away from him and called stop thief again; then he stopped and came back running down Dartmouth row; I took hold of his coat and brought him into the shop and sent for an officer; he was never out of my sight after I took the tea tray from him; the greatest distance he was from me probably was five or six yards; I valued the tea tray at three shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner entrusted to sell goods and to receive the money for the house - A. Certainly, and to bring it to account.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he brought to account three pounds seven shillings, or any other sum for that article - A. I believe not; I have examined the books with very great care; the cash book I have brought here, in that book it should have been entered; it was his duty to bring it to account, and saw it so done.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Might it not happen that a person might bring the money into your till, nevertheless omit to make the entry in your book - A. He might so, but that would be found out and corrected at the end of the week; the cash book is settled every week.</p>
               <p>Q. That is provided there was no error in casting up the accounts - A. That is almost impracticable, if you were to see the books.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they not been found frequently to disagree - A. They have.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you state upon your oath, that the sarsnet of the pelisse, that that is what you had in your possession - A I cannot swear it, but I have no doubt it is mine.</p>

               <p>Mr. Plowman. I brought that remnant from my shop this morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How long have you had it - A. To the best of my belief, in August, 1807.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you positively say that remnant was in your house, December 1807 - A. I can, I have no doubt I had it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lesuse. I have looked at the pelisse; I have no doubt that the pelisse was made of part of that which Mr. Plowman has produced, is the remainder; it has a particular selvage; it might be imitated, but I could discover it.</p>

            . I am a City constable. On the 7th of this month, a little before nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Sun street; I met the prisoner with two others; they were coming from Finsbury square towards Bishopgate street; the prisoner had a velveteen jacket on, and the buttons covered with the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before - A. I knew him as perfect as my own brother; I have known him for several years; he had this piece of baize upon his left shoulder; I first passed him a little; the others that were with him were in conversation together; I heard the word Wake, it is a slang word among thieves, that they are to be put awake to it; I heard the word Wake distinctly; I turned short round and went between the prisoner and Mr, Matther's shop window, which had a very great light; it gave me a perfect view of his countenance; the instant I looked at him I knew him perfectly well; I asked him where he was going with it; he said what was that to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you - A. I do not suppose he did. I told him I was an officer and insisted upon knowing where he was going with it; I changed the stick into my left hand, for my right hand to have hold of him; he threw the load against me and made his escape; he ran as hard as ever he could run; I called out stop thief; I throwed the load into Mr. Matthers' shop; the next morning I gave information to Bishop the officer. This took place on the Tuesday evening; on Thursday morning he was taken in custody. I am positive he is the same man.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of this one - A. Between five and six pounds. The thirteen pieces that were taken away altogether were worth between sixty and seventy pounds; I have no doubt of this piece being one of the thirteen that were lost. They are only for exportation; they are the property of Mr. Lines, Josling and myself. This bale was marked C. G. No. 1.</p>
               <p>- STURTON. I am book keeper to Messrs. Lines and co. These two bales were deposited in the coachhouse by Mr. Lines' order; I saw them when they were there; I think we had them about the middle of December; I never saw the contents of them. The marks on the wrappers were

               <p>Q. The prisoner came in before eight o'clock - A. Yes; he came in with another person; I cannot tell the other person's name; he is not here; he was a tallish thin faced man something in the horse dealing way; they came in together in company, and drank together; they had nothing but one pot of porter all the time.</p>

               <p>Q. It was a very lucky thing that as the prisoner did not know you his friend should find you out - A. On Friday evening he came into this house. I was in the house drinking with Mr. Hedge again; he recollected me and asked me to be a witness; he took me last Sunday to Clerkenwell to see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man then tell you who he was - A. No; I do not know what he is now, nor his name, nor where he is to be found; he came to me to day about ten minutes after eleven o'clock and fetched me out of my master's premises and gave me a paper and a shilling and told me where to come to, and away he went.</p>

             - A. Yes; I was with him at the Angel tavern on Tuesday night; I recollect seeing the prisoner there that night, last Tuesday was a week.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go there - A. Twenty minutes before eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what time the prisoner came in - A. To the best of my knowledge five or ten minutes before eight; we had been drinking porter there; this man said sit a little further Stumpey; I said you have no call to call me stumpey, you are stumpey enough yourself. I went away from the public house past nine o'clock; I left the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons might there be in the public house - A. There were four soldiers, a young man and me drinking together, and the publican's brother, Gillman, he was rather intoxicated; I am sure it was the prisoner that was there, he had a brown coat on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You went there twenty minutes before eight - A. Yes; I had only about two minutes walk from my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. And you looked at the clock before you came out - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were four soldiers there, another man drinking with you, and the publican's brother - was the publican there too - A. He did not come in all the time, nor his wife; my daughter kept the tap room; she lived at the house about two months.</p>
               <p>Q. So the prisoner said, sit further up Stumpey, you moved and he sat down - A. Yes; he drank with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other man - A. I do not know him; the other man was in two or three minutes before him; they did not come in together; he was a thin, tallish man, thin faced; I have seen him since, I saw him at the Angel last Sunday, he came in while Huntington and I were drinking together; he said there is the two men that were drinking together on Tuesday night; Huntington asked him what song he sung on Tuesday night; he said he sung part of three songs. The prisoner's friend asked Huntington whether he knew the person that was sitting on the seat next me; Huntington said he did not take so much notice of him as the old man did; we went to the prison on Sunday to see the prisoner; he told me the man that called me Stumpey was taken up; and I saw the prisoner on Thursday where he was taken to.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it the people drank that night at the public house when you saw the prisoner - A. The prisoner and the other man had a pot of porter; I suppose between Huntingdon and me we had three pints of porter, we might have four pints for what I know. I left the prisoner there when I came away; and Huntington and I came away together.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure that you did not leave Huntington behind you - A. I do not know whether he was behind or no; I came out first.</p>
               <p>COURT. When did you last see the man that came to you in the public house - the prisoner's friend - A. I saw him to day about eleven o'clock; I saw him at my work; he came to fetch me.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner and his friend came into the public house did they appear as if they had been running - A. No, not at all; they were quite cool.</p>

I can tell you in what way I came by this tea, I found it laying about the warehouse; I had not a bit of paper to put it into, I put it in my pocket with full intention of taking it down to the accompting house; we were all very much hurried in our day's work, we did not leave the warehouse till the clock had struck two; it slipped my memory, when this gentleman asked me what I had got in my pocket; I said my pocket book; I did not recollect then; I had my pocket book in my other pocket; I recollected when I asked him to go back. I really forgot that I had the tea in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Clark's Defence. I went with Rawlins to the prosecutor's shop to purchase two yards of cotton at a shilling a yard, and six yards of print at two shillings and two pence per yard, for which we left two shillings for a deposit; we were going away, and we asked the shop boy if it was all right; he said stop, I must go up stairs and make the necessary memorandum; the boy returned; we went away, and got half a mile, when the boy came up to us and desired us to come back; the prosecutor stood at the door; the prosecutor charged me with taking a green print from under my apron, he said it was there before I went away; he said upon my return I put it down upon the counter; I deny it positively, I might as I passed touch such a print, but not to my knowledge. I get my living by shoe binding.</p>
               <p>Rawlins' Defence. I am young and pregnant; I am a married woman; I was never accused of a criminality before.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your house broken open on the 19th of January last - A. On the 20th, about two in the morning, I was awakened by hearing a noise in the shop; I immediately got up and looked out of a two pair of stairs window; the two pair of stairs is very low; upon looking out of the window I saw two men in the street' I called out watch; no watchman came; the prisoner looked up in my face for near five minutes; there was another man, he got out of the window; there was three of them altogether; two of them went towards Swallow street, and the prisoner ran down Argyle street; the two men went down Swallow street with a bag of the things they had taken from the shop; when I saw the three men run off I went down stairs and examined the shop immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How had it been broken open - A. One end shutter was forced down, and the pane of glass was broken; they put their hands in and unpinned one of the front shutters; they then cut a pane of glass out; the pane is very large, large enough to admit the body of a man; the man got into the shop. When I came down stairs I missed all the articles stated in the indictment; the value of them altogether was between twenty four and twenty five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these things in the shop - A. The night before, about ten o'clock, I had seen them all there; I fastened the shop up myself; the shutters were put up and the windows were whole at ten o'clock. I am confident the prisoner is the man that stood at the door; the snow was on the ground, and the lamp at the door being directly over his face, gave sufficient light for me to distinguish his features.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be looking at him - A. Near five minutes; he was looking up the whole time, I could see his features completely; had I have met the man in the street for this twelvemonth I should be confident of the man; he had a velveteen jacket and small clothes, the same that he has on now.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a waistcoat had he on - A. I could not tell, his jacket was buttoned.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he shoes or boots on - A. I could not see, nor his stockings I could not see what they were; he had the same dress on when I saw him at the office.</p>
               <p>JURY. Are we to form an opinion, that while you were looking out of your two pair of stairs window, and was calling out watch, that the man remained five minutes staring up at you - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not he come voluntary to the office, he and a man of the name of Flowers came without being in custody, he had been waiting at the public house - when you come Griffiths went to the public house and brought the man over - A. He did; I said that is the man, in the yard, when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. You would wish us to believe that the man came in the same dress - give me leave to ask you whether you do not know that there is a reward of forty pounds - A. I have lived long enough in my country to know that there is a reward; I do not do it for the sake of the reward; I have heard there is a reward of twenty pounds for the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was one article of your property found - A. Not a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you were robbed was it that the prisoner was taken - A. It was seven days after the robbery that he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take up another man - A. Flowers was brought to the office for me to look at.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not any body else taken upon your information - A. There was not; I could not swear to any other; I did not see any of their faces but the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150042"/>Q. You continue to be positive to the man, and that he continued looking at you for that time - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a hat had he on - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man had a cocked hat an you must know it - A. He had a round hat on.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man stood under you, having a round hat on, the flap would of necessity obscure his face - A. No, unless it was bent down it would not.</p>
               <p>Q. You, in a two pair of stairs window above him, the light of the lamp between you and him, the light of the lamp must fall upon the flap of his hat, that must shade his face - you said he had a round hat on - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer of the public office, Whitechapel. I received information from the other end of the town that a shop had been broken open in Oxford street; I sent to a person of the name of Flowers, and desired him to call up to me; he did, at the public house near the office; I told him that there was a complaint against him and a man of the name of Greenaway; I asked him if he would call upon him and bring him to me on the Friday; they did come to the house at time appointed; I said not a word about this; the reason of my desiring them to come was upon my receiving this information. I desired them to wait till two, and if the gentleman did not come by that time, they should go home; they did stay, and just before two Mr. Southey came to the office; Mr. Southey described the person of the prisoner to me, he said he was dressed in a velveteen jacket and breeches; I fetched the men; he looked at the two men, they were both in the same dress partly; he pointed out this man, he said he would swear to him; then I told them to walk into the office, I would put them both to the bar, which I did; an examination took place; he positively sworn to this man before the magistrate; the other was discharged. My brother searched the prisoner's lodging, no part of the property was found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am as innocent as a lamb - so far from my being in connexion with any one in that robbery, the night after the robbery was done, I was obligated to pawn my bed for two pounds to support my wife that was lying in, and my five children. I am innocent in ever having acted hand or part, or even knowing the part of the town where he was robbed; my circumstances were so low I could not afford any body to look after my wife; I was obligated to make away with my things to support her.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On Tuesday the 7th of February, about seven in the evening, I was in company with Ekelsoe and Deer in Holborn, at the corner of Kingsgate street; I had just before heard a whistle; I looked, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner of Kingsgate street, I knew him, I asked him what he was at there; I think he replied nothing. I laid hold of his hand, and desired my brother officer to lay hold of the other; I asked him what he had got, he said only some stockings. I took him into a liquor shop, and found these things in his bosom; I have had them in my custody ever since; he told me he found them things in Holborn, he picked them up. It was a dirty night, and the stockings were not muddy, they had no appearance of having been dropped in the dirt.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Mr. Book's - A. Two or three hundred yards or more; Mr. Book is the corner of Dean street, and this is the corner of Kingsgate street.</p>

I was coming home on Tuesday night along Holborn, I picked up these stockings; I saw three men running before me; I cannot say whether they dropped them or not; I was at the corner of Kingsgate street, I was going to the public house to get a pint of beer.</p>

In a quarter of an hour I saw them pass the window, with a number of other people, and on my going to see what was the matter, I saw a scarlet cloak, my property, in the hands of a neighbour, Mr. Bignall; on which I went and seized both the prisoners.</p>

Passing by Mr. Squire's door Mr. Squire came out and owned the cloak which I had in my possession. At Mr. Squire's door the young one ran in between us, and asked me what I wanted with his brother. The oldest said he had bought it of a dustman and gave four shillings for it. James said he bought it of Mr. Squire and gave three shillings for it. The cloak has been in my possession ever since.</p>

On the the 28th of January I had been to Hammersmith with my master's waggon, I brought some empty sacks; I had eleven quarters seven bushels of wheat put in them, and two bundles of empty sacks at the top, and two bran sacks stuffed in behind; one sack was marked with my master's name, and the other with Mr. Griffith's name, he lives at Walham green; he delivered me that empty sack to put bran in, and to be sent back to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you arrive at the Three Pigeons - A. About five o'clock. I took the waggon under the gateway, shut the gates up and left it there; when I put the waggon in I took out my coat, and then I saw the two sacks at the tail of the waggon; I missed these two sacks on Monday morning, the 30th of January. I have since seen them in the possession of Mr. Collit, the constable; I am sure they are the two sacks I left in my waggon at the Pigeons inn.</p>

            . I am a carrier from the Angel at Brentford. On Sunday the 29th of January, in the evening, the prisoner came to my house, he asked me if I would buy a sack of wheat; I told him no. He went down my yard; I followed him. I saw two sacks with wheat in them, in one cart, and another sack in another cart; he asked me leave to let him leave them in my stable till the evening, he would fetch them away; I gave him permission to put them there. He went away and I locked the stable up and kept the key myself; the next morning I was summoned on a jury at Westminster hall, I was obliged to be up early; I saw the two sacks that were marked with Mr. Kidd's name, and one in the name of Griffin. I gave Mr. Kidd information. I left the sacks in the stable and locked the stable door. He was to be with me on Monday evening, but I was not at home till after ten o'clock at night, then I understood he was apprehended. I delivered the three sacks to Mr. Collit the constable.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

               <p>Q. On January the 12th were you there - A. At half past four I unlocked the stable; I was then in the stable ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the stable then - A. No; then I locked it up, and came again about a quarter before seven.</p>

The prisoner nursed a child in the house while the mother went to work. Mrs. Terry's sister, the prisoner, was in the house after I came home at night; at ten o'clock in the forenoon of the next day I came home; I spoke myself to the prisoner about it, and then Mrs. Terry spoke; I asked her how she came to break the door open; she strongly denied it, she said she would tell my landlady, the landlady would not tell her father, he would beat her. I do not know what further passed; they went out of the room.</p>

            . I am officer of Lambeth street. On Saturday the 31st of January, I searched the prisoner's box; I found a pair of breeches and two waistcoats tied up in a bundle; the shirt was loose in his box; the box was locked; I took the key from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, the crime alledged to my charge is the first that ever was imputed to me; I cannot account how the property in question came into my bundle; I should be sorry to lay an imputation upon any one person in particular. I had it in my power to defraud my masters to a considerable amount; on the evening I was taken in custody the woman servant asked me to go for some milk; I said I would oblige her, as there was no one else in the house; I put the bundle on the table and went out of the house, I could not get any; the woman said she would go; she went out and brought in one of the clerks; she had egress to every part of the house, the same as me; she and I were never in the habits of friendship; I hope my master will give me the character I deserve, and the honourable court and jury will pity my case; my fellow servant afterwards told me that she or me should leave our situation. It was certainly put into my bundle unknown to me.</p>

               <p>Miller. He said when I took him it was the first time, he hoped his masters would be as partial to him as they could.</p>
               <p>JURY. Was the servant and him at variance - A. No, they were very intimate.</p>

When the officers arrived we went up stairs together to the same door and pushed the door open, we went in and saw the prisoner in the act of having some goods out of the box; we saw the box had been broken open, and a poker laying by the side of the box; some of the goods laying on the table, I think; I am positive there were some on the carpet, and some was remaining in the box; there were twenty five pieces of worked muslin, and one piece, I believe it is called worsted net. The prisoner, when he saw me, wrung his hands and begged me to forgive him, he said he would never do so any more; I told him he must take his chance. We then took the prisoner to Bow street. He had lived <rs id="t18090215-95-deflabel525" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>Q. On the 14th of January do you remember seeing the prisoner come there - A. Yes; I was taking the baggage from the coachman who was at the top of the coach; I left some of them unloaded from the coach in the yard while I was taking the packages to the warehouse. It being dark I could not see the directions, only the size of the box.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see a box afterwards at the prisoner's lodgings, or at Bow street - A. I did. By the size of the box I believe it to be the same that I took from the coach that night. When I returned for the two other boxes the prisoner was standing by, I asked him to lift up one box, he did so, and he said he would bring the other to the warehouse; I missed him and the other box both together.</p>

            . I am a porter at the Bell Savage. On the 14th of January, in the evening, I saw the prisoner there; he had a pint of rum; I saw the prisoner go out of the yard, he came in the yard again just after the Southampton coach arrived; in about twenty minutes after I saw him coming out of the yard with a box on his shoulder; he let it fall; he ran across the road and went down Dolphin yard. I saw the box again at Bow street; I believe it was the same box by the size.</p>

Last Monday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150048"/>week, about four o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by some person in the room; the prisoner laid in that room; he was not at home when I went to bed. About four o'clock I was awoke by some person at my bedside; I called to know what it was; the person answered so low I could not tell who he was; I put my hand over the bed side and felt the prisoner, and I felt for my watch in my hat; I found it was gone. I put my hat under the bed, and my watch in my hat; I called to the prisoner again, he said he was looking for something of his own; I told him there was nothing about my bed that belonged to him. I got up, and found my clothes in different directions to where I had left them. The prisoner asked me if I was going to get up; he said it was too early for me at present; I told him I knew my business, I must go and call my master up. I got up, called my master up, and gave charge of the prisoner; the watchman secured him; by that time my master was up; he came out with a light. I saw the prisoner's hand move; the watch was picked up by my master about two or three yards off, in the direction that the prisoner's hand moved.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How many lodged in that room - A. Four; my bedfellow was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. You and the prisoner had been very good friends - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not friends, you were very great enemies - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went out of the house first, you or the prisoner - A. I went out first, and the prisoner closely followed me.</p>
               <p>Q. You never complained to the prisoner of his taking your watch - A. I did not, I was afraid of the prisoner; I knew there was another man in the room besides. I never had any quarrel with the prisoner.</p>

            . At four o'clock on Monday morning I was alarmed by a knock at my door, I thought it was the man come to his work; there came a second knock. I went out undressed. The moment I opened my door, my man exclaimed the prisoner had robbed him; I asked him of what, he said his watch, and he was afraid of some money, but he was not certain, as he found his clothes misplaced. I told my man and the watchman to see that he did not throw any thing away. The moment I spoke the word, I saw the prisoner's hand go back, as if he threw something away; I told the watchman that he had thrown something away. I got a candle and looked for what he had thrown away, in that direction; I picked up a watch four yards from him; then I went with the watchman to the watchhouse and left him there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I suppose the glass of the watch was broke - A. No, it was not, it was bruised.</p>

Soon after four the prosecutor came to me in a very great hurry, with his clothes half on; he said a man had robbed him, he said this is the man, he has got my watch; I laid hold of the prisoner with my left hand, he gave a struggle to disengage my hand; he immediately up with his fist; I gave him to understand that if he did not deliver himself to me I would knock him down. We got him nigh to Mr. Warner's door, Mr. Warner opened the door; the prosecutor told him the man had robbed him of his watch; he said take care of him that he does not throw any thing away; instantly he threw his left hand back and let the watch fall in the street. Mr. Warner said he has thrown it away now, watchman. Mr. Warner brought a candle, looked in the direction he saw the hand go, and found the watch three or four yards behind him.</p>

I was calling the hour of nine o'clock on the 26th of January; at the bottom of Dyot street I saw the prisoner and another man, the other man was trundling a wheel in the foot way; I asked the man where he had the wheel from; he said it was his own, and if you have any suspicion you may come and see; with that he trundled the wheel along the channel. I told the other watchman to go along with him and see whether all was right; the prisoner's mother has been to me at the watch-house, and asked me if I would take a bribe, and make a flaw in the indictment.

On the 11th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came very much intoxicated to our shop with a gallon pot in his hand, I was serving some customers with cotton shirts, he did not offer to sell it; I took the pot off the counter, I asked him where he got this pot; after some hesitation he said he picked it up in the street; I saw it belonged to the Cooper's Arms, Lower East Smithfield; I sent the boy down to Mr. Steward.</p>

On the 17th of last month, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I apprehended the prisoners; as I was taking them to Bunhill row Crick said he could draw a light as to the stockings; I locked them up for an hour and a half; I went back to them, Crick said to Rumball if you know any thing of the other things I will thank you to acknowledge to this man; Rumball told me I might find the breeches at Mr. Birkett's in St. John street, the duplicate was between his bed and the sacking; I went back, and my brother officer picked it up and gave it to me. He said he had sold the waistcoat in Rosemary lane for half a crown.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. About the middle of December we lost three spoons, and so on till the beginning of January. I was determined to find out who was the thief; there were no strangers came backwards and forwards to the house. I put two spoons out, one on the table and the other on the dresser; I cannot exactly tell the day of the month; it was in January. I went up stairs, and when I came down in the kitchen I missed the spoon off the table; the prisoner left in the kitchen. I went up stairs and acquainted my mistress of it. My fellow servant came down and asked if we knew any thing of that spoon; the girl was then in the other kitchen. My fellow servant asked me to turn my pockets out, and then asked the prisoner; she turned one pocket out, it contained nothing but a pair of gloves; she said she had no other pocket; my fellow servant put her hand to her side, felt she had a pocket, and desired her to turn out what she had; she had no spoon in her pocket, she had put the spoon up between her frock and her stays; my fellow servant took it from her person. We then acquainted our master with it. The prisoner then said she took it up by mistake, and asked did we mean to say that she had stole it; we asked her what she did with the others; she with a great deal of persuasion acknowledged that she had pawned them.</p>

On the 15th of February, a little boy came into our shop, No. 56, Turnmill street and asked for some cakes; my mother asked him who they were for; he said a lady at the door; he had a bundle with him; he said the lady was a little way down the street. He went out, he came in again, and asked for sixpennyworth of cakes of any sort. My father went out, and I went out; I went one way and he another in pursuit of the woman; I overtook the woman and called for assistance, and I had the woman taken up to Hatton Garden office.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 14th of October last do you recollect being at the Kings Arms public house - A. Yes; I went to pay the men at four o'clock, there were three carpenters, a bricklayer, and a labourer; the prisoner stopped about twenty minutes behind, then he came in and sat down by himself in the tap room, separate from the other men; I paid the men; after that I went down to the building, I missed the brass cock and the pipe; I saw it that day, before I went to the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of the pipe - A. About two shillings and sixpence, and the cock sixpence.</p>

               <p>Q. Some time after that you met a man of the name of Cummings - A. I did, on the 6th of this month; I missed the lead and the cock on the 15th. On the 17th of October I had some information from some children in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he and you upon good terms - A. We were upon good terms, I had no difference with him whatever except in this transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he brought any action against you - A. He has; that was after the 15th of October, he brought in a balance of seven pounds odd due to him; I paid him four pounds to get rid of him because he was a troublesome man.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you notice of trial - A. About a fortnight ago; he was apprehended a week after that, When the officer went to apprehend the prisoner the prisoner said he would not go without he shewed his warrant; the prisoner made his escape.</p>

               <p>Q. The place where you live commands a prospect of Mr. Ben's premises - A. On the 15th of October last I was at work at my own shop, at my bench under the window, I could see the premises very plain, even the ground; I saw the prisoner standing with his back towards me, he had a piece of leaden pipe in his hand, between two and three foot long; it seemed to be something of the leaden pipe that belonged to the premises, I did not observe the cock to it; he was standing about five or six feet from where the pipe stood. On the 6th of February I communicated it to Mr. Ben. I accompanied Mr. Ben and Mr. Partridge to apprehend the prisoner; when we went to his house he was not at home; we went then to No. 15, Quaker street, he escaped through the roof. I apprehended him; I said Lawrence, I want to speak to you; he said do not hurt me; I said there is so and so after you; I told him I would conceal him, for the purpose of drawing him forward; I said how silly you were to steal the water pipe: he replied so I was, but good luck to you, you are a good fellow; do not say a word about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you, Partridge, and Mr. Ben went to apprehend him - A. On the 14th; Valentine's day.</p>
               <p>COURT. How came you not to tell Mr. Ben of it on the 15th of October - A. I had no acquaintance with him then; I did not suspect that he was going to steal the pipe till a woman accused him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is your shop - A. No. 44, Brook street, in the second story room.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the premises where the cock was - A. Yes; even to the foundation; if a shilling laid close to the foundation I could see it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I was coming up King street, I was laying hold of a young woman; I left her for three minutes; I thought of course I would overtake her; I told her to go into Swallow street; I ran after her, and while I was running to catch her, as I thought, there was a man running before me; he threw a bundle at me, which was them things altogether; I catched them altogether, they were in a white cloth, I catched them at my breast; I know nothing further of them than that. Them keys were not in the crown of my hat, my hat was knocked off in the scuffle. When he took my hat off, he said what have you got in your hat; there was nothing in it; I acknowledge the whole kit of them was in my hand.</p>

We were going on from Swallow street to the end of Major Forbes' passage, he let go my arm and told me to go on; not seeing him come back I looked back, I saw the prisoner; a man that was running threw something at his breast; in the fright I run back, I missed him.</p>

               <p>Q. That happens to be neither the 18th or the 19th - A. I went out with him. I have known him about sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. What relation are you of his - A. I am no relation of his; I have known him so far as if I was his own sister I could never have known more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not he been abroad - A. I never could know that, I have been out of town.</p>

               <p>Q. You cannot say he has not been out of England - A.

               <p>Q. Have you acted as bookkeeper to the prisoner Wesley - A. Yes; I used generally to go of a Sunday, if I was wanted oftener he came for me; I then made such enties in the book as he occasionally wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the 5th of April last, killing two pigs, two shillings, did you make that entry - A. I did; I killed the pigs, the two shillings was paid to me; I was present at the delivery of the pigs to Mr. Warboys.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that pig that was delivered to Mr. Warboys one of these two, for which there is two shillings charged for killing - A. Undoubtedly it is. I was present when Wager paid three pounds; I signed the receipt with Wesley's name, by Wesley's desire. This was on the 2nd of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look in the book and see if there is any entry of three pounds received of Mr. Warboys, does it appear on the 2nd of May, or afterwards - A. No; that is the book I kept for Wesley. Some time after he expressed himself as though he thought he never should get the remainder of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that time give you directions to put down the three pounds - A. I never received any directions to put down the three pounds; he said let it be till I receive the remainder, it will make a short account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after that under his direction make up the book for the quarterly settlement - A. Undoubtedly I did; that was at Midsummer. The balance was then struck and settled, without that three pounds being brought to account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to cast up the book once a week - A. Yes; I used to come on a Sunday, take his directions, and cast up the book, On Friday the money was sent up to pay the men.</p>

Yes; the prisoner came to me I believe, on the 10th for the money; my wife paid the money; I throwed down a guinea, and my wife throwed down four shillings; I asked about a receipt for the twenty five shillings; he said I cannot write, as soon as I get home I will strike it out of the book.

               <p>Q. Had you occasion to put a horse of your's in a stable adjoining his stable - A. I had; I put him there about the latter end of September, he had been there about three months; the stable belonged to me, it adjoined the mill; the horse was in a very good condition when I put him there first; I gave fifty guineas for him, I sold him last week for about fourteen pounds. I sent my man there regular with from four to five trusses of hay a week.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some certain circumstances that you observed did you speak to Coombes the officer - A. I did; about the 25th of January; I watched the prisoner first; Mr. Coombes advised me to put a label in the truss of hay, we sent a man down to the stable with it, and my brother, and Mr. Coombes the officer likewise followed me; I saw the hay put in the stable and the door padlocked; this was the 25th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, it was moon light, but dark. I, and my brother, and Coombes went into an adjoining garden for the purpose of watching; we saw him go past; he staid there about a quarter of an hour; the prisoner went in about three or four minutes after the man had deposited the hay in the stable; we saw the prisoner go into the stable and take away the hay; when he took the hay out of the stable he came back the same way close to me, and when he came near we immediately rushed upon him; he flung the hay out of his arms; he was apprehended immediately. I saw him throw the hay down; we all three rushed out together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you lose sight of him before he was laid hold of - A. No, he was apprehended that very instant; he said he hoped I would forgive him, it was the first time. After the hay was picked up we got a candle and found the label in it. We took the prisoner to the office; I went back to examine the padlock of the stable door; we found the staple drawed; this is the adze that drawed it out; I found it on the ground by the padlock.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of a truss of hay - A. About three shillings and eight pence.</p>
               <p>Coombes. I have the label; it is both our hand's writing.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the day laid in the indictment any thing attracting your notice respecting the prisoner - A. Yes; when I came down at half past six, before it was light, as I went along the passage to get into the back yard, I found the bar door open, I heard a rumbling noise in the kitchen; I went down as far as the kitchen door, I found that door open; I said to the prisoner, Tom, is that you; he said yes. I went out backward where I wanted to go to, and when I came back the bar door was shut to. That is all I know. I went out to work, when I came home at breakfast time I told the prosecutor of it.</p>
               <p>MR. LITTLEPAGE. I am a headborough. On the same evening I went to the Britannia, I took charge of the prisoner about a quarter past eight at night; Mrs. Foster told me that he had been robbing them for six or seven months, of what she had been working hard for; he said indeed he had not, it was all his own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150056"/>property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the prisoner's box - A. Yes; after I had taken him to the watchhouse; I found in his box, it was unlocked, twenty five one pound notes, twenty two guineas, twenty seven seven shilling pieces, four shillings, fifty four new halfpence and penny-pieces, and sixty three new farthings; there was a canteen of rum, a broken glass with bitters in it, two twopenny loaves, a shirt marked Foster, the name in full length, a new neckcloth with G F on it, a pair of stockings, and a pair of pantalooons, with a rule in one of the pockets; they are all here in the box.</p>
               <p>COURT, to prosecutor. Is that the box in which you found the things - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q In what state did you leave the bar the over night when you went to bed - A. It was fastened in the state that it usually was, I fastened it with two buttons.</p>

            . I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your stand near Doyle's stall - A. Yes, it is part of my beat. On the 8th of February, I was calling half after four, I saw a basket between Doyle's stall and another stall; I called Sheene, another watchman. I said there were thieves there; as we went round we found fifteen basons deposited in a place not far from there, and four salt cellars; they were about sixty or seventy yards from Mr. Doyle's place; I left my brother watchman to keep watch for who should come for this earthenware; while I went and called Mr. Doyle to let him know that his place was broken open; as I was going away my partner called to me and told me that he had stopped a woman towards the earthenware; when I came up to Sheene I found it was the prisoner; my partner asked her where she was going at that time of the night; she said she came from Charles court in the Strand, she was going out to wash in Hatton garden; he asked her to shew her hands; her hands looked dirty, not like a washerwoman's hands; I told my partner to keep her in custody till I brought Mr. Doyle; we took her in the watchhouse and searched her; in her pocket we found two salt cellars and a knife; Mr. Doyle believed the salt cellars to be his. The prisoner said she was going through the market she picked them up. The padlock had been forced off Mr. Doyle's shop.</p>


               <p>- SHEENE. I am a watchman in the Piazzas, Covent garden; as I was calling half past four, the last witness told me had he found some earthen ware, when I came to him he said there was an empty basket, he believed the people had been robbed; looking further we found these basons; a quarter before before five the prisoner was coming round Mr. Bailey's shop in the road; I observed her turn back when she saw me. I followed her and took her in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her meddle with the earthenware - A. I did not; before she altered her direction, she was coming towards the earthenware; when I stopped her I asked her to go with me; she entreated me to let her go, she was going to washing in Hatton garden, and she came from Charles court in the Strand; I asked her to shew me her hand, her hand was quite dirty; we took her to the watchhouse and searched her; these two salt cellars was in her pocket and a knife; she first said she lived at No. 14, and then No. 7; we went to Charles court, we could not find what part of the court she lived in.</p>
               <p>Wren. Before I called Sheene I heard a foot go through the market; I went after him, he was about twenty yards from me; he got towards James street; I did not know of any depredation being done at that time; I thought I had no right to stop him.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through the market, I picked up the two salts; the knife is what my boy cleans the shoes with; I have four children.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the carman and distiller access to the different backs of spirits - A. Yes, every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time, and when, discover that you had lost various quantities of spirits - A. I did; in January, and before in October and November; in the early part of January I took the stock myself along with the excise officer, and one cask of brandy was missed of four gallons; my suspicion fell upon the prisoners. On the 21st of January, I went through the accompting house into the cellar, Thorn and Smith was in the cellar; I said Thorn your mistress wants you to go of an errand. When Thorn came back he went into the same place again, and when he came back again, I said Thorn you have been a long while getting your beer; he went further into the cellar, than where the beer was, that gave me suspicion; I there found a quart bottle filled with peppermint; I put it in the same place, it remained there till the Monday. On Monday, the 23d, at night, I found a bladder in the cellar behind the same cask where the bottle was; on Tuesday, in the evening, on examining the stable, in one of the stalls I found a bladder containing gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoners access to that stable - A. Yes, both of them. On Friday the 27th, Matthews the officer came to my house; we examined more minutely; on a load of straw were four empty bottles, apparently emtied of spirits; the bladder in the stable was full; Mr. Matthews thought it right to get a search warrant, and when we came back the bottles and the bladder were gone; the prisoners returned between one and two, and went to their work again, and continued there till<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150057"/>night; the officer came to my house again at half past four o'clock; they were taken in custody on Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in these places - A. I did; the bottles were returned there empty; and looking at them just before the time they went away the bottles were filled in the tub in the cellar under the distil house, and the bladder was filled in the stable; they left business about six o'clock; at the time they were going away, Mrs. Jackson desired one to go through the gates, the other to fasten the gates and go through the house. I went into the cellar, I found that the bottles had been removed; I came in and mentioned it to the officer; the officer went out and brought them back to my house; I saw a bottle that I had seen before in the tub, and a small bladder that I had seen before in the cellar; there was gin in both; the gin in the bladder corresponded with the gin in the vat. Smith then said, Oh! God, what have I done, I have been robbing my master, it will transport me. Thorn said there was no great harm in it, or something of that.</p>

When the prisoners returned to work, Mr. Jackson went backwards, and he saw the things all filled again. As soon as the prisoners were gone out I followed them; Thorn went out of the house; I came up with them and catched one in each hand; Smith turned round and struck me; Trott came to my assistance. I searched Thorn, I found this bottle in the waist of his breeches, buttoned with this loop; the bottle was full of gin at the time, it contained about a pint and a half. I was present when Trott searched Smith; he found this bladder full of gin in his coat pocket; I had seen the bottle in the cellar, I am pretty well sure it is the same bottle, and the bladder is apparently the same bladder I saw in the stable.

               <p>Q. Did you miss your pocket book before he went away - A. No, nor for a long while after. I took my pocket book to get change; I am not certain whether I put it in my pocket, or left it on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out of your room while the prisoner was there - A. I went backwards; I was not more than ten minutes gone; the prisoner stopped in the room alone till I returned; then in about twenty minutes he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not odd that a stranger of this sort should stay with you all that time - A. He talked about something, I did not think he came to do any harm; I often had seen him and sold him wood when I kept a shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the prisoner was gone out was it that you missed the pocket book - A. About an hour after I missed it, and I went after him; I did not see him till about eight o'clock the next morning; I asked him whether he had my pocket book, as there was nobody else in the way; I told him I knew he took it; he called me a fool, and said he did not take it away. I have never seen my pocket book from that time to this, nor my money nor my earrings.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the business that led you out of doors - A. I went backwards in the yard; I went and looked in the privy myself; I could see the soil, there was no such thing there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner near enough to you when you were chatting together to take it out of your pocket - A. I do not think he was; he was of one side of the way and I of the other.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the cart loaded with - A. A load of hay. I could not see him lay it on the cart, there was a garden hedge prevented me; when he came back to the stable I went to the cart, I found two trusses and a half instead of one and a half, which is the usual allowance; I put a twig of birch into each truss to know the truss again; my intention was to find out the receiver, as he had to go to London and back again. After he was gone with the cart I followed him; it was moon light; I kept as near as I could all the way to London; the hay was on the cart at Hendon, and at Golder's green, and at a watering house, the Black Cap, the hay was on the cart, and between the Black Cap and Battle bridge the hay was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever speak to him about this truss that was missed <placeName id="t18090215-116-crimeloc659">between Camden town and Battle bridge</placeName>

On the Monday following I told him I wanted to know what became of the two trusses of hay that I missed out of the lost, one on Thursday morning and one on Saturday morning, because I had counted the trusses and knew where he took it from; he said he never took out any hay but what was for his horses; I told him I did not ask about what he had for his horses, that you had out of the hay rick, I ask you about two trusses that you had out of the lost; he always denied taking any more than a truss and a half for the consumption of his horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it might not have dropped - A. It was not likely, it might be possible.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of a truss of hay - A. Three shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When you say it was not likely to drop off, you do not mean to say it might not fall off - A. It might possibly fall off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Master has said at different times in the stable he did not care how much hay I had for the horses, so as I did not waste it; I never did waste it.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer - A. Yes. On Sunday the 22nd, I took the prisoner in custody; I searched the prisoner's lodgings, I found twenty six shillings more of copper; here is one paper tied up; the boy swore to his tying them up before the magistrate, and this handkerchief I found at the lodgings.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Grannell. One of the paper of halfpence was tied up by me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had thirty shillings in copper by me, before I went into Mr. Phillips' house, by my own working for; the boy is mistaken.</p>

On the 14th of January, about six o'clock, I was going from one part of the premises to the other, I heard a noise in the passage; I approached to see what it was, a man came out in a confused manner; I asked him what he had been doing there, after talking to him, all I could get from him was that he had been in the office to see William; I suspected that he had been upon no good; I had to direct a letter for the post, for which I had to go to another part of the premises, and on returning I had to go into the passage where the noise had been; on opening the door into the passage this form, that is in court, fell against me; I went after the man; he was gone, he had ran away; I concluded from the form being so heavy that more than one was concerned in it; I immediately shut to the printing office door; I waited there about half a minute, I heard a foot seemingly in confusion going backwards and forwards; after waiting about half a minute I saw the prisoner, I knew him, he had worked for me a twelvemonth before that; he said in a confused way, Mr. Wilkes I came to see if you would have given me work; I had no doubt then but he must be the man that was concerned with the man that ran away; I was then anxious to get him up stairs, I said, certainly go up stairs, I will give you plenty of work; he said very well and went up stairs; I listened and observed that he did not go further than the second flight of stairs; I heard him stop there; about half a minute after that I heard him come down stairs again; when I saw him approach I called loud why do you not go up stairs, and I will come up to you; instead of going up again he ran down as fast as he could and knocked me down, he aimed at the door to get away; I stood at the door to prevent him going away, he knocked me from the door to get away, we struggled about half a minute he attempting to get away; I then fearing violence called out murder; about a dozen men came down from the top of the house and secured him. This is the form of types, we had two stolen; one I detected him with; we found three on the stairs that they were in the act of taking off when I discovered him. This is my property.</p>

On the 14th of February, I was going up the yard, I saw one of the warehouse doors half open, I thought some one was in there; I went and saw the prisoner in the warehouse; I saw sugar in his hands; he appeared to be very much confused at the sight of me; I asked him what he wanted there; he wanted to see George; I told him George was gone; I came out of the warehouse, he followed me, and as he came down the yard he past me, I thought his pockets looked full of something; I followed him into White cross street; I saw sugar drop out of his right hand pocket as he was walking along the street; I was sure it was my master's property: I laid hold of him, he begged me to forgive him, he had never been a thief before; I took him back and sent a man into Wood street to inform my master of it. The officer came and took the sugar out of his pocket which weighed five pounds; some was raw sugar and some was lump.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the yard, the door was open, I thought I might take some sugar, it would sweeten my wife's and childrens tea, that was all; I never did such a thing in my life before.</p>

On the 3rd of February, both the prisoners came into my house between eleven and twelve o'clock, and called for two or three glasses of rum; after they had drank and paid for what they had they both went out together; the pots were drying in the taproom by the fire; while they were there my servant found two of the pots missing; I followed the woman down to her lodging No. 2, Saffron hill; I asked her what become of the pots; I took her back to my house; the man prisoner came in to know what was the matter; I felt a pot on his side under his coat and another in his pocket; I laid hold of him, in the scuffle he got me down; I got up and knocked him down; I kept him till I sent for Wood the officer, he took the pots from him. The prisoners have lived together, they do not live in the house; I heard the woman say that she had lived with the man prisoner five or six years, he had used her very ill. The man prisoner offered me a seven shilling piece not to send for an officer, when I had him down.</p>

            . I am a taylor. On the 31st of January last, between the hours of five and six o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop in a very great hurry with something in his hand, he threw it behind a tub in the shop; I went to see what it was, it was a couple of pieces of carpets; I was rather uneasy at the man throwing it in in that kind of way; I sent my brother round to the brokers; I found in Spital square Mr. Harlow had lost two carpet; in about an hour and a half the prisoner returned again, and passed up to the place where he had put them; I told the prisoner I must know where he got them; he made answer it is all right; I sent for an office, he came and took him in custody.</p>

            . I took the prisoner in custody at Mr. Owen's house, and the carpets; he had then the carpets with him; I asked him where he had got them; he said from a sale in Spitalfields, he did not mean to keep them; he had been employed to hold the candle for the auctioneer.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I get my bread by attending sales; there being nobody there when the sale was over I took the carpets down; I asked the girl in the shop if I could leave them there; I did not throw them behind a tub, nor any thing of the kind. When I went to fetch them from this gentlemen's house I told him I was going to take them to Mr. Harlow's house. I had been holding the candle for Mr. Harlow two hours, of course I expected something for my trouble.</p>

I went out and asked him what he wanted; he said their cart was coming with two hogsheads of gin; I asked him whose cart it was; he said Mr. Hodges of Bank side; I continued in the yard with the prisoner; he was talking about Mr. Hodges' servants stealing gin from him; I left him and went into Smithfield and returned back again: I said is not your cart come now; he was sitting on a hamper in the yard; I went in doors and missed him off the hamper: it was a vinegar half hogshead; I went out and saw him taking it down the yard; there were six in the yard, two of them were taken away; I thought he was gone to take them to this cart; I went in pursuit of him; in a little time I saw the prisoner coming from Smithfield; he made a way for Turnmill street; I pursued after him and he then met me; he said master I will pay you for these six casks; I said I do not think you have any right to them; he said the cart was up the street; he took me up Turnmill street; the cart was not there; I took him back to the yard.</p>

I asked him very rough what he wanted there; he making no reply I asked him a second time; he said some shoe strings; I shewed him some shoe strings; he gave me a shilling in my hand; I supposed the shilling to be bad, I held it in my hand and looked at the prisoner and he at me; he appeared confused at the time; he suddenly took up the shilling and ran out; I came round the counter, I missed two handkerchiefs that lay in the window; I went to the shop door, I did not see any thing of him; a lad told me he saw him put the handkerchief in his pocket.

            . I am servant to Mr. Coker. I found the stable broken open, there were two saddles, two pair of traces, and a collar gone. On Tuesday morning I went and saw the saddles and traces; I know that they belonged to my master; I am certain the saddles are my master's.</p>

               <p>Shortland's Defence. I was in the habit of going backwards and forwards, and likewise a great many other young men were in the habit of going there to the young women; the landlord of the house desired me if I had any friends or any thing in the apartment belonging to the young women, to take them away; accordingly I did, and went to a public house in East Smithfield; Mr. Windey came and accused me of a felony.</p>

               <p>Levy said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses his character.</p>
               <p>Shortland called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see that cap - A. On the 27th my husband and the servant who now lives with me went to her lodgings and brought her box; she was with them herself; she said she could not tell about the baby's cap; she believed the habit shirt was in her box by mistake; upon looking at them I knew them to be mine.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of November last had you occasion to export any articles to Antigua in the West Indies - A. Yes; on board the Russia Company, captain Grisdale; I employed the defendant as my <rs id="t18090215-133-deflabel769" type="occupation">shipping broker</rs>

               <p>Q. Where did you give Annis instructions to enter your goods - A. At Lloyd's coffee house.</p>
               <p>Q. As shipping broker it would be his duty to make<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150064"/>the entry of the goods - A. I understood so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him, at the time he made the entry, a list of the goods that he was to enter - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that list that you so gave to the defendant copied from that I give to you - A. It was, with the exception of one article of forty pounds. (The paper read.)</p>
               <p>COURT. How much do it make in all - A. Four hundred and forty pounds sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. One article, 5 T H, the sum was not put down in the paper that you gave him - A. No, it was not. I said to him there were several articles in that trunk, he must put down what was necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, from your dictation, put down the articles in that trunk - A. He did; I told him what value to put upon that trunk; forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore then it became a complete copy of this - A. Yes, it did.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had given him these instructions did you yourself take the goods to the West India docks - A. I did; he said he would meet me there if he could. On Tuesday the 5th of November I took the goods; I did not find him there; I left the goods there.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him - A. I think, to the best of my recollection, I did not see him till Saturday the 12th, he came to me at my house in Moorfields, he came into the shop; he said he brought his little bill and put it down on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the bill which he brought to you - A. Yes, that is it. (The bill read.)</p>

               <p>Q. At the time that he produced this to you did you make any observation of convoy duty three hundred and thirty four pounds sixteen shillings, and commission three hundred and ninety four pounds sixteen shillings - A. Yes, I did; he said the commission was always paid upon the whole sum, though the duty was not; the linen and cotton went free.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon his stating this to you did you give him any money - A. Yes; I paid him the amount; I paid him eleven pounds in notes, four guineas and a half in gold, half a crown, and six pence; I believe I asked him where the paper was that I had given him to enter the goods by; he said he had mislaid it; I asked him if the business was done, and how it came to be so long before it was done, and whether they were put on board; he said no, they were not, but that they should be done, that he would go down to the docks that morning and get them on board.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he say the entry was made - A. He had charged the entry; he told me that the goods were not put on board, but he would take care and put them on board that morning; this was Saturday the 12th of November; I told him I wanted to see him again, and where I should see him; he said he would meet me at Lloyd's that day at four o'clock; I met him that day at Lloyd's, I asked him if the business was done; he said no, some part of them was opened; I said for God's sake, for what reason; he told me to be quiet and easy and all would be well about them, that he should see me again on Monday, he would give me a better account of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did any thing then pass about the entry - A. No, nothing at all. On Monday the 14th of November we met again at Lloyd's, I asked him if they were then put on board the ship: he said no, they were not, but that all but the linen were stopped and opened; I said it was very odd they should be opened, for what reason: he said be still and quiet, and if nothing was said to them it should all be right again; I told him I could not think of any reason why they should be stopped; he told me if I would be quiet he would put all to rights again.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you meet him again - A. I saw him again at the custom house; I went down to the custom house and enquired about the goods; that was on Wednesday the 16th I saw him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that your goods had been stopped - A. I found that they had been seized by the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it stated in the prisoner's presence on what ground they had been seized - A. No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>MR. MILLER. Q. You are a collector of customs for the port of London; of the customs outward for the port of London - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the defendant, Annis, coming to make any entry of goods on the 11th of November last - A. No, I cannot; I have some hundreds come to me on a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper - A. This is my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw that signed - A. I dare say I did; I believe it to be signed in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a declaration of the value of the goods for the purpose of exportation, for what purpose is that entry made - A. For the several duties; one in the middle is the convoy duty upon that entry; I cannot speak to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. That is your hand writing, that is all you prove - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the defendant made an entry of this before you, he put the value of the goods, you put the charge from the value of the goods - A. Yes; the exporter makes it out and I sign it; that is my hand writing.</p>
               <p>MRS. FAVEY. Q. Have you had any opportunity of knowing the defendant, Annis's, hand writing - look at that and see whether you believe that to be his hand writing - A. I did not see him write it; I believe it to be his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that and tell me also whether you believe that to be his hand writing - A. I believe that to be his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that, that is another paper, do you believe that to be his hand writing - A. I cannot say as dto that; I do not think that to be his hand writing. (The receipt read.)</p>

               <p>Q. What did you find the real value of these goods entered sixty nine pounds ten shillings - A. Perhaps three or four hundred pounds, or more; vastly exceeding the entry; I thereupon seized them.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had so seized them did Mr. Annis come to you - A. He did, and his excuse was that in the hurry of business he had committed the error.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew he was a person acting as a shipping broker - A. I never saw him before this transaction.</p>

            . I am a publican, I live at the Red Lion, Poppin's court, Fleet street. On Sunday morning, the 5th of February, my wife awoke me, she told me somebody was breaking into the house; I opened the window, I saw three men at Mr. Leaf and Severs' warehouse, they were standing against the warehouse; the watchman came to cry the hour of half past three, and they dispersed; I got into bed again; presently I heard the noise of moving some shutters, I got up and dressed myself and came to the one pair of stairs window; I watched them alternately, sometimes at the window and sometimes at the door; that part of the shutter that they first attempted to break they left off, it made such a noise; they began another shutter with a center bit; after they had made a small hole with the center bit the watchman came by; they dispersed the second time. When he came at four o'clock they had made a very visible hole, then Norman stood with his back towards the hole, and his face towards me, and the others went away. The watchman asked him what he was doing there; he said he was in liquor, he was going home to Stonecutter street; they had some conversation relating to some gin. After the watchman went to his box; they went to work again; the prisoners and another there were three and at times there were two. Thompson and Norman came back, they continued to work, excepting when the watchman came round at half past four, then they dispersed as they did before, taking the precaution to daub the shutter that they had cut with some mud that they took out of the gutter. About a quarter before five these men were very attentive to work; I armed myself with a small poker, went and collared Thompson, and struck Norman; a scuffle ensued, they gave me a few slight blows<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150066"/>with their hands; I turned my attention towards securing one; I beat the one that I laid hold of till I thought he had sufficient and he was in my power; then I turned to Norman, he ran away; while I turned round to Norman, Thompson ran down the court; I pursued him at about two yards distance; I was about two yards distance from him all the way down the court till we came to the bottom; two watchmen were turning into the court, they rather impeded his progress; I came up to him, collared him, and turned him over to the watchman; I heard a voice say what is the matter; I turned round and saw it was Norman. I gave him in charge likewise; they were both taken to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw them at half past three - A. Yes; and when they were taken it was a quarter before five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the persons of these men - A. The lamp gave a very indifferent light, I could not swear to their features ; when I gave a knock at Norman I had a full opportunity of seeing; he had the opportunity of running away and going to Fleet street; but when he returned and asked what was the matter I was convinced he is the same man; I am now quite satisfied in my own mind he is the same person; the other man there can be no doubt of him; I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Before the alderman you were not quite so certain as you are now, you then said you thought he was dressed like the man, and his voice was like the man that you heard speak to the watchman - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were taking Thompson, Norman came behind you and asked what was the matter, his voice corresponded with the man you had heard before and you gave him in custody - he was not committed when the other man was - A. He was; and after being committed he asked leave to bring some people to prove where he was at the time; he brought some person to prove where he was at two o'clock; the next day he was to bring people to prove further; then he could not prove so far as he did the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to speak positively to Norman - A. His going out of my sight does not enable me to speak so positively as to Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. The man who did escape, whoever he was, you gave him a pretty sharp blow on the neck with the poker - A. I fancy I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact he was examined and no mark found on his neck - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my beat is in Poppin's court, Fleet street. When I went the hour of four Norman was standing with his back to the shutter; I asked him what he was standing there for; he said he was looking towards Mr. Shenton's window; he wanted a glass of gin; he said he could get one; Shenton knew him very well; I told him he had better go on; he said he would. I went up to the top of the court; he asked me if there were no houses open where he could get a glass of gin, he would give me one; I told him there was a night house in the Old Bailey where he might get some; he wanted me to go with him; I told him I could not go, nor I would not go; he told me that he lived in Stonecutter street; I told him to go down Poppin's court into Harp alley, to Stonecutter street, or to go down Shoe lane; he went down Poppin's court; I went down to the watch-box, and then I went about half way up to where the noise was, I heard a noise of screaking; the noise ceased a bit and then began again; I could not think what it was: I thought it was some people moving their goods, I thought I must watch if in case any body moved their goods away I should be blamed; I went up the court, then Mr. Shenton was pursuing after these men; Thompson was stopped at the end of Poppin's court, Harp alley ; when we got him a little way down Harp alley Norman came up and asked what was the matter; then Mr. Shenton gave charge of him; I laid hold of him and took him to the watch-house along with the other.</p>
               <p>Q. After the long conversation that you had with Norman about the gin, had you the opportunity of observing him so as to be able positively to tell that he is the man - A. Yes, I had, at the end of the court.</p>
               <p>- ROGERS . I am beadle and constable of St. Bride's. The prisoners were brought into our watch-house between four and five in the morning; I took the charge from Mr. Shenton; they were searched in the watchhouse and no implement was found on them at all; I was in the room when Norman was stripped at Guildhall; there was no marks of any blow on his neck or body.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, to Leaf. How was the house broken - A. The shutter was cut through the wood but not through the plate ; they had attempted two places, one place was cut with a slight mark, the other was cut a round ring through; about five inches diameter was taken out of the wood part, leaving the iron plate on the inside; the iron plate was nailed to the wood.</p>
               <p>COURT. Mr. Shenton, you said you heard a noise - A. Yes; it was something like a splitting of the shutters; a screaking noise.</p>
               <p>Thompson's Defence. I had been out to a money club that I belong to, I stopped very late; I went to sleep on a bench. I live in Shoe lane; coming home very late some young girl picked me up and took me down this court; in the mean time the young girl took me down somebody rushed upon me and struck me with the poker; I ran; I did not know but it was somebody belonging to this girl, and they were going to use me ill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney addressed the jury on behalf of the prisoner Norman.</p>
