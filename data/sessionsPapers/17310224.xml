                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173102240019"/>An ADDRESS to the GENTLEMEN,</p>
               <p>By Dr. GREGORIUS,</p>
               <p>(Noted for his Skill in Surgery and Anatomy, as well as Physick and Chymistry.)</p>
               <p>WHO having observ'd the frequent Advertisements in the News Papers, of one and another single Medicine, said to cure all sorts of Gleets , and Seminal Weaknesses, which their Authors confound together, as if there were no Difference between them, has been prevail'd upon, by his Friends, in this publick Manner, to inform, and undeceive those who have unwarily been brought into either, (or both together , as it sometimes happens) of these perplexing, draining Imbecilities .</p>
               <p>That where the Gleeting is only from a Laxity of the Glands in the Urethra , what leaks and drills away insensibly from them, through the Urinary Passage, and spots or smears the Linen, though it be yellowish, vet being without Pain, or any ill-condition'd Disorder, is no more than Mucus , and must be cured one Way.</p>
               <p>And where it is a Seminal Weakness, that which slips away involuntarily, though it be thin, watery, and unelaborate, either by itself, in the Day-time, or a Nights too frequently, or prosusely in the Sleep, or with the Urine, or upon Stool, whether from an Acrimony, or Depravity of the Juices, or by over-straining the Spermatick Vessels, or both, is Seed, and is to be remedied another way, inasmuch, as that Medicine which will cure the one, will not cure the other, and (vice versa) as every Practitioner that knows the Nature, Make, and different Situation of the Parts ministring to Generation, will allow; and that for want of this due Distinction, and right Application, it is, that so many People are disappointed of Cure; and by Continuance of the Gleetings, are drain'd, as they are, into Impotencies, or Infertilities, which as it hinders their marrying, gives 'em great Anxiety, and the more, when attended , as in some, with Pain and Weakness in the Back and Reins; or, as in others, with Difficulty, or Dribblings of the Urine in, or after making it, which at length comes away either foul , sharp, slimy, or of an ill Sell .</p>
               <p>As this is so in Fact, and the Dr. well known to have experienc'd, in numberless Instances, the noble and never-failing Effects of two particular Balsamick Electuaries, which he spared no Pains or Expence to find out, the one to restrain the Mucus, and the other the involuntary shedding of the Seed, by their respectively bracing up the Fibres, and restoring the Tone and Springiness of the relaxed Glands and Seminals, invigotating the Genitals , and fertilizing the Seed, was also perswaded to recommend their Use, that those, who, for a long while together, had tried other Medicines for the same Weaknesses, and by their not succeeding, concluding themselves incurable, might be convinc'd by their speedy Amendment and Recovery by these, that it was not the Incurability of their Malady , but the wrong Method they had been in for Cure.</p>
               <p>But yet in either of the said two Weaknesses, or where it happens that they are complicated, and have proceeded, either from Self-abuses, excessive, or over-straining Coitions, or from over Purgations in Venereal Cures, or any other Cause, as a Flux of Humours generally falls down and settles upon all weakened Parts, rendring them still the weaker, and these tender nervous Parts more especially: The first Step to be taken in order to make way for a regular and substantial Cure, (and without which it is not to be accomplished) must, in a peculiar Manner, be to correct, and gently divert those Humours; and the only Medicine he could ever rely upon to do this effectually, that is, to overcome the Cause, and introduce the Cure of the most difficult of these Weaknesses, (even where the Vessels had been obstructed, Manhood greatly enseebled, and in some, well nigh extinct, or at least not able to touch a Woman, but ad primum labiorum contactum, semen emittunt; ) has been his Preparing Pills, of which when the Patient has taken only three Doses, at due Distances he is to begin (and not before) with one or t'other (or both together, as the Case may chance to be) of the said two Electuaries, which how to distinguish in, and how to proceed with, the printed Directions, wrap'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173102240020"/> up with the Pills, do so plainly shew, that no Persons, even of the meanest Capacities, can be at any Loss to understand them; but will by their observing the easy Rules therein laid down, have their Blood and whole Body well cleans'd and purified, the debilated Parts strengthened, and by Degrees, compleatly, and lastingly invigorated and restored , so as to be enabled quickly, and safely to Marry, without the least Need of any further, or other Advice or Medicine.</p>

               <p>They are to be had, Price 7 s. 6 d. the Box, sealed up, ready to be delivered to any Messenger, upon only asking for, a Box of Pills, at Mr. Payne's, a Bookseller, at the Crown, facing the Chapter Coffee-House, in Pater-noster-row.</p>

             has lately prepared two Anti-Scorbutick Medicines, being Pills and a Spirit, which excel any thing yet offer'd to the Publick, with a Purge given at proper Times with it: It expels the numerous Trains of Scorbutick Symtoms; and as the Hypocondriac and Hysteric Illnesses have their Source from the Scurvy it relieves them; it altors and changes all the Juices in the human Body, renovates the Blood, restores decay'd Nature, chears the Heart, revives the Spirits, and opens Obstructions of the Viscera, gives Rest to weary, tired and worn out Bodies, it invigorates and inkindles again the almost extinguish'd natural innate Heat, making the Vital Flame to burn clear, removing Weaknesses and Indispositions, and restoring the prestine Health.</p>
               <p>The Symptoms are cutaneous Eruptions, as red, yellow or black Spots upon the Arm and Legs, as small as Flea-bites, sometimes as large a Crown-Piece, and sometimes the Limbs are beset with rough scaly Swellings, oftentimes there is an itching of the Skin, and is frequently taken for what is vulgarly call the Itch.</p>
               <p>The Scurvy perverts the Lympha, and is a mortal Enemy to the nervous System; for Scorbutick Persons are troubled with Weariness, Weakness, Sonse of Weight, and a dull obscure Pain in the Limbs, the Appetite is either too stimulating or too languid, the Gums are liable to Excrescences, Swellings and Ulcers, and when rubb'd void either a saltish Blood or serous Humor, the Teeth are loose and corroded, the Mouth has a Stench; the Sp is very salt and sometimes acid, they are likewise affected with nocturnal Sweats, difficulty of Breathing, wandering Pains , a fat Skin is found sometimes swimming on the Top of the Urine; but all these Symptoms are rarely found in the same Person.</p>
