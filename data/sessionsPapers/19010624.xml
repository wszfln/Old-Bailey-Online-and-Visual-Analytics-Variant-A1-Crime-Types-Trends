               <p>Crown Court, when Anderson left the others and crossed the road, and caught hold of a man who was under the influence of drink, and pinned him against the wall, and called out to the other prisoners—a uniform officer went towards them, and they left him—they went down Fleet Street, and looked into the prosecutor's shop, 90, Fleet Street—there war jewellery in the window; there were no shutters; it has an iron grating—they went into St. Bride's Avenue—I saw Upton, another plain clothes officer, and told him I wanted him to watch St. Bride's Lane—Fleming was watching at the end of the lane, so that he could see people coming in from Bride Lane or Fleet Street—I do not think Fleming saw Upton—I rejoined Males, and we ran through Salisbury Court, and entered St. Bride's Avenue from the other end—I saw Anderson standing by St. Bride's Church door, and Nolan standing on some iron rails attached to the windows at the back of 90 and 91, Fleet Street—he had his hand on this piece of copper (<hi rend="italic">Produced),</hi>which kept the fanlight up—if it was broken the window would be open; it is about 30in. by 20in.—there was a stool inside, so there would be no difficulty—Nolan was trying to break the copper, but he could only bend it, as he was not tall enough, so he got down—he went back to Anderson, who was still at the church gates—he went and mounted where Nolan had been, who took up the position of Anderson; Fleming was still at the other end of the court—Anderson mounted the rails, and gave this piece of copper two wrenches backwards and forwards, when Nolan rushed up and shouted, "Go on," and then ran away—Anderson jumped down and followed—I watched them go through the court and meet Fleming—they turned sharp to the left, which would take them into Fleet Street—I sent Males into Fleet Street, while I followed down St. Bride's Avenue—I saw the prisoners enter the bar of the King Lud, and immediately come out by the door on the left—I was standing outside the door—a uniform man came along—I caught hold of Nolan, and the other prisoners were caught by the other two detectives and the uniform man—they were taken to the station—in answer to the charge Anderson said, "I thought it was only a case of drink"—he was not drunk.</p>

I tried to get away from them; I ran up Wellclose Square; I drew a revolver from my pocket with the intention of throwing it away; the hammer caught in my pocket, and it went off by accident; I ran on, and then was caught by a policeman. I threw the revolver away, and told the policeman I did not intend to do him any harm."</p>

The window was open a foot from the top, and I went into the machine-room, and went behind the machines and had a sleep. That is the only time I went into it. When I was asleep I heard a noise, and it woke me up. It was the police, and I called to them to come to the other end of the room. I had no intention of stealing anything in that place." <hi rend="italic">He repeated this statement in his defence.</hi>

               <p>socks, shoes, and gloves—the gloves were examined by the seconds and the referee before they were put on—I saw Bettinson there—he examined the gloves, and so did Corri—I am familiar with the rules of the club—this contest was under these rules—up to the seventh round I thought Smith was a little way ahead—in the seventh round Smith invited Roberts to get in a blow; he was leading off with his left, and he avoided a blow from Roberts; he went like this (<hi rend="italic">Imitating the action),</hi> and came back on to the ropes; his head struck the ropes, and he doubled up and came under the ropes on to the floor—as he got up time was called; he went to his corner a little bit <hi rend="italic">groggy,</hi> but nothing unusual—after the usual minute interval the men stood up again—I did not notice anything about Smith till he turned round to face Roberts; then I saw that he was dragging his right foot after him; when Americans are boxing they have a way of dragging their feet in that way to get a firm hold on something—they got to the right side of the ring while sparring—Smith's back was to the referee; he went down on his knee—I cannot exactly say what caused that—I saw Roberts strike a blow, but whether Smith wan struck or not I do not know; I believe he was; he rolled over—Roberts stood away—no other blow was struck—Smith was counted out—he got up with the assistance of his seconds and went to his corner—at the end of the 10 seconds the referee called out, "Out," and awarded the contest to the other man—the deceased became conscious; I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> his seconds wipe him down and sponge him and help him to his room—I do not think the blows exchanged in the contest were at all hard; I have seen a great deal harder at the German Gym<lb/>nasium, and at other boxing contests—it is usual in a boxing competition to strike hard blows—I should think they were striking as hard as they could to win the contest.</p>

I used to box—the scoring is by points—the harder you hit, the more likelihood you have of getting through your opponent's guard—getting a blow in depends as much on your oppo<lb/>nent's agility as on your blow—I think these two men were equal in skill—so far as I am aware, there is no advantage in a man using unnecessary violence; in fact, he would be militating against his own chances of success, because you want to keep your head cool and your hands handy, and also to keep your temper—I do not think in the last round that Smith got a blow; if he did it was very light—if he was hit it was on the chin—he was defending himself—it could not be called a knock-out blow by any exaggeration—in the seventh round he overbalanced himself in trying to get his balance—from first to last Roberts boxed perfectly fairly.</p>

There was no external mark correspond<lb/>ing with the cause of death—a man falling will make a natural effort to recover himself—if in falling to the floor he struck something between his head and the floor without expecting it, he would strike that object with more force than he would strike the floor, because he would not expect it—if Smith fell in trying to avoid a blow, and in falling struck his head on the rope, that would cause the injuries—people taking part in anything that produces excitement, like a walking race or a heated argument, are more likely to produce effusion of blood, but excitement alone is not sufficient, but it would produce the expansion of the blood-vessels, and render them more likely to be affected by a blow than a man who was quiescent.</p>

               <p>difficulty in saying if a competitor is working for a knock-out blow—I know Colonel Fox; I do not know if he would put his name to a rule which could not be carried out—there would be no difficulty in carrying out the rule, "If a knock-out blow takes place by accident, the prize will be allotted to the competitors by their previous marks"—I have not seen the Scottish Amateur Boxing Rules; I do not think they have been in existence very long—there was not a joint discussion between our Association and the Scottish Association; they have never put themselves into correspondence with us—there would be no difficulty in carrying out this rule, "In the event of a knock-out blow, the round in which it occurs shall finish, and the marks for that round shall be awarded for the work done up to that point"—I do not think there is more inducement to a man to deliver a knock-out blow than an ordinary one.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LORD LONSDALE</hi>. I am a member of the National Sporting Club, and have been interested in boxing for 25 years—I have seen a great deal of it—I know the club rules; they were all founded on the Marquis of Queens<lb/>berry's rules—there was an exhibition of boxing for young men under 17 years of age, and it was found necessary, for the sake of endurance and minimising danger, to make certain rules, and the foundation of them was taken up by a committee—Rule 5 was the subject of careful consider<lb/>ation—it is a reasonable rule—it was made from a humane point of view—the Marquis of Queensberry came to the conclusion that a boy or a man who went down could, after a time, proceed; but the exhaustion was so great that it became dangerous, so the 10 seconds rule was made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The National Sporting Club rules were instituted to substitute science for brute force—I think that the rules which existed before the Queensberry rules necessitated a fight to a finish—I have attended some Public Schools' competitions—the rules are signed by Colonel Fox; they say, "Rough fighting will not be allowed"—I think that is the same as "roughing on the ropes," which comes under the head of wrestling. Rule 5 says, "No points are awarded for a knock-out blow; if a competitor is seen to be working for a knock-out blow he will be cautioned, and if he does not desist he will be disqualified; if, on the other hand, a knock-out blow takes place by accident, the decision will be awarded on the points already allotted to each competitor"; but who is going to find out if a man is working for a knock-out blow?</p>

I am an examiner in the Official Receiver's Department—I took part in the preliminary examination of the prisoner on his Statement of affairs—it was first taken by Mr. Sims on July 27th, and statutory questions put; and on August 29th and 30th the prisoner's answers were completed, and he signed it as correct in its com<lb/>pleted form—he describes himself as carrying on business in Leather Lane, and states that he sold the stock at 50, Lower Marsh to his brother, Thomas Holmes, for ₤50, in May. 1901; and that he gave ₤100 for the busi<lb/>ness, and said, "In 1897 I had a shop at 40, Exmouth Street, Clerkenwell, removed to 31, Exmouth Street, and traded until June last, when I let the premises to Mr.Fogo, and sold the stock to my brother Thomas for</p>

I am an agent, of 12, Darville Road, Stoke Newington—for some years before the prisoner's bankruptcy I sold boots and shoes to him on behalf of different manufacturers—I called on him from time to time—it was pare of my business to notice his stock—in April, May, and June, 1900, I called frequently at his shop, 38, Leather Lane, and at his warehouse in Hatton Wall—I called at his shop in Leather Lane on July 2nd, his petition being on July 17th—I should say the value of his stock was about ₤1,000—I do not think there was so much stock in May and June—his stock varied; sometimes there was a larger amount at the warehouse, and sometimes more at the shop—in June I saw at least ₤3,000 worth of stock at Hatton Wall at one time—the prisoner showed me over the stock once or wice in May, June, and July—he had several houses—I saw his stock in Drury Lane previous to the transfer to the son, and afterwards—its value was between ₤500 and ₤600—the transfer was notified in the boot and shoe trade journals—it was advertised—I called at his shop in Lower Marsh, Lambeth, in May or June—the value of the stock was ₤500 or ₤600, and that at Exmouth Street, when I went with the debtor once or twice in May or June, was about ₤250.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, of 49 and 51, Ball's Pond Road, Islington—on May 14th, 1900, I bought from the prisoner 862 pairs of boots and shoes—I paid him for them by this cheque for ₤120, which is endorsed "John Holmes," and the cheque was crossed, but as he told me he had not a banking account, and wanted the money, I wrote on it, "Please pay cash," as it appears—I took from him this receipt for ₤120—I sold them by public auction on May 21st—they realised ₤137 7s.—Eatwell was a purchaser at that sale—he bought in the name of Brown—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190106240058"/>
               <p>I knocked down to him lots 262, 305, 248, 317 and 403—in the catalogue each of the lots 262, 305, 248 and 317 is described as six pairs of kid<lb/>legged leather-lined boots—on May 30th I advanced him ₤140 by this cheque of that date upon another parcel for sale on June 18th—he wanted the cheque open—I took this receipt, which states that it is an advance of ₤140 upon these boots pending sale—lots 145, 146, 147, 148 and 150 are described in the catalogue as "parcels of six pairs of satin-lined Balmorals"—lots 145, 146 and 147 were sold to Packer—the whole lot upon which I had made an advance realised ₤213 14s., which, after deducting commission, left a balance owing to the defendant after the sale, of ₤49 16s.—I paid that by this cheque, dated June 22nd, 1900, for ₤49 16s., which is open in the same way—the boots came from the defendant's premises in Hatton Wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chartered accountant at the Railway Approach, London Bridge—I was appointed trustee in the defendant's bankruptcy—from his Statement of affairs the total amount due unsecured is ₤7,030 4s.7d. for goods supplied, and ₤22 for gas and water—I took possession of stock of the value, at Leather Lane of ₤1,391 13s. 6d.; I saw the bankrupt, and adopted the figures in the statement as the value of the goods at cost price; at Hatton Wall, ₤609 12s.; roughly, ₤2,000; cash at the bank, ₤2 4s. 4d.; trade fixtures, about ₤15; furniture, ₤20; leases: Lower Marsh, ₤50, of 38, Leather Lane, estimated at ₤200; total, ₤2,288 9s.10d.; further assets were disclosed by book debts, ₤1 16s. 8d., and estimated surplus from creditors fully secured, ₤556 10s.; that has not been a realisable asset—the real value is about ₤2,000 at cost price—the deficiency works out at ₤4,255—that will be augmented by unrealised assets, so that the real deficiency is ₤5,000, roughly—none of Joseph's three cheques produced were accounted for to me, nor the proceeds of the alleged two transfers to the brother, and one to the son of the premises in Clerkenwell, Lower Marsh, and Drury Lane—under an order obtained by me, the defendant filed the deficiency account of ₤4,255 in round figures—I received no material to vouch those figures except his statement that he lost certain moneys advanced as loans to different persons, but none of those persons' addresses could be found—I think he made that statement in his public examina<lb/>tion; the deficiency account simply gives the figures—there is in the schedule, "Loss by burglary, July 1st, 1900, at 38, Leather Lane, ₤707; loss of business during illness, Christmas, 1899, about ₤100," but no</p>

               <p>reference to losses by advances—he did give that as an explanation, but no amounts of loans, only names and addresses which could not be found—his banking account is of amounts paid up since January, ₤4,000 odd, and since April 1st sums drawn out amount to ₤2,708 4s., and several amounts paid in—I do not find any proceeds of stock in his bank<lb/>ing account since April 1st—I am giving you the figures from an extract from the pass book—on April 1st his credit balance was ₤63 4s. 4d., and on May 1st ₤101 11s. 3d.—₤1,076 15s. was paid in between April 1st and May 1st—except from the defendant's statements, I had nothing to account for the deficiency—there were no books, so that it was impossible to get it—what has become of the stock we do not know, except what we have found out by examination of the bankrupt, and the evidence given before the Magistrate and here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am an expert in the leather and boot trade—I was instructed by the solicitor acting for the bankrupt not to prepare a State<lb/>ment of affairs, but to take the stock only, in view of a statement being made to the creditors when they met—I saw enough of the defendant to find out that, although he could read and write, he is illiterate—I do not imagine he is good at figures—when he paid money into the bank there would be a succession of acceptances—that is borne out by his pass book—I found no paying-in book—from the cheque books I found his pay<lb/>ments out were for goods and other legitimate payments—a few little items were not traced—all that has been paid into the bank has been properly accounted for—at the beginning of 1900 he had a cash balance of ₤117 5s.3d.—there was a total paying-in of ₤4,743 in practically six months—on June 25th there was a balance of ₤4,229 4s.—I instructed a private detective to make inquiries as to the burglary—he was also tracing out goods—I sold the lease of Leather Lane for ₤112—₤200 was tendered with the stock—Mr. Cohen, the purchaser, sold it to the London County Council for a much higher sum, but I did not know the L.C.C. would require it, or I should have retained it longer—his payments in cash into the bank were not identified—I valued his stock just before the private meeting being called by the solicitor, which was on July 13th, so that my valuation would be about the 10th or 11th—I got the cost price from the defendant, and a bundle of invoices was handed to me—I made an inventory, as I adopted the figures in the statement—I did not know it would be wanted—it is at my house at London Bridge; I can get it—Mr. Raphael's question to me in cross-examination as to the total value of stock being only ₤2,043, referred to the purchase of goods within the last two months of June and July—he asked me whether I had tested that by statements from creditors, and since I have applied for, and got state<lb/>ments from all the creditors, but the question had nothing to do with the figures I had adopted as the value of the stock—two months before the petition I got ₤2,161 12s. 7d. from statements obtained from creditors since the examination at the Police-court—in the debtors' schedule it was ₤5,257, but probably whoever prepared that statement had put down wrong dates, and the months in which the goods were supplied—I have known cases where empty cases are among the stock, but it is not the usual practice—in taking stock I should look.</p>

I was instructed to make inquiries in reference to a burglary stated to have taken place at 38, Leather Lane, and on Monday, July 2nd, I examined the premises—I found a door from the street into the passage, on the right, and two doors from the passage into the shop, about three yards apart—the defendant took me into the shop and showed me the gas meter, and where he said the money had been, which was behind a box which was by the wood partition, and which was torn away—he showed me a box, boarded up, round the gas meter, and the case against the gas meter—he said a little over ₤700 had been taken, and he showed me a bag, which was cut right across, and which contained some bank bags, which he alleged the money had been taken out o—I think he said the wooden casing was screwed up after he put the bag in, and that it was wrenched away—I found the wood work round the gas meter broken away—he said six pairs of boots had been taken, which had his mark on them—I examined the front door; it had no marks on it—the second door into the shop from the passage was closed, but not locked; it was simply latched, but without a lock—no injury had been done to it—he said it was never locked—on the other door, as you enter on the right, I found the bolt of the box lock had been torn inwards towards the shop, the door opening outwards into the passage—the only marks I saw on it would be, in my judgment, caused by pressure from inside, which bent the bolt and forced it outwards, but no instrument had been used—there were scratches on the woodwork from the lock, which was bent round.</p>

                  </hi>. I was station-sergeant at Gray's Inn Road Station on July 1st—about 11.50 a burglary was reported at the station as having occurred at 38, Leather Lane—at 12.30 on July 2nd I visited the pre<lb/>mises—the defendant said that he had placed ₤700 in money in Bank of England paper bags, which he put into a handbag, and put that in a box as a safeguard with the gas-meter, and that he screwed the lid down—he said it was all right when he went out just before six that evening, and that on his return, about 11.25, the street-door was open, which opens into the passage, from which there are two doors, into the shop; that the first door had been broken open from the passage, and that the second had been left unlocked; that the wood at the top of the box round the gas meter had been forced up—a handbag was on the counter,. with a piece cut out of it, and some empty paper bags in it—I said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190106240061"/>
               <p>something to the effect of "Don't you think it rather unwise to keep money in a place of that description, which is rather weak, in the shop?"—he said, "Oh, no, I think money in my own keeping is better than in the bank, sometimes"—I examined the premises—the street-door was all right—on the first door in the passage the bolt of the lock was bent in towards the shop, showing that the door had been forced from inside the shop, because it would be impossible for the bolt to be bent as it was if forced from the passage—the grazing of the bolt of the lock had caused a mark on the woodwork—I told him if that door had been forced it had not been forced in the way he suggested, and asked what was the necessityof forcing the door if the other door was unlocked—he said, "Then they must have got in 'at' or 'through' the skylight at the back"—I went and looked at the skylight from the top of an ante<lb/>room—the skylight was intact and fastened—there were no marks on it—it was 12ft. to 14ft. from the ground—then he said they must have got in along the front window at the top of the house, along the guttering, and have come down by the staircase—I went to that part—there was one window open—there was no dust or cobwebs disturbed, or sign of any<lb/>one having entered—I said so, and shortly afterwards left—I am positive I made a thorough examination of the premises, being the first officer called there; and, as far as I could see, there bad been no attempt to enter, judging from my experience.</p>

               <p>she handed me this bill for ₤245; she said it was given her by her brother in payment for some furniture he had bought from her—she said she wanted a loan of ₤50, and that the bill was accepted by Frederick Lau<lb/>rence—we took her bill for ₤60, and gave her a cheque for ₤54 19s. 3d., which was afterwards paid—on April 15th I received this letter from her—(<hi rend="italic">Saying that she required another ₤30, and if she could have it on the same terms she would be quite satisfied.</hi>)—on the same security we advanced her another ₤30 by cheque, which was paid—on April 17th we received a letter card from her, which was a receipt for the ₤33—<hi rend="italic">This also requested another ₤10 for her, so as to settle some business matters.</hi> )—we took her bill for ₤11, and sent her a cheque for ₤10, which was paid—I cannot say from memory when her bills became due, but when they did, our bankers presented them for payment—they were returned marked "No account"—they were presented at Hammond's Bank, Canterbury—we became suspicious, and I went to Maids tone, and saw Mr. Frederick Laurence—he said the bill was not issued by him—we then caused these proceedings to be taken—we subsequently found that Mr. Laurence's acceptance of January 24th was a forgery.</p>

                  </hi>,M.R.C.S.Lond., and L.R.C.P. I have had considerable experience in dealing with persons who are insane—in 1890 I was one of the Medical Officers at St. Luke's Hospital, and since 1892 I have been Medical Superintendent at Halliford House Asylum, at Sunbury-on-Thames—from the books I find that the prisoner was admitted there in June, 1879, under a certificate signed by Drs. Meredith and Monckton—she remained there a short time, and was then discharged</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190106240063"/>
               <p>—that was before my time—on December 2nd, 1890, she was again admitted, on an emergency order by Dr. Savage—she remained there till March 1st, 1892, when she left to go under the charge of a Mrs. Rogers, who had been a matron at Halliford House, under what is known as "single care," but still under certificates—I saw her frequently, and finding she was getting bad again, on my advice she was again taken to Halliford House on July 5th, 1894—she was discharged on certificates on January 29th, 1896—I considered her case as one which could never recover; she would get better for a time, and then have a fresh outbreak; her better moments were never permanent—she has a complete absence of moral sense on financial matters—while at Halliford House she forged the matron's name for a small amount, although she had a considerable amount of money in her possession, and she committed some small thefts—she was morbidly suspicious, and she slept badly and had hallucinations—she thought she heard voices of people threatening her family, and especially her children—it is a very common delusion to hear voices.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She was discharged in 1896, but not as recovered—she was discharged by her friends—the discharge of patients has nothing to do with the doctor under whose care she is; she ought to have continued under supervision—she always showed a great deal of cunning.</p>

I practise at 3, Henrietta Street—I have had 30 years' experience in dealing with insane people—I have known the prisoner's history since 1890—I saw her then, and formed the opinion that she was suffering from chronic delusional insanity, with ideas that there were people wishing to injure one of her children, and that the only way to save it was to get money by any means to keep off the prosecu<lb/>tions—I saw her at Halliford House in May, 1891—I was then of opinion that she was still of unsound mind—she then believed that she had ₤8,000, and could spend what she liked—she had no idea that she had forged signatures—she was not responsible for her actions—I saw her again in February, 1892—she was improved, but still insane—I formed the opinion that she would never recover—in March, 1893, I saw her again—she was still insane; I thought then she would be better in a private asylum than in lodgings—I saw her on June 18th last at Hollo<lb/>way—I think she is of unsound mind—she has delusions that people are going to ruin her eldest son—she said that detectives followed her wher<lb/>ever she went, and that she was haunted by people night and day, and that she wanted to commit suicide to save trouble to her son Lance—hearing voices in the street is a very common delusion—I believe she is perfectly sincere, and believes what she says—the condition of things which I found lately is quite consistent with what I observed 10 years ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I am not the man who was riding with the pri<lb/>soner—I know the horse the prisoner was riding; it was given to bolting, and last March I was ordered by Lieut. Hunter, who it belongs to, to ride it and stop it—I did so, and broke it a bit, but it is liable to bolt now—I was ordered to try and stop the habit, because I am the rough rider of the battery—as soon as it gets on any grass it wants to go, and if you have not got it well in hand, it will go—the horse has a hard mouth, and takes a lot of stopping without plenty of room—I know the prisoner to be a good rider, and a sober man; I have known him for 12 months, and never knew him to be the worse for drink.</p>

I am adjutant of the prisoner's depot—I know this horse; it is a Government horse, which was told off for me to ride—the prisoner was told off to look after it—I was away two or three days, and I gave him orders to exercise it—the horse is hard in the mouth—when it gets on to grass it is in the habit of galloping off, and when once it gets away it is very difficult to stop—I am much</p>

               <p>stronger and heavier than the prisoner, and he has only just been in-valided home from South Africa with enteric fever, and I can quite believe the horse would get too much for him—he has reported twice that it has got away with him, and once it got away with me, and I could not stop it—it is almost impossible to stop it in anything like a short distance—at the place where the accident occurred there is rather a steep slope, and a horse would cover 100 yards in something like 15 or 16 seconds—the prisoner has been my groom for 10 months, and he has always conducted himself in a satisfactory manner—I have never known him to be addicted to drink—he has been four years in the Army, and he has never had an entry in the defaulter sheet, which is a very rare thing, as every little thing against a man is put down.</p>

On May 29th, about 10 minutes or a quarter past 12, I was on duty near Lower Marsh, and not far from Lancelot Street, and met Finch, whom I have known about 18 months, running towards me from the direction of Lancelot Street, 20 or 30 yards from it—I went on to Lancelot Street, and found Cox just regaining his feet, and in a very dazed condition—I assisted him to the station—he was without his helmet, staff, and whistle—no one was by him when I found him, but there were several people in the vicinity.</p>

I am a butcher, of 109, Lower Marsh, Lambeth—on May 29th, some time after midnight, I was looking out at my window, hearing a noise, and saw a female and a man who rolled up against my shutters; two more men came across the road, and had an altercation with the man and woman, and then four more came—I saw Tynan among them</p>

               <p>—a constable came up, and asked them in a quiet way to go away, and Tynan said, "Kick his—out," and went up to the constable—I could not see whether he kicked him, but they closed together and fell, and as soon as they were down all the other men started on the constable, who cried for help—I ran out without any boots into Westminster Bridge Road, and fetched a policeman—I believe that was Barnes, but I was exhausted when I got there.</p>

I am barmaid at the Noah's Ark, Blackfriars Road and Charles Street—on Whit-Monday, about 10 p.m., the prisoner came through the Charles Street door and called for some mild and bitter—he put this half-crown on the counter—he was sober—I gave it to the governor, Mr. Dean, in the saloon to examine—the prisoner could not see us from where he was—after two or three minutes Mr. Dean went for a constable—when going back to the prisoner I saw him walking out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, at 109, Southwark Park Road—Parslow was brought to my branch surgery in Rotherhithe New Road, suffering from a contused wound about 1 1/2 in. long and 1/4 in. deep on his forehead, over his right eye, caused by a blunt instrument, used with great violence—in my opinion, the piece of iron produced would have caused it—it could not have been caused by a blow with the fist—it was a dangerous wound, and might have killed him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 16 years old, and live at 6, Iron Yard, Rotherhithe—on May 17th, in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my father's arch and picked up the iron bar produced, and put it down his right-hand trousers pocket—I said, "What are you going to do with it?"—he said, "What is it to do with you?"—he went out, and walked up to the prosecutor and struck him on the forehead with it, and ran away.</p>
