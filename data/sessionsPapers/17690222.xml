On the 6th of February, just about six in the evening, I was informed the prisoner was at Mr. Bullock's window, attempting to cut a pane of glass with a diamond. He had been at our window several times trying to cut it. I went out at our back door, and crossed the way to him. I laid hold of his collar, and saw he had the end of a piece of handkerchiefs, and had got it out at a hole through the glass, about five inches. A person that lives with the prosecutor came out, and we took the prisoner into the house. We found the diamond afterwards upon a boy that was with him.</p>

The bell being broke, I was obliged to go up stairs to call my servant to look for it. I returned in about two minutes. My servant said there was no such handkerchief. I said to the prisoner, You have come a great many times for goods which I never found. Then she went out immediately. As soon as she was gone I missed a linen gown, which I had taken in that day, from under the counter: We always put the goods of the present day there. I went out to see for her, but she was got out of sight. I sent a person out to see for her, and she was brought back in about a quarter of an hour. I took her before my Lord Mayor, there she utterly denied it. She was committed to the Compter, till I could get an opportunity to see about among the pawnbrokers for the gown. I found it by inquiring at Mr. Berry's, a pawnbroker in Barbican. I have known the prisoner two or three years, by using my shop.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. I cannot be exact to the time. I think it was about ten o'clock. This is the same gown. I have had it, I believe, ten or a dozen times before, and know it well.

I walked round the house, and looked about the garden; then locked the doors and made all fast, and went to bed between nine and ten. I heard a good deal of noise between twelve and one in the next room. I got up and looked about the house softly, and as there are a good many cats in the house, I thought it might be them. Then I went to bed again.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a noise was it you heard?</p>
               <p>Flannagen. It was as if something was rustling against the window. As soon as I laid down in my bed I heard the window in the next room fall in. Then I got up again, and went into the room, and saw the prisoner standing in the middle of the room packing up several things. Taking the dressing glass from the table, he came and struck me with his fist, and made no attempt to get off, but then fought me with an iron that he had in his hand. The moon shone bright into the room. I fought him till I mastered him. I saw a ladder standing up against the window; I took and drawed that up into the room. I took him down stairs, and sat over him with a gun till seven o'clock; then I brought him to a constable: he confessed he brought the ladder out of Mr. Bristow's yard, which is not above an hundred yards from the window. (It was Mr. Bristow's ladder.) The bar of the window was bent so that it was forced out of its place. It was a sash window with the shutters on the inside; the shutter was shoved on one side, and the glass broke. He had throwed two japan dressing boxes out of the window before I came into the room, which were found in the morning, some distance from the window: he confessed he throwed them out. We found a knife and a great long iron scure in his pocket. I know that window was whole, and the shutter fastened over night.</p>

Flanagan had a gun on his shoulder, and had hold of the prisoner. I went into the room, and saw the window was broken. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220004"/> looked out and saw the two dressing boxes lying at some distance.

               <p>I was very much in liquor. I wanted to get to a place to lie down, and seeing a ladder stand against a window, I got up upon it, and fell down into the house. I had no intent to rob the house. I had nothing to do it with. When I was in the house, the man came and struck me with an iron bar, and knocked me down: I got up again, he knocked me down again, and after that he knocked me down a third time. I had fourteen cuts on my head.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Robinson. Yes. He had worked at our brew-house about three years ago. We got a search-warrant the next morning and searched his lodging, which was but about two hundred yards from the brewhouse. There we found the remainder of my clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you think he got to your window?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I found a ladder upon a parapet wall, which was taken from the new building. The ladder stood about five or six yards from the window, from the ladder he might get to a leaden gutter which joins my window.</p>

               <p>I put my wife in the hospital some days before this happened. I had no fire at home, and no place to get my victuals. I went to a public house; there were two men drinking: one of them I had seen before, but not the other. I drank share of a pot or two of bear along with them. They went away and bid me good night. I had a pennyworth of purl after that; they came again, in about three quarters of an hour, and brought two bundles of clothes. They asked me if I had any place where they could leave their bundles till the morrow; I said I had. I carried them up stairs, and put them into my room. On the morrow one of the men came, and tied up one of the suits of clothes in two handkerchiefs. I thought I would go and carry my wife a little wine. The man asked me if I would take the suit of clothes and pawn them for him; I told him I was too weak, I was not able to carry them. I had laid in bed four days before that, Mrs. M'Cardell knows.</p>
               <p>M'Cardell. He had been very ill; it was the goal distemper; he had been in Newgate. He kept his bed a day or two; I cannot say positively how long.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out on the 11th of January?</p>
               <p>M'Cardell. He did, and came home with a parcel at night between nine and ten. He was very dirty and very fatigued, and said he was very tired.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come with him?</p>
               <p>E. M'Cardell. No. I did not see him till he came down to light his candle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The two men came with me to the door with the clothes, one of them went with me to the pawnbroker's, and bid me go in and pawn them for 30 s. I went in, and asked 30 s. upon them, and they stop me. I do not know where they had the clothes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The shirts had been thrown out of the window; they were all dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think one man could break the window, and do it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I think one man might, the weight of the things are not so heavy, but one man might carry them with ease.</p>

I told Mr. Green immediately, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220006"/> knew that indico, and that I had sold it at the beginning of the week to Mr. Curvan. It is a most particular kind of indico. At that time I did not know the indico had been lost. I told him I suspected it to have been stolen, and bid him take care what he was about. He desired me not to take notice to any body what he was going to tell me (but perhaps that is immaterial to the matter). I went with Mr. Curvan to Mrs. Jones's, and there saw the indico, and knew it to be the same I sold him. There were about 108 lb. weight of it. I question whether there is any such in London besides. I sold it to Mr. Curvan for 6 s. a pound. ( Some of the indico produced-in court.) There are very few casks of indico come into the kingdom, but what I see.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively this was the same indico you bought for Mr. Curvan?</p>
               <p>Scofield. I do. I have it now in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. How is indico manufactured?</p>
               <p>Scofield. It is made of a weed; by fermenting it with lime they bring it into a stone.</p>

            . Mr. Scofield sent some indico to me for Mr. Curvan; I have seen the remainder in the cask, and that found in the Borough, which certainly is the same. I had it from Lime-street. I was shewed a great quantity of indico, but there was no other like this one cask, which was the occasion I did not chuse to have it myself. I swear positively this is of the same indico. I never saw such indico in England before.</p>

            . I am a seafaring man, and live at Wapping. On the 1st of February, about two in the afternoon, two young men came to me; one was named Hunter; they brought some indico; one of them took two or three pieces out of his pocket, and asked me if I knew what it was. I said I did not know. He said it was indico, and that it was very dear. He told me he wanted to sell it, and he would satisfy any body for their trouble, if they would get any body to buy it. I went to Mr. Lockhart's house, but he was not at home; he came to me between five and six the same day to the house of Mr. Gordon, the Watermens Arms and Black Boy. He asked what I wanted with him. I shewed him a piece of indico.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Sharp. I cannot tell. I have known him to buy coffee of a captain and other things. He said he had bought as good for fifteen or sixteen pence a pound, and if I could buy it for eighteen, he would give me two shillings a pound for it. He asked me if I knew the man that brought it; I said I did not, but I heard he was a mate of a ship; then he said there was no danger, if the man had that appearance, in buying it; he said, Buy it by all means. I told him I had no money; he said, he would help me to money. After that Hunter and the other man came to me at Gordon's house; the man delivered 23 lb. of indico to me, and I told him I could get him 18 d. a pound for it. They carried it themselves to Lockhart's door, and I carried it in; they told me they must have the money, but Mr. Lockhart was not at home; I inquired where he was, and went to him, and he gave me two guineas, and I delivered it to them; he said, if that would not do, he would change a 10 l. note. This was about seven at night, and at nine, or a little after, the said two men and Baynam came to my house, and brought a bag; Baynam brought it; there were 82 lb. of it; they laid it down and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Baynam before?</p>
               <p>Sharp. I did, he is a <rs id="t17690222-5-deflabel30" type="occupation">waterman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t17690222-5-defend71 t17690222-5-deflabel30"/>. I sold that to Lockhart, and carried three guineas to the other two men, and gave it them. I did not pay a farthing to Baynam. I saw Baynam and one of the other men, on the second, being Thursday morning, about eight o'clock: the other man asked me for the remainder of the money. My wife went and borrowed two half guineas, and I had 2 s. of my own, which I gave to Baynam. In all, they had four guineas for that parcel.</p>
               <p>Wm Strange. I am the keeper of the House of correction in the Borough. On the 8th of February Baynam was brought in, and Sharp was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220007"/> brought in the day before; at that time Sharp was charged as a principal in the robbery. I said to Baynam, Sharp has been charging you with stealing this indico, do you know any thing of the matter? it is on his account you are taken up. Baynam said he was a poor fellow, a waterman, he was employed to carry them from the Middlesex side to the Surry side. The lighter lay on the Surry side, near Rotherhithe church, as I understood; and they went alongside the lighter, and ordered him to stay; they then put something into his boat in a bag, and he rowed them to the Middlesex side again, and they went on shore with it to Sharp's house.</p>

About the latter end of January the prisoner's landlord, where he lodges, sent me word, he had charcoal, sea-coal, and wood, and on the Sunday he had made a great fire, which had alarmed some of his neighbours; they thought he had been doing something that he should not. I went up into his room, and found some of the remains of the things, some pearl ash, and between two and three pounds in money; upon which I imparted this to some of my men, and ordered him to be set about some work, and take particular notice what silver I gave him. I marked two pieces of silver, and put them into the window, between the bar and the casement, where he sat; he had not been at work from the Wednesday till the Monday following, and the Wednesday after I missed one of the pieces of silver. I told two of my men of it, and we went and found him at the Coach and Horses in Aldersgate-street: I charged him with having robbed me; he denied it: I said, You have some of my property about you; he said he had not. I desired him to let me search him; he consented, and pulled his clothes off in the presence of the people, and I found the piece of silver that I missed in the fob of his breeches. ( Produced and deposed to, by a hole made in it and being bent at one end.) I mistrusted him some time, by his earning so little and spending so much.</p>

I have not been concerned with him above four months; I cannot recollect the particular day. Steed and I went into Ironmonger-row, and seeing no light in the room in the prosecutor's house, I opened a little gate which went to the house, and shoved up the sash and went in; I do not know whether it was a parlour or not; I took out these things and gave them to Stead, and he put them into a bag, and we went away with them. I was taken up in a public house by Mr. Wood, who told me he had had a great deal of trouble after me. When I was before the alderman, I was asked about a robbery: I said I knew nothing of that; but I made information of several robberies that I had been engaged in, and particularly this.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was this bag?</p>
               <p>Biggs. I bought three yards of black cloth; two of them went to the making the bag; it was yard wide.</p>
               <p>Wood. I took this bag out of Stead's pocket. (Producing a black bag.)</p>
               <p>Biggs. This is the same bag. I took a watch-stand out of the room, but, it being of no use, I threw that away, about an hundred yards from the prosecutor's house; and we carried the rest of the things to Smithson's house, who was at home when we came there. I turned them out of the bag in order to see what we had got. I asked Smithson to go and pawn the silk gown; he went; and came and told me he had pawned it for 14 s. which he gave in; but since I find he pawned it for 16 s.</p>
               <p>Stead's Defence.</p>
               <p>When I heard Biggs was taken up (he and I had laid together two nights ) I sent a young woman, who was daughter to the woman where I lodged, to him; he desired every thing that belonged to him might be carried to Mr. Smithson's, in Shoe-lane: I put the bag in my pocket to carry to Mr. Smithson's, and unfortunately I met with the constable, who took the bag out of my pocket. I live in Golden-lane, and was going up Barbican when he stopped me.</p>
               <p>Biggs. The last night Stead and I were out together, he took the bag, and a tool we had made on purpose to break houses, home to his house.</p>
               <p>Smithson's Defence.</p>
               <p>The evidence broke my door open, and carried the things in; I was out at the time: he lodged in the house, and used to trade with people: he has sold pounds worth of things in the house; and has desired me to pawn things, which I have, and brought him the money.</p>

They asked me to drink; I said I did not value a pot of beer; they went out, but instead of bringing beer they brought six-pennyworth of brandy and water, or some such stuff. While we were drinking it they threw me down backwards on the bed twice, and the third time I perceived they had got my watch from my pocket: I desired them to give it me; they said they had not got it: I told them I was determined to have it, for I had lost it in that room, and I would have it before I went out of the room: one of them struck me several blows on my face, and called me all the names she could think of; after that two men came up into the room to their assistance, threatening me, if I did not get out of the room immediately: I declared I would not quit the place till I had recompence. I staid about half an hour, and then the watch came; I called the watch, who took the prisoners into custody.</p>

I said into Bishopsgate-street; he said, if you will be so good as to lend me a hand with this box, I'll give you a shilling. I took the shilling and came with it; he walked with me, sometimes before and sometimes behind me. When they came to take hold of me, I looked round to see the person that gave me the box, and he was gone. I am innocent of the fact.

            . We lost oak I believe to the value of 4 or 5 l. and several fir-planks, inch thick. It was put in a house and locked up; we had not seen it from the first of October last till the 10th of this instant, February, then we found the door had been broke open; we do not know when it was done; the place was then stripped: we found eight or ten pieces, six of oak and two of deal and one oak plank, which the prisoner had made into a little cart.</p>

               <p>Row. He is a labouring man.</p>

I can take upon me to swear it was the prosecutor's, and the oak the bricklayers had used in scaffolding. He had made it up without planing the wood, for there was the mortar upon them; the cart was standing before his house, and his house joins to the prosecutor's orchard. The prisoner was taken up upon Shrove Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the oak and fir?</p>
               <p>Row. We value the oak at 3 s. and the fir at 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner's cart?</p>

I was going out to get some quart pots, and in going by the prosecutor's passage there came three young men out, they were very near pushing me down. I saw something drop at the door; I suspected they were thieves, and pursued them. I took the prisoner, he was one of them; just as I took him, he pat his hand into the side pocket at his bosom, and dropt something down, which I found to be napkins: I ordered a young man that was coming by to take them up: I saw nothing else in his hand.

            . I took Handlan in the Park; Wall was with me; he was got up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220015"/> into a hollow tree in the Bird-Cage-Walk. I heard the name of Stapleton mentioned, he was up in another tree; I told them, if they did not come down, I would make them; they came down, and I took them to St. Giles's Round-house. Handlan denied it at first when he was charged with it, but when he was brought up again, he said they went in for a halfpennyworth of worsted; that they were very difficult in chusing it; that Stapleton made a sham cough and blowed the candle out, and they took these stockings and ran away with them; that Wall took them and brought them to the door, and there gave them to Waters; then they took them to Mrs. Spencer's in Monmouth-street, and sold them for 2 s. and shared the money, 6 d. a piece.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he get into the house?</p>
               <p>Jones. I believe he got up on the backside of the house: here is a chissel I found with him. (Produced in court.) This chissel exactly fitted to the marks he had made in cutting it off.</p>

His friends are very honest people at Coventry. If the court will consider his youth, and give him his punishment here, I will, at my own expence, see that he shall return down to his friends.</p>

               <p>I was bound to the sea, and had been abroad sixteen months; but the ship was laid up for the winter. I had a letter that my mother was very sick; my master granted me leave to go to see her; when I came to London, she sent me to an old woman, a nurse, at Bloomsbury; as I was going there, I met a man who asked me where I had been; I told him: he said, if you will carry a parcel for me, I will pay you for it, and ordered me to meet him at the Fleet-market; which I did: he bid me follow him: I did; he then went and lifted that parcel on my shoulders, and again bid me follow him: he went out, and as I was going after him, that gentleman laid hold of me. I called to the man, Thomas or John, Why don't you answer! but he made off. Be pleased to ask the porter, whether I did not call in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. to More. Did you hear the prisoner call as he said?</p>
               <p>More. When he found I had laid hold of him, he said (Tom stop, don't go away.) I did see the glimpse of a man, but not to discern what dress he had on; he ran off as fast as he could towards Fleetstreet, down the side of the market.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. We were all by my fire-side below while my drawers were stripped above. I missed the clothes mentioned between five and six in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>M. Malens. I saw them at about half an hour after three o'clock that day.</p>

               <p>I am the person that pawned the things to be sure. Mrs. Keys, that lives in Northumberland-court, brought them to me one morning, and desired I would go and pawn them for her. (I did not live with her, but I was acquainted with her). I asked her, if I was to pawn them in her name, or mine; she desired me not to pawn them in her name, because the pawnbrokers knew her; then I said I would pawn them in mine; I did not mind it. I pawned them in my name, and brought the money to her, and she went to market and bought a fine stock of greens.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Malens. Mrs. Keys was taken up and brought before the sitting alderman at Guildhall, she had sixteen people of credit to give her a good character, and she was discharged; she is now in court.</p>

Then I went to Mr. Howard's, and found that the white sattin and apron were pawned there the day before.</p>

I went there, and there I found he had spent 14 s. besides the expence of the post chaise; they knew him, (that is, the prisoner). I found he took a post-chaise at the King's Arms there, and went to Newbury. I pursued him there. When I came to the George and Pellican there. I heard he was gone for Marlborough; I took a post-chaise, and overtook him about a quarter of a mile before I came to the Black Bear at Hungerford. I drove by his chaise, and when I was about an hundred yards before him, I got out: he, seeing me, spoke to the boy that drove him, that he wanted to speak to me; I took him in custody: he directly confessed that he took the money away; and said he would go back with me. I took him to the Black Bear at Hungerford; there he returned me four guineas in gold, 5 s. and 6 d. in silver, and 4 d. in halfpence, and owned it was the prosecutor's money.</p>

Last Thursday two women came into my shop between six and seven in the evening, and asked to look at some striped lawn; upon which my servant took some out of the counter. In the mean time I heard something like the breaking of the glass; I turned round and saw the prisoner at the window on the outside. I observed his arm move several times by the light of the lamp, which is exactly over the place. I went out and saw his hand upon the piece of handkerchiefs: he had them better than half way out of the window where he had broke the glass. As soon as he saw me, he let them go, and ran away. I called, Stop thief! He ran opposite Fleet-market, cross the way, and ran up Snow hill. I ran after him, and caught him in Cock-lane. I brought him down Snow-hill. There were four or five people endeavoured to take him from me. I called assistance, and brought him back to my shop.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had not compleated the felony, by getting the piece in his possession.</p>

We got a candle and lanthorn, and went cross the road, and there we found a parcel of keys in a bag. We carried them in to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Darwell. I saw one of the keys tried, and it opened one of the prosecutor's trunks better than the right key did.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My trunks were locked. I saw one of the keys that were found open my trunk better than my own would; there were two pair of stockings and a waistcoat taken from out of that trunk.</p>

               <p>When I went to lodge there, I did not know them, nor they me. When he came to take me up, he asked me, if I did not lie at his house such a time. I said yes. I gave that woman orders to call me about ten o'clock. I was up about half an hour after ten. As to being in the closet, I never was there at all. The keys they mention were not mine. I never was possessed of them. When I came down stairs, Mr. Pool was in the bar, and there was some dispute about an overcharge: I thought it too much for my supper and bed to come to 3 s. I disputed it with him. Then he said his wife made the charge, and he could not recollect what it was for. I told him I generally paid 6 d. for a bed. Then he reduced it to 2 s. I had no other clothes on than what I had on my back. I never was out of the house neither backwards nor forwards.</p>

I went to the play with him the 23d of January at Drury-lane house; we sat in the two shilling gallery: he called upon me at my house in Wood-street about three o'clock, and dined at my house, and asked me if I would go to the play. I said, as it was a broken afternoon, I would. We got to the play about half an hour after four, before the doors were opened, and waited there a good while. We continued there all the play, and staid till the entertainment was over. I left him at the door of his lodging about half an hour after ten, and went home. He lodged in Blackman-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any body else in your company?</p>
               <p>Cook. No, there were only he and I.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body give him a purse, or money?</p>

            . I keep the city of Durham, a public-house, in Blackmore-street, Clare-market; the prisoner lodged with me. The 23d of January was a club night; I have a club every Monday night; I did not take notice then, but the next morning I heard he was taken; I do not know where; but on the Monday night he came to my house between ten and eleven o'clock. He was going out again; I said, George where are you going at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220027"/> this time of the night? we shall soon go to bed; the best part of the company are gone. I did not see him come in, but he went out then, returning me for answer he should soon be back; the next day I heard he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he had any curious pieces of money given him?</p>
               <p>Hancock. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to supper, after I left Mr. Hancock's, at the Two Blue Posts in Cockpit-alley, just by. The man that gave me the money is absconded. Sir

               <p>Q. to Townsend. What size man was the man that stopt the chariot?</p>
               <p>Townsend. He appeared to be a thinish sized man, much the size of the prisoner: I could not distinguish whether he wore a wig or his own hair, but it was a darkish curl.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hancock. How long has the prisoner lodged at your house?</p>
               <p>Hancock. He has lodged at my house between three and four months; he is a bell-hanger or white-smith; he did several jobs for me; he hung three bells for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he use to work?</p>
               <p>Hancock. I do not know that he worked any where; he told me he went out to work; he sometimes had an apron on, and looked like a man that went out to work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I worked journeywork. In the early part of my life I worked for my father, and after that, I did bell-hanging for myself: that business being so beneficial, I did not work but three days in a week, which were sufficient to maintain me very well.</p>

I called to my chairman to let me out. I had drawn my sword out of the scabberd, and directed the point towards the glass, and endeavoured to get out: the prisoner then was for retiring.</p>

            . It was very moon-light. I suppose in about a couple of minutes, or not so much, the fore chairman had got hold of him, and he was struggling with him on the ground in the middle of the street; when I got out, I went up to him, and pointed my sword to him, and desired him to surrender, which he soon did: when he was up, I took this pistol from the ground which lay under him. (Producing a pocket pistol.) It was charged with only powder and a bit of cork.</p>
               <p>- Edwards. I was bringing Mr. Wheatham home. We were stopt by the prisoner in New Bond-street. I was behind. He put a pistol through the glass of the chair, and said, Sir, your life or your money. That very minute my master said something, what I cannot tell. My partner laid hold of the prisoner, and by meer strength flung him down in the street. My master called to me to let him out, which I did as soon as I could, and we secured the prisoner. This pistol was found under the prisoner in the struggle.</p>

I turned round, and he went to my master. I saw my master with his sword drawn in the chair; he called to us to open the chair; instead of opening it, I laid hold of the prisoner as soon as I saw him strike his pistol through the glass, and threw him on his back in the middle of the street, and secured him.</p>

               <p>Babington. Very loving indeed, and kissed it a number of times, and said, Let me wipe thy pretty face as I used to do, and cried I thought very much. We going by the Vineyard walk to go to the Justice, I believe she mistook that for a church-yard, she saying, This is the church-yard where the dear father lies ( meaning her husband); if he had lived, this had never happened.</p>

            . I live at the Horse and Groom in Holbourn. I was one of the constables of St. Andrew's parish. On the 15th of January, about ten at night, the prisoner came into the watch-house at the corner of St. Andrew's Church-yard; she was crying and making a great noise. The watchman and beadle said, Here is a charge for you, this woman has drowned her child in the New River, and she is come to deliver herself up. I only asked her one question. I said, Good woman, what have you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220029"/> drowned your child in the New River? She said, If I have, I am come here to suffer for it; and I had rather die than live. I sent her to the Compter directly, the next day I brought her here ( it being sessions time) before an Alderman. I was ordered to go with her to the New River, and search for the child. She went very willingly with me, and shewed me the place. I took her to Sir

            . I live in Mutton-lane. The prisoner is my own sister. This daughter of her's was about a year and a half old, and was at my sister's at Deptford, whose name is Comfor. The prisoner brought the child from that sister's to my room; it was with me Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The prisoner breakfasted and dined with me on the Sunday, and went out with the child in the afternoon; when she came home at night without the child, I asked her where it was; she fell a crying sadly, and said it was in the water; that was all she said to me. There was not a dearer mother born than she was to her baby: she would hardly let it be a minute out of her arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in distress?</p>
               <p>Underwood. She is very low, and could do but little for it. I went up with her to the New River; she said she would go and surrender herself. I bid her a good night. I hardly knew what she said, I was so frightened; and I believe she hardly knew what she did say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I came away from Deptford with the child, and went to this sister's room. It was there from the Thursday till the Sunday evening. A little after three I took my child out to give it an airing. Going along Islington, I stopped to have a pint of beer, as it rained very hard. When I came out at the door the moon shone very fine; and whether the child saw the light of the moon in the river I cannot say, but it gave a spring from my arm into the water, and I ran away directly, being sadly frightened. It is very likely, if they asked me if I had hanged my child, I might have said I have. I was so frightened, I did not know what I said.</p>

On the 17th of September last, a little after one o'clock, the prisoner and another man came into my kitchen booted, and whips in their hands. There were several of my neighbours drinking and they asked most of them how they did by their names: Most of them were housekeepers. There were some steakes on the fire; they asked if they could have such; a butcher that was there said they could; they ordered a pound and a half, he fetched them, and my servant dressed them. They asked how my family did, and said they were sorry my wife was sick. The prisoner said they had some drafts, and desired I would change them. Then they fell into discourse with a cheese-monger; the prisoner and the other man calling themselves cheese and butter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220031"/> factors from Nottingham. They were I believe half an hour in the house before the prisoner offered me this draft again. (Producing one.) I said, Are you sure this Smith is a good man; the prisoner said yes. I took it of him, and carried it up stairs, and brought down 15 guineas, and delivered them to him.</p>

            . That is a very remarkable man; he has a very great dent in his chin. I really thought that some cheesemonger had been paying them a bill. They said they had a great way to go, and it would save them an hour if I would change it. I went on the Wednesday following to Mess. Fullers, and presented the bill for payment; they said it was good for nothing, and hoped I had not paid the money for it. I said indeed I had. I brought it away, and have had it ever since.

            . I am an apothecary, and live at Ratcliffe-cross, about two miles from Mason's wharf. The prisoner offered to sell me some aqua fortis, on the 18th of January, in the morning. He was a stranger to me. I said I could say nothing to it till I saw a sample: he went and brought a sample, and said there were six bottles of it. Upon examining it I said, I could not afford to give above 7 d. a pound. Two porters brought it to my shop, but the prisoner was not with them at that time. He came soon after. I then asked him for the bill of parcels and the tare of the bottles; he said he had not got them: he said the weight of them was about four or five hundred pounds weight, and the value would be 15 l. 2 s. The bottles were not all full; three of them had been recently opened. I told him I could not pay him in less than a fortnight. He desired to have six guineas then. I paid him three, and promised him a draft for the rest, which was 11 l. 19 s. the next morning. The prisoner called twice in the morning, but I was not up; after that a porter called for it, and I gave it to him. I went to breakfast, and then I saw an advertisement of six bottles of aqua fortis being lost out of a boat. I sent to give notice to Coney and Co. that I had such a number of bottles. The prisoner came about ten. I said, Here is a fine piece of work, the bottles are stolen. He said, I have stopped the draft, and returned it. I then asked him for the three guineas, but he denied he had received any. I stopped him before any body came to my house from Coney and Co. then the prisoner said, he was not the man that sold me the goods; and before Sir

               <p>It is a very unlikely thing that I should go to dispose of the bottles, where I have lived twenty years, in the open day, if I had known they had been stolen. A well-dressed man came in at the back door at the Ship-a-Ground, within thirty yards of my own house; he said he was mate of a ship, and had this aqua fortis to dispose of. He took out a bottle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220033"/> from his pocket, and desired me to go over to Mr. Tease and ask him the price of it, and said he would satisfy me. I went to Mr. Tease, and asked him if he bought aqua fortis; he said, I do. He spoke German to his man. I shewed him the sample; he said he would give 7 d. a pound for it. I said I thought it was sold by the gallon. Said I, I will go to the man, and let you know in half an hour whether you shall have it. I went to the gentleman, and said, I believed he could get no more. Then he said, Go over again, and ask if he will give 8 d. I went, but he said he would not give it. I went home; and after that the gentleman sent me word to go over and see the bottles weighed. They weighed four hundred, two quarters, and eighteen pounds. Mr. Tease told me he had no money in the house, but that he would pay in a little time. I told the gentleman. He said he must have five guineas. I went again, and he gave me three guineas in part; which I never put in my pocket, but went and gave it to the gentleman. He got up, and said, Do you stop a bit, and as soon as I come on shore again, I will pay you for your trouble, but he made off, and I saw him no more. I went as soon as I saw the advertisement to Mr. Tease, and returned the note.</p>

            . I am a sugar-refiner at Old Shadwell Stairs. The prisoner brought a sample of aqua fortis to me, saying he had a parcel that must be sold for ready money; and he was to be satisfied for his trouble if he sold it. I said I did not know the value of it. He called some time after, and said he had been offered 7 d. a pound for it by Mr. Tease; and he dined with me that day, and said then he had agreed. I have known him five or six years, and never knew, or heard, any ill laid to his charge.</p>

On the 19th of January, in the morning about nine o'clock, the prisoner came into my house, and asked me what I chose to drink, saying, he was afraid he had got into a hobble. How so? said I. He said, as he came along he went into a public house, and reading some paper, he saw the very same quantity that he had sold advertised; and that it was aqua fortis? I said, What business have you with aqua fortis. He said, it belonged to a ship at Bell Wharf. While we were talking, in came a porter with a piece of paper in his hand; he said to Mr. Starkey, Have you seen him? (They were the very words.) What is that you have in your hand? said Mr. Starkey. It is a bill I got of the Doctor, said the Porter. Mr. Starkey took it and opened it, and gave it me, and said, Here is the thing I was relating to you, and added, What shall I do? I said I knew Mr.

I heard him say something to them, and saw him put down two or three guineas upon the table, but do not know who took them up. They talked about meeting the next day. They seemed to be seafaring men.

On the last day of January, about two o'clock, he and I were in the warehouse at the Three Cranes by the water side, when Mr. Robinson came and gave us instructions what we were to do in the afternoon. I had taken some skins out of that warehouse, and carried them into another; coming in at the door, I heard something snap, and saw the prisoner at the farther part of the warehouse, where were four hundred martins skins. I saw him put something under his coat behind. I came up to him, and said, I believe you have been doing something you should not have done. I put my hand under his coat, and pulled out the martin's skin. (Produced in court.) I said, We have all of us been accused, things have been missing, and I am sorry you should behave in this manner; I will go and tell my master, and desire you would go out of the warehouse; he begged that I would not, and said that he never did such a thing before. I told him I could not nor would not conceal it. I got him out of the warehouse, and thought he would have come along with me, but he did not. I was by when he was before the Alderman; there he said he was never guilty of any such thing before; and he could not say but what I accused him with was right, and hoped they would take it into consideration.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there one skin missing of the number?</p>
               <p>Cowley. They were told over two or three times; there were but 399. This was broke from the string which went through the nose.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he worked for Mr. Robinson?</p>
               <p>Cowley, He had been a servant there almost four years. I never saw him attempt such a thing before.</p>

Certainly, if I intended to steal them, I had better have stolen them when they were loose than when they were strung. I did not intend to steal it. I broke it with my foot, and upon hearing my fellow servant coming I put it under my waistcoat.

My wife got up and went down stairs; she soon seat me word up that my house was broke open, and I was robbed. I got up and came down, and found the door of my cupboard in the bar was broke, the lock also broke, out of which I mist eight table spoons, a pap spoon, a milk pot, a pepper castor, a punch ladle, six silver castors, some table cloths and shirts, a cloth coat, and several things out of the parlour, that are not mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did they get in?</p>
               <p>Vaughan. I found my cellar door broke open. The flap had been forced open, which is in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that secured over night?</p>
               <p>Vaughan. It was. There was a bolt on the inside, which went into the frame, which they were obliged to force before they could get in. Part of the frame was wrenched up. I advertised an odd buckle, scratched W. B. upon it, among other things we had lost. The day after

After Winstanley was committed by Mr. Alderman Crosby, he desired to be admitted an evidence, but the Alderman would not admit him. Coming along, I said, How could you be so cruel to serve me so, so good a master as I have been to you? He said he did do it, but was sorry, and hoped I would be favourable to him. I said, Why did you not speak before? He said he would have spoke, but the Alderman would not let him.

He said, To one Peggy, that lives at one Welch's in St. Giles's, at a little chandler's shop by the dead wall. I said, What did you mean by having that little hatchet in the bar?

He said, Murphy went down into the cellar with him, and was in the house with him. He said, After they had taken the things, they went into the parlour, made a fire, and made some punch. I said, I hope you made it good, Frank? Yes, Sir, said he. Then he said he went into the scullery and got a pair of my shoes, and pulled his old ones and stockings off, and the while he was putting them off, and putting a pair of my shoes and stockings on, Murphy drank all the punch up. He told to several people that he himself was the principal person in acting, but Murphy persuaded him to it, and was with him. Here are his old shoes and stockings which we found in the parlour the next day (Produced in court ).</p>

            . I am a peace officer. On the 9th of this month, at night, I had been round searching my ward. I came home about two or three in the morning; as I was coming home, I thought to go and search the lodging houses, to see if I could find any of these lads; Mr. Vaughan having told me he had been robbed. I found Winstanley in one, I made him dress himself. (I knew him when he lived with Mr. Vaughan. I searched his great coat pocket, there I found a brass candlestick, and also another on his pillow. I said, How came you by these? He said he stole them out of Broad-court, in company with Murphy. I secured him in St. Giles's round-house; then I went to another night house in Drury-lane, and found Murphy in bed. I brought him to the Round-house. The next morning I brought Winstanley to Mr. Vaughan, and he took him before Mr. Alderman Crosby, the sitting alderman. I asked him how he could be so foolish to do such a thing; he said, it was by getting into bad company, that made him do it. I asked him who were the chief persons that put it into his head; he said they were Murphy and Coleby, and that they had been at him some time to go a thieving with them. I asked him how he broke the cellar window open; he said, With an ax. I asked him whether he went into the cellar immediately; he said he did, and Murphy followed him; and he found an old rusty gimlet on the head of an old butt, which he opened the cellar door with, and also the cupboard door in the bar, where the plate and money was. (The gimlet produced by prosecutor, and rusty as described.)</p>

We had occasion to open that warehouse, and then we found a chest that had been broke open, that caused us to search further; when we found several chests that appeared to have been opened.

               <p>Q. Had you any other suspicion of the prisoner but by his being a watchman?</p>
               <p>Holbrook. We had not. On the search-warrant we found a bag in the prisoner's house that had had tea in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you found?</p>
               <p>Holbrook. That was all; he did not come to work again, which looked rather suspicions. The 18th was a Friday, and he did not come the next day to take his wages. I believe he called on me on the Sunday at my house, but I was not at home; and on the Monday morning I was informed he came to the warehouses, but did not stay to be taken on, and from that time he absconded. There were three locks to that warehouse door, but we found the door might be lifted off the hinge at the bottom.</p>

The prisoner had these three table cloths. (Produced in court.)</p>

I saw the prisoner Williams there among them. They were hallooing out Wilkes and Liberty, and throwing stones up at the windows, and breaking the lamps. We went out by turns at the back door to try if we could detect any body; I went out and saw the prisoner go and pick up a stone and throw it. I saw it go over the stone banisters, where it hit I could not see. I went and took hold of him, but he wrenched himself away from me. I catched him again and took him into the Mansion-house. I received a good deal of hurt on getting him in at the gate by other people. There were four of the lamps broke in the front of the house, and several windows that night; some were broke before I took the prisoner. We secured him in the house till the mob was gone, then we took him to the Compter.</p>

               <p>I was a little in liquor, and there were a vast number of people assembled before the Mansion-house. I thought I could not get through without I was busy amongst them, so I catched up a bit of dirt, or some thing, lest I should get some hurt among them. I came out of the Strand, and was going to White Chapel, and could not go on the other side the way. I did not intend to do any damage. I thought it the best way to do as they did to get through.</p>
