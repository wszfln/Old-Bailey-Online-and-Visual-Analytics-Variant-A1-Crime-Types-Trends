            . I advertised them with their marks; we did not miss the chesnut horse first. I found the bay horse, which was particularly advertised, on the 8th; he was taken away we suppose on the 6th at night; I found him at one Mr. Oliver's, at the Bull and Gate in Holborn. By my publishing these hand bills the other was found; the prisoner took these horses to one Mr. Phillips, who was then buying horses, as I am informed, for the French king; by these bills being put into the stable yards, they came and gave me information that they believed that the horse I had advertised was to be shewn to Mr. Philips; I found out the man that rid the horse for the prisoner; I sent my man to Mr. Oliver's; I saw the horse there; I am certain that is the horse that was stolen; I had not seen him for two or three days before he was lost; we recovered the chesnut horse on the Monday following; the 6th of December was Sunday; I sent my man to Mr. Henley, a dealer in horses at Datchet; he sent me word he had got the horse, and that he bought it of Mercier. I had bills brought of horses that were stolen at Colnbrook; the prisoner was coming from Colnbrook to a neighbour of mine who gave information of it.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Emerson; I look after his horses in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them in the field?</p>
               <p>Ingle. I rode the bay horse on Sunday the 6th; by turning another into the field I made a mistake in my number, and did not recollect seeing the bay gelding in the field; I think he was gone on Saturday; I do not recollect seeing him then; I am sure I saw him on Friday. I went into the field on Monday morning the 7th and missed the bay gelding.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of him?</p>
               <p>Ingle. Twenty pounds I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. You understand horses?</p>
               <p>Ingle. A little. I did not miss the chesnut till the Friday morning following.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen them since?</p>
               <p>Ingle. Yes; Mr. Emerson has them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the two horses that are returned to Mr. Emerson, are the two horses that were at grass under his care?</p>
               <p>Ingle. Yes, they are. I found the hedge pulled up on both sides of the gate of the field; I followed him by his feet being without shoes; the bay gelding had only a half shoe. I traced him to the road: I followed him about 40 yards into the road, then I could see no further; the turnpike-man at Kensington Gravel Pits said there was such a one went through about one o'clock, and that a Frenchman rid him.</p>

            . I keep the Green Man at Paddington: I had a good many horses in and out;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170004"/> there were some horses in my yard: about a quarter before four I looked out at the window, and saw the prisoner go by with a horse in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before?</p>
               <p>Linnell. No; he led the horse; it was a bay horse.</p>
               <p>Q. A full tail?</p>
               <p>Linnell. A prerty deal of hair upon it. He told me when he came back he had lost himself, and said he brought the horse from Harrow; he called for a pennyworth of purl and a pennyworth of gin in it; he went to sleep immediately. I went with a candle out to look at the horse seeing it had no saddle upon it; it had a cramped-up white bridle which seemed to have been in somebody's pocket; I took his foot up to see if he had any shoes on; he had none on either foot except a bit of a shoe on one of the fore feet.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this?</p>
               <p>Linnell. Monday morning between three and four; I always get up early on account of the teems; I said, God bless me, where have you been with this horse without shoes; he said there are two or three of us who buy them for the French king, in the country; he said he had been home long before now, but that he had met with two hussies last night who kept him up all night; he said he went about to buy horses; I asked him if he knew Baldock and Dunstable; he said very well; I asked him if he knew Harrow, and whether he came up or down a hill, or saw a river; he said me see no bill; he could not tell me which way he came from Harrow; there is a very steep hill down from Harrow; then I apprehended he had never been there; I knew he had not been at Harrow by that. His horse stood tied at my door; he said he should be glad to have him shoe'd; I sent a boy for the blacksmith; he took the horse over and had him shoe'd; when the horse was shoe'd and brought back again, he gave me a 9 s. piece that wanted about 3 s. of weight; I scrupled taking it; he had money enough to pay me all but a penny, and he had another bad 6 s. 9 d. I said your money is not very good, nor I do not believe you are, I believe you stole that horse; he made no excuse but said me buy them for the French king. I bid my man put the horse in the stable; he was marching away; when he had got five or six pole my man called him back, and told him his horse was in another stable; he came back and took it away; I stopt his gloves for a penny. He came about two, or between two and three in the afternoon, and went to the Brazen-head, which is about ten pole from my house, and sent an old man with a penny for his gloves; I said I would not deliver them to him; then he came himself on this chesnut horse; it is a very good horse indeed, with a swiss tail; he had got another dress on then; he rid to the door with a very great air and called me.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Linnell. In a lightish coloured cloth coat with a red cape; he said, you charge me with stealing a horse, take my good name away; I have seven or eight besides this; me punish you; and seeing him upon that horse I did think I had let my tongue run too fast, but however the Frenchman never came near me any more; he rid back again up Bell-lane; I looked after him and instead of going the way to go through the turnpike; he went over the rails a-cross the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the person?</p>
               <p>Linnell. I am positive he is the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the horses since?</p>
               <p>Linnell. No; but by the bills they appear to be the same horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the bay horse.</p>
               <p>Linnell. It had a black tail and a black mane.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any white about him?</p>
               <p>Linnell. No, a black mane.</p>
               <p>Q. How high?</p>
               <p>Linnell. He might be about fourteen or fifteen hands: a middle sized horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew for a bred horse?</p>
               <p>Linnell. He looked to be a sort of an Arabian.</p>
               <p>Q. to Emerson. How high is he?</p>
               <p>Emerson. About fourteen hands: he is a bred horse, and I believe his fire was a bred horse, but he is a remarkable airy horse; he had quite the shew and action of a foreign horse, remarkably so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said I had a red cape to my coat, I had no such thing.</p>

            . I keep a stable-yard at the Bull and Gate. On Sunday the 6th of December, the prisoner, who I knew by having horses with me the week before, brought a chesnut gelding to my stables; I did not see the horse till next morning.</p>

               <p>Oliver. A chesnut horse the week before, not the horse here but another; he stood at my stables only one night. He came on Sunday at that time, and sold him the next day; that on the 6th was a chesnut. On Monday morning he brought this long tail bay horse in; the chesnut horse was brought without shoes, and he ordered him to be shoe'd; that was one of the horses that was returned to the prosecutor; the bay horse he brought between six and seven in the morning; I saw him come in with the bay horse between nine and ten on Monday morning; I said you have got a fine horse, meaning the chesnut horse; he said yes, but if you did but ride this bay horse you would say he was a very fine horse, much finer than the other; he told me he should have three more, one of which cost fifty guineas; he said they were to come that evening; he staid in our tap room till towards three in the afternoon; he borrowed the same bridle and saddle and let out with the chesnut horse, and left the bay horse there; he said he was going to meet the other three which were coming that evening. I never saw him from that time till the Thursday night following; this was Monday between six and seven in the evening; during his being gone with the chesnut horse, Mr. Emerson came and challenged the bay one; when he came on the Thursday I stopped him, and we had him to Sir

            . The prisoner came to Datchet, near Windsor, on the 8th of December, last year. My father is a dealer in horses; he came about twelve o'clock to our stables to see our horses; he told me he was employed by one Mr. Philips that bought horses for the king of France, who had sent him to see if we had any thing to suit him; I shewed him the horses I had; he said he was going to London; he came again upon Thursday morning; he said all his money was gone; I said I had been in France and was well used, and would lend him half a guinea; he said he was obliged to me, but had a horse to dispose of; he went and ordered the man to bring it out; he said he had been bid seven guineas for it; I should have it for seven guineas and a half; I said I was very cautious how I bought horses for I had had several stolen ones; he said if you dispute give me a guinea in part of payment, and I will bring you the man that I had the receipt of; he said he bought him of a woollen draper at Acton, five months ago. He said he had taken a house and was going to set up; that his profession was a doctor; he was dressed in a light coloured coat and waistcoat, a pair of new buckskin breeches, a pair of boots, a new brown great coat and red collar, and he had very much the appearance of a gentleman; I was going to pay him all the money but he would not take it; he would only have a guinea, but I would have him take two; he gave me a receipt for them in part of payment; he ordered a supper at an alehouse in the town; this was Thursday morning; he was to be there on Friday night. I lent him a horse and went with him to Lingley; he took the coach, got into it, and took the bridle and saddle that came on the chesnut horse with him; he said it was not his own property; I never saw it afterwards Mr. Emerson's man came and enquired for us upon Monday morning, with a letter desiring us to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170006"/> deliver the horse to his man, which we did directly.</p>
               <p>Emerson. That was the same horse I gave an account of. Mr. Earling immediately sent me the horse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>One of my witnesses lives in Bell-yard. I made an acquaintance with an Irishman; he saw me in Ireland; he knew I was a surgeon by trade; he told me he was to go into the country; he told me he would sell me a horse, that he was old and had but one eye; he said he would sell it me cheap; I took him in hopes I could give him the sight of one eye; I tried but could not do it; I had a lodging in that house; the man came to me and said he had an acquaintance, a Frenchman, that bought horses for the king; he said sell him, he will give you something for it; he said he had several others; that next day he would shew me a fine clever horse, the Sunday evening; he desired me to be there between three and four; I was there with a man that was to be here; the horse was without shoes; he said he was just come from grass; he asked me ten guineas for the big horse, the chesnut.</p>
               <p>Emerson. The bay horse was very deep, what we call a blood bay.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This was the chesnut; I gave him seven guineas for the horse; I bought it near Hyde-Park-Corner, the road to go to Acton; he told me if I would go in the morning he would bring me a fine clever horse; I said I would; he said call in a month's time and he would find me twenty horses; he was to have brought me three horses on Wednesday upon the road to Oxford; there was only his servant there; then I went six miles further, and they were at the King's Arms, eleven miles from town on the Oxford-road. I wanted to sell the horse and they directed me to the horse dealer. I went to the Bull and Gate, and they stopt me directly.</p>

               <p>Boucher. I found these things in the prisoner's apartments; he was present at the time; Mr. Pateman was along with me; I was in a room up one pair of stairs; the woman prisoner was with him; as soon as the prosecutor saw him, he said that is the man; I took him by the collar, and immediately Chapman put his hand upon the things. The prosecutor said, O you naughty lad, you have robbed me before, and he confessed it, and said he took them at four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Did you threaten him or promise him favour if he would confess?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, he said if you will forgive me I will go to sea; I said no, he should have what the law would allow him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it should be better for him or worse for him, or any thing of that sort respecting a confession?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No.</p>
               <p>Boucher. He owned he took them between three and four in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Who asked him as to the time?</p>

               <p>Boucher. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the custody of the goods?</p>
               <p>Boucher. They were in the lodgings; they were all in the room: I took this handkerchief from her neck; when the man came in he said it was his handkerchief. An apron was about her feet, it was not tied about her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>Boucher. She said they were the things Fosset gave her; and she said she had them from that bundle; she said she had lived with him two years.</p>

               <p>Q. to Hollis. The saddle you received of the witness Bert is that the saddle you lost?</p>
               <p>Hollis. Yes.</p>
               <p>Bert. The prisoner used my house a month or six weeks before; he said he had found a saddle in Epping-forest, and asked me to buy it; I said yes, if he brought it and came honestly by it; I saw no more of him for a month after. On Monday fortnight I met him; he asked me how I did, and said I never brought the saddle to you, I will bring it in a few days; he came on Tuesday morning and brought it, and I bought it in the public tap-room Mr. Hollis came and owned it, and I gave it him; the prisoner said that was the saddle he spoke of a month or six weeks before.</p>

We lost nothing at that time; I placed a large piece of black gauze against the pane, to prevent the wind coming in; the piece of black gauze stood up against the pane, and near it stood this piece of white silk gauze, containing eighteen yards. About twenty minutes after, I heard the pane break again; the first crack was about three or four inches; as soon as I heard the glass break I went to the window and missed this piece of gauze containing 18 yards; (producing it.) As soon as I missed the gauze I heard the cry of stop thief; and in about a minute Price brought the prisoner into the shop; her arm was cut and the gauze was bloody, and some places cut with dragging it through the pane of glass.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Is this the gauze you put before the pane of glass?</p>
               <p>Throbeck. No; that was a piece of black gauze that lay down by it.</p>

On the 8th of February there was a fire at my house; I lost a leather trunk out of my house containing a brown suit of clothes, a brown velvet waistcoat and a pair of velvet breeches, a pair of stone buckles set in silver and a linen handkerchief. I missed them in the evening; a man told me he had found a trunk in the King's Mews; there was nothing in it; I fetched the trunk the day after; the trunk belonged to the landlord where I lodged; his name is

               <p>Hawsher. Me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you missed the trunk had you seen these things in it?</p>
               <p>Hawsher. The day before I had them on, and put them in on Sunday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of any of the things afterwards?</p>
               <p>Hawsher. Yes; there was a man that brought a coat, and another that stopt the waistcoat and breeches in consequence of my having advertised it.</p>
               <p>Sampson Hodgkin. I bought this suit of clothes of the prisoner on Tuesday the 9th of this month; I met the prisoner in the street; he said he was a gentleman's servant; we went into the Rose in Wimpole-street, Cavendish-square; he offered the clothes to some Jews; they could not agree for them; I asked him to let me look at them; he brought them; I asked him the price of them; he said 36 s. he had another waistcoat and breeches; I asked where the coat of that suit was; he said his master wore it with other clothes; (the clothes produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I am a Frenchman, and am not acquainted with the English law. On Tuesday morning a man came to me in Piccadilly; he had some clothes to sell; he offered them to some people; they could not agree; then he shewed the clothes to me and I bought them; then he shewed me a pair of shoe buckles and asked if I would buy them; he asked half a guinea for them; he said he lived with a gentleman that was gone abroad; I met a Jew; he asked if I would sell the clothes again; I said I would not in the street, so we went into a public house, but we could not agree; a chairman bid me 31 s. 6 d. for them; I told him I could not take it; then I went to another house and shewed them to another Jew; he bid me 15 s. for them; the man collared me and asked if I would take the 15 s. I said I would not; the gentlewoman bid me tie the clothes up, for they did not want to buy them; then the man in black knocked me down and said I had stole the clothes. I am as innocent of it as the child unborn.</p>

            . I live in Mr. De Grey's house: I was the only person in it during his absence. On the 23d of November I went to bed between 11 end 12 at night; I made all the doors and windows fast over night; the next morning I came down a little before six with a candle (it was then dark;) when I came down I found the area door open and this piece of wood ( producing a piece of wood that had been taken out of the door) lying by the door; there were a great many shavens and two chissels; I went into the pantry and there was a chest broke open, and some chissels; (the chissels produced;) these are the chissels. When I came into Mr. De Grey's room there were two portmanteaus opened, and all Mr. De Grey's clothes taken out; I did not know what was taken away; I went into Mrs. De Grey's room and found her things thrown about; they were in good order the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of portmanteaus were they?</p>
               <p>Smart. One was leather the other cloth?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of any wax candle?</p>
               <p>Smart. There was a bit lest in the two pair of stairs room, and a great deal was dropped on the carpet.</p>

            . I am a constable: about the 15th of January Mr. Caleton came to me and desired me to aid him, to go where he was ordered by the magistrate to go; I took my bludgeon in my bosom, and he desired when he saw the person he wanted I would secure him; we went to the prisoner's house; the prisoner himself opened the door; as soon as he opened the door I seized him by the collar, stopt an empty coach that was going by, and put him directly into the coach, in such a manner that I believe the people in the house had not an opportunity of even suspecting where the master was gone; he was carried before the magistrate; the wife was in custody before. As soon as he was brought there a search warrant was made out, and I, and Mr. Bird the silversmith, and one Jones belonging to the office, went to the house; we found a gold enamelled watch at the tester of the bed; Mr. Bird took it down; I took it in my hand to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find besides the watch?</p>
               <p>Barnet. Some silk stockings; I searched further and found this pistol ( producing it) loaded with a ball, which was drawn in the office; and betweed a trunk and a box these tools (producing a parcel of carpenters tools) and a bunch of matches; there were some old clothes put over the tools that nobody could see them; there were several things I cannot enumerate; I carried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170013"/> these things to the office, the loaded pistol, the gold instruments, the silk stockings, and his pocket book with 20 pawnbroker's duplicates; there were other things lost; Mr. De Grey desired the prisoner to tell where they were; he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find without any assistance from him?</p>
               <p>Barnet produces a parcel sealed; he opens it. This watch was the first thing we got in the house; it was then opened and Mr. Bird said by the description of it in the advertisement it was the watch that was lost; the silk stockings were found next.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair?</p>
               <p>Barnet. Four or five I believe: these things Mr. Bird stopt (producing a box of little gold things, the heart, &amp;c.) This watch-case, the buckles and this gold, was found in brown paper at the second search.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he promised he should receive any favour if he made any discovery?</p>
               <p>Barnet. Upon my oath he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the things are there any chisels?</p>
               <p>Barnet. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce them.</p>
               <p>Barnet produces four chisels, a center bit and a saw, the maker's name is erased out, and thirteen other center bits of different sizes. I found in the room three little angurs.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Smart. Did that match with the hole in the door?</p>
               <p>Smart. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of any wax on the chisel?</p>
               <p>Smart. I made a remark on the center bit.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the bolts of the door was that bit taken out?</p>
               <p>Smart. It was the bottom pannel.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they could reach the bolt of the door?</p>
               <p>Smart. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any larger holes made?</p>
               <p>Smart. No, there were no other holes made.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the bolts forced?</p>
               <p>Smart. No; there was one undone, they had fastened the other up again.</p>
               <p>Q. What doors were open?</p>
               <p>Smart. The street door.</p>
               <p>Q. to Barnet. Was the hole big enough for a boy to get in?</p>
               <p>Barnet. Yes; the board is about nine inches across, any man might get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any goods you have not spoke to?</p>
               <p>Barnet. There are some things in the office that Mr. De Grey did not swear to, that will I believe be advertised.</p>
               <p>Mrs. De Grey deposed to most of the things that were produced.</p>

            , an ironmonger in the Strand: I sold five chisels to a person about the be gining of November; I cannot swear to the person; three of them were marked; two were not marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these five chisels, are they what you sold?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any body coming to your house with these things?</p>
               <p>Bird. Yes; these things (producing the bars of a pair of garnet drop ear-rings, the gold enamelled fish, &amp;c.) I bought of the prisoner, with a gold enamelled watch chain, and some other little odd things; a seal, and the setting of another seal I bought at the same time of her; she frequently came to my shop; when she first came I questioned her how she came by these things.</p>

               <p>Calton. They were. He said he bought them of a Jew walking about, but did not know the man.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say respecting the tools?</p>
               <p>Bird. He said being of an ingenious disposition he used to amuse himself by making tea-chests, and other small things at his leisure hours. He was examined a second time, and then he said he had them of one De Croy, a hair-dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had the tools of De Croy?</p>
               <p>Bird. Yes, and the silk stockings and ruffles; upon which De Croy was apprehended. He had them six weeks before that time; this was the 21st of January; De Croy was brought about four or five days afterwards, and the prisoner was sent for from Newgate; when he came he could make out no charge against De Croy, so he was discharged.</p>

I was not acquainted with the law of this country; I did not know that the things were stolen; I bought them of a man in Soho-square; if I had known they were stole I should not have bought them; what my wife went to sell she was ignorant of; she did not know when I bought them; she was quite innocent of every thing, and she is my wife; what she did was by my order. I lived eight years with Lady Pembroke; I was Butler there; I always bore a good character; nobody could alledge any thing against my character.</p>

Into this letter were put two bank notes, and the money as stated in the indictment; it was about 10 o'clock when I came from the dance; I could never get at the letter again, nor I do not know what became of it, except by broken parcels of a letter that were found; I never saw or knew the prisoner till that time. I am positive I never told the prisoner I had any such letter in my pocket at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Poole. I put the notes and the money into this letter, and delivered it to this person, in the presence of Mr. Ryder, for him to carry and deliver it to Mrs. Wellbank.</p>

               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>The Watchman. When the prisoner was brought to the watch-house the charge against him was, that he had taken a letter out of the black's pocket and delivered it to two women, but when he took him up, nothing was said of the letter being delivered to the two women. I thought it but a small charge, the prisoner's having the letter, and there being no desire from the black to any person whatever to pursue the two women there was no enquiry about the women; there was a number of people got together; I never heard of this part of the story of the letter being delivered to the two women before.</p>

On the 23d of January, between six and seven in the evening, I lost 15 wooden crops; they were in two parcels hung up behind the door: my house is a watering house for coachmen; one of the coachmen took them down to look at; I bid him tie them up and hang them up again, which he did; the prisoner was in the house, and had a pennyworth of purl; there was a call for three or four coachmen; they went out; a coachman came in and wanted a stick; my wife called to me to know if I had taken them down; I came to see, and the prisoner was gone.</p>

               <p>We were going to take a walk: Bilby walked with us; Bilby stopped: we walked about a quarter of a mile; we halted: Bilby broke into this house, and came up to us afterwards with these things: we were walking along: we wanted for him till he came up; he had mentioned this that that was the house where he had lived, and he had got in and out many a time, and he could get in easily; we both refused going with him, and begged of him not to go; we did not think he intended to go; he told us afterwards he had broke into this house and got these things out; he carried them to Clapham; we went to Clapham that night.</p>

            . I lived in the Old Bailey a great many years; I have left off business about four years; I live now at Whetstone. Bilby came to live with me about 1761 or 1762, in the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you?</p>
               <p>Bishop. A coach-master; I kept a great number of coaches; he was with me pretty near five years; his character was very good; then he went to a gentleman and lived with him till he died; from thence he went to live with Dr. Wilson.</p>

               <p>Bishop. Yes, I believe so; when he was out of place he came and staid with me seven or eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago?</p>
               <p>Bishop. About a year after he was gone from me; Mr. and Mrs. Parr, with whom I was pretty intimate, asked me his character; I gave him a good character; I said he was an idle boy without looking after, but honest and sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you give him a good character or a bad character; what is his general character?</p>

            . I lodge at a little lodge at Lord Holland's; I know the hides of the cows, are the hides of the cows belonging to Lord Holland; I bought the cows for Lord Holland, and bred the heifer, and they have been under my care ever since. I saw the cows last Sunday night was fortnight when they were turned out in the evening; I missed them at seven o'clock next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when they were sent out in the evening?</p>
               <p>Bampton. A boy drove them down to a rick near the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both in milk?</p>
               <p>Bampton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us the colour of the cows?</p>
               <p>Bampton. The heifer was mostly white, red, and a little mixed with brindle, and the cow was red and white on the back and some white on the belly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other mark?</p>
               <p>Bampton. There was a mark on the right ear of the cow.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it marked?</p>
               <p>Bampton. A quarter of the ear cut out of the underside.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular about the horns?</p>
               <p>Bampton. It had a littlelish horn, white in the middle, and very yellow at the point.</p>
               <p>Q. Any thing particular in the horns of the heifer?</p>
               <p>Bampton. They were not come to their full growth, the dogs on them were not come off, and the splinters on the middle of the horn; it had a fine yellow horn; it was about seven years old.</p>

            . I am gardener to Lord Holland: I missed the cows on the 8th of this month about 12 o'clock; I went to the turnpike about one, and the turnpikeman told me two cows were drove through the turnpike, by two men, but he could give no account of the cows or men. On Tuesday morning, about 10 o'clock, I went into Leadenhall-market and found the skins which I am certain were the skins of the cows; the cow was about six or seven years old, a bright red colour, with a white stripe from the shoulder, all along her back, and some white on the belly; her horns were partly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170027"/> white on the under side, and yellow on the upper part towards the extremities, and turned up a little towards the back; her right ear was cut on the under side; the heifer was of a white colour intermixed very much with red, and some brown spots on different parts, very long hair; her horns were tipped on the extremities; from the extremities towards the head was full of scabs or bristles.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose possession were the skins in?</p>

When I came from carrying the other quarter of beef the prisoner was in the public house; I asked him if I should take the hides up; he told me he did not know till Cotton was there; then I went up to the hall again about my business, and when I came down I took up the hides, in consequence of Cotton's order the day before. I did not see Cotton nor the prisoner again till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you?</p>
               <p>Edwards. Cotton; he came to me to the slaughter-house about three o'clock, and paid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170028"/> me 2 s. 2 d. for carrying the hides and the three-quarters of beef.</p>

               <p>Banting. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see West?</p>
               <p>Banting. On Monday the 8th; we were in bed; we heard a cry of hollow! we did not answer the first time; the next time we asked what they wanted; they said to kill two heifers; they said they had killed two there six weeks before; my husband asked what time they wanted to come; they said in half an hour my husband had a cold, and I myself got up and let them in; there were the prisoner and Cotton, and they had two beasts.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drove in the beasts?</p>
               <p>Banting. The prisoner and Cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the hides?</p>
               <p>Banting. No, not in particular; they were red and white.</p>
               <p>Q. They were killed at your slaughter-house?</p>
               <p>Banting. Yes.</p>

               <p>Banting. Between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when Edwards was sent for?</p>
               <p>Banting. I sent for him to kill some sheep; my husband was at market; when my husband came home he went out with Wansley and Sheriff; I asked him where he was going; he made answer not far; I looked after him and saw him go with two strangers; presently after Edwards came and said, Mrs. Banting, I am afraid the cows were stolen; I said I am afraid so too, and if they come for the other side they shall not have it; he said no, don't set them. About half an hour after, Cotton came with two porters to take the quarter; I called to an officer of the Marshal's Court to aid and assist, for I believed they had stolen the cows; I shut the door and kept them in; the porters said I could not do it without a warrant; I sent my child to fetch a constable but he was not at home, and then to another and he was not at home; I kept them in half an hour; at last they begged me to let them out; the officer of the Marshal's Court said I could not keep them without a warrant; I told him not to let them go but keep them at the public house; they went to the public house and the officer let them go.</p>

Two men called that morning at six o'clock; I asked who was there; one said it is the man who killed two cows here six weeks ago, and wanted to know if they could kill two there then; they said they wanted the slaughter-house opened in half an hour. When I was at breakfast Cotton came to the window and asked me to send them a hand up with one of the beasts; it was lying upon its back; there were only Cotton and the prisoner there.</p>

No; they were talking about the price of beef in the country; and asked me what I thought this cost; I said I did not know; Cotton said in the country they cost eleven pounds, and that they thought them very cheap, that they thought they bought bargains; I said upon my word I cannot buy such a beast as the best of these under nine or ten guineas in Smithfield.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they black stockings?</p>
               <p>Tolley. No, white. I suppose he took an opportunity to put them under his hat; I shewed him a pair of stockings that had a particular mark in them; I looked for them and missed them; I saw his hand go several times to his hat, so I catched hold of his hat and found three pair of silk stockings under it: I kept them in his hat till I sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine them: whose stockings were they?</p>
               <p>Tolley. Mine.</p>

            . On Saturday the 13th I had been to Cavendish-square with a letter; I came into the shop; the young man said I believe there has been two shop lifters here; I want you to look for them: I went to a public house and watched them; they did not take any thing, but came away from the shop; I heard Smith say to Wood it will not do, it is removed; afterwards I went over the way, and laid hold of them, and took this cloth from under Wood's cloak, tied up in her handkerchief.</p>

               <p>I was going up the road: being a cold day I went to have a pennyworth of gin, at the corner; a man came and delivered this, and said will either of you hold this five minutes, while I go a little way; it was laid down; one would not take it and the other would not take it; it lay on the bench; I waited ten minutes; the man never came back, so I took it up, and by this means it was found upon me. I go out to ironing every day.</p>

About six in the evening, on Tuesday the 9th of this month, I was in the parlour adjoining to the shop, nailing some list round the door; I came into the shop and saw the prisoner taking some rings out of the window, and giving them to an accomplice that was stooping down beside him: the shew glass is a part of the window within the walls of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When the shop is shut is it within or without the shutters?</p>
               <p>Skinner. It is within the shutters. I had no time to hesitate; I ran out and caught the prisoner by the collar; there was nobody passing; I dragged him to the other side of the way, in hopes I might meet with somebody in the public house to assist me; I got him to the door; I had him by the collar with one hand; he struck at me, and said, D - n your eyes what do you mean by laying hold of me, and got away; what he had in his hand he threw away after he had got from me; I pursued him through the court; he lost his hat, and there I lost him. I came back and my wife found the ring in the street, in the very place I described he had dropt it in.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get his hand into the shew glass, was the glass broke?</p>
               <p>Skinner. Yes; by whom I am not certain; it was not broke before.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the door did he throw away the ring?</p>
               <p>Skinner. It might be within three yards from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. He said before Sir John he had my hat.</p>
               <p>Skinner. I said so; I have it now; the hat that dropped from his head.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Skinner. I am the wife of the former witness: my husband was lifting the door; he went into the shop; I heard a bustle; I went to the door and saw my husband and the prisoner at the alehouse door; he got away and my husband pursued him and took him. My husband told me the ring was dropt, and I took a candle and found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the ring?</p>
               <p>Skinner. In the street, about a couple of yards from the door. (The ring produced and deposed to).</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Newman. I believe I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not you positive you know him?</p>
               <p>Newman. I am positive within my own breast that he was the man that robbed me on Saturday, the 16th of January, between the hours of seven and eight in the evening. I was going to Hampstead in the Hampstead stage, and just before I came to the halfway house, between seven and eight in the evening, I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any moon?</p>
               <p>Newman. No, but there was what they call the northern lights, which made it very light at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you the only person in the coach?</p>
               <p>Newman. No; there were two more; he was dressed in a great coat and a flouched hat, when he came up to the coach; he swore many reprobate oaths, and said he would blow my brains out, if I did not give him my money; I gave him some silver and halfpence; I cannot tell exactly to what amount; he said he was sure I had something else; he got off his horse and pulled me out of the coach; he unbuttoned my coat and searched me; he turned my pockets inside out; he took a handkerchief out of my coat pocket; he said I had something else, and then he took the watch from me: there was a coach came up, and he made me go into the coach again directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a pistol?</p>
               <p>Newman Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it presented to you or to the others in the coach?</p>
               <p>Newman. To me.</p>
               <p>Q. This must have took up a considerable time?</p>
               <p>Newman. It was a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. How long?</p>
               <p>Newman. I suppose about the space of ten minutes in all.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very certain the prisoner is the person?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170037"/>Newman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him?</p>
               <p>Newman. We went and gave information on the Sunday morning; we were robbed on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken up?</p>
               <p>Newman. On Monday, at a house of ill same, that they call Private Thornton's, under the Piazza, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you by when he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Newman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was past seven o'clock?</p>
               <p>Newman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in the Hampstead stage?</p>
               <p>Newman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you set off from London?</p>
               <p>Newman. I do not know: I am sure it was then between seven and eight, because directly after I went to the Half-way House; it was then near upon eight.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did it want of it?</p>
               <p>Newman. Near ten minutes I think.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked at the clock for the purpose of knowing what was o'clock?</p>
               <p>Newman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is pretty extraordinary you should not know then what it was o'clock?</p>
               <p>Newman. I was frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you so frightened, that after the robbery was over, when you went to look what it was o'clock, tho' you went for the purpose you could not recollect? I suppose you was terrified and so did not take such particular notice as you otherwise would have done: which side of the coach did the man come on that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Newman. Upon the left hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing over his face?</p>
               <p>Newman. He had a crape over his face.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to mention that?</p>
               <p>Court. I understood him he could see his face and his clothes.</p>
               <p>Newman. There was a crape at first; I saw him afterwards; the crape flew up as he pulled me out against him; it was shoved up with his hand all the time till he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might the crape continue so?</p>
               <p>Newman. About two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the crape up when he pulled you out of the coach?</p>
               <p>Newman. No, it was over his face; by pulling me out, I tumbled against him, like; so with that I fancy it rumpled it or something; he took his hand and shoved it up before ever he spoke, and it continued up all the time I was out of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Was the crape put up under his hat?</p>
               <p>Newman. It was shoved up to his forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner's Counsel. Was it shoved up above his forehead?</p>
               <p>Newman. A little above his eyes; I could see some part of his forehead just above his eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he pulled you out of the coach I suppose you could not but be pretty much frightened, as you was so frightened afterwards?</p>
               <p>Newman. I was not so much frightened then as I was afterwards; I was pretty resolute.</p>
               <p>Q. You said there were some northern lights, did you mention that at Sir

            . I live in St. George's, Bloomsbury; I am a coachman; I drove the Hampstead stage; I was going on the 16th of January to Hampstead; a little on this side the Half-way<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170038"/> House, between the Crown and Half-way House, a gentleman a-horseback rode up very violently, clapt his pistol to me, and swore he would blow my brains out, if I did not stop. I stopt immediately; he turned to the coach door the left hand side; as I was going to Hampstead, he said the same to the passengers, and repeated the same to me several times, if I offered to stir or move. After a little space of time, he quitted his horse, and pulled Mr. Newman out. I saw him searching him, but what he took from him, I could not discorn; I heard him demand their watches and money; he expressed the same to the two ladies that were in the coach, that he would blow their brains out, if they did not deliver instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not pull them out?</p>
               <p>Parsons. No, he swore he would go into the coach to them, if they did not deliver instantly. After he had robb'd him, he saw Mr. Newman get into the coach, he bid me drive on; he then went behind the coach and mounted his horse: another coach was coming from Hampstead; I asked him if he would shut the door, or give me leave to do it; he bid me shut it and rode off.</p>
               <p>Q. You continued on the coach-box all the time?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn round to see him?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. His back was towards you then?</p>
               <p>Parsons. No, his face was towards me, but I could not distinguish his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he come to you?</p>
               <p>Parsons. He came from behind the coach, as from London; after he quitted his horse, his face was towards me; when he turned round on horseback, his face was from me; when he pulled Newman out, it was towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not distinguish his features?</p>
               <p>Parsons. No, but his voice was very remarkable?</p>
               <p>Q. What could you distinguish of his face, when he came up?</p>
               <p>Parsons. His hat being stap'd before, he look'd rather swarthy, and appeared to me to have a very long nose.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing else to prevent your seeing his face, but the slap of his hat?</p>
               <p>Parsons. No, not then.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not distinguish his face was swarthy, and he had a long nose, when he was demanding the money from the coach?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes. And I plainly saw while he was demanding the money, and when he pulled Newman out, and threw back his great coat; then I saw three pistols: I was not so near to distinguish his face, when pulling Newman out of the coach but before; this observation I made, when first he came up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. The pistols were in a belt, or something of that kind?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes, as near as I could observe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the man?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I really do believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. By what you saw of his face at first?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes, and more particularly his voice; he came close up to the side of the box.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Very light in the air, and particularly star light; the light faced me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you drive the Hampstead stage constantly?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes, for some years; but have not since this thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you set out from London, at this time?</p>
               <p>Parsons. A little after 7 o'clock, 5 or 6 minutes, or it might be something more, when I set out from the Blue Posts in Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of the horse?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Either a brown, bay or chesnut; rather a dark one, or a brown bay.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dress'd?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Rather in darkish cloaths; I cannot say particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. A great coat on?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Boots on?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes, and seemingly a new saddle and bridle.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a hat?</p>
               <p>Parsons. A plain hat.</p>
               <p>Q. I think your coach has been robb'd since?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I did not drive that.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had some conversation with the coachman since?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I have talked with him, but not about the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never said you believed it to be the same highwayman, that robb'd both coaches?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I don't know that I mentioned it to any body particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170039"/>Parsons. I have heard several people say so; I have heard it spoke of several times.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had no conversation with the other coachman?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Not particularly concerning that.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say so?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Not knowing that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. But you believed it was the same person; you have heard a description of the person that robbed the coach the second time?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you heard them say, that the person that robbed the other coach was very much like Mr. Whichcote?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I heard he swore in that manner, and used much the same language.</p>
               <p>Q. And robbed at the same place?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I heard it was somewhere not far from it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that second robbery?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I do not know; I did not hear of it for some days after.</p>
               <p>Q. It was since this robbery, that the other coach was robbed?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you drive this coach?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave it off upon this occasion?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I drove for a man that was ill; I had been ill before myself; the man came to work again; he took the coach on the Monday following.</p>

            . I am wife of the prosecutor; I was in the coach; I was going up to Hampstead in the coach, between seven and eight, between the Crown and the Half-way House; a gentleman rode up to the coach and bid the coachman stop; the coachman did not hear him directly, upon which he rode close up to the coachman, and then he came to the coach door and demanded his money and watch; at the same time he swore a very great oath and demanded the ladies money and mine, and told us he would otherwise blow our brains out; then Miss Davis gave him her money; he did not take mine (I had it in my hand) nor never asked me for it; he was not satisfied with the money my husband gave him, but said he had got a watch; he swore a great oath and told him he should come out of the coach; he dragged him out and felt in his pockets; I saw him search his pockets: another coach came up, and then he made him get into the coach again. My husband went out at the Half-way House.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish his face?</p>
               <p>Newman. Not till he was rifling his pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. He was close with his face to the coach?</p>
               <p>Newman. Yes; but I sat on the further side of the coach, which prevented me seeing so much; I could see but very little of his face; when he pulled my husband out of the coach I went nearer towards that side, and saw there was something of a black crape up, and that he he had got a very long nose; that was all I could observe; the crape was upon his forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. By merely seeing his nose you could not form a judgment of his person?</p>
               <p>Newman. No; I thought him a small person: but his voice was so remarkable that I thought I should know it again. I was not so near as Miss Davis and my husband.</p>

             did not ask a question of either Mrs. Newman or me, but at Hickes's Hall I swore to his voice, last Tuesday; by seeing him twice after it made the voice very particular.</p>
               <p>Q. But you was in such a fright that you could not remember a feature of his face?</p>
               <p>Davis. His hat was slouched, and I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170040"/> frightened that I did not look at his face, but his stature and voice are the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of him when rifling Mr. Newman's pocket?</p>
               <p>Davis. No farther notice than that he had a large great coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Newman sit forwards or backwards?</p>
               <p>Davis. Forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When he pulled him out of the coach did he go nearer to the coachman or the other way?</p>
               <p>Davis. Rather towards the back part of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as you sat backwards you must see him plainer; then could you judge much of his stature on horseback?</p>
               <p>Davis. I saw him when attacking Mr. Newman, when he was off his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What size man?</p>
               <p>Davis. Much the size, as near as I can guess, as Mr. Whichcote appears to be; but having a great coat on he appeared to be bigger than Mr. Whichcote; his great coat was loose.</p>

               <p>Davis. No, on a visit to one Mr. Norton.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he swore.</p>
               <p>Davis. Very violent; the first word was a violent oath and demanded the money with the pistol in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. In a violent manner?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes.</p>

               <p>Moule. Not till the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the public day for hearing I believe.</p>
               <p>Moule. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Whichcote on the Saturday the day the robbery was committed?</p>
               <p>Moule. Yes, the 16th of January, the Saturday; he came into my house about a quarter after three in the afternoon; he staid till within about five minutes before eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you particular to your time?</p>
               <p>Moule. Yes: I had change for sixteen guineas to carry over to a taylor's shop, for the journeymen taylors working for Mr. Crossier; I carry over change for them; we trust them all the week: on Saturday night I cast up their score and take their money as their master pays them.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Mr. Whichcote dressed?</p>
               <p>Moule. In a brown coat, white buttons, and a silver laced hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any great coat?</p>
               <p>Moule. No, he had neither great coat nor boots; that is the coat he has on now; that is the dress as near as I can see; I am positive it is, and the same hat *.</p>
               <p>* A silver laced hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>Moule. Not when he came in; he called for a pot of beer and a bit of bread and cheese; he had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing when he went away?</p>
               <p>Moule. Yes; about half after seven he asked me for a bit of stick to walk with; he complained he had been walking till he was tired; I had never a bit of stick; there was a young man, his name is

               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Moule. About half after seven or a little better I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out of the house to these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170043"/> taylors did you leave Mr. Whichcote in your house?</p>
               <p>Moule. No; he went out to the door before me; before I went to the shop I shook hands with him, and saw him go down the street; I came back and said I had staid rather too late, the taylors would use me ill for staying so long; there was a young man there that I asked to stay and assist my servant maid if any body wanted beer; my wife was ill a bed; I looked at the clock and it wanted about five minutes of eight.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the common time that they leave off work?</p>
               <p>Moule. Sometimes by seven, sometimes it is eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Of other nights?</p>
               <p>Moule. Sometimes by seven, sometimes half after seven; if they have work to finish they wait till the work is done.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you go over without being sent for at any settled time, or do they send for you?</p>
               <p>Moule. I have no fixed time, sometimes I go a little before eight; half after seven is my general time to go over; if they have business sometimes they work till ten.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is seven the usual hour of leaving off if they are not in a hurry?</p>
               <p>Moule. Yes, thereabouts; I generally go over about half after seven; I should not have staid so late if I had not been detained by the captain; the men were waiting for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the prisoner when you say the Captain?</p>
               <p>Moule. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>Moule. Pretty near five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he used your house?</p>
               <p>Moule. I believe in the course of five years he may have been at my house twenty times.</p>
               <p>Jury. You have not lived there long, have you?</p>
               <p>Moule. Five years last Michaelmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he dine at your house that day?</p>
               <p>Moule. He only eat a piece of bread and cheese when he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. You said when he asked for the stick he said he had been tired of walking, had he been out of your house from half after three till that time?</p>
               <p>Moule. He had never been out farther than to the door very likely, to make water.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him all the time?</p>
               <p>Moule. I was.</p>

               <p>Day. I never saw the gentleman but once before, the last was Saturday night.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him the night the coach was robbed? you know the time do you?</p>
               <p>Day. Yes; I saw him that night at the Blue Bear in Long Acre.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it?</p>
               <p>Day. I did not look at the clock; I have generally done about eight, I cannot ascertain to a quarter of an hour; I remember seeing him with two men: I was then paying my porters; I saw him there with a great stick in his hand (he is shewn the stick;) it was that sort of stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the stick?</p>
               <p>Day. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether it was before eight or after?</p>
               <p>Day. It could not be above ten minutes either way; if any thing, I rather think it was over eight, because I spoke to our people that were in the box with me, that were sitting down and having a tankard of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who left the house first, you or he?</p>
               <p>Day. He. I will tell you the way I came to take notice of him that night: the man of the Blue Bear was gone out; he was fitting along with two young men in another box; Mr. Whichcote was in liquor; after he had drank his pot of beer, as I was talking to our people at the fire, he took me for the landlord; he came up and said, well, landlord, I have no halfpence or money, will you trust me the beer? I said I would; he said I will call again and have something better next time and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. He appeared to be in liquor, did he?</p>
               <p>Day. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he went out after you came in?</p>
               <p>Day. I think about ten minutes, I will not trust my memory as far as that.</p>

            . I live at a house called Private Thornton's under the Piazza's Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Whichcote's coming to your house on the 16th of January?</p>
               <p>Walker. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come in?</p>
               <p>Walker. Between eight and nine o'clock.</p>

               <p>Walker. A Madeira Negus.</p>

               <p>Walker. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how he was dressed?</p>
               <p>Walker. He had neither great coat nor boots on; he had the same clothes he has on now and a silver laced hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a piece of wood he brought in his hand?</p>
               <p>Walker. Yes; that is the piece of wood I believe.</p>
               <p>Jury. There is no occasion I believe to give the Court any more trouble.</p>
               <p>Court. The prosecutor has had no person to confirm him in one circumstance: the coachman never said, a word of a crape over his face, the prosecutor says he had the crape on when he came to the coach all the rest have not said a word of the crape, but it is impossible that evidence can weigh against this.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you directions to search the prisoner's house?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. Yes; on Saturday night the 30th of last month.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find there?</p>
               <p>( Macknabb produces several things.)</p>
               <p>Q. Where is his house?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. At Mill-yard in the parish of Whitechapel; I found the prisoner there too; he was sitting by the fire with a child on his knee.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sage. I am a moneyer at the Tower; I saw these instruments before at Justice Sherwood's.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you call them?</p>
               <p>Sage. I do not know what particular name to call them by.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of them?</p>
               <p>Sage. For edging of money.</p>
               <p>Q. According to your skill are they instruments fit for the purpose of edging of money? do you know any use for these things but that of edging of money?</p>
               <p>Sage. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Macknabb. Where did you find them?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. In the fore garret; I searched the man; he had two good guineas about him and some half crown pieces; all good money as far as I saw; there was a thing to clean dies called a scratch brush to clean it out; here is a 5 s. 3 d. I believe it to be a very bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any edge to it?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that an edge resembling a 5 s. 3 d. coined in the Mint?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with these instruments when you got them there?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. I carried them to Mr. Sherwood's; I produced them there and have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. At what house did you say you went to search?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. No. 3; I cannot take upon me to say whether it is the gentleman's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Because I believe it was taken by the Court that it was his house.</p>
               <p>Macknabb. I cannot say that; I saw him sitting with a child on his knee.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray where did you find these things?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. Up stairs in the fore garret: part of them, the two brass things, and the 5 s. 3 d. he had four half crowns, a crown piece and two guineas, very good money as far as I understood.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these the other things you found there?</p>
               <p>Forrest. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sage. I looked over these things at Justice Sherwood's; I saw nothing there but what the melters use in general, nothing in the coining way at all; there is mould and sand, pearl ashes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170047"/> and mercury, and those kind of things they use in the fluxing of gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to be understood that though you do not use them in coining they are not for the purpose of coining, or that they cannot be used for coining?</p>
               <p>Sage. There is nothing there I should conceive that can be used for coining.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to use the term coining as in contradistinction to melting, and the whole process, or how?</p>
               <p>Sage. This is proper to melt the gold to reduce it in the kind of way to impress it, which is a previous preparation.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. You mean to say there is nothing there particularly adapted for coining more than other melting?</p>
               <p>Sage. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the house with Macknabb?</p>
               <p>Sage. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things locked up particularly?</p>
               <p>Sage. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They were open then?</p>
               <p>Sage. Yes; all laid about.</p>
               <p>Q. Like lumber?</p>
               <p>Sage. When the officer went up into the garret the charcoal was not quite out in one of the furnaces.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. I think you said the prisoner was there at the time?</p>
               <p>Sage. Yes; he was with the officer all about the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say about its being his house?</p>
               <p>Sage. First he said the front part of the house was his; afterwards he said the house was his, only part of it belonged to a lodger that was not at home; there was a bed in the house; we went all over his apartments.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things found in one of his apartments?</p>
               <p>Sage. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any bed in this garret where these things were found?</p>
               <p>Sage. No, no bed at all.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Was there any other thing in the garret besides what is brought here?</p>
               <p>Sage. There was a furnace in the cellar and one in the back garret.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the coals were hardly out in a furnace, where was that?</p>
               <p>Sage. In the garret where these things were taken from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the furnace in the cellar appear to be used lately?</p>
               <p>Sage. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Grove. Above half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first become acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Grove. At the Horse and Leaping Bar, Whitechapel, a public house; I drank with him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live?</p>
               <p>Grove. I never knew where he lived.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. A gentleman here has run this piece of money over the grove produced and it has made a milling on the edge.</p>
               <p>Grove. I was desired to ask him how he sold his shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to ask that question of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Grove. I lived with one Mr. Shurbut; he put the bad money off; I was sent to ask the question by one Harwood, how he sold his shillings; he said the best sort 27 s. for a guinea; I asked him if he could not make two for one; he said he could, but they would be of a worse metal and would not wear so long; I asked him if he would make me forty shillings worth of his shillings; he said he would against the Saturday night following, and he appointed me to meet him at the White Lion, in Red Lion-street; he said he had been very busy and had not quite finished them; that he had about a couple of hours work more to do to them, but if I would come in the morning I should have them, and he appointed nine on Sunday morning; I was to have forty shillings of his shillings, and to give him twenty good shillings for them; I met him on Sunday morning; he called me up into a chamber in the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Grove. About the latter end of September last; there he gave them to me on condition if I put them off I was to pay for them, if not he was to have them again. He produced two half crown pieces, and said he sold them two for one, and two guineas, he said he sold them four for one; he said I might take them with me and try to put them off; I had not had the silver but two or three days before it turned colour.</p>
               <p>Counsel. That was your own fault, he told you the money would not hold if you took beyond the sort of 27 s. for a pound.</p>
               <p>Grove. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the guineas turn out?</p>

               <p>Grove. No; I told one of Justice Sherwood's men I would send a little girl up to look for him, the landlady's daughter; she brought word he was not at home but they would send him; after some time he came; I told him I had an acquaintance out of the country that wanted a little of his goods; I asked him if he had got any whites.</p>
               <p>Q. What do they call whites?</p>
               <p>Grove. Shillings; he said he had not any; but he could make some against the Friday following; I asked him if he had any yellows, that was the gold; he said he had none with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Bellamore hear this conversation?</p>
               <p>Grove. Yes; he said he could make some against the Friday following; I asked him if he had any yellows; he said he had none with him, he would fetch them; he went, and in about three-quarters of an hour he returned; he called us into the parlour, and produced as many yellows as came to two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. How many came to two guineas?</p>
               <p>Grove. At the rate of four for one; he said he would not sell under two guineas worth; I went to Justice Sherwood's; he sent a couple of guineas up; when we came up almost to that place Bellamore came out, and said he had made his escape from him; the reason we sent for the money was Bellamore said he had not so much money about him, but must send to his lodgings for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you talk about the price?</p>
               <p>Bellamore. Yes; I was to have eight guineas for two.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you ask for?</p>
               <p>Bellamore. He brought me two guineas worth. I was to have some five and three-pences; he would not let me have any without I was to have two guineas worth.</p>

               <p>Q. Till he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Jeffs. One Sanders took the house for his brother of Mr. Poole; I had the key left at my house.</p>

               <p>Jeffs. At No. 3, Mill-yard.</p>

               <p>As to this Groves he says he bought things of me; it is something very extraordinary that he should throw them away, why did he not bring them to the Court and bring something against me? as to Bellamore, I never saw him in my life or ever had any connections or dealings with him, nor with Groves any farther than buying a pound of tea or so of his master, and I can bring people into court to prove these things are not mine. I was not an inhabitant of the house but a lodger, and these things were not mine, and I hope I shall satisfy the Court and Jury it is so. Mr. Jeffs knows I am not the proprietor of it, that Mr. Sanders lived in the house and worked in it every day.</p>

               <p>Q. To whom did you let that house?</p>

               <p>Q. Did he occupy the house?</p>
               <p>Poole. I suppose so, I do not know; he always came to my house and paid me the rent regularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go to the house and happen to know who lived in it?</p>
               <p>Poole. I have been to the house several times and have always seen Mr. Sanders except once, then he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. For what time, for the last three quarters of a year?</p>
               <p>Poole. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner there?</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you known Sanders before ever you let this house to him?</p>
               <p>Poole. Not a day before.</p>
               <p>Q. What rent is the house let at?</p>
               <p>Poole. Sixteen pound a year beside the water rent.</p>

               <p>Poole. He told me he was a gun-smith, and he and his brother were to live together in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. That was all the knowledge you had of him?</p>
               <p>Poole. Yes.</p>

               <p>Poole. Yes; if I recollect right I enquired his character and they told me he was an honest man; I believe I spoke to Mr. Jeff.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170050"/>Q. Was it Sanders or Sanderson? because one of your receipts is to Sanders, the other to Sanderson; to which of these two men did you let it?</p>
               <p>Poole. I have an agreement.</p>
               <p>Q. But answer that first.</p>
               <p>Poole. One is a mistake; I can refer to that only by the agreement which I have at home.</p>

               <p>Poole. I may have done it but I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. And whether Sanders or Sanderson lived in the house you do not know?</p>
               <p>Poole. I have seen him in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe so, because there was a partner with him I believe, did he take it for himself or who?</p>
               <p>Poole. For himself and his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the name of his brother?</p>
               <p>Poole. No.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. You say upon your oath that you let it to a Sanders by agreement, and received your rent so late as January last of Sanders?</p>
               <p>Poole. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Poole. In Queen-street, Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you go to this house after you let it?</p>
               <p>Poole. After quarter day I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to collect the rent, or is it brought to you?</p>
               <p>Poole. I went to collect the rent; the first time I went Sanders told me he would call upon me, and came and paid it at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the two last times he came to your house?</p>
               <p>Poole. I went to his house to collect the money; he said it was not suitable to him then, and he called upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. He came to you to pay it afterwards?</p>
               <p>Poole. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose house is it?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Sanders's: it belonged to Mr. Poole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Sanders live there?</p>
               <p>Eversley. He used to come backward and forwards there.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. What is become of him now?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I do not know; I have not seen him this fortnight or three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner at this No. 3. in Mill-yard?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes; I have worked in the same shop with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Sanders use to work with him there?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is he?</p>
               <p>Eversley. He went in the character of a silversmith.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was his shop?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Upon the same floor as ours was.</p>
               <p>Q. What floor is that?</p>
               <p>Eversley. The top floor.</p>
               <p>Q. You worked in the garret?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which garret?</p>
               <p>Eversley. The front garret.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that thing before: I hope it won't frighten you?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who worked in the garret where these things were?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Mr. Sanders.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have been in the back garret, where these things were frequently?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I used to go backwards and forwards often.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Sanders work there?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I never saw him work there before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see it there before?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen it used?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I do not know any use of it; I have had it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had this bit of old brass in your hand too?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I do not know I have; I was going to break it up as a piece of old brass; the prisoner said it belonged to Mr. Sanders.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that to be talked of?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No otherwise than he said it belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after you was about to break it up?</p>
               <p>Eversley. After.</p>
               <p>Q. And that hindered you from breaking it up?</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you see it?</p>
               <p>Eversley. In a basket of old tools in Sanders's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner you called your master?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No; I worked there for the government.</p>
               <p>Q. What for the Mint?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No, in the gun trade.</p>
               <p>Q. These things are not used for the government?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had nothing to do with Sanders's trade?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. No concern with Sanders?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No; he helped me in the gun trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Since you had nothing to do in Sanders's shop, and this tool was found there, how came you to think of taking this tool up and breaking it up or destroying it?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I had no business there.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no business there?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I did not know it was of any use.</p>
               <p>Q. Use or not use what business had you to go into Sanders's shop to take up this thing; this bit of old brass as we will imagine it to be; what business had you to go into his shop and break up this piece of old brass?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I did not know it would be any injury to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he tell you it was?</p>
               <p>Eversley. He did not tell me that it was of any use, only he said it belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you did not want to be informed of that, you knew it was in Sanders's shop; did not you know all that was in the shop was Sanders's, and you had nothing to do with it; it was in Sanders's shop, was it not?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it up imagining it not to be Sanders's?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I did not think it would be of any hurt; I did not think it would be of any great injury.</p>
               <p>Q. You did think it to be Sanders's when you meant to break it up?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Thinking it to be Sanders's, and taking it out of Sanders's shop, you did think to break it up, and why did not you break it up, why because you was told then just as much as you knew before, and neither more or less, that it was Sanders's: now scratch your head and at it again, tell me?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I cannot tell you any more than I did tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood it to be Sanders's and meant to break it up, and afterwards did not break it up because you understood it to be Sanders's?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I brought it in to him and he told me it was Sanders's.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you break it up?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Because he said it was Sanders's.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you find a use for it?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I could tell you a use but it would cost you your neck.</p>
               <p>Eversley. I do not desire to make that use of it.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. You say upon your oath Sanders worked in the back garret, and the prisoner and you in the fore garret, and these things here belonged to Sanders, and you did not work in that garret, and that these and the other things are the property of Sanders who worked as a silver-smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoner and you in full business there?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes; I worked for the office of ordnance seventeen years.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner worked in the fore garret with you?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. What is become of Sanders?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you worked in this house?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Ever since last Michaelmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the occupation of the house when you first came to work there?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Sanders belonged to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there before you came, or did he come with you, or after you?</p>
               <p>Eversley. He was there when I came.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found him and Sanders there both?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to come there, did you lodge there?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you lodge in?</p>
               <p>Eversley. In the back chamber.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170052"/>Q. Under the back garret?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did the prisoner lodge in?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Not in the house at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What other person did lodge in the house?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No body else.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Sanders's brother?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Sanders's brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you any relation of him?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any such person as his brother?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure respecting the piece of brass where you first saw it?</p>
               <p>Eversley. In the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Sanders in the room when you first saw it or not?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What he used to leave his room door open to go in and out when you pleased?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you never saw him work in your life?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I lodge at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you lodge there now?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I go backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I lodge there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lie there last?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your landlord?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Why the prisoner at the bar; he rented two rooms and let me one.</p>

               <p>Veritas Humphreys. I have known the prisoner sixteen or seventeen years: he files brass, works the furniture for guns; we call him a labourer to assist the gun-makers; he has worked with me nine or ten years; he lodged next door to me; I never knew a better man in my life; he has been in my house when he might have robbed me, and I declare I believe him to be as honest a man as ever broke bread; I never heard any other character of him.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. When you say that ever broke bread, do you mean to say any more than this, that he has never wronged you, and you have no reason to doubt his character?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I never heard a tittle against his character.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of where he has worked for the last six months?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. At the top of a place called Mill-yard; I have called there once or twice as I was going by, and have told him I had little jobs, as I could; our business has been very stack since the war; being so I have not employed him much this three months; but I do a little now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this in the town way of milling?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I know no use of this more than the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not for making molds I take it?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I know nothing of the use of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Macknabb brought them in a bag out of the room and put them in the fore room, and asked me what they were used for: I said I did not know, nor were they my property.</p>

               <p>Macknabb. There was a brown paper bag brought out of the room, and some mould in the place; these two brass implements were upon the place where I brought those to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Grove swore in his information and said he threw them away in the country, now he says he threw them away on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I was before the Justice; I heard Groves say, that he had bought I think forty shillings or two guineas for a pound of this man; that he wore them in his pocket, and they were a little white, that he could not get them off and therefore threw them away.</p>

               <p>Potter. I believe them to be the men, but cannot swear to them; they took from me a silver watch and seal; first they spoke to me; they said it is very dirty walking; another said it was very dark, and then they knocked me down; I got up on my feet; they pretended to help me up, and said they hoped I had not hurt myself; then I felt my watch go out of my pocket; they held my hands fast while the little one took my watch out of my pocket; I pursued and took him; one of Justice Welch's people found the watch; that man's name is I think Coxon; he came down to Greenwich to me, where I live; as soon as the men quitted me, I pursued him I thought took my watch; I do not know certainly which took the watch; I think the little one did.</p>

               <p>Q. from the Jury. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Potter. Yes; I went into the Black-horse to treat a person with six-penny-worth of brandy and water; when I went in, the prisoners were in a box drinking a pint of beer; I asked the coachman to drink with me; I had come up from Greenwich in the stage; at the place the Greenwich stage goes from: one of them pushed the pot to the coachman, and asked him to drink, and I think they asked me; we both refused it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in liquor?</p>

               <p>Dalby. I cannot positively swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you before the Justice say you knew the others?</p>

               <p>Henry Green. Sheridine and Harding and I went last Friday night was three weeks, we went into the Black-horse at Charing-cross; we saw the prosecutor stand at the bar changing a guinea: Sheridine called me on one side, and said, d - n his eyes, he has changed a guinea, stop a little, and we'll scamp him; we staid about ten minutes in the house; he went out; we followed him over the way: just by the corner of the Mews, Sheridine and I went up and knocked him down by the dead wall of the Mews.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Harding?</p>
               <p>Green. Close to us behind; we took the watch out of his pocket, and Sheridine and I ran away; Sheridine took it out of his pocket as he was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Who helped him up?</p>
               <p>Green. Harding got hold of one arm, Sheridine hold of the other; they were going to lift him up and some gentlemen's servants came by, and we let him down again; he was not quite up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing to him when they listed him up?</p>
               <p>Green. Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say they hoped he was not hurt?</p>
               <p>Green. I did not hear them say so, they let him go and he fell down upon his backside again.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing was said to him?</p>
               <p>Green. I did not hear any thing said to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Not hear Sheridine say any thing to him?</p>
               <p>Green. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Near enough to hear any thing that passed?</p>
               <p>Green. I did not hear a word pass.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sheridine. He says we knocked him down at the corner of the Mews, the prosecutor said at the corner of Hedge-lane?</p>
               <p>Harding's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming from the Mews: I went to make water at the corner of the Mews; Green went up and said there was a man stone-blind-drunk; he said, Harding come here; I went up; he was quite drunk; they lifted him up; one picked a watch out of his pocket; they said, come along; they ran away and said they had got a watch.</p>
               <p>Sheridine's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Green. Do you know Dalby?</p>
               <p>Green. I never saw him before that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him then?</p>
               <p>Green. At the bottom of the Hay-market.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take notice of him then if you never saw him before?</p>
               <p>Green. Harding spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Harding. They said they would give me something if I would pawn it for them; Green asked me, then I asked Dalby, if he could pawn it for me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Chandler. Who was it pawned the seal to you?</p>
               <p>Chandler. It was Dalby.</p>

               <p>Q. to Dalby. Then you pawned the watch with one man and the seal with another?</p>
               <p>Chandler. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to do that?</p>
               <p>Chandler. I pawned it a fortnight afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You had it in trust from them to pawn?</p>
               <p>Chandler. They gave me the seal for my trouble.</p>

               <p>Q. What watch?</p>
               <p>Cummings. A pinchbeck watch; it was at one Mr. Sanderson's; he kept a public house; he is now dead; the prisoner came to Mr. Dickenson's house, knocked at the door, and asked if the maids wanted any muslins; I went to enquire; they said they did not want any. When I came back she told me she wanted to speak particularly with me, she had something of consequence to say to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I never saw her before. I desired her to go to the tap house and I would come to her presently; I went; she said she could not tell me what she had to say unless I could lay down a sum of money, as much as I could get, and count it before her; I went into the compting house and borrowed a sum of money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you expect from this, to let a person you never saw in your life have your money?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I did not mean to let her have it: I went and borrowed ten guineas, and then I borrowed twenty more; she then said she could not tell me there, that the house was not convenient; we went to another; she said that would not do; then we went to another which was

               <p>Cummings. She took such solemn oaths, and I was foolish enough to believe her, that there was a quantity of plate lodged for some years in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. In what cellar?</p>
               <p>Cummings. The cellar where I live.</p>
               <p>Q. You was to have that plate?</p>
               <p>Cummings. Yes. I was to make it appear I had so much money; that I was worth so much, or else she could not tell me any thing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Court. You never was served so before?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I did not think a man could be imposed on so.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not tell you she put the plate there?</p>
               <p>Cummings. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This was all from her superior knowledge, she passed for a conjurer I suppose?</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do when you found your mistake?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I made myself content, for I thought it was all in vain to look after her.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say about the watch?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I took it out to see what was o'clock; she said it was a pretty watch; I gave it her to look at; I forgot to ask for it again; I never saw it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ask to see it?</p>
               <p>Cummings. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she give it you again?</p>

               <p>Q. When did you miss it?</p>
               <p>Cummings. As soon as I got home; I went directly home from Sanderson's.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you live from Sanderson's?</p>
               <p>Cummings. About 100 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop any where in your way?</p>
               <p>Cummings. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to any body in the street?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I went straight home.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose plate was this to be; did you think it was to rise out of the earth, or come from the heavens?</p>
               <p>Cummings. She said it had been lodged there some years.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you did not lose your watch going home?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I am sure of it.</p>

               <p>Cummings. At present I keep a public house in the Minories, which Mr. Dickenson put me in; she came one morning for a pennyworth of purl and some bread and cheese; I thought at first look that she was the woman that robbed me; at the second look I was positive she was the woman; I then sent for a constable and sent her to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Cummings. About three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure she had this money of your's?</p>
               <p>Cummings. Yes, I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who held the handkerchief while the money was put in it?</p>
               <p>Cummings. She held it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it put in your handkerchief, and then in a handkerchief of her own?</p>
               <p>Cummings. She had one of her own, I do not know what she did with it.</p>
               <p>Q. It took you up a good while looking for your plate I suppose?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I thought it was in vain to look when I found I was taken in so.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. When you took her did she say any thing?</p>
               <p>Cummings. She said she did not know any thing of me, and made a noise and wanted to get out; I bid her sit easy, I would not hurt her; two or three persons in the tap room came to assist me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you was to have all the plate in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Cummings. I was to look for the plate and to have it I suppose if there was any: I was simple enough then to believe it; it was the first time and I imagine it will be the last.</p>

On Wednesday morning I cleaned them, and left them in the kitchen; in about five minutes I returned to the kitchen and missed one of them; I came out directly and the prisoner, Bird, with a pot, was climbing over the table that stands by the back door; there is no passage to the door without getting over the table; he jumped off the table on the outside towards the door; I went directly and got the pot and asked him how he came to have the pot there; he said he never saw it; I went and told my master.</p>

On the 31st of January, about six in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop to ask for a shift, and asked for it 2 s having been pledged, in a name, which upon looking into the books, I found not there; I bid the prisoner at last fetch the person that pledged it, for I had no such a thing in that name; she was in and out two or three times in the whole in about a quarter of an hour; she went away and in about ten minutes after, before any person came into the shop, I missed a cloak, which hung by a string in the reach of one of the little boxes; the prisoner came to me afterwards and asked me if I had been robbed; I said, yes; then she said I had; she said I had been robbed of the jacket, cloak and trowsers; I had not missed them then. She said she could tell me who had stole these things, and mentioned one Garacker; she went out and said she would fetch her, but did not; the woman was brought there by somebody else, and the prisoner was not to be found to make good her charge against her; on the contrary, she charged the prisoner, and by her directions I found the cloak at one Orlington's, and a jacket at one Wynne's.</p>

            . The prisoner brought these goods to my place: I buy and sell all sorts of fowls, birds, and such things; he brought them yesterday fortnight; three geese, five ducks and six fowls; he said his father was a farmer in the country, and sent things up to sell in Newgate-market. I know nothing more of it.</p>

            . I am Mr. Hemmings's servant: I know the geese to be my master's property; they were lost on the 4th of February, in the night; I missed them in the morning; three geese, five ducks, and six fowls; they were in a barn; some of the boards of the barn were broke; I have seen the fowls at Granger's on Holborn-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them there?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. The 5th of February, the day after they were lost; I could swear to the geese at that time, and the ducks appeared very like them; the geese were marked in the feet; one of the ganders had a knotch in his foot; one of the geese had a piece out of its foot, and another a claw off the toe.</p>

               <p>I went with a drove of sheep; I met a man on the road; he pulled out three geese, five ducks and six fowls, and I bought them of him in the road below Hammersmith-turnpike; I paid him 2 s. 6 d. a-piece for the geese and 3 s. a-piece for the fowls; I do not know the man.</p>

               <p>Webb. Yes. On the 13th of this month I was looking about the goods and saw the prisoner go in where the goods hang to cool in the night; I went to him; he had a sheep off of the hook; I said what are you going to do with this; he threw it down and ran away; I pursued him and took him immediately, in about the space of twelve yards from where I saw him first; I took him to the watch-house; there he fell asleep; I examined his coat, and there was grease upon it of a carcase.</p>

I received my wages, amounting to 29 s. last Saturday was a week; the prisoner was in the house at the time, and having an intention to leave my place, I asked him to go with me to see another place; which he did: he asked me to lend him two-pence to get some bread and cheese; I had no halfpence, so I lent him six-pence; we lay together at my master's house; when I waked the next morning he was putting on his clothes by my side.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put your breeches when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Jones. Under the bolster; he had been under the bed, and in the bed searching for something; he said he had lost his knee buckle; I asked him where he was going so early; he said to the washer-woman for his shirt; when he was gone, I searched my pocket and missed my money. I am sure I had it when I went to bed. I ran down stairs to stop him, but he was gone. I awaked the maids and my master, and told them I had been robbed; a gentleman that was in the house saw him over the water, and had him stopped the same day; he had got a new hat, a new pair of shoes, and a new pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any money about him?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, two or three shillings; I cannot tell whether that was any part of my money; I found in my pocket in the morning a shilling wrapped up in a piece of paper, instead of a guinea and half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else lodge in the same room besides you and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jones. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door of the room locked?</p>

Gum; they had credit at our house; I delivered the matts to him, and made him a bill of parcels; he came again the 20th and wanted another bundle; I served him with it, and made him a bill of parcels; he came again at night and wanted another bundle; I asked him for the bill of parcels to put them together; he said he had given it to Mr. Chalton, Mess. Gums clerk; he came again the 26th and had six mats; there is ten in a bundle. My father had a suspicion of him, and sent me to Mr. Gum's to enquire if he lived there; he said he did not.
