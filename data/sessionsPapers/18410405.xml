                  </hi>. I am a silversmith and pawnbroker, and live at Nos. 18 and 19, Bolingbroke-row, Walworth; one is a silversmith's, and the other a pawnbroker's shop. On the 3rd of February, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, as I came into the pawnbrokers shop, I found the female prisoner there, and a ring was put into my hand by the shop-man—she asked 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I asked her what it was—she said it was a dia<lb/>mond ring—I said, "Prior to lending you so much on a valuable ring, perhaps you will give me your name and address?"—she gave me, Franklin, No. 18, Walworth-road"—I said, "I will accompany you, and see that it is right"—she then said, "I don't live there, I live at Islington"—I said, "What part of Islington?"—she said, "Vineyard"—and was about to make some addition, but caught the word up, and said, "Goswell<lb/>terrace," (I think, No. 5,) and said, "The ring was given to me by a gen<lb/>tleman who slept with me last night, and said that he lived at No. 18, Walworth-road—I desired my young man to fetch a policeman—she-heard me, and desired me to consider her respectability—while my man was gone for the policeman I had come round the counter and stood near the door, and saw the prisoner Harding walk by the shop and return in almost a second—he passed and repassed, and as he passed tire door I heard a person cough twice—Franklin desired me to let her go, and de<lb/>clared to God she had never been in my shop before, and if I would let her go, and give her the ring, she would never come into it more—when I heard the cough the door was partly open, but chained—I pulled it open, and Harding was looking in at the window of the silversmith's shop—he took no notice of me, but walked gradually on towards the turnpike—I stood some time, and looked after him—there is the Fountain beer-shop, kept by Garrett, five or six doors from my shop, between that and the turnpike—he passed that, and went towards the turnpike—I saw the</p>

               <p>prisoner Frenaby standing at the beer-shop door, looking towards my shop—when Harding passed, he took no notice at all of Frenaby—my young man returned without a policeman, and I and him took Franklin to the station ourselves—as I came out of my own door, Frenaby stood at the beer-shop door, and as we came near it, on our way to the station, he gradually withdrew into the house—he had an opportunity of seeing Franklin with us—we all three passed the beer-shop door, and I saw Fre<lb/>naby standing just against the bar—he took no notice of Franklin—a few doors past the beer-shop I met Harding coming towards us—he passed, holding his head down, without taking any notice whatever—I turned round afterwards, and saw him looking after us, and in a few seconds Frenaby came from the beer-shop door and seemed to join him in conversation—Harding was going in a direction from the station, but they both turned round and followed us, but I did not see them come through the turnpike—the material in this ring is a very good imitation of a diamond—it is set transparent, which lessens the suspicion—it is paste, not a stone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and am in partnership with Mr. Kib<lb/>bear, as manufacturing jewellers, in St. James's-walk, Clerken well. This ring is one of our manufacture, and is what is called an imitation diamond—it was made for a man named Frenaby, on the 26th of January, (<hi rend="italic">refer<lb/>ring to her book</hi>)—I made the entries in this book—it was not the prisoner—I also sold a pin on the same day to the same man, but not this man, at least he does not look the man to me—he was dressed in different ways at different times—I think that is not the face—the person was dressed in a cloak, and twice his face was tied up—on the 22nd of January, I sold three pins to the same man—all the articles which have been produced are our work—we call the stones composition—I do not think I am at liberty to say where I got them from—I appeal to my Lord—it is the secret of out trade, am I to expose it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you make them, or purchase them ready made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have a secret in making them—we have them cut for us—we partly make them, and have them cut in Paris—the secret is here.</p>

I live at No. 13, Goswell-terrace, Goswell road—I know the three prisoners—Frenaby and the female prisoner lived as man and wife, in the second floor front-room of our house—they came on the 28th of November last, and passed as Mr. and Mrs. Frenaby—Harding came about four weeks after—he was brought by the Frenabys to work with Frenaby—Franklin told me that Harding was in a little trouble, in consequence of a bill that was due, which he was not prepared to take up, that they were afraid of having their goods taken, and requested me to allow him to be there in the daytime, and his wife also, and she took a lodging for them to sleep, at No. 5—(he has a wife and five children)—in consequence of that arrangement, Harding, his wife and children, used to be at my house all day, and go home at night to sleep—he worked there as a watchmaker—he bad a board fixed up in Frenaby's room—on Wed<lb/>nesday, the 3rd of February, Franklin went out, in company with Fre<lb/>naby and Harding, about half-past one o'clock, and they did not return all night—next day, about eleven or twelve, Frenaby came home alone—I asked him where Mrs. Frenaby was, he said they were gone out a little way, that he had been with, her all night, he knew where she was, and she would be home presently—she did not come home that day—I asked him about her again on the Saturday morning following—he then said she was with a friend who was confined—I saw some Jews come there a great many times—I knew they were Jews by their appearance and language—Franklin said they were diamond merchants—when she went out, on the 3rd of February, she had on a blue silk bonnet, a black lace veil, and a black silk cloak, which belonged to Mrs. Harding, and several times before that she had done so—her own clothes were very shabby—she had a shawl and shabby bonnet—I have seen both Harding and Frenaby wear that Macintosh cloak.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and lodged at No. 13, Goswell<lb/>terrace, Frenaby and Franklin also lodged there, and Harding was there frequently.

               <p>would allow my little girl to go up stairs, and tell Frenaby that there was a little boy wanted to speak to him about some work—there was no little boy there that I saw—I sent my little girl up, and before she came down again Franklin asked if I would alter a pawnbroker's duplicate for her, from a 6 into a 4—she did not produce it—I objected, on the ground that I could not alter the other ticket, and in case the things ever came out, I should be found out—Frenaby then came down stairs into my parlour, and the moment he came in he asked her what she had got—she said 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she gave it into his hands with the ticket—he put 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with the ticket, into his trowsers' pocket, and said to her, "You shall not be their servant for nothing"—he then went up stairs, and while he was gone, she said there were two Jew merchants up stairs, who she had been to pledge property for, six or seven diamonds—that they had a bill coming due on the following day, and had very little money—I remarked that it was very little money to get on so many diamonds—she said I did not understand it, that they were the manufacturers of the articles, and to them the real value was not more than 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Frenaby came down stairs again, and said they were perfectly satisfied, and had given her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for her trouble.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you asked him whether he knew Frenaby, what said he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said, "No"—his wife came forward, and there was a very distressing scene—he was not entirely dressed—he dressed himself during the time this conversation was taking place between us—we then went into the front room—I asked him where the blue Macin<lb/>tosh cloak was—he asked me, "What cloak?"—I said, "The cloak which you wore when you went to Boyce's to pledge the pin"—(I was endeavouring to ascertain if he was the person; I still, from not knowing him, and from his manner, doubted it)—he said, "I see you know all about it; I am in it; but she"(pointing to his wife)"is as innocent as a babe unborn; she never pledged an article in her life; I did it, but she knows nothing at all about it; I see that b—wretch, Frenaby, has been chattering; I will tell all I know; I will turn Queen's evidence; I only pledged one pin myself; that was at Boyce's, in Theobald's-road; and as I returned them the money, and got the pin back again, they cannot do any thing to me for that"—I said, "There was a female with you at that time"—he said, "Yes, Frenaby's woman was with me, and so was Frenaby, but he did not return back with us"—I said, "There was a fourth person, I under<lb/>stand, with you in the Walworth-road"—he said, "No, there was only three of us; me and Frenaby waited at the beer-shop while his woman went to Knowles's to pledge the ring"—I took his wife to the station, but discharged her, on ascertaining that she was his wife—as I was taking them down, I heard him say to his wife, "If you are asked any questions, tell the whole truth, for we will not be got into trouble through him"—we then had a conversation about the pins—I did not seek for it; on the con<lb/>trary, I repeatedly cautioned him; he thanked me, but said he was deter<lb/>mined to tell the whole of it—he said, the first pin they got was brought to them by two Jews to Frenaby's house; that Franklin went out and pledged it at Sharwood's, in St. John-street, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that afterwards, the Jews brought a second pin to them, which was also purchased; but that Fre<lb/>naby watched the Jews, when they left the house, to Messrs. Kibbear and Evans; he afterwards refused to make any more purchases of the Jews, but went and made his purchases himself of the makers—I asked him, whether Frenaby had not occasionally worn his cloak—he said, "Oh yes, repeatedly; I have repeatedly lent him my cloak, and so has Mary Ann Franklin my wife's; the one she has got on now is her's—he said he had been a jeweller; that he had been brought into it entirely through Fre<lb/>naby; that he was respectably connected, and that Frenaby had been his journeyman—I had seen some duplicates at Frenaby's lodging, and I asked Harding where the duplicates were—he said, he had deposited them with a friend of his, at No. 8, Wynyatt-street—I went there, and found the du<lb/>plicate of the cloak, which I took out, and have produced—I found Fre<lb/>naby at the Pheasant public-house, Gray's Inn-lane, the following morn<lb/>ing, the 12th—I told him what he was charged with—he said nothing.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184104050017"/>
               <p>warrant was granted—I should not have taken him if he had said nothing, without having the landlord up, to see if that was the Mr. Harding—it was perhaps two or three minutes before I was satisfied that he was the man—I asked many questions after I was satisfied he was the party; but that was after he told me his positive determination of turning Queen's evi<lb/>dence; and I repeatedly cautioned him, that he had better reserve what he bad to say till he went before the Magistrate—he said, "No, I mean to tell all I know; I don't mean to conceal any fact before the Magis<lb/>trate"—I did not put several questions to him after cautioning him not to say any thing—a general conversation took place between us on the way to the station, in which he was perfectly communicative; and even without having said any thing for a minute or two, he would break out again, to tell roe some circumstance connected with the transaction—I did not get any thing from him at that time by asking him questions—it was after he had said he would turn Queen's evidence that I asked him if a female was not with him at Boyce's—I put that question to gain information which he was readily disposed to give—my first questions were, to see whether or no I had the right man, not to gain information of the entire offence, and that he was the person who committed it—it was after he said he would tell all he knew, that I asked him about waiting in the beer-shop—I asked him about the cloak previous to being convinced he was the man—I had been in the house more than an hour before he came home, and had seen the landlord—I gained information from him, that a person named Harding lived in the room, but he did not describe him to me—Harding came in, and let himself up stairs, without being seen by me or the land<lb/>lord.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at St. Andrew's-hill. On the 20th of March I was in the Post-office—I had two pins and a chain in my stock—after putting a letter into the Post-office, I missed my pins—these now produced are them, and what I lost—I had them safe immediately before going into the Post-office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and live in Wells-row, Islington. About eleven o'clock, on the evening of the 20th of February, I was in my shop—a person very much resembling the prisoner came in—I believe him to be the same—he asked for a pair of Wellington boots, and agreed to give 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a pair, and offered me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the one now pro<lb/>duced is the note, for I wrote on it the name and address he gave me, "Davis, 22, Holloway-place"—I wrote that from his mouth, as the direc<lb/>tion he gave, and added my initials, "H. H." to it at the same time—I went out to a neighbour to get change; and in consequence of what the neighbour said, I returned to my shop, and told the prisoner I could not get change for the note—I did not say why, and asked if he had a sove<lb/>reign in his pocket—he said he had not, but he had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he gave me—I told him, he had better give me the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and pay the remainder when the boots 'were sent home—he agreed to that, and did so—I returned him his note, and he left the shop—I went with the boots to the direction he gave—the people, I suppose, were all gone to bed—I rang three or four times, but nobody answered—I did not see him again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector of the G division. On the morning of the 29th of March, I was in company with Brannan in Gos<lb/>well-street, and saw the prisoner in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I went up to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the time the other person was paying the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man—the prisoner stepped out—I did not know at the moment that he had any thing, but he drew the bundle out behind him—I then followed him about fifteen or twenty yards in Goswell-street, with Brannan, and suspecting where he was going to, I said to Brannan, "Follow him, and don't lose him"—I then returned, thinking that the other man had got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, but he had escaped—in about three minutes Brannan brought the prisoner to me with a bundle—I asked him what he had there—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Certainly yon have something, what is it?"—he said, "I don't know what is in it, some person gave it to roe to carry"—I took him to the station—I know the other man, and am in hopes I shall find him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Tower-lane, Smithfield. I was returning home on the 2nd of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—I met Bowler at the bottom of Holborn—I went with her to a house in Field-lane—after I had been there a short time she left the room, and came up again with two men—she came and hustled round me—I was then sitting in a chair—she put her hand in my right-band pocket, and took out a half-sovereign, three half-crowns, and four shillings—I was not perfectly sober, or I should not have gone there, but I knew what I was doing—I can identify Fuller as one of the men—I am sure he was one—he had a stick when he came in—when Bowler took the money from my pocket she handed it into his hand—I heard it link, and he said to me, "What the b—y hell business have you with my wife, if you are not off, I will break your b—y neck down stairs"—I made my escape as soon a I could—I ran a little way up Snow-hill and met the policeman—he went back with me—we found Bowler in the house, but the man was gone—I am certain this money was in my pocket, and she took it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the publisher of the "Derbyshire Courier," and a printer and bookseller, living at Chesterfield. The prisoner came into my service at the latter end of September, 1839—I gave him four weeks' notice to quit on the 6th of February—he was to leave on the 6th of March—on the 22nd of February I paid him his wages to the following Saturday—on the 24th of February he did not come to his employ in the morning as usual, and on inquiring at his lodging I found he had gone away—I have seen him write, and on the 26th I received this letter in his handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—" Sir,—By the time you get this I shall have ter<lb/>minated an existence, begun and continued in sorrow; no efforts will find any trace of me. Your account I have sent to my brother, as well as several others; he will discharge them in a short time.—J. G. P.—Hull."—in consequence of suspicion I set off for London, and got here on the 1st of March—on the 2nd of March I went to Gray's Inn coffee-house, about eight o'clock in the evening, and the prisoner came in with a companion—the officers I had there took the prisoner—I asked him what he had done</p>

The prisoner was my cook—on the 23rd of February, a little after eight o'clock in the evening, I saw her in the kitchen sitting by the fire, com<lb/>plaining of violent pains in her back—I spoke to Mr. Semple, a medical man, who happened to be in the house at the time—I went to the privy, which is in the garden, immediately after speaking to Mr. Semple, and saw some ashes or mould had been recently thrown down on the soil—I had a candle with me, and besides the mould, there were two or three garden-pots, or parts of garden-pots thrown there—I beard no noise—I then came back into the house, and went to the prisoner with Mr. Semple—she was still in the kitchen—Mr. Semple asked her if she was in the family way, or had been so—she denied it—he remarked some appearance of blood on her arm, which she said was occasioned by salting some beef, which I contradicted, as I had salted it myself—she complained of being</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Islington. I was at Miss Lemoyne's house on the night in question, and at her request went down into the kitchen to the prisoner, who was sitting by the fire in a state of very considerable exhaustion—I examined her externally, and found some flabbiness about the abdomen—I saw a good deal of blood on her arms, and suspected she bad delivered herself—I asked whether she had been in the family way, and whether she was married—she said "No"—I said, I suspected she had been delivering herself, and it would be well if she would say, and she had better say so to her mistress, as something might be done, thinking the child might be in the house, but she said, "No"—I afterwards went to the privy, and took the child out—it was a female—I found it lying partly on its back and partly on its side; the legs only were seen above the soil; the head and upper part of the body were buried with the ashes and mould—it was apparently dead, but I had heard an indistinct moaning before I took it out—I used a warm bath and friction, and ultimately restored it—I found the placenta in the cess<lb/>pool, just by the child—the umbilical cord was torn—Miss Lemoyne asked the prisoner, in my hearing, if she knew why the mould and ashes were thrown down—she said, she had not thrown any down for many days before—this was before the child was found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to James Lye Seager and Mr. Evans—there is more than one partner—T. D. Chappell, of Taunton, is a customer of ours—on the 23rd of January we forwarded two puncheons of gin to him—they were sent by our van to the wharf—the name of seager and Evans was on the van, and, on each puncheon, "T. D. Chappell, Taunton, Somerset"—any body in the street could read it—next day, the 24th, Walker came to the distillery with this letter, and the memorandum which is appended to it—I asked him some questions—Mr. Seager was standing behind him—in consequence of what passed, I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., having marked it first, by Mr. Seager's directions—this order was not quite sepa<lb/>rated from the letter when it was brought—Mr. Seager went out before Walker.</p>

On the 24th of February I was present when Walker brought this paper—in conse<lb/>quence of information, I desired the money to be given to him, and marked—I afterwards went out, and observed Walker go towards Oliver's Coffee-house—he was met by the prisoner—I saw them talking together, and soon after I went up, and had him taken into custody—supposing I be<lb/>lieved this to have been the genuine writing of Mr. Chappell, I should have paid the money, that is our practice—it is in the course of business to pay on these requests to country customers.</p>

About ten o'clock in the evening of the 10th of February, I saw the prisoner in the house with a female child in her arms, about sixteen or seventeen months old—she threw it violently on the ground—it was picked up and put in her arms again—she threw it down a second time, saying, "You little b—would not mind two years for you; I wish you were dead before the morning"—a woman picked it up, and as she was giving it to her, the prisoner made a grasp at its throat—I prevented her by laying hold of her, but she caught its arm and gave it a pull, and I rather think she dislocated it at the time—we got it away as well as we could, and got her on the ground, where I held her till the policeman came and took her into custody.</p>

On the 26th of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I was in bed, and was awoke by hearing cries of murder, and the screams of children proceeding from the prisoner's room—it was his wife's voice—I had often heard it before—I jumped out of bed, dressed myself hastily, and proceeded to their room—I had scarcely opened my own room door, when I saw the wife running as if making her escape from the prisoner's room, with a child in her arms—I went inside the door of his room, and told him to consider himself in custody—I had on my trow<lb/>sere and boots at that time, and my arms through my coat, which I was buttoning up—the prisoner was standing in the centre of the room—he said, "Leave the room, sir, you are not on duly"—I told him I was al<lb/>ways on duty, and pointed to my uniform—he then ran to the fire-place, while he was going there I called to the parties outside the door to run down and fetch assistance—I had scarcely said the words when the pri<lb/>soner ran at me with the poker, striking at me with it—he did not strike me then—I closed with him for the purpose of taking the poker from him, upon which he got one arm round my waist, and struck me on the back of the head four or five times with the poker now produced—it is bent now, but it appeared perfectly straight when he had it in his hand first—I still kept hold of him, and brought him outside the door on the landing—I was there assisted by Mr. Grogan—he then said he would go easily with me—I requested Grogan to come to the station with me to ex<lb/>plain his conduct—Grogan went up to put on his coat and shoes—he had no sooner turned his back than the prisoner commenced beating me about the head with his fist—(he had thrown away the poker in the room)—after striking me several times he flung himself down the first flight of stairs and effected his escape—I followed him to Lee's-buildings—I lost sight of him there and returned—I had my head dressed at Mr. Winpenny's, a surgeon, in Fetter-lane—it was cut about two inches, in two or three places, besides a cut on my cheek—I cannot say how that was done—I went to St. Bar<lb/>tholomew's Hospital, and saw the house-surgeon, who has been attending me ever since—I am taking medicine now from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a currier, and live in Lisle-street, Leicester-square. I was proceeding home on the 10th of March, accompanied by the two prisoners—one Woodfield was with the prisoners when I met them—they were walking together—Speed had been a schoolfellow of mine, and I used to play with Bridges—I was intoxicated—we walked on together—they accompanied me to my own door in Lisle-street, where I live with my mother—I did not miss any thing that night, but next morning I missed a watch and two rings—I cannot say where they were when I last had them—the rings were on the guard, and the watch in my fob, at nine o'clock, and I fell in with the prisoners between nine and half-past nine o'clock—I was too much intoxicated to miss them that night—I saw the watch next morning in possession of Kelly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 19th of March I was at the Islington station, Islington-green, about eight o'clock in the evening—the prisoner came and knocked at the door—it was opened, and she came in, and said she wished to give herself up, she had murdered her child—I asked her in what way—she said, "By throwing it into the liver"—she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184104050106"/>
               <p>said the child was three weeks old on the Tuesday before—I went with her to the New River, at Owen's-row, and opposite No. 19, she pointed to the house, and said, "It is right opposite here where I put it in; I had been sitting down at that door for half an hour," and the child had been crying the whole time she had been sitting there, and had been crying all the afternoon—she said she had no food for herself, and no milk to give the child; that she had been that morning to Marylebone workhouse for relief, and there they searched the books, and found her mother's name, but not her's, and that was the reason they told her they could not relieve her—she said she had committed herself, and then went to Maidstone gaol for three months, and a fortnight before her time expired she was confined with this child, and the child was registered in the name of Eliza Harris—I have since been there, and got a copy of the register in that name—I made search for the body of the child, and found it, after two hours' search, be<lb/>tween fifty and sixty yards from the place where she pointed out as having thrown it in—the child was on the surface of the water, stopped by the iron grating that goes across the bridge, near St. John-street-road—it was dressed in the clothes which I now produce—it was a female child—I took the child and clothes to Rosoman-street station—it was examined then by Dr. Edmondson—at the time the prisoner came in she bad this small parcel in her hand, containing a small quantity of bread.</p>

I have known the prisoner from three years of age—on the 18th of March, the night be<lb/>fore she committed this act, I was going towards Turnstile, Saffron-hill—the prisoner passed me, with a child in her arms, about a quarter after seven o'clock—she told me she had come from the Borough—I saw she had a baby in her arms, and asked her whose it was—she said it was hen—I was surprised at it—she said it was three weeks old—she took me to a shop window and showed me the baby—it was very small and very pale—she told me she had no breast for the baby, and was afraid it would not live—I asked where she was going—she said to Islington—she said she was living with a young man, a shoemaker, and he was earning 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I said that was very little—she said they were comfortable—I then asked her if she would like to see her mother—she said, provided she would not scold her—I said I would go to her mother for her if she would wait—I did so, and she waited—her mother was not at home—I came back and told her so—I then asked her if she had any message for her mother when I saw her—she said, Nothing particular, I might say I had met her, she bad got a little girl, and had now made her mother a grandmother—I said, "It is early days for you to be in the cold"—she asked me several questions concerning her mother—I then bid her good night, and we parted.</p>

On the evening of the 19th of March, I went to a house in Owen's-row, at not quite eight o'clock, but very near it—I saw a woman with a child, sitting on the step of the door—I went into the house No. 14, and re<lb/>mained there about ten minutes, as near as I can guess—when I came out I saw her there again—I did not see her face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I examined the body of the child on the 19th of March, about half-past ten o'clock in the evening—the clothes were dripping wet—I saw it immediately it was brought to the station—the child was stripped—I observed that the surface of its body was unusually pale, except the skin of the head and face—its eyelids were partially open—I did not open the body—from my external observation, the cause of its death appeared to be suffocation from drowning, from immer<lb/>sion in water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you hear, before you examined it, that the body had been found on the surface of the water? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, stopped by the grating—I did not make any <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I think there was sufficient appearance to enable me to say it had been drowned—as far as external observation went, I am of that opinion—the mouth was quite closed—it is not usual to find the mouth of a drowned person open—I have seen many drowned persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TAYLOR</hi>. I am a surgeon. I examined the body of the child on the 22nd—there were no external marks of violence—in dividing the skin, very little fat was found between the skin and muscles—the stomach was healthy, and contained about half a spoonful of fluid, resembling milk—the lungs filled the cavity of the chest, and, had a redder appearance than usual—they were filled with frothy mucus—the vessels of the brain appeared more congested than usual—the <hi rend="italic">diaphragm</hi> descended towards the abdomen—on turning over the body, a little fluid issued from the nose—in my judgment the child came to its death from suffocation, from drowning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What quantity of fluid was there from the nose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Probably a tea-spoonful, nearly as much as that—the immediate cause of death was not the congestion of the brain—there are many causes to account for its death—the deprivation of air from the lungs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was there to indicate it died from drowning, and not before it was immersed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The frothy mucus, and the blood not coagulating, I infer from that the child was alive when thrown into the water—the child was very thin and emaciated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the want of food, either substantial or fluid food, account for the appearance of the brain, or the <hi rend="italic">diaphragm</hi> descending towards the ab<lb/>domen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it would—I did not examine the prisoner—no water issued from the stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing it to be in a dying state for want of food, would its ap<lb/>pearance immediately before death, or for some minutes before death, be such as to lead a person to suppose it was dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might present symptoms of great exhaustion, but not that of death, I should think—drowned persons are generally found with their mouths shut—it may or may not be so—I have seen grown persons, who died from suffocation by drowning, and, no water found on the stomach, but not often—generally speaking, it is not so—the pupils of the child's eye were dilated, the eyes were shut—I believe they are generally open in drowned persons—it may or may not be so—the froth in the air vessels would not be caused by the child being without food for a long time—at the time of death it is possible for a little water to form in the lungs, and become mucus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But if the child died for want of a sufficient supply of milk, is it not possible that the milk going into the air vessels would form that ap<lb/>pearance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, if the child was at the breast, I do not think it posssi<lb/>ble for the milk to get into the air vessels—milk would produce a different appearance to what was found—it was frothy mucus—it was very differ<lb/>ent to milk—I do not mean to represent that milk could not find its way into the air cells, but it is a very improbable thing—during the straggle for life, it is possible the water might find its way into the air cells from the mouth, but it would not find its way from the mouth without that struggle, because the lungs are protected by the <hi rend="italic">glottis</hi>—supposing the child to be actually starving, it is very unlikely it should find its way then—if any thing gets down the windpipe, it produces suffocation, or at least great distress.</p>

On the 4th of Feb<lb/>ruary, I and Miss Wright went to Madame Tussaud's exhibition—we left there at twenty minutes to nine o'clock, and got near Bell-street, Edge<lb/>ware-road, a few minutes before nine—when we got to the end of Bell-street, I felt something pulling at me—I did not at first think it was my bag, but I found it was, and I felt somebody pulling me down Bell-street—my bag was twisted round my wrist—I was carrying it in front of ray waist—I was dragged a yard or two down Bell-street—I screamed violently, "My bag," and after I screamed I was felled to the ground by a blow in my back, and when down, I received a kick in my back front the effects of which I am suffering very much, and have been under medi<lb/>cal treatment ever since—I saw a face when I was knocked down, which I have no doubt at all was the prisoner's—my bag gave way, and then I was on my back—I saw the man's face both before and after I was down—I have the strings of the bag here—the bag gave way from the sewing—it con<lb/>tained the money and articles described in the indictment—the prisoner ran up Bell-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a traveller. On the evening of the 5th of April, I was in St. Paul's Churchyard, and met the prisoners just opposite the Goose and Gridiron public-house—they asked for something to drink—I gave them a shilling—I had at that time eight sovereigns loose in my pocket, and a purse containing four other sovereigns, and a sixpence—as soon as I left them I beard a sovereign drop, I picked it up and put it into my pocket, with the other seven—I then missed my purse containing the four sovereigns and sixpence, which was a cracked one—I have seen the sixpence and the purse since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Francis Poidevin, who lives at Craven-hill, Bayswater—the prisoner was his ser<lb/>vant. On the 26th of March I went to market, and when I returned I found the prisoner intoxicated—she had only been there three days—I searched her box, and found in it three bottles of wine and one of brandy—when I first wanted to see her box she objected, and said she would we me d—d first, but she at last gave me the key, and I found this wine and brandy in it, and one bottle of wine she had drank—the corks of the bottles had been cut off—she said they were her own, and she had brought then from her mother's in Wales—here is a mark on the bottom of the bottle of brandy, by which I know it is my master's—I cannot say whether the wine is his or not—I found a pewter-pot in the kitchen with the remainder of the wine in it.</p>

               <p>Sheriff Gibbs was present part of the time—I was there the latter part of the day, from twelve till three o'clock—I was there from twelve till the close of the poll each day—daring that time Mr. Sheriff Gibbs was generally present—on the 20th he was there at twelve, and certainly until about two—I produce the poll-books, which have been in the care of the Secondaries—they are the poll-books taken at the last election.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Benjamin Sharp, as butchers, in New-street, Dorset-square—Goodiff was in our service seven or eight weeks—I know Prime by sight by coining to the shop—on the 16th of March, I was returning home about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and passing my shop, I saw Goodiff with his back towards me, and Prime holding a cloth by three corners—I saw Goodiff take some meat and give it to Prime—it was put into the cloth—I did not go into the shop at the moment—as soon as Prime saw me, he said to Goodiff, "Hush," and threw the cloth and meat behind some carcases of mutton—he then took up a piece of neck of mutton, and said, "Weigh this for me, I am unwell"—I walked into the shop—Goodiff asked me how ranch it was,—it weighed 2 3/4 lbs. —I said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I then took the doth and meat from behind the sheep, and said, "What a shame it is to rob me in this way, not retail, but wholesale"—the cloth contained a fore-loin of pork, and the chump end of a loin of mutton—the prisoners both said they knew nothing about it—I then asked Prime if the cloth belonged to him—he pretended to look at it, and said it did not—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the mutton, and walked out of the shop—I observed the initials "H. P." on the cloth—I did not at that time know Prime's name—I then called to Groves, our clerk, to pay Goodiff his wages, which he did—I accused him of the theft, which he denied—he went away—I afterwards went with the police to Prime's house—he opened the door, and I gave him in charge—we searched the house, and found some cloths with initials correspond<lb/>ing to the one in my shop, and almost all his things were marked "H. P."—in consequence of information I afterwards examined my premises, and found marks of pieces of fat on the cover of the water-closet, which is in the passage leading to the slaughter-house—I also found a hole in the ceil<lb/>ing of the stable, but could not see any marks there.</p>

On the 6th of April the prisoner came to my shop with a child—she said she wished to purchase a dress and a shawl—the young man showed her some dresses—she selected two dresses, a shawl, and three pairs of stockings, for which he had a bill made out—she said she was going further to receive some money, and would call and pay for them on her return—she took the bill with her—she was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour in the shop—from her manner I suspected her—I went out, and overtook her about a hundred yards from the shop—I saw her take the bill out of her bosom and tear it to pieces, which increased my suspicion—I went up to her, and said she had just left my shop, and I believed she had brought more out than she took in—she asked why I suspected her—I took hold of her cloak—she began crying, and hoped I would forgive her—I brought her back—she threw the dress into the shop, and attempted to run away—this is the dress.</p>

On the 1st of March, I attended the Court of Requests—I left home about half-past eleven o'clock, and left my daughter alone—I came back about half-past twelve—I found my daughter and Buckley together—the door was shut—Buckley had a coal-bag in her hand—the next day I missed my husband's boots and shoes, which were safe the Sunday before—I told my daughter to look for them—she did, and did not find them—on the Wednesday evening I missed a flat-iron—my daughter said she could not find it, she supposed the woman up stairs must have taken it—on the following Friday Buckley came again, she asked me if I had got every thing yet—she did not mention boots and irons—she said, "Have you got your things?"—I asked her if she knew what character Mrs. White, the lodger, who lived up stairs was—she said she bore a very bad character indeed, and she thought she had taken the things.</p>

On the 2nd of April I was at the Two Brewers public-house, at Greenwich, at twenty minutes past ten o'clock at night—the prisoner was there—I was about treating some old pen<lb/>sioners—I put my hand into my pocket, and found I was without the means of doing so—I was a little the worse for liquor—I had, no doubt, spent the money—I took the prisoner for the waiter or potman—I gave him my watch, asked him to take it to his master, and ask him to lend me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I would send for it in the morning—he did not return, and I went to the bar to make inquiry—the landlord and I had a contention about it—I afterwards went out, and met the prisoner in the street—I challenged him with having taken my watch—he denied it on his oath, and words took place between us—a policeman came up—we went back to the house, and my watch was found in his left-band trowsers-pocket.</p>
