             sworn. - I am a bookseller in Baldwin's-gardens: On the 23d of January, about four o'block, the prisoner brought me, to the best of my recollection, one hundred and seventy numbers of Harrison's Classics for sale; he said he was going to Liverpool, he had been paying his coach fare in the City, and had no time to spare; I do not recollect what he asked for them, but I offered him a guinea, and he took it; he bought a bird and a cage of me for three shillings, and I gave him eighteen shillings in money; about six o'clock I looked them over, and found them to be odd numbers; I went to two booksellers to ask their opinion, and they were of opinion that I was taken in, that they were worth nothing to me but waste paper; but when I looked them over again, I thought there was something in it that was not fair, and I was determined to find out the proprietor; and I went about the next day form eight to one, till I found out Mr. Walker, and I delivered them to him; they were the same that I had bought of the prisoner; Mr. Walker took me to the prisoner's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; do you believe him to be the man? - A. I believe him to be the man, but my knowledge of him is but shallow.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the man that Walker took you to; have you any doubt then whether it was the same man? - A. An oath is a serious thing, but I believe it to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether that man was the prisoner at the bar? - A. He has every appearance to me of being the same; I have but very little doubt that he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to him, by Walker, in his presence? - A. Mr. Walker asked him what he had done with the money; and he said he had made away with it.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen them last? - A. Some of them must have been there for a twelvemonth or more; I cannot speak to having seen them at any particular time; I had seen the bundles, but not to look them over, I kept the key of the warehouse; I was called into the parlour on the 24th of January, and there I saw the numbers, (produces them); I know them to be the same that were in that warehouse; there were eighty-seven of one number, and fifty of another; the next day my master and I went into the warehouse, and looked them over, and these two bundles were wanting; of No. 83, there are eighty-seven books, and of No. 118, there are fifty books, and a variety of odd numbers; eleven of No. 1, two of No. 10, three of No. 12, three of No. 13, and others; but I cannot speak particularly to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walker.

               <p>Q. How came you to follow them so? - A. I suspected the two men that were with the prisoner; he stopped at the foot of London-Bridge, and went to Billingsgate; I told him I would feed my horse, and take care of his while he was gone; I looked into the cart, and saw some lead; and when he came back, he said, fish was very dear, and he would go over into the Borough; I said, no, you will not, I shall stop you, for you have got lead in your cart; he said, was I in earnest; I told him, yes; then he said he was a ruined man; then he said he would tell me where he got it; he said he found it upon a dunghill at Butcher's-grove, just on this side of Cranford-bridge; he said he had got down to ease himself there; he said it was Monday afternoon, and he left it till Wednesday morning, and then took his horse and cart, and went and fetched it.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was the 15th? - A. Wednesday; he said he left Twickenham at three o'clock, and had been to Butcher's-grove, and loaded it; it is about four miles from Twickenham to Butcher's-gove, and about ten miles from there to Hammersmith, and he was at Hammersmith as soon as me; I could not get a constable, and a man came up, and he told him, that he had got some lead, and that I wanted to be busy, and had stopped him; the man asked if I had got a constable; and he said, no; then the man said, he could not stop me; the prisoner then said, he would knock me down if I offered to stop him; I told him, then I would follow him, I followed him in my cart, and he in his, over London-Bridge, where I got a constable, and took him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You knew Hanson before? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did he say where the dunghill was? - A. I do not recollect that he did; I asked him who the cart belonged to; he said it was his own; on the Monday following, I took the lead down to <placeName id="t18000219-4-crimeloc19">Twickenham</placeName>

               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. Seven shillings; I gave more money for it; I picked it up, and have kept it ever since; it has my private mark upon it; I did not see her take it.</p>

No; on the 1st of February, about six o'clock, I went up stairs to my own lodging, I found my room door broke open, that was between six and seven; I had not been in the apartment since the morning; I missed six shirts, four pair of stockings, four pocket-handkerchiefs, sixteen neck-handkerchiefs, a counterpane, and one pound nine shillings and nine-pence in halfpence; I had seen them the same morning; I immediately went to Bow-street for a warrant; when I returned, I saw the prisoner in the cellar, with a candle lighted; I saw him put the candle out, and saw him bring the goods out at the door, I was not a rod off him; I took him into custody going into his own house, with the property in his hands, (produces the articles mentioned in the indictment;) they have been in my custody ever since; I am confident they were all taken out of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your doors left fastened? - A. Yes, it appeared to be opened by a crow, and the boxes too, he confessed he had done it with a crow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Before you say he confessed, let us know what you had said to him? - A. I wanted the bag of halfpence, and he said, if he let me know where the halfpence were, would I let him go, and I told him I would not; he told me where the halfpence were in the cellar, my man went down into the cellar, and brought them up to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. Does not the prisoner lodge in the same house with you? - A. No, he lives in the next house.</p>

The prisoner told me he bought them at Highgate, of a man that came from Barnet; I asked him if he knew the man; he said, no; I asked him if he had a cart; he said, not that he knew of; I asked him if he had a horse; he said, he did not know.

             desired that the prisoner might drink with us; the prisoner was unknown to me or any of the company; we drank porter from four till eight o'clock, we had had four pots; Hartley's brother-in-law then went away, then the prisoner said, I will drink along with you, he did not join our company till then; I objected to it; he said he would be his pot, I said no, you had better keep<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190011"/>your own company; George Scott said, let him drink with us, his pot of beer is as good as ours, upon which he laid hold of the pot to drink; we then sat till between nine and ten, and drank four pots of beer more; then Rudkin had to go to his barracks, each man paid for a pot; George Scott said, we will have a parting pot, which I went and drew immediately; Rudkin slung down his penny to pay towards it; I said, let us be pennys-a-piece, for short reckonings make long friends; James Hartley said he would see me d-d first; I said, there is no occasion to see me d-d first, upon that I said, we will pay his penny amongst us; George Scott jumped up, and said, I was the cause of his coming into your company, I will pay the money for him, only let me go out and make water, and as he was going towards the door, he thrust the sword into him.</p>

               <p>Q. To the best of your recollection was nothing more said? - A. Nothing more on either side; he passed the prisoner, as he went to the door; the deceased turned to me, and said, oh Lord, Kendrick, I am killed, I am dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing had been said by the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a sword was it? - A. A Dutch sword, that he had brought from Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sword in his belt? - A. I did not see it in his belt, he had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he it in his hand all the evening? - A. No, he gave it to me, and I returned it to him in about ten minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned you to return it to him? - A. He asked me to bring his sword back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him draw it? - A. No, nor I did not see the blow given, but I saw him draw the sword from his body; the deceased made a stop, and fell towards the fire; he died in the course of a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the wound? - A. Yes; the prisoner turned about and offered to make his escape, and an old man, William Davis, knocked him down, he had the sword drawn, and I forced myself into the box to him, and hit him over the arm that he held up, which made him drop his arm; I then laid hold of the point of it with my left hand, and with my right hand to the hilt of the sword, wrested it out of his hand and broke it; the landlord came running out of the bar, and the landlady; he went for a surgeon, it was near an hour and a half before he got a surgeon, but the surgeon said he was dead; I carried him up stairs upon my back; we sent for a constable; as we were conveying him to St. Mary-le-bonne watch-house, I had a lauthorn in my hand, and his arms were tied, he came up to me, and said, you have no occasion to say all you know, do not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this happened, how were you as to sobriety? - A. We were all a little in liquor, but not to be in any way intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner intoxicated? - A. No; he was about in the same form that we were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. About seven o'clock the prisoner and his brother-in-law entered the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was upon a furlough going to Bandbury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He told the landlord so, and requested a bed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the brother-in-law drink with you? - A. No; the prisoner did not drink with us till he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What had the prisoner to drink with his brother-in-law? - A. A pot of ale, and a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides the eight pots? - A. Yes; but he took no part of the first four pots.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of gin was drank in the course of the evening? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. What other liquor? - A. No other, but a pot of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been agreed that the prisoner should have a bed there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he gave you his knapsack and his sword, and desired you to put them by, soon after he got there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in consequence of some dispute between you and the prisoner, respecting the last pot of beer, that he asked for his sword and knapsack? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him that he should not have a bed there that night, and was not that the cause of your getting him his knapsack and sword? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not your own spontaneous act, fetching his sword and knapsack? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not tell him he should not sleep there that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a publican of the name of Davis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you never told any person that it was in consequence of your endeavouring to turn some person out of the house, that this accident took place? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask for his sword himself, or did you fetch it him without? - A. No, he asked for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What other arms were produced? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there such a thing as a pistol produced? - A. Yes, by me; he asked me to let him look at it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he know you had a pistol? - A. Because he saw it in the place where I put his sword.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190012"/>Q. How did you amuse yourselves? - A. By smoaking our pipes, and drinking porter.</p>
               <p>Q. In no other way? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not domino played? - A. Not while the prisoner was there; we were at play before the prisoner came in, but not after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner lay down upon the table to sleep? - A. Not till after the deed was done.</p>
               <p>Q. That you mean to swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never told any body that he was napping at the table, and that you awoke him to pay the reckoning, and that a quarrel ensued in consequence of his refusal? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many blows passed that night? - A. None, till after he had given the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Who struck the prisoner? - A. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in consequence of his refusing to pay his money towards the last pot of porter, that the quarrel ensued? - A. He refused to pay it, but there was no quarrel; Scott got up and said he would pay it for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not Scott go out and return, before the wound was given? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, after the wound was given did he not say, by G-d I am afraid I have hurt him; send for a surgeon? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you have never told any body so? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the army? - A. Between six and seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever belong to any other regiment except the guards? - A. Never.</p>

             sworn. - I went with the deceased to the Black Lion at Bayswater, about four o'clock; there was Kendrick there and the prisoner, and another young man that came along with us; they two drank by themselves till near eight o'clock, when the brother-in-law said he must go home to the barracks; he went away; then the prisoner said, sooner than drink by himself, he would chuse to come into our company, which Kendrick rather refused at first; the deceased said, what is the object, his pot is as good as our's, we are all soldiers alike; after that we admitted him into our company; I suppose we drank beer to the amount of four pots in the company afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you drank before? - A. I suppose three or four pots in the course of the afternoon; I said I must be going home to the barracks; the deceased said, let us have a parting pot; upon that Kendrick fetched a fifth pot in, and we drank part of the beer; Kendrick said, we may as well pay for the beer, short reckonings make long friends; Kendrick, the deceased, and I paid our pennys a-piece; Kendrick asked the prisoner for his, and he said, he would see Kendrick d-d first; the deceased said, there need not be any words about the money, it was my fault he came into company, and sooner than there shall be any words about a penny, let me go out and make water, and when I come in I will pay the money; upon that the deceased was going out to make water, and going by the prisoner, there was a sword lying upon the settle, he took it up and put it into him, about two inches from his navel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him draw his sword? - A. No; but I saw him draw the sword from him; upon that the deceased said, oh Lord God, Kendrick, I cannot live; he died in about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were there, did you hear any other altercation? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any quarrel at all? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to become a private again? - A. Through neglect.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that happened to you more than once? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner came in, proposing to sleep at that house, did not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him give his arms to Kendrick to take care of? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When he joined you, he was sitting without his arms? - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many games at domino did you play? - A. Not any while the prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many games did you play at all that evening? - A. I did not play at all, I did not see any dominos there all that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Scott did not play? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any body saying it was a very shabby thing in the prisoner to refuse to pay the money? - A. Something was said, that it was not a soldier's behaviour not to pay the money.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom? - A. I cannot say whether it was the deceased or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Kendrick give him the sword? - A. No; I was not sitting in the same box; he asked for the sword.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it to be returned to him? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Kendrick tell him he should not sleep there, he should leave the house? - A. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190013"/>Q. When the deceased passed by him, was his face towards your's, or towards the prisoner? - A. Towards the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. He passed the prisoner after somebody had said that it was very unsoldierlike behaviour of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not very possible for Scott to have pinched him by the nose, or brushed him in the face, his back being towards you? - A. He did not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not possible for him to have done that without your perceiving it? - A. I do not think he could; I should have seen it certainly, if he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that struck any blow before Scott went out of the house? - A. I never saw a blow struck.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have always given that account of it? - A. I never saw a blow struck before Scott received the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said so? - A. I never have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Peisley, a broker and auctioneer? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am a licensed hawker; what I saw was after the man was stabbed: I saw nothing going forward, but I sat peaceable on my chair; after he was stabbed, Kendrick and Rudkin were pitying of him; Kendrick took the sword from the prisoner, and broke it; then he got the deceased upon his thigh; I thought it possible the prisoner might make his escape; I stood between him and the door, and struck him; then the landlord was called, and he went for a surgeon, and Kendrick and I kept walking backwards and forwards that he should not make his escape, till he was secured.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you been in the house? - A. I had been there I suppose from about dark; but I was not in the room where they were I suppose not a quarter of an hour before it happened; I had been sitting in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any quarrel, or any blows struck between them? - A. I did not see any blows at all; there was something like a dispute about a penny. but I did not know then what it was about, it was so trifling it did not take any attention.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did the prisoner at the bar walk about the room, or continue sitting in the box, after the blow was given? - A. He sat in the box, and he drew towards the end of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. It would have been in vain for him to have tried to make his escape, you would not have let him? - A. No; but he shifted to the end of the seat, and how soon could he have got up and ran away, if I had not prevented him.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no blows given to the prisoner at the bar? - A. I struck him after the murder was done.</p>
               <p>Q. For what did you strike him? - A. Because he was shifting, I thought, to get away.</p>

Kendrick, was then present in the tap-room; the landlord tapped Rudkin on the shoulder, and took him out to speak to him, and I did not see him after; I had no conversation with Kendrick.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a surgeon, in Holborn: I was called in to attend the deceased, on Thursday the 6th of February; he complained of a pain in his belly, and a great soreness in making water; I ordered him what I thought necessary, but he died on the 11th, I saw him only till the 10th; when I saw him on the Friday I thought he would not live; I and Mr. Hodgson opened the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any external marks that appeared to portend to you dangerous consequences? - A. None; upon opening the belly, we found the internal covering of the lower intestines very much inflamed, nearly approaching to mortification; the bladder was in a state of mortification, and had ruptured.</p>
               <p>Q. To what cause did you ascribe his death? - A. Cold, fever, or drinking, might cause those appearances.</p>

Cheating; the deceased put his right-hand upon the table, jumped over, and hit the prisoner in the face; the prisoner then said, you are fightable, are you; the deceased said to the prisoner, come along my lad; the prisoner came out of the box in the tap-room, and as soon as ever he was out, the deceased struck him again, and then they got to fighting, and, in the scuffle, the deceased got a hook in his hand; Mr. Lawrence, a porter in the yard, took it from him, and I threw it under the table; then they got to fighting again, and threw one another down against the tap-room door, they both fell down; then I begged and prayed the prisoner to leave off, which he did; the deceased then got up, and sat down in one corner of the tap-room; he seemed to me to be very ill, groaned very much, and seemed very full of pain; my wife went to him, and he laid his head upon her arm; she asked him if he wanted any thing to drink, and she fetched a glass of gin, and he drank about half of it; he staid about ten minutes, and then I assisted him; he walked stooping quite double, and groaned all the way home; he lodged in the same yard, and there I left him.</p>

             sworn. - On the 28 th of January, I was called in to the deceased, about the middle of the day: I found two other professional gentlemen there, who lived nearer, and got there before me; when I saw him, he appeared to me to be dead; however, we naturally proceeded to do all that was reasonable and proper to restore him; but after making some experiments, we thoroughly agreed that no more would be of any use; he was dead at that time; we had him stripped, and put into a warm bath; we discovered no external marks of violence, no bruises, or any thing of the kind, except a cut in the upper lip; the next morning we met in order to open his body; we made a very minute examination, and we could discover nothing that could lead to that idea that a blow had been inflicted that could have caused death, if we had not been informed that the man had been killed by a blow; there was nothing that could have that appearance, excepting one circumstance, on taking out the stomach, and opening it, it was reported that it was in that part he received the blow; upon examining the coat of the stomach, there was one or more place of extravasation diffused over the inner membrane of the stomach; that, however, was by no means the cause of his death, however it might have been the effect of a blow; there was on other particular appearance that we could discover; it might eventually have caused death, but not immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. If the violent concussion had affected the heart, it might have produced instantaneous death? - A. Yes, as it did in this case.</p>

             sworn. - I am a labourer in the India Company's warehouses: On the 28th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190017"/>of January, about twelve o'clock, I saw Hughes with three bunches of matches in his hand, and he said to Harding, Dick, here are two for a halfpenny, and one for a farthing; I sat down to eat my dinner, and upon turning my head round, I saw them fighting; I did not see the first blow struck; after they had done fighting, Woolley went away into the accompting-house, I did not go in with him; Hughes was upon the ground, and was carried into the accompting-house from the first beginning of their striking one another; he was dead in the course of a minute and a half; the blows they struck did not seem as if they would hurt a child of ten years of age, they were so close to one another; he was as stout, able, a young man as could be any where; ever since Woolley came to the warehouse, Hughes has been always abusing of him, and calling him names, there is not a man in the warehouse that would have taken the ill behaviour that he did so long.</p>

             sworn. - I am pot-boy to Mr. Martin: On the 5th of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, I went to No. 1, in Elm-court, to Mr. Lasher's chambers, when I came down, I missed the pots, there were eight quarts, and five pints, upon a leather strap; I then saw Simon Dyke, the watchman, and he and I went down to Crown Office-row, and took him with the pots upon his back; he was going towards King's-bench Walk; he said he was going to take the pots home to the Essex-head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing at all of him before? - A. No; I had never seen him before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you gone up stairs? - A. Not two minutes; the pots all belong to my master. (Produces the pots.)</p>

             sworn. - I am watchman of the Temple; I went with the boy, and took the prisoner in Crown Office-row; we took him towards the Essex-head, and in Essex-court he turned rusty, and swore he would not go any further; he then 
               <persName id="t18000219-17-person202">drew</persName>
             a knife, and cut me across the hand; I called to my fellow-servant that was coming through the court, he took him by the arms behind, and secured him while I went to the doctor; I have not lost the use of my hand, but I have not been able to do any thing since; he threw the knife away, and it was found by my fellow-servant.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he upon him when you found him in Crown Office-row? - A. Eight quart pots and a pint.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you take upon you to swear that I was the person that cut you, when there were so many people by? - A. I am very positive of it, for there was nobody by but myself and the boy; I had thrown him down upon his back before he cut me, he cut me as he laid upon his back, upon some stone steps in Essex-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the boy at that time? - A. The boy had loosed him with the fall, there was nobody else near at that time, and my fellow-servant heard me say I was cut, and then he seized him by the arms behind.</p>

             sworn. - I was coming through New-court, into Essex-court, and I heard Dyke say, that the man that he had got there upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190021"/>the ground had cut him, and I immediately jumped behind him, and locked my arms in between his, and said he should not cut any more; a gentleman standing just behind me, said, here lies the knife; that was about a yard and a half from the prisoner. (Produces the knife.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was the knife open or shut, when you picked it up? - A. Shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of blood upon it? - A. No. (The pots deposed to by Mr. Martin.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows: My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, on the 5th day of this month, I was going into the Temple, after I had left my work, to see a friend, and going along, I saw these pots lie in the court, not near any house, and two boys standing by them; I heard one of them say, as I passed by, put them in your apron till we can get a coach; hearing these words, I had a suspicion they were stolen from some house, where, I knew not; I took up one of the pots to see the inscription that was on it, and the boys, seeing me observe them both, ran away; seeing this, I was sure, within myself, that had stolen them; I saw, by the inscription, that they belonged to the Essex-head, Essex-street; I put them on my shoulder, and was determined, as it was all in my way, to take them there, and tell them how I got them; the pot-boy came up, I told him I had a suspicion they had been stolen, as I found them in the middle of the path-way, with two boys standing by them; this is the true state of the transaction, and as this is a Court of Justice, I hope and trust you will weigh the matter within yourselves, and the crime for which I stand here indicted, I am entirely innocent of, and trust in God you will think so too; and in regard to the watchman, I know nothing of it; he cannot swear I was the man that cut him, he found the knife upon the ground, near the place where I stood; but that was as likely to be dropped out of any other person's pocket in the scuffle, as from me; for if I had cut the man, it was impossible I could have shut the knife and thrown it away, as two persons had hold of my hands all the time, and if that knife had come from my possession, some one or other must have seen me with it; the Justice particularly asked him, if the knife had any blood on it, and it had not; therefore, Gentlemen, I hope you will consider within yourselves, that I am not guilty of the assault.</p>

               <p>Bough. These are my planks; they are the same that were lying in the Isle of Dogs; they have my mark upon them; I marked them with a centrebit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am not guilty; I bought them of an unknown person, who came to me and asked me three shillings for these two planks; I do not recollect the day, but it was about seven o'clock in the evening of the day that I was stopped; I had very lately come from a foreign country, and I do not know any body here.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Aust.) Was the direction in which he was going, towards the docks or from the docks? - A. From the docks.</p>
               <p>Bough. I counted them again on the Sunday, and found twelve more gone.</p>

Yes; I know the apron, and this piece of my child's cotton gown; I parted with the prisoner that same day, at three o'clock, at the Horse-guards, he was going into the country to see for work; before we went out, I told his wife, who was with him, that I had got twelve pounds to pay my landlord, that I had got seven pounds by me towards it, and I believed I should make what money I could of the remainder of the things that were stolen; she came to me at the prison at nine o'clock, she was to sleep with me that night, and went home with me; when I came home, I found my house broke open, and the things gone; when we parted at the Horse-guards, she told me I did not know what might happen, I had better take the key of my own place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into the country to look for work, I am a brick-maker: I was eight miles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190027"/>off that night; she has left me and my wife in the house many times, while she has gone out.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hakesley. I never did but once, and that was the day after Christmas-day.</p>

             sworn. - I am a marshalman, (produces the indigo;) I saw this parcel taken from his hat; I searched his pocket, and in each pocket he had a quantity loose; in searching him farther I found this parcel under his trowsers, in his breeches.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Here are samples of indigo, and my own hand-writing on the papers.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of it? - A. More than five shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was ordered to sweep up the warehouse, and in sweeping I met with this indigo, I put it in my hat because I did not know where to put it, till my prosecutor came in, and when he came in, he charged me with stealing it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant, who had known him nearly four years, and gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. In what way? - A. Drawing: On Monday evening, the 10th of this month, about half past seven in the evening, I was coming up the Minories from Tower-hill, when I was within twelve yards of Mr. Buttenshaw's house, I heard a great noise of breaking the glass, and in two minutes saw the prisoner meet a man in the middle of the crossing, and give him a piece of cloth; he came towards Mr. Carey and me, and upon seeing him give the cloth to the other man, I supposed he was the person that stole it; I went after him some short distance back, when Mr. Carey collared him; I took hold on the other side, and brought him back to Mr. Buttenshaw's.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the prisoner from where you heard the noise of breaking the glass? - A. I suppose five or ten yards, I did not take notice of the window.</p>
               <p>- BUTTON sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Buttenshaw: I was in the back part of the shop, on the 10th of February, in the evening; I heard a violent breaking of the glass; I immediately ran forward to the door, and when I opened the door, I saw a very tall man running on the other side, crossing the road, not the prisoner; he ran down the Minories, about two hundred yards; I immediately pursued him all the way, he crossed Rosemary-lane, into Queen-street, and when he found that I gained upon him, he threw away a piece of Irish cloth that he had under his arm, it was Mr. Buttenshaw's cloth; I brought it back, and gave it to the constable.</p>

               <p>Q. In what state was the pane of glass? - A. Hardly a bit of glass remaining in it.</p>

            : On Monday the 10th of February, the prisoner was employed, with some others, to house some chests of sugar; he had been up about an hour, I had reason to suspect him before, and I kept my eye upon him; as he came down stairs, I saw some sugar upon his jacket; I immediately went to him, and asked him to let me see what he had got in his pocket; I laid hold of his pockets, and found them to be full of sugar; I made him take it out of his pockets and put it into my apron, which he did with his own hand; I asked him if he had any more; and he answered me, no; I put my hand to his breeches, and thought I felt something hard; I took him to the Quay, where some more of my partners were, and there, in his breeches, was a quantity more of sugar in a bag, which he pulled out, and I had him fast by the collar at the time; I sent for an officer, and gave charge of him; the officer has had the sugar ever since, it is worth about two shillings, it is saw sugar; I found the head of the hogshead broke open immediately after I had delivered him to the officer; I had seen the hogshead about half an hour before, and the head was not broke in then.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that the hay that came out of your yards was hay? - A. It was two different sorts of hay, one was clover hay, and the other marshy hay; I followed it to Mile-end, along-side the carts, all the way, for it was a very dark morning; they drove as fast as they could well drive, it is about a mile and three quarters, or near two miles; I saw some hay that same day, at Stepney, that I believe was mine, it was sold to a man that keeps a cow there (it was a particular kind of hay, marshy hay, with flags like, in it), about half a mile from the Coach and Horses, or scarcely so much.</p>

               <p>Q.Was your shed opened? - A. I employed a man to open it about eight or nine o'clock, but there was nothing at all there; there was a back door to it, and that had been opened.</p>

               <p>Q. Could not you have got in at that back door yourself? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I was servant to Mr. Clements: On the 6th of January, the carter, Shepherd, set me to take these horses to Mile end-road, with two trusses of hay belonging to Mr. Clements; I went to get the money for the grains and wash, while he drove the horses out of the yard; and when I had received the money, I ran after the carrier; I met with him in the Hackney-road, past the George; he says to me, come along, and when he got to the Coach and Horses at Mileend-road, he called out, will, to the offer, and he came out and took the hay, and gave us one shilling and sixpence a-piece for those two trusses of hay; and we went into the public-house and had a pennyworth of purl and a pennyworth of gin in it; he put the hay into a shed, and we went on to go to Bromley, and came back again, and had some more liquor there; and asked Mr. Holloway to be so good as to send a man home with the horses and carts; that was, as nigh as I can guess, between eleven and twelve o'clock; and then we ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to run away? - A. Because I was frightened, never having done any thing before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you of it at the public-house? - A. Mr. Holloway told me my master had been there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. He sent me out with the hay; he was the first that gave the hay out to the ostler, and whether the ostler gave him any money I can not say; I never received a farthing of it.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called his master, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, servant to Mr. Bunn, the corner of Wood-street and London-wall: On Friday, the 31st of January, I had information of a gold watch having been stolen; and on Saturday, the 1st of February, about four in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar offered me a gold watch to pledge, which answering, the description I had received, I detained the prisoner, and carried the watch to Mr. Witke's lodgings in Union-court, Broad-street; upon seeing the watch, he immediately said that was the watch he had lost; the came back with me to the shop, and gave charge of the prisoner; she wanted six guineas upon it; I did not ask her how she came by it; she said it was her father's; I asked her how long her father had had the watch, and she said, he had not had it long; I asked her if she knew what her father gave for the watch, and she said he gave twelve guineas for it; when I went to Mr. Witke's, I left her in the back shop with one of the boys; in the mean time Mr. Bunn's sister came in, and she pretended to her that she was very ill, and begged to go out for the air; and she, not knowing what she was detained for, let her go; but I came in before she had been gone three miniutes, and went after her, and brought her back; I am sure she is the same person.</p>

               <p>Smith. When she brought the watch to me, she told me her father was lately dead, and she was under the necessity of raising six guineas upon that watch, for that she had him to bury.</p>
               <p>Witke. This is my, watch, but not the chain; this is a woman's chain; mine was a string, and two gold seals; I have not found the seals; the pin is mine, and the handkerchief.</p>

             sworn. - I am a city constable: I know the prisoners; I knew Rudd before this happened; on the 1st of February I saw them both with another person, between six and seven in the evening; I was going down London-wall; the prisoner, Cawdle passed me with a bag upon his shoulder, Cawdle is the tallest of the men; I went a few yards, and Rudd and another man passed me; I followed, thinking I knew their faces; I then turned back and came up to Rudd again, and the other person; I then looked at them, and I was thoroughly satisfied that they were the faces of men that I knew; upon that I made the best of my way to Cawdle; I laid hold of the bag, and said to him, my good fellow, what have you got there; he said it was sugar; I asked him if he had a bill or receipt of it; he said, yes; I then told him I was an officer; he said, d-n you, what was that to him; then up came Rudd and the other man, at the corner of Basinghall-street, the London-wall end, towards Wood-street; Rudd and the other had parted; one came before and the other behind me; I said to Rudd, you keep off, for I know you well; I then had hold of the bag; then the man that was with Rudd came up and struck me between the shoulders; some people then came down Basinghall-street towards London-wall, and Cawdle pitched his load upon me, but luckily missed me, or else it must have broke my legs, then they all three made their escape towards Fore-street; they all made off in one company; the bag I took home with the assistance of a porter. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this had you known Rudd? - A. For two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you possibly be mistaken that he is the man that was with Cawdle and the other? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Cawdle was one of the men? - A. I had my eye upon him for three minutes, and from his height and his face, I think he 1s. After I had taken the sugar home, I met Sansum; told him this story; On the Monday night following, about seven o'clock, I saw the same three men in Bishopsgate-street again, in company together, coming from the Bull Inn; we looked at them some time; they were following the Walthamstow errandcart, which goes from the Bull Inn; I immediately went up to Rudd; Cawdle perceived me before I came up to him; he went side to buy a halfpennyworth of apples; I went to look at him full, with the light before him; I went away again to Sansum who was about six yards off; they went on further then, as far as Old Bethlem; we saw them cross several times by the cart, and then we stopped them; we took Cawdle and Rudd, and the other made his escape, upon taking them, I asked them where they were on Saturday night, at ten o'clock; Rudd said, he was in Brick-lane, Old-street, Smoking his pipe, and Cawdle said he was in bed at that time, at a public-house, in Brick-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What time of the night was this? - A. Between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It was then dark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Cawdle you knew nothing of before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, you went, on the Friday morning, to my Lord-Mayor, and gave information of the prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give their names? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And why did you not? - A. I told the Lord-Mayor how I had proceeded, and told him I should be able to get them.</p>

               <p>Q.Had Cawdle a round hat on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you mean to swear that you knew the man again? - A. He had his hat in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday, while he was buying some apples, you went up to look at Cawdle, and therefore you were not sure that he was the man? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190038"/>Yes, I knew him, but I was willing to be thoroughly satisfied; I am sure Rudd was one of the persons, and I never saw two faces more alike than that man's, and the face of Cawdle; I never saw another man like him; I must be greatly deceived if that is not the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Have you any doubt but Cawdle is the other man? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a light at this apple-stall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you had a better opportunity of seeing whether he was the man that you had been on the Saturday night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - I am a constable; I was in company with Read, on the Monday evening, when the two prisoners were apprehended; as we turned from London-Wall, towards the Bull-inn, Read and I saw the Waltham slow errand-cart in the middle of the street, going towards Shoreditch, and almost directly, we perceived the two prisoners, and another man, that they call Ginger, he got away from me, when I apprehended Rudd; we followed them on the pavement, as they were in the road, they were walking behind the errand-cart; I then turned short round to follow them, and observed that they came away from the cart, on the pavement; Cawdle went and bought some apples; Read went to the light, and looked at him two or three times backwards and forwards; he immediately said, that is he, and I seized him, and delivered him to Read, while I pursued after Rudd; Ruff had got a little way on; I seized him; little Ginger was before him, and I desired another man to lay hold of him, but he got away; I took them into a tobacconist's shop, to the light, and Read there said, they were the men that he had stopped with the parcel on Saturday night; I asked Cawdle where he was at ten o'clock on Saturday night; Cawdle said he was in bed, I think, and Rudd said he was smoking his pipe, in Brick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the persons of Cawdle and Rudd before that time? - A. Rudd I knew well, and I have met Cawdle several times in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a man whom you knew, if you saw him? - A. Just so; on the Saturday before this, I was going down Bishopgate-street, about six o'clock, and saw Cawdle, Rudd, and another man in company together, nearly opposite to the Bullinn.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the bar during the whole of that evening? - A. Yes, I never go out; Cawdle went out backwards about nine o'clock, and came in again, and asked me for a glass of rum, for he had a pain in his bowels, and he would go home to bed directly; I said, what, would you go home so soon of a Saturday night, and he said, yes; Rudd staid some time after Cawdle was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. How many months ago was that Saturday you speak of? - A. Not one yet; three weeks next Saturday; every Saturday night, at ten o'clock, my work is booked; I remember well that it was the 1st of February that I booked my work at night.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was Saturday the 1st of February above all other Saturdays; - what day is this? - A. This is Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. It happens to be Friday, I believe? - A. Our Saturdays are always Friday night, or Saturday morning: on the Tuesday following I went into that house, and heard that they had been taken up; I said, bless me, can that be the man that I bought my gaters of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when Cawdle was taken up? - A. I heard it on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Rudd? - A. Only by seeing him that day, and once or twice before.</p>
               <p>Q. How many boxes did you sit off from them that night? - A. The box they sat in was the next to the bar, it was a box or two off.</p>
               <p>Q. How many else were there in that box? - A. I cannot say; there might be a shoe-maker, and a brewer's servant.</p>
               <p>Q. In the same box? - A. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you applied to about this? - A. I spoke it open in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you here to-day - did you tell the prisoners of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to them in jail? - A. No; Cawdle's mother came to me, and asked me if I was drinking with her sen on the Saturday; I said, no, I had not drank with him, I offered him a pint pot to drink, and he said he had a pain in his bowess.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no reason to know that this was the 1st of February but by your book? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Cawdle, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            : On the 30th of January, just before candle light, the prisoner came into the shop and asked the price of pork-sausages, and took up a hand of pork that was on the window-board, and gave it to another soldier that stood on the threshold of the door; the other soldier took it in both his hands, and ran up the lane; I went to pursue the other man, when the prisoner stopped me, and almost pushed me backwards; he asked me what I was in such a hurry about, he wanted some sausages; he stopped me from going after the man that had the pork, and therefore I detained him.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A. I was not drunk, I knew very well what I said and did; I had been at two or three public-houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did it happen? - A. I do not know the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you so drunk you could not tell that? - A. I am a stranger in the place; I have not been in town above a week; I met with the prisoners in the street, and they desired me to go into a house with them, which I did; I went with them into a public-house; I am sure the prisoners are the same women; we staid a few minutes; we had a glass of something a-piece; it was some wine-vaults; when we came out, I meant to go home into Wood-street, and I thought I was going the right way; and as I went along, one got before me and the other behind me, and stopped me; the prisoner Brown got her hand under my coat, and took out my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your watch in your sob? - A. No; in my waistcoat pocket; I thought it would be safer, with my great coat on. I felt it go, and I laid hold of her arm, and she directly gave it to the other woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you not have prevented her giving it to the other woman? - A. No; then the other woman gave it to Brown again directly; I called the watchman as hard as I could, and the watchman came and laid hold of them both, and took them to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they searched? - A. No; I saw Brown drop the watch, as they were taking them to the watch-house; Mr. Hancock shewed me the watch at the watch-house; I know it to be mine; it is marked G.M. in the outer-case and the inner-case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Agar. (Counsel for Johnston.) Q. According to this account, Johnston did nothing? - A. The other gave her the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, and she would not have it; she returned it again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear that Johnston ever offered to touch you? - A. She was behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. She never attempted to take your watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking a good deal? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, how many public houses had you been in? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon your oath, were you not in several public-houses, drinking with these women? - A. I had been in two.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, can you tell, within a pint, how much rum or brandy you had with them? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking before you met with them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Brown stood before you, did you know what she was about? - A. No, I did not; or I would not have suffered her to take it.</p>
               <p>- HANCOCK sworn. - I am a hosier, in Milk-street: Last Saturday night, I was coming home, after the clock struck twelve; when I came to the end of Mitre-court, I heard a violent outcry of, do not rob me, do not rob me; I had the came in my hand that I have now, and I stepped into the court, and saw the man struggling with the two woman at the bar, it was rather dark; there was another little man with them, Morley was calling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190050"/>out, that they had robbed him of his watch; the women began to call him fool, and said that he was drunk, and there was a scene of confusion; I enquired of the man who he was, and he said, he was a watchman; I then desired him to conduct them to the watch-house immediately; we got on with considerable difficulty to Aldermanbury, and there she dropped the watch down by her side; I picked it up, and went on with them to the watch-house; Morley there charged Brown with taking it from him; when it was communicated that I had the watch, he was asked if he should know it, he said, yes, it was marked G.M.; I produced the watch to the constable of the night, and the prosecutor claimed it; they were afterwards conveyed to Giltspur-street Compter, but they were very unruly both of them, and it was with very great difficulty that they were got there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. Q. Could you distinguish whether it was dropped by the prosecutor, or by me? - A. I did not see her hand; I saw it drop by her side.</p>
               <p>The WATCHMAN sworn. - I heard the prosecutor call, watch; I went up, and saw them scuffling together; I laid hold of Brown, and took her along, and the prosecutor took her along, as far as Lad-lane, and then the other watchman took her; he said, he had lost his watch, and they had it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Agar. Q. He was very drunk, was he not? - A. No, he did not stagger, nor nothing at all.</p>

He wanted me to take half-a-guinea to go home and sleep with me; he took us up Mitre-court, and behaved in a very rude impudent manner; then he said, he had lost his watch, at another public-house; we went to two or three public-houses, and had a glass of pepper-mint at each, and he drank brandy; I know nothing at all of the watch, it must have dropped from himself.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. There had been a bag of nails lost before? - A. Yes, I believe there had.</p>
               <p>Q. And there was a wicked rogue or two, of the names of Birchley and Berry, that said you had taken them? - A. I heard amlost as much.</p>
               <p>Q. That Birchley and Berry said you were the thief? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you would be up to them for that? - A. No; I don't know that I ever said such a word in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not swear that you would be revenged of them for saying you had stole the nails? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say about it? - A. I don't know that I said a word about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Charged with stealing a bag of nails and not say a word about it? - A. I did not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say about it when you were charged with it in the yard? - A. Upon my life I don't know that I heard them say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you would be revenged on them for it. - What makes you so long answering? - A. Upon my life, I hope you will excuse me, I am hard of hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you so long answering? - A. I know nothing about the nails.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been employed in the yard? - A. Six weeks, or two months.</p>

               <p>Q. Then I shrewdly guess that you were turned away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I have not a right to ask you whether you stole them, but, upon your oath, were you not turned away upon a charge of stealing bolts? - A. I was charged with stealing bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Hicks turned you away because you were charged with stealing them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, two months ago, you told him you would leave off your old tricks if he would take you again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were turned off, he brought you and the bolts together into the yard? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I was present when the man was taken; I am warehouse-man to Mr. Hicks: On the 19th of September, I was at tea in the accompting-house, adjoining the warehouse, and I heard Mr. Hicks call out, here is a thief in the house; I went out into the warehouse, and found Mr. Hicks, and Thomas Buckney in his custody; Mr. Hicks had a bottle of wine, the key of the cellar and a candle in his hand; Mr. Hicks asked the prisoner how he came to do it, he begged for mercy, and under the stairs, in the cellar, we found three bottles more, which he acknowledged to have taken out himself, and also the one which Mr. Hicks had in his hand; he desired a constable to be sent for; he came, and asked the prisoner for the keys of his box; he searched the box, and found in it a silver watch; he found no wine there, only an empty bottle; there were no keys in the box; the prisoner gave the keys to the constable, and there was a key, which Mr. Hicks said, was belonging to his wardrobe; the prisoner ran away after that; the bottles, and the whole of his property was put into the box by the constable, and sealed up, he is now dead; I saw the same box on Friday last, I opened it in the presence of Mr. Hicks, and Mr. Peill, it contained the same bottles, I took them out, and gave them to Mr. Hicks; I brought two of them with him.</p>
               <p>JOHN PEILL sworn. - I know nothing more than has been stated; I was not there the whole time, as I went for the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Hicks.) Do you know that to be your wine? - A. It appears so; these seals on the corks were put on where the wine was taken, there were no seals before, (tastes the wine;) this is port wine.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows. The situation to which I am reduced, does not weigh more heavy on me from any consequences that may affect myself, than the reflection that a family hitherto, without reproach, will be rendered miserable on my account, but as I know of no better amends in my power, than a true account of the transaction, I shall shortly state it; I had been employed by my master, in bottling some wine, and missed by some observations which were used, though from my present sense of my impropriety, I wish not to criminate other persons; I was certainly induced to secret two or three bottles of wine, to drink in the kitchen; I had never wronged him in any other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190056"/>instance whatever, and have severely suffered from that hour to this, for having given way to such a temptation; so heavily, however, do I feel the fault I have committed, that I have, although at large, surrendered myself to take my trial, and suffer any punishment I may deserve.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not your Lordship give that witness a particular caution, as to the person he would swear to? - A. Certainly; it was a very complicated examination, there being so many prisoners; and he, from his own account, had been in that state of intoxication, that he appeared to me incompetent to know any thing about it; he was perfectly sober at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. (To Horton.) Look round at those two women, and tell us which of them is the person that took your purse? - A. That is the woman.(Pointing to Duffey.)</p>

               <p>The CONSTABLE sworn. - On the 29th of January, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I had information that there was a pot-stealer gone to No. 6, in White's-alley, and that they were then in the act of melting pots down; I went and knocked at the door, which was opened by a woman; as soon as they heard my voice, the woman of the house came, and while I was making the nature of my business known to her, the prisoner was making her escape by me, out of the house, with those two quart pots, and the two pint pots, tied up in her apron; I stopped her, and took her into custody; they were not melting any thing down; this pot I took out of the privy; I took all the woman up; I searched the house, and found this iron ladle, which I suppose is for melting the pots down in; it was like an old iron shop, which, I think, is only to deceive people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you take them from me? - A. Upon my oath, I took the two quart pots, and two pint pots, from you, tied up in this apron. (The pots produced, and deposed to).</p>

I picked them up in Castle-street, in that blue apron; there were two quarts, and two pints, in that blue apron; I was going to this Mrs. Wild's that she should read them for me, because I cannot read or write; and then I was going to take them to the landlord's house; I did not know what was in the bundle as there is a just God in heaven.</p>

               <p>- SAMPSON sworn. - I am a constable: On Saturday the 25th of January, I and Reed were out together; going along Upper Thames-street, I observed the prisoner and three more men, near Mr. Bolt's warehouse; I observed the prisoner and one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190060"/>other go to the gate of the warehouse, and I saw the prisoner stoop, and then he came away and went up a court; it was so dark, we could not see whether he had any thing in his hand or not; then he came back again, and brought something from underneath the gateway, up the court, on the opposite side of the way; we stopped at a distance to watch their coming out of the court; after being up the court two or three minutes, the prisoner and another <rs id="t18000219-77-deflabel468" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. What he has said is very false; as soon as I came out of Mr. Bolt's, I went away home, and the man ran after me; my master was satisfied, and never knew me to take half a pound of sugar in my life; I have been there five years; I am innocent of the crime laid to my charge, I had no concern with it at all; I worked there all the week, my master searched me that night, and gave me my money, and I went away; I never offered to take a bit, and he never found a bit upon me.</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. Laycock and Tyler; I was in the shop at the time the whole business was transacting: On Wednesday the 5th of February. Knope came to the accompting-house, and told me Mrs. Watch had taken a settee; I told him to go behind the counter to Mr. Laycock; and I went to her, and took the flushing coat, and set it down in the workbook; she was then going home, and went towards the shop-door, which, as she opened, Mr. Laycock stopped her, and asked her what she had there; I don't know the answer she made, but he looked into her apron, which was tucked round her, covered with her red cloak; he opened it, and pulled out the article mentioned in the indictment; after that, I took her to the back part of the shop, and asked her for the duplicates of the three pair of trowsers we lost on the Tuesday; I found the duplicate of a pair of breeches upon her; I went next morning to the pawnbroker's, with the officer; I know them to be my master's property.</p>
