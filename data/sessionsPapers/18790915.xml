I am a gardener of Oxford Street, Crystal Palace Bead on 6th September I was at Dulwich Lane, there was an excursion of the Wentworth Ragged School there—I lost a purse in the gardens—it contained two little things that I have had 18 months or 2 years, what they call Hanover medals, and I think 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2 sixpences.</p>

I am Rector of Spitalfields—I have employed the prisoner for the last 10 months since he came out of prison—he had latterly the charge of Wentworth Street Bagged School and has been a messenger at the Rectory, and in paying bills and taking parcels—the offence he had committed had nothing to do with counterfeit coin—he had a character for honesty—he had charge el the soup kitchen, and always proved himself perfectly honest—he has had money entrusted to him week by week and day by day, and there was never the slightest inaccuracy—I believe he has really endeavoured to reform.</p>

When the man came in I had my hands up, but I was in custody of the first man, therefore it was impossible for him to see me strike her. It is all brought on by her bad conduct and committing adultery. I saw her go into a closet with my lodger and remain there for 10 minutes, and two nights afterwards she was there again. He is just turned 20, and she is 50. I pulled the door open and saw them, and two days afterwards she tried to get me into an asylum for insanity. I never struck her with the hammer, or I should have cut her to pieces.</p>

Hill or order, and endorsed by G.

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Hyde Side Terrace, Edmonton—I was formerly a wharfinger, in business at Red Lion Wharf and 3, Crane Wharf, Upper Thames Street—I was for ten years a member of the Court of Common Council—I have known Sir Francis Truscott about 22 or 23 years—I helped to get his father into the Court of Common Council, and afterwards himself—he was in the Court with me for the same ward, and afterwards he became an alderman—in 1867 I went abroad—I was in great difficulty with regard to some company; not money difficulty—I left Sir Francis Truscott</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150018"/>
               <p>to manage my affairs while I was away, and he had 10 per cent. for doing it—he had the control of my property entirely, and of my house and furniture—while I was away I received letters from him—I returned to this country in August, 1877—in the mean time I had been made a bank<lb/>rupt by the connivance of Sir Francis—I have had no personal dispute with Sir Francis since my return—I ceased to be on friendly terms with him long since, when I discovered him—I was not on friendly terms with him; that is, hardly strong enough—on 25th July I was living at 9, Hyde Side Terrace, Edmonton—Miss Smith was living with me—it is her house—she is not my housekeeper now; she was formerly—she retained from Spain with me—some time in the evening of 25th July there was a knock at the door—I went to the door, and took from the postman this post-card—I read it—it was just in the same state as it is now, but a little dirtier—I noticed the handwriting almost instantly, astonished at the card—an instant after, having read it perhaps twice through, I saw it was Truscott's—I took it to where Miss Smith was sitting and held it before her—she made a statement about it—I then ran out of the house to find the postman, angry—I did not see him; he had passed—I saw Mr. Ryde, and had the post-card with me—I showed it to another person as well on the instant—that same evening I went to the police-station and made inquiries—I showed the post-card to three persons that same evening—I showed it to a Mr. Baker and a Mr. Green—after showing it to them I went immediately to the post-office and showed it to Mr. Wragg, who keeps the post-office at Edmonton—I noticed that there was a portion of a red mark over the flourish on the card; Mr. Ryde and Mr. Baker and myself talked of it—I noticed that at the time—I called Mr. Ryde's attention to it—after showing it to him I went and inquired at the police-station, and I then on that same night compared the post-card with one letter of the defendant's—on the 29th I took the post-card to the Mansion House to Sir Charles Whetham—I afterwards went to Guildhall—a summons was not granted there, and I preferred a bill of indictment here at the last Session—from the knowledge I have of the defendant's handwriting I have not the slightest doubt that the post-card was written by him. Q. Is it in an ordinary handwriting or a feigned hand in your judgment A. Mixed—some of the letters are perfectly distinct, others are a little holder than he usually writes—there are one or two letters that I cannot speak positively to, but the bulk of them I can—I had not the least doubt from the time I received it up to the present time that it was written by the defendant—I produce some letters signed by the defendant—this is the one thai I first examined, dated 25th September, 1868 (<hi rend="italic">marked C</hi>)—that is written by the defendant and signed by him; it is addressed to Mr. William Clark—I don't think I have got the envelope of that letter—here is one envelope without a mark on it—there is nothing to identify it as the envelope of that letter—it came to me from Mr. Kay, the Queen's Counsel—this letter of the 5th August, 1868 (<hi rend="italic">marked A</hi>) is in the defendant's handwriting and signed by him; it is addressed to Mrs. Clark, the wife of Mr. William Clark; this is the envelope of that letter (<hi rend="italic">marked x</hi>)—I also produce a letter of 17th August, 1868, addressed to Mrs. Clark (<hi rend="italic">marked B</hi>)—I don't think this is the envelope, there are so many; I do not know whether it is—the letter is written by the defendant and signed by him—I also produce a letter, dated 7th November, 1868 (<hi rend="italic">marked D</hi>), addressed to Mr. Clark—I have not got the envelope—the letter is written and signed by the defendant—there is another letter, dated</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Clements here produced a number of document.</hi>) Amongst these there are a number of letters written by the defendant to me—here is one of July, 1868—I ceased writing to him at the end of 1868—the most recent is a letter of 15th February, 1869—there is not a great deal of writing in it—it is signed by the defendant, and is addressed to me—here is one letter of 24th, June, 1867, from the defendant to Miss Smith—that is in the defendant's writing—it is signed with initials—it has a bit of flourish at the end, but not similar to what he signs to his letters. (<hi rend="italic">The post-card was addressed to the witness, and contained the words</hi>, "Excuse an old friend mentioning to you, to put you on your guard, but you are being watched by the police."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I have not had any corre<lb/>spondence with the defendant since 1869—I have frequently seen his writing since; a seven years' law suit has brought his writing almost every day before me to be copied—I have none of his writing written by him since 1869—it was about 7.30 in the evening of 25th July that I received the post-card—later in the evening I compared it with this letter of 25th September, that comparison tended to convince me that the post-card was the defendant's writing—I was convinced before, but on that comparison I had not the least doubt about it—before I made the comparison I showed the post-card on the instant, first to Mr. Ryde, a neighbour, who lives a few doors from where I was residing—I also showed it to Mr. Baker, a neigh<lb/>bour, and to Mr. Green—I then went to the post-office—I showed it to Miss Smith before I went to the post-office—I was very angry at having imputed to me that I was watched by the police—under all the circum<lb/>stances, considering that he has robbed me considerably, it was a most serious imputation to say that I was being watched—it angered me; I felt angry—I was exceedingly reluctant that anybody should suppose I was being watched by the police or anybody else—I showed the post-card to Mr. Green, Mr. Baker, and Mr. Ryde because they knew from me how I had been treated by the defendant; that was the reason; to convince them how shamefully he was treating me; not satisfied with my. money he attacks my character—Alderman Cotton was presiding at Guildhall at my first application there—Mr. Martin, the clerk, was there—Sir Robert Garden was the Alderman presiding on the 31st, when the summons was refused—they did not tell me that they declined to grant the summons because in their opinion the writing was not the defendant's—Mr. Martin did not tell me that the writing was not the defendant's—the first person I saw on the Tuesday morning was Sir Charles Whetham, the Lord</p>

Did not you know that if you proceeded against the defendant civilly he would be permitted to give his evidence on oath, and that if you pro<lb/>ceeded against him criminally he would not be permitted by the rules of law to give any evidence at all—did not you know that?—A. It did not occur to me, it never crossed my mind, on my oath; nor had I any conversation on such a subject; I went away to Mr. Humphreys—I really don't think I thought much about it, only that I was very much annoyed—I know Mr. Thomas Flight Smith and his father, Mr. Thomas James Smith—they are wholesale stationers, and carry on their business in Queen Street, Cheapside—Sir Francis Truscott introduced them to me about 15 years ago as near as</p>

               <p>I can guess—I have not been intimate with them, not out of their business—I don't know where they reside—I know their place of business, that is all—I have been in the habit of calling there pretty frequently and talking to them about my affairs—there was that sort of friendship—I considered they were friends of mine; that they were friendly to me—I called on them on 12th August, and again on the 15th—on 28th August I received a letter from the father to call when I was next in town, and on the 29th I called in Queen Street; and Mr. Smith, senior, said "Kearns, if I were to say my son wrote that card what would you say to it?"—I said "I should say it was a conspiracy between him and Truscott"—he told me that his son had written to him from Germany—he told me he was told to say by his son that he was the delinquent, that his son was in Germany, but not with Truscott, and that he had written to him two days ago, which would make it the 27th—that was what passed—I did not ask to see the letter, but he said "I can show you the letter," and he turned as if to show it me—I held my hand for it, and then he said "No, I have not got it"—he said "Then you don't believe it"—I said "No, I don't, I know the handwriting too well; it must be a question for a jury"—a day or two after that I saw the affidavit of Mr. Thomas Flight Smith, swearing that it was his handwriting; still I did not believe him—I never saw the handwriting of Mr. Thomas Flight Smith—he never wrote to me—it occurred to me to get to see some letters of his, but I did not know how to get them—I had no opportunity of getting them—I did not know his friends—I did not ask his father to show me some of his son's handwriting—I have not seen them since—if he wrote it, would he not have come to me, instead of going to the solicitor of the defendant?—the card is exactly in the same condition as it was when I received it—I do not observe any alteration. Q. Are you in the habit when you receive letters from people of underscoring some of the words; now, just think? A. I need not think, I never did such a thing—I think I may swear that I never did such a thing in my life—I went among other persons to Major Bowman, of the City police—Col. Fraser is the head, the Commissioner, and Major Bowman is the second in command under him—I showed the post-card to Major Bowman and a letter as well; that was on Saturday the 26th, as I received it on the 25th—on the Saturday morning I went to Major Bowman and showed him the card and one of Truscott's letters—when I showed it to him it was exactly in the same state in which it is now—on the Friday when I first received it I went to the local police and showed it to them—I suppose it was to some inspector—I don't remember his name—in my view this is like the style of the defendant's writing—it is not very much disguised—it is hardly disguised—it was not disguised from me, not so as to deceive me for a moment—I have expressed myself strongly against the defendant—I did not tell Mr. Thomas Flight Smith that I had been waiting for vengeance for 11 years, and I would have it now; nothing of the sort—I have said that as lorg as I had life I would take every legitimate and legal course to obtain the property he had robbed me of, and that when the time came I would prosecute him for perjury that he had committed in the Court of Bankruptcy—I told Mr. Smith that—I did not tell him that if I could help it the defendant should never be Lord Mayor—how could I?—you would not perhaps wish me to explain what occurred—I left England on 26th March, 1867—I was chair<lb/>man of the Anglo-Danubian Navigation Company—at the time I left I was,</p>

               <p>not indebted to a considerable extent—that is one of my hardships—I was made a bankrupt on 20th May, 1867, my agent not appearing for me and having destroyed or intercepted the notice of adjudication, which I never got, I never surrendered under my bankruptcy—I was not a bankrupt, and I have not surrendered—I can't answer whether I was declared an outlaw, unless you allow me to explain—I don't know whether I was declared an outlaw—a gentleman named Burke said he had a consider<lb/>able claim on my estate—he had been connected with me in the business relating to the Anglo-Danubian Navigation Company—he has been seeking to prove on my estate—the amount for which he should prove was referred to Mr. Clegg, a member of the firm of Messrs. Quilter, Ball, and Co.—I did not attend a meeting before that gentleman in July—I was there—the order of the Registrar was in February, and they have done nothing but once up to to-day—I think the meeting was about 25th July—I was not informed by anybody at Quilter, Ball's, that my proceedings would be watched, or that I would be watched—there was not an angry discussion between me and Mr. Crawford, the solicitor for the defendant—there was a discussion—I showed him a paper—he did not tell me that he would have me watched or anything to that effect; nothing of the sort, nor did anybody else say anything about it—a clerk of Mr. Burke's was standing in the room at the time—Mr. Hayling was there—Mr. Williams, a clerk of Mr. Clement's, was not there—he had left—it was a long time before I received the post-card that the discussion with Mr. Crawford took place—there was no angry discussion—I only told Crawford that he was a clever little fellow—that was months before I received the post-card—Mr. Crawford represented Mr. Burke and Sir Francis Truscott—he did not say anything to me to this effect, "I know you have money and I intend to have some of it, and I will watch you till I ascertain where it is"—I did not say "I know that I have and I intend to stick to it"—on my oath nothing of the sort—no such discussion ever occurred—I was joking him about his bye play; about what had occurred with Mr. Burke, in perfectly good feeling—when I went away I went to Spain—I did not remain there entirely from March, 1867, till I returned to England, I did principally—I returned to England in August, 1877.</p>

Smith were introduced to me by the defendant; they were friends of his; I knew them through him—Mr. Smith senior did not show me the letter which he said he had received from his son abroad—he said "I have a letter I will show you," and he looked round and added "No, I have not got it"—I have never seen it; it has never been produced to my knowledge—I went abroad in March, 1867—I did not hear of my bankruptcy until after it had occurred—I was made a bankrupt without my knowledge—I met the defendant in the October following in Switzerland, by appointment, and he told me of the bankruptcy, and that he would have it immediately put to rights; that it was nothing—the ordinary time for surrendering had</p>

               <p>then gone by—I conversed with him on the subject of the bankruptcy—not a word was said at the Mansion House or at Guildhall when Alderman Cotton was sitting, as to the post-card not being in the handwriting of the defendant—the same clerk, Mr. Martin, was there on the 30th and on the 31st—Alderman Carden was there on the 31st—on the first day I under<lb/>stood it was a question of jurisdiction only—on the second day we attended for the decision of the question of jurisdiction—Mr. Martin came to Mr. Humphreys and myself to ask us into the Alderman's room; on entering the room Alderman Carden was putting his cloak on, and said "Good morning, Mr. Kearns;" "Good morning, Sir Robert;" he said "I don't know that this is Truscott's writing; I am late in the Court"—on that Mr. Humphreys said, "Sir Robert, we did not come to you for evidence; we come to you for a summons"—he said "Oh, I don't know anything about it," or something of that sort, "and I am late in Court"—I think Mr. Humphreys also said to Mr. Martin that they were paving the way for a paid magistracy—my attention was not called at that time to any specific document for me to compare with the post-card; no document was shown to me; I did not take one in my hand and look at it—at the further end of the table I saw a paper lying upside down, and I saw Truscott's name and his sign manual under it, but it was not shown to me—I did not take it into my hand—notwithstanding Mr. Thomas Flight Smith's statement that this card was written by him, I have not the slightest doubt of its being written by the defendant—I have no writing of Mr. Smith's—I never saw his writing.</p>

Simply quite impossible—I had not seen him for some weeks before or some weeks afterwards—Mr. Kearns said to me that Sir Francis Truscott never should be Lord Mayor—the next time that I saw the post-card was at the office of Mr. Humphreys, the solicitor for the prosecution—that is the only time that I have seen it since—I forget the date of that—it was about the 25th August, two or three weeks ago—I only saw it that once—since then I have been asked by Mr. Crawford to write a post-card from my memory as well as I could, and I have done so on two occasions—these are the two (<hi rend="italic">marked Y and Z</hi>)—I wrote Y, it might be about a week ago, and the other I wrote this morning—thoy were written naturally from my own head and memory of what I had written of to Mr. Kearns.</p>

               <p>opinion the flourish on the post-card is copied from the flourish in these letters—I did not make the flourish, to the best of my belief—on my cath I don't believe I made that flourish—if I am to swear one way or the other I should swear I did not make it—must I answer the question, because if so I must take my oath that I did not—I don't believe I did make that flourish—my belief is that I did not make it—on my oath I believe I did not make it—I have answered the question as nearly as I can—on my oath I believe I did not make it—I shall decline to answer further—I never did make a flourish like that—it is no use my answering any more upon the matter—I can swear to the best of my recollection and belief I did not make it—I shall not say more than I have done, and that is the truth—I say my recollection is not so strong as to pledge my absolute oath, still I believe I did not put it—I don't say I may have put it; I did not put it; I may not have put it on—I see the flourish after Sir Francis Truscott's signature in his letters—it seems very similar to the flourish on the post<lb/>card—in my judgment it is an imitation—I am not certain whether I under<lb/>scored the words "watched by the police"—I may and I may not have dona so—to tfie best of my memory I don't think I did, but I really could not swear one way or the other—I have never been to No. 9, Hyde Side Terrace, Edmonton—that address was given to me, at least I saw it on a pamphlet issued by Mr. Kearns—the writing on the post-card does certainly not resemble the defendant's at all—it has never been remarked that I write like the defendant—I do not see any similarity whatever to the defendant's writing in it, and no one knowing my handwriting would say there was—I went to Mr. Humphrey's office to see the post-card—I made an affidavit first, and saw it there afterwards—I was there about 10 minutes I suppose—I don't know whether an expert consulted by the defendant made a copy of the post-card—I did not see any copy—I believe I posted the post-card myself—yes, I did in Queen Victoria Street—I believe I carried it in my hand and posted it—I wrote these two post-cards from memory—I had no copy—I believe I wrote them word for word—I have not examined them together—I knew what I had written—one was written here this morning—I knew what I had written, and I put it down—I put no flourish to this—I have no objection to write a post-card now in Court (<hi rend="italic">the witness did so</hi>)—I have written four post-cards now altogether, these two, this one, and the original, and they are the last four I shall write—Have I spelt "Side" with a Y? I wrote it in such a great hurry; I will write another if you like, and that will make five—these are not scored under, and there is no flourish and no punctuation, and it is not my custom to do so—I am not in the habit of writing post-cards—sometimes in business matters and little things I do—I think this is the first libellous post-card I have ever written—sometimes I initial them, sometimes I do not.</p>

               <p>for many years—I have also known Mr. Kearns for some years—in the early part of the year, prior to May and July, he had been in the habit of coming to my counting house and conversing with me on his affairs—I am well acquainted with the handwriting of Sir Francis Truscott—this post-card is not his handwriting; it is the handwriting of my son—these three other post-cards are also in my son's handwriting—I remember my son going abroad to Wildbad, in Germany, with his wife—I received a letter from has wife in the first instance on the subject of the post-card, and then afterwards from him—I have not got that letter—the fact is I destroyed it—I had several letters from him and several letters from his wife—I am not in the habit of keeping private letters, and I destroyed that letter amongst others—in consequence of the communication I received from my son I sent to Mr. Kearns, and he came to my counting house—I said "Mr. Kearns, there is no doubt who is the sender of this post-card; it is quite useless of you accusing Sir Francis Truscott of having done so—it emanated from tint counting house and was written by my son"—he said "he did not believe it—I said "It is the fact"—he said "It is Sir Francis Truscott's writing, and I will swear it"—I said "I will swear it is not"—he said there was a conspiracy against him—some few words passed—I did not particularly lose my temper—he just put his hand on the desk and said "I don't believe it,' put on his hat and away he went—I did not offer to show him the letter I had received from my son—I did not look for it—I don't think I kept ii 24, hours after receiving it—I did not think it was important—it is important—I remember destroying it—I tore it up with other letters—I have got the post-card before me—it is not in the slightest degree like the defendant's handwriting; not a bit—nobody could say it was, without a purpose—the flourish in the letters A, B, C, D, is a good deal like the flourish on the post-card—I don't know that I have ever seen many letters of Sir Francis Truscott's, but I really should not recollect whether he always made a flourish or not—I know one thing that my son never makes a flourish—I have a letter here of my son's, the only one I could find; and I think that will show his handwriting (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I received it from my son on the 22nd May, 1878—that is the only one I could find, and I found it promiscuously.

I have been acquainted with Sir Francis Truscott about 10 or 12 years—I have known him intimately, and know his handwriting perfectly—I also know Mr. Thomas Flight Smith, and know his handwriting perfectly—this post-card is certainly not in Sir Francis Truscott's writing—it is in the handwriting of Mr. Smith, junior—I could select it out of a 100 post-cards written in the character of their respective hands—these other post-cards are in the handwriting of Mr. Smith—I have known Sir Francis Truscott a great many years—he has borne a very high character.</p>

               <p>Fortesque, "Your friend is coming back"—he said, "I have no friend"—I said, "You must come along with us," meaning Trafford, a constable, and myself—we then took him into the bank—I said, "Will you give me your card?"—he said, "I have not got one"—I said, "Will you give me your name and address?"—he said, "I am a gentleman"—I said, "What an you?" and he repeated "I am a gentleman"—I said, "What are you doing down here?"—he said, "I have an appointment with a lady—I don't understand why I am detained—what are you?"—I said, "We belong to the police"—he said, "I thought it was something of that sort—I can't understand why I am detained"—I said, "You will be charged with being concerned in uttering a forged cheque at this bank—you will have to go to the police station"—he made no remark on that—I left him in charge of Trafford and went in a room in the bank where Bangham was in conversa<lb/>tion with Outram—I said to him, "Where were you going to take the money?"—he said, "To George Street"—I said, "Where is Drew?"—he said, "I don't know, I have to meet him at Hun? mum's Hotel, Covent Garden, at 11 this morning, in the coffee room"—I believe this is the letter he showed me.

Yours obediently, H. W. Bangham.") This blue counterfoil book is called the establishment licence book—Bangham wrote licence forms in this book—there are numerous entries of his here—"H. G. Griffiths, Belmont House, Hampstead"—the figures are in Bangham's handwriting—"James Jordan "is very similar to his handwriting—the writing in the body of this cheque signed James Jordan does not appear to be the same writing as the signature—the "Albert Drew "is evidently the same, written by the same person as the James Jordan—the money is not—this letter, "Sir,—In reply to your ad<lb/>vertisement," is to the best of my belief in his writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, at 46, Old Montague Street, Whitecliapel—I was walking down Christian Street on 17th August at 1 a.m.—there was a crowd there looking at a fire, and I was struck on the hat by McManus—I said, "Don't tackle me, I've got nothing about me"—Smith then tripped me up and struck me on the hip, and Sheen held me by the throat—I was thrown down and Ayris held me down by the throat—Gregory was kneeling on me and called out, "Back him," and Smith kicked me on the hip, McManus holding my legs—my trousers pocket in torn out, it contained five keys—a tobacco pouch, pipe and handkerchief, were taken from my coat pocket, and two sixpences from my waistcoat—my watch was in a fob-pocket in my. trousers and I kept my hand on it, and held Smith with the other hand—I called "Police," and "Murder,' till the police came—the others ran away—about 7 p.m. on the Sunday a number of men were shown to me at Leman Street Police Station—I made a mistake first, but afterwards picked out McManus—I had only seen his side face before, but on getting in front of him I picked him out, and I afterwards picked out Sheen—I did not know McManus before, but have no doubt about him—I do not know who took the money out of my pocket—I picked out Gregory on the following Saturday at the Commercial Street Police Station.</p>

At 10.30 on the Sunday night I was in Clarke Street, Stepney, with Inspector Wildey—I saw McManus, and told him I should take him in custody on suspicion of being concerned with others in robbing the prosecutor at a fire in Christian Street oh Saturday night—he said "I was at Wandsworth at 11 o'clock, and slept all night in 'Jack's Hole' (John's Place) with my wife"—on getting to Commercial Road he became very violent, and struggled and kicked, and with the assistance of Inspector Wildey and other constables I got him to the Leman Street station, where he was placed among seven or eight other men and the prosecutor was sent for—he pointed out another man first, but after looking again he identified McManus, and he was also identified by another man who is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Ridley, of 1, Finlay Court, Old Street, St. Luke's—the prisoner and his wife lived at 134, Old Street, immediately opposite—from my window I could see half of their room; my room is on the second floor, and so is theirs—the width of the street is about four yards—on Monday, 18th August, at 1.15, I was at my window; it was open, and so was the prisoner's; I could see the dinner on the table in his room—I saw him take a chair and sit down at the table; his wife was standing in front of him—I heard them quarrelling, but could not hear what they said—after they had been quarrelling some little time I saw the prisoner strike his wife in the face with his open hand, one blow—she ran towards the window—he struck her again three or four times in the face and head with his fist and his open hand—she did nothing in return—he then picked up this piece of wood (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the side of the fireplace, ana jobbed her with it three or lour times in the side—she then picked a plate off the table and threw at him; it did not hit him; it struck the window-ledge—she said "I don't care a b—; you brute, you are slowly murdering me"—I halloed to him from the window, "You brutal fellow, why do you illtreat the. woman like that"—then he threw the wood down and struck her again with his hand—she reeled on one side, and then he shut the window and looked over the top of the curtain, and I could not see any more—the neigh<lb/>bours were all out at their doors by this time, hearing the noise—at 20 minutes to 3 the prisoner came out—I had seen the deceased go in with the dinner at about 10 minutes to 12; she appeared to be quite sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was up at my window then—I did not speak to her—I could only see half across the room; I have not been in the room since—the fireplace was in the middle of the room opposite the window—I could see the fireplace; I saw the prisoner stoop and pick up the piece of wood from the floor—the deceased had not moved when he first</p>

I am a rag merchant and furniture dealer, and am landlord of the house where the prisoner lives—on Monday evening, 18th August, between 7 and 8, I saw the prisoner come up the court from the house—I did not see him again that evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see his wife that day—she was a very drunken woman; she was nearly always so during the four weeks she was my tenant—the prisoner used to go out to his work in the morning, and she used to go out afterwards and get drunk, and then come home and lis about; that was her usual habit—he was a very regular man—I never saw him the worse for drink.</p>

On 20th August I went with Sergeant Canham to 134, Old Street, to the second-floor back room occupied by the prisoner and his wife—I found this piece of wood behind the door in the bedroom—that same night I searched for the prisoner, and found him in bed at 41, Baldwin Street—I asked what his name was—he said Gibson—I said I should take him into custody on suspicion of murdering his wife—he said, "I never murdered her; all the injuries she has received she got by falling about; I have got my subpoena to attend the inquest to-morrow morning; you might as well let me have my sleep out, for I should have been there; she was a very drunken woman, and it is a very bad job"—I had known her for several years as a drunken, dissi<lb/>pated woman—she had been convicted several times of pot-stealing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She had only been out about five weeks; she had 21 days for having a quantity of melted pewter in her possession—I have seen her very drunk; I have not seen her in fits—she was rather decrepid in the feet—she was about 45 or 50 years of age—the room where I found the prisoner was his son's room.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector G</hi>). On 22nd August I went to Mrs. Ridley's room, and from her window could see into the prisoner's room, as she has stated—I then went to the prisoner's room—I saw on the ceiling a black mark, such as would be produced by this piece of charred wood—I found three pieces of a broken plate there—I had known the deceased as a woman of drunken, dissipated habits. Eugene Yarrow. I am surgeon to the G Division of Police, and live at 87, Old Street Road—on 18th August, about a quarter past 9, I was called by the prisoner and another man to 134, Old Street—the prisoner said his wife was very ill, and would I come and see her—I asked him if she was sober—he said "She is very ill, and I think getting cold"—I went and found her lying on the mattress, dead—in my opinion she had been dead four, five, or six hours; the extremities were quite cold—she was about 52 or 53 years of age—I made post-mortem examination—the cause of death was effusion of blood on the brain, the result of a blow or an injury to the head—there was a contused wound right on the top of the head—this piece of wood would produce such a wound—she appeared to have been lifted on to the bed from the clothes being disordered, and from the huddled manner in which the body lay—the prisoner went up into the room with me—I said to him, "She is dead"—he said "You don't mean to say she has gone to her last home," and he lifted the body up, put his arms round her, and called out "Lizzie dear"—I asked him when he last saw her alive—he said at dinner-time—I said "Where did you leave her?"—he said "Where she is now"—I asked if she had been</p>

               <p>drinking—he said "I do not know; we had a few words, and both lost our temper"—he was slightly under the influence of drik—he came to me next morning, and asked if I could give him a certificate—I told him there would have to be an inquest, and that I had informed the Coroner's officer—on the post-mortem I found a great number of bruises in different parts of the body; the most recent was a very large one on the right side of the abdomen, by the side of the navel, about as large as the top of a teacup—it is not impossible that a fall might have caused the wound on the head—there was an iron bedstead in the room; if she had fallen head foremost against that it might have caused it—I had known her for some years as a drunken woman—I have attended her at the police station when drunk, and I was once called to her in the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been called to her by the police on many occasions—I never attended her for fits—I have seen her when she was said to be in fits, but they were fits of drunkenness—the cause of death was apoplexy, or effusion of blood—that does sometimes occur without any external injury—there was no outward wound; the contusion was under the skin, only visible when the scalp was removed—drunkenness would be a predisposing cause to the effusion.</p>

               <p>making for the wooden gate; one of them undid the bolt and opened the gate, and I rushed at them to catch them, and while two of them were getting through the iron gate the prisoner stood to defend them—they squeezed themselves through a broken bar in the gate, and as I came up to them the prisoner stood up with a knife or instrument in his hand, and struck at me and cut my hand—I struck him on the head with the lantern more than once, and he squeezed through the gate and I followed him—the railings and gate had been painted that afternoon—two hats were picked up—they went to the left and ran down Bonner Road, and I followed without losing sight of them—when I got opposite the public-house at the corner, one of the men turned round and said "If you come any further I will murder you"—I continued the pursuit, and kept them in sight until I found myself getting exhausted some little distance up Bishop's Road, which leads to the corner of Waterloo Road, where I met Field and Tyerman, to whom I made a communication—the three men were still in sight and going down Waterloo Road—I discontinued the pursuit, and Tyerman ran after them—my head was bleeding very much, and I went to the doctor's to have it dressed, and then went to the police-station, and the prisoner was brought in—I said in his presence to the constable, "I do not seem to recognise the man, but if any of those men have paint on their hands or coats they an the men I followed"—there were a number of men—we found paint on the prisoner's hands and coat of the same colour as that on my clothes, and I fancied I recognised him—he was bleeding from the head—I recognised him at Worship Street Police-court as a workman named Sparrow, who was formerly in the employment of our firm, and left in July, 1877, at which time the safe was kept in the factory near the door where the men ware crouching—I examined that door, and it was partially broken away, and had marks of an instrument upon it—my head was very badly injured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The two men were 100 yards from me when I gave up the chase—I was nearer during the pursuit—at the station seven or eight men were shown to me—the prisoner was amongst them—I said I thought I saw the man, and I pointed out a man, but it was not the prisoner—I was then asked again by the officer, and I pointed him out—I then said "Oh, search if there is paint," and I identified the prisoner from the paint and from his clothes and general appearance—there were several with similar coats—the other man I picked out wore a similar coat—I believe he is married, but do not know his wife, or that her maiden name is Welch, but I believe it to be so—I do not know that he has a stall in Smithfield Market as a brush dealer—I believe he is engaged in the trade, but never heard that he was provided by his brother with tools to carry on his business.</p>

Pietri, it being a debt due from the funds of the Empire; for that reason I addressed myself to him to complete the pay ment which M. Pietri and Count Clery had commenced. I had received the sum of 2.000 francs, which is not a sum given away in charity. Later on a sum of 20 I was paid to me by M, Pietri, which sum I did not accept as charity. As to the letter, I did not wish M. Pietri any harm, and beg it may be considered as null and void; all I want is to go back to France. The threats I used were used, by me only for the purpose of drawing M. Pietri's attention towards me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of the Fulham Infirmary—on Tuesday, 15th August, I was called up to see a woman named Alice "Woodrow—I found her in labour—she was carried into the ward and confined within an hour and a half or two hours—she was delivered of a healthy child—it is alive now—she got well through her confinement, although it was a cross birth—I saw her again the same night, and found her very well—about the second day she began to droop, and complained of an increase of pain which she had described at first over the ovary—she was properly treated with appropriate remedies—she got worse and worse, and died on the evening of 23rd—I made a post-mortem examina<lb/>tion—the body was that of a healthy, well-nourished person; all the internal organs were healthy, but suppuration had taken place over both ovaries—one had already buret, and had set up recent peritonitis—the second one bunt under my hand—I could not attribute it to natural causes—I never saw natural causes give rise to such a state—I think violence of some kind must have been done to her, a direct blow or coming in contact with a sharp angle—I don't think a fall was likely to have produced it—it might—the rupture of the ovary was the immediate cause of death and external violence would have caused that—if she had thrown herself about in any violent way that might lead to injury of the ovaries—it might be caused in a struggle and fight, but I should have expected to find more general results, and not so localised as I did—a fall four days previous to death might have caused what I have described in a woman far advanced in pregnancy, or a straining and tumbling about might have done it—it is a case in which, I cannot give any positive evidence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am deputy at a lodging-house, 34, Milne Street, where the prisoner and the deceased lodged—on Saturday, 2nd August, a dispute arose between them—the deceased got hold of the prisoner, and threw her on the floor, and punched her—they got up, and had their hands in each other's hair—some of the lodgers in the kitchen separated them, and they went at it again—the prisoner struck the deceased, who fell, striking her head against the side of the stool, and broke her neck, dying directly.</p>

I am the wife of George Holloway—I lived then at 34, Milne Street—I heard the two women quarrelling about something that was thought to be lost by the person who does the cleaning there, and the prisoner had had a little to drink, and commenced arguing upstairs with Ann Richards—the latter came down into the kitchen saying when she came down "I cannot stay in my room, as that person intends to quarrel"—the prisoner came into the kitchen, and began to quarrel again, and Richards said the prisoner had had a drop to drink she said "If I have, I don't keep a fancy man"—Richards said "Nor do I," and something passed, but what I don't know, and Richards got up to strike the prisoner—the prisoner got up as quick as Richards, and they struggled in the middle of the kitchen and fell together, and some one called out "Don't hit the woman when she is down"—they got up, and Richards stood in the middle of the kitchen—she didn't then attempt to return the prisoner's blow, but the prisoner hit her again in retaliation, took her hair, which she wore long down her back, threw her down, and fell on top of her—Richards's head must have struck the stool—I un<lb/>loosed the prisoner's hands out of Richards's hair—I then said "Ann it in a fit," as she commenced to struggle—we carried her into the yard, and the doctor pronounced her dead.</p>

Cross-examined. I was about 20 or 30 yards from them when I saw them jump over the wall—the third man, who has not been caught, was running in front when Shehan dropped the coats—all the men ran in the same direction down the towing-path—they could not get out till they had run some distance to the bridge—the towing path is open to the public.</p>

Shortly after 9 p.m. on 7th Angust I saw a four-wheel cab stop at 79, Paul Street—Burke is the occupier of the house—Wilder and Burke brought out some rolls of carpet, which they pot into the cab—I told Burke I belonged to the police and asked him what he had got in the cab—he made no answer—I repeated the question several times and he said, "Only some stuff to sell for a man"—I had received on 5th August information of this and other burglaries in the neighbourhood and I watched Burke's place on the night of the 7th, having previously written him a letter the same night and saw it delivered to Burke in hi shop—shortly after my messenger left I saw Burke come out of the door and look excitedly up and down the street—he went inside and Wilder came out and returned with the four-wheeled cab and they put several bundles in and Wilder got inside and Burke on the box, and the cab drove off and I stopped it—the cab was then driven to Old Street Police Station, and Mr. Knott was sent for and identified the carpet as part of the proceeds of the burglary—after the charge had been taken down I returned with Constable Bandall to Burke's shop and found some silk and satin in a box under the window, and a backgammon work-table (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which has been since identified by Mr. Stringer, of 81, Curtain Road, from whom I had received a complaint—I found also some plates of silvered glass in the shop and cellar, which I have shown to Mr. Sanders, of Phipps Street; and in the cellar another backgammon table, which I have shown to Mr. Schwier of City Road, from whom I had received a complaint—on my return to the station I said to Burke, "I have found a quantity of silk and satin and some bed-ticking and some backgammon worktables, at your shop"—he said the silk was some sample patterns he had bought from a traveller, and the bed-ticking he had had by him for years, and the tables he bought from a man at the door—I searched him and found 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. upon him.</p>

I am only engaged for Mr. Burke"—I think the hour when the burglary was committed was mentioned at the station before Wilder, but I did not hear him say anything about it—he said he could prove he was sleeping at home every night—I helped to search Burke's place and found this glazier's diamond (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in a drawer with a key in it in the shop—I have shown it to Mr. Lang, of 44, Charlotte Street, who had made a complaint to me</p>

On 7th August I went with another I officer and Mr. Fisher with a search warrant to the prisoner's shop, 55, Hare Street, Bethnal Green—the name over the door was "Goodyear, I hosier and haberdasher"—I saw a female in the shop—Mr. Fisher I picked up this piece of feather trimming behind the counter—I went I upstairs, through a private passage, into the bedroom, and there found this I box of feather trimming (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I brought it down into the shop to Mr. Fisher, and he identified it—the prisoner's son was in bed—I inquired I for his father; he took me to the Hop Pole, in Whitechapel, where I saw the prisoner—I said "I am a police officer, I want to speak to you"—he came out and said "What is it all about?"—I said "I have a warrant to 1 search your premises, and have found a quantity of stolen goods there"—I I took him back and showed them to him—he said "Well, I suppose I have the invoice somewhere, let us have a look"—we looked, but failed to find one—he then said "My wife carries on the business, I suppose she know all about it"—I said "I believe you have carried on the business here for the last three months"—he said "That is so"—he said at the station "Everybody knows I could not be guilty of anything of this kind."</p>

I am a house decorator at 16, Dudley Street—on Wednesday night, 20th August, shortly before 12 o'clock, I had just left the theatre door and was crossing into Porter Street, when the prisoner, who was behind me, called out "Make haste here, Bill"—I turned round and saw him standing with his back to the shutters of a shop, and as I walked on I received a blow on the back of my neck from behind on the right, and fell on my right elbow on the kerb—a man put his knees on my elbow and held me by the throat, and another man was leaning on my knees and held me down while the prisoner, leaning over, tried to get the chain from my waistcoat—I got my hand free and held the watch; the prisoner held the chain and pulled it, but could not get it—he then said "Boot the b—," and I was kicked, and let go the watch, and they took it away—I got up and ran as far as I could in great pain from my side, and saw the back of the prisoner turn down in the mews on the left—a gas lamp was projecting at the corner and I saw the light thrown distinctly on his back—I saw him next on the Friday night, standing at the door of a public-house—I immediately recognised him, fetched a constable, and gave him in charge—he said "You have made a mistake," and when he spoke I recognised his voice—I have not seen my watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl, and lodge at 18, Albert Street, Shadwell—on 29th August I was at home; about 7 o'clock the prisoner came with three other men—the third man was drunk; I don't know his name; he went to sleep; the second man was sober; his name is Nicolas Michaels, or Carealis—the prisoner sent for some beer; I fetched it; after drink<lb/>ing that he took the jug to fetch some more; we all had a share of the first beer, not the man that was drunk, he was asleep all the time, but I and the I prisoner and Carealis—when the prisoner returned with the beer he brought another man with him, an Italian, and introduced him as his cousin; it was Salvatori Segansio—the prisoner called me out into the passage and asked. me what they put in the drink to make them drunk—I said I did not know—he said the Italian had 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon him, and he wished to make him drank and rob him—I told him he should do no such a thing there; if he did I should tell the police—he said "All right, I won't do it"—I then went out to fetch some more beer—we all had share of that too; I gave Carealis a glass; he drank it, and I gave a glass to Segansio; he drank the best part of it—I saw the prisoner stir something up in the glass with a piece of paper—I had given a glass of ale to Segansio, and I was pouring some beer into another glass; that was when I saw the prisoner stirring something with the piece of paper; that was in Segansio's glass—the prisoner did not say anything; I watched him for a minute; he gave it to Segansio and told him to drink it; I saw him drink it, and I said "All right"—I meant that I was going out to tell the police—I had a glass in my hand; I put it down to walk out, and before I had time to move from the table the prisoner took a revolver from his pocket and said "Look here," pointed it to me, and fired—I was standing at the corner of the table, facing the prisoner, with my back towards the fireplace; he was sitting in a chair on the other side of the table—I moved my head on one side as he fired; I heard the smash of glass behind me—I heard a whizzing noise as something passed my head—I ran out and into the next house but one, No. 20—the prisoner followed me—I ran upstairs into the front room; the door was open; I shut it after me—the prisoner called for me to come down, saying "Come down; I won't hurt you"—I said "No"—he tried to open the door—the mistress of the house came running to the foot of the stairs, and called up the stairs "Who</p>

               <p>is there? come down; I don't allow any one in my house"—the prisoner went down directly—as soon as I saw him get out into the street I ran out—I met a constable coming down the street, and I gave the prisoner in charge—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the revolver—the prisoner had been drinking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate that he was drunk—I have known him about thirteen months, not five or six years—he is a seaman; he has been in the habit of visiting me; he slept with me on the night of the 28th—we had all been drinking together on the night of the 29th; he came in with two Greeks—he is himself a Greek—two mugs of beer had been drunk before the Italian came—it was when the prisoner went out the third time that he brought in the Italian—there were then four men in the room—the Italian was sitting against the prisoner—the prisoner called me out of the room into the passage when he spoke about making the man drunk—I gave the Italian a glass of beer—the prisoner gave the beer to him and told him to drink it, and he did drink it; that was the glass of beer I gave him—the prisoner took the glass up; I thought he was going to drink it, and I noticed him stir up something with a piece of paper; then the glass was given to the Italian and he drank it—there was a bed in the room, a table, and pictures—there was a picture over the fireplace representing a soldier going away to war—I was standing up at the table at the time the pistol was fired—the prisoner was sitting not two yards from me—I saw the revolver—there was a lamp in the room, but not alight—this was about a quarter or half-past 7; we could not see very well—when I heard the pistol fired I ran out at once—he did not ask me to whom the pictures belonged—he said he was going to Liverpool that night—what he said was, "The Italian has 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on him, and I want to make him drunk and take it from lim"—he did not use the word "rob."</p>

On the night of 29th August I was sent to the prosecutor's house by Inspector Smith—I met the prosecutor in Cambridge Street, coming towards the station—we met the prisoner at the door of 18, Albert Street—I asked him what was the matter—he said "Nothing, it was only a glass broken"—he spoke English—I got a light, and went into the room—the prisoner stood in the passage—there was a broken glass on the table, and three others which contained some beer—I asked him whore was the revolver—he said "I did not have any"—I searched him, but found no revolver on him—there was one man on the bed in the room drunk, and two others, Segansio and Carealis, who gave the name of Michaels, and was at first included in the charge before the Magistrate—the prisoner had been drinking, but he appeared to be perfectly well aware of what he was doing—I asked the prosecutrix if she had seen the revolver—she said "No, it must have been a glass"—the prisoner took up a broken glass from the table, and said "It was only this glass"—Sergeant Talbot came in immediately after—he said to the prosecutrix "Stand in the position you were in when he fired at you"—she did so—he then asked her where the prisoner was sitting when he fired—she pointed it out—I then followed the course of the bullet, and found it in the wall just in a line where the prosecutrix was standing—the bullet went through this picture, breaking the glass, and making a hole in the picture, and imbedded itself in the wall;</p>

I am professor of chemistry and forensic I medicine at the London Hospital—on 29th September I received from Inspector Smith a small tumbler corked, and wrapped in brown paper and sealed—it contained about 3oz. or a little more of a liquid that smelt of beer with some tobacco floating on it—I analysed it, and found a trace of picro toxine; it is the active principle of cocculus indicus, or the Levant nut—by "a trace "I mean a quantity that I could not Weigh—I also found about two grains of nicotine, the active principle of tobacco—I do not mean that it was put in as nicotine; it might have been put in as tobacco, but I found nicotine, which was an evidence of tobacco having been put into the liquid—a small quantity of tobacco put into beer would result in the production of nicotine—I am not prepared to say that if the quantity of nicotine I found had been taken it would have been dangerous—it would have a stupefying effect if taken in a sufficient quantity—in all cases of vegetable poisoning the use of the person taking it has to be considered, and as persons of their class smoke somewhat freely I am scarcely prepared to say that the quantity I found would be sufficient to produce a dangerous effect—to a person not accustomed to tobacco it would be undoubtedly dangerous—the glass if full would hold 8oz. of fluid; it contained 3oz., and in that was two grains of nicotine; that would come under the denomination of either a stupefying or overpowering matter, or both—I found particles of I tobacco itself in the beer.</p>

I am in partnership with my brother, at 34, King Street, Clerkenwell, as Davenes Brothers, wholesale provision merchants, and the prisoner was for 18 months or two years employed at a weekly salary as salesman—we take stock on Wednesdays and Saturdays—he takes goods out, and calls them off to the man who enters them as they are put into the van—he is provided with a delivery book, and takes the receipt of the customer on the counterfoil—this counterfoil, 3381, is written in pencil, "3rd June, 1879, S. Hoskins, 34 A 61 80," and "Hoskins" across the counter<lb/>foil—I have the book in which the entry is made—he took four tubs on that day—I did not check that with him personally—I compared the stock the following day—when we took stock the stock was right—on the same day my collector went to Mr. Hoskins, and this charge was made.</p>

He went to tell Mr. Amery, but on seeing him coming out he was afraid, as he had always told him never to leave the pony and trap on any account. He spent the rest of the day searching, and walked about all night as he had no money, and had to pawn his coat next morning to keep himself till Wednesday, when he went home, but his landlord refused to admit him as the police had been after him, and he then gave himself up.</hi>

I am a dealer in jewellery and live at Friern Lodge, Peckham Rye—I have known Cohen four or five years, and his father longer, and he bears the general reputation of an honest and respectable young man—I was speaking to him in Houndsditch on Monday, 28th July, between 2 and 3 p.m., and a man whom I knew by sight as a dealer came up and offered a sample of pearl studs, and asked Cohen if he could purchase a large quantity, between 800 or 900 of them—he said at first he did not care for them, they were not the class of goods he cared to purchase, as they were too much trouble to sell—the man mentioned Hackney Road—I fancied a set of the pearl studs and gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them from the samples he was submitting—Cohen said he could not buy them by sample and could make him no offer unless he saw the bulk—I left them at the end of Houndsditch and they walked away together—I have carried on business in London as a dealer for 19 or 20 years, and know most of the sale rooms and most of the dealers in the East End—large transactions take place on Sunday mornings at Duke's Place—many dealers are, known by sight to other dealers who do not know their names and addresses, and considerable transactions take place between them—I know between 400 and 500 jewellery dealers and diamond merchants, but do not know the names of 20 of them—in the goods produced there is no intrinsic value</p>

I am a reporter, and live at 4, Copeland Terrace, Peckham—I have known Cohen and his father seven or eight years, and during that time his general reputation has been good—on 29th July, about 8.30, I called for the first time at Camden Passage to see his father, and I. saw Cohen there and purchased a small gold Geneva watch, secondhand—he said something and we went together towards Hackney Road—outside a public-house he met a friend who spoke to him on business and upbraided him with being twenty minutes late, and said he was just going away—Cohen said something I did not hear, and I went with them into a house in Elizabeth Street, Hackney Road—I know the house—there were on a small oral table in the front room four brown paper packets—some conver<lb/>sation took place about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Cohen said he had made up his mind not to give more than 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that he should like to sea them—I saw money pass, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—he looked over the goods and tied them up with a string—they were studs.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant K</hi>). I apprehended the prisoner on the 8th of this month—I had received a description of him—I did not know him before; he was at the corner of New Gravel Lane and St. George's Street, near the place in question—I told him I should take him into custody as answering the description of a man who was concerned with others in robbing a Frenchman on Saturday evening last at the corner of Glasshouse Yard and St. George's Street—he said "What time was it?"—I said "I think it was about 3 o'clock"—he said "I was not there, I was having my tea in St. George's Chambers at that time"—I took him to the station in King David Lane and placed him among seven others—I sent for the prosecutor and he identified him at once; he pushed the others away from him and left the prisoner standing by himself—I could not understand what he said—I stopped in the room at the prisoner's request; they were all standing up and all had hats on—Wilcox afterwards came in and immediately pointed out the prisoner.</p>

I said I might have been in the chambers having my tea. On Saturday I saw two men following the Frenchman. I heard one say to the other, 'He has it in his outside coat-pocket.' They went down to the bottom of the street One asked him for something, what it was I could not tell I saw him shove the man out into the road. He went to him again and said something, and the other man ran up and put his hand into his pocket. What he took out I could not say. He then ran up Glasshouse Yard. I turned round and went up Leman Street, walking rather quiet I was making a cigarette. I saw the policeman looking at me rather sard, as if he had a suspicion of me, and would recognise me again, I then went into Wells Street to see a man who had promised me sixpence, and he gave me sixpence."</p>

I am a printer, and print the bill-heads for Grist and Son, and have done so for the last two years—it has been "Grist and Son" the whole time—I have never been blamed for its being a mistake—I submit my proofs before I take the order—I should think I should not print "Brown and Son" or "Grist and Son" without instructions—on the Thursday morning I was passing the shop when I heard Grist distinctly tell the boy to take the horse back to Mr. Upton—as he was gone so long Mr. Grist, senior, asked me to go up and hear what the conversation was between them—I went to Upton's shop, and saw Upton and young Grist together with the horse—Upton turned round to Grist and said, "Didn't you buy the horse?" and the son said, "I did"—then he said to Grist again, "Didn't your father know all about it?" and he said, "Yes, it was with my own money that I bought it; father had no business to have anything to do with it, only he wouldn't let me keep it"—as they turned round I said to Grist, junior, "The best thing you can do is to take the horse back under the circumstances"—he said, "I mustn't do that, you know what father is"—Upton's is a butcher's shop, certainly not a cat's-meat shop—Mr. Upton is as respectable a butcher as Mr. Grist, I should think more so—he has hit carts and sends round for orders—I have no interest in the matter, I lose money by it—I shan't do any more printing for them, I believe.</p>

I am late steward of the Minora belonging to the British Steam Navigation Company—she arrived on Sunday, 3rd August, tod on the 6th, between 12 and 1, with the Custom House Officer, I went through the stock in the store closet for Customs purposes, and the Customs Officer afterwards sealed the door—the closet contained claret and spirits and ginger cordial—I identify this bottle of claret as being from my stores, and the whole of these other bottles (<hi rend="italic">Also produced</hi>) as the property of the British India Company—they were all perfectly safe between 12 and 1 on the 5th, and the door was locked—they commenced to discharge cargo on the 5th, and on the 6th 1 received this information between 11 and 12—I then examined the store-room, and found that two planks had been forced open—I sent to the Customs officer and he broke the seal, and on examin<lb/>ing the stock about 50 bottles were missing, and about 40 bottles were found hidden round the hold, about 10 full and the rest empty—the three capsules produced correspond with the bottles of ginger cordial, and this stopper fits an empty bottle found in the hold—I saw Palmer in the lower hold.</p>

I did not go down afterwards—I do not know that Baldock was not there on Tuesday—at the time the doer was sealed we could have seen if the planks had been started on the outside—they were started in the after part of the store-room bulkhead, far away from the door—the bulkhead was safe when We counted the bottles—the planks were forced with a crowbar—there were 13 workmen in the gang—during Tuesday night One of the officers and the whole of the native crew were on board, but they do not have access to between decks, the hatches are put on at night—I left the ship about 3.30 or 4 p.m.—the chief officer has the key of the hatches, and it takes two or three men to lift them—the men come to work at 8.30—I know nothing about their duties except Palmer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouse keeper at B and K Jetty, Victoria Docks—the prisoners are employed as labourers for the dock company—only Palmer and Stratton were employed on 5th August, but on Wednesday, the 6th, all three were employed, and about 11.30 Baldock came to my office on the quay to ask for leave for the remainder of the day—he was under the influence of liquor—he said he had had some trouble the day before, and was rather excited—seeing his condi<lb/>tion I took him to the chief constable and gave him in charge, and saw</p>

I am chief constable at the Victoria Docks, West Ham—at 12.45 on Wednesday, 6th August, Baldock was brought to me under the influence of drink: he had been drinking wine—I searched him, and found fa stopper and capsule in his waistcoat pocket, and asked him how he accounted for it—I told him he would be detained—I went on board the Minora, and saw Palmer and Stratton and 10 others in No. 3 hold—on searching the hold I found three full bottles—all the men were brought to the police-station and searched, and I found another stopper on Stratton—he had been drinking wine—I charged the prisoners with being concerned in stealing the wine, and they made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Wilkinson and Co., timber merchants, Hatcham Road—Simmons came to our place about the end of February or beginning of March—I knew him as the supposed foreman of Mr. Manning, a builder—he said, "I want some timber. I am going to build at Leytonstone, and shall want a large quantity, but I want 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth to begin with"—he said he was going to build on Mr. Sambell's ground—I said I could not offer him the timber unless he brought me a guarantee from the ground landlord—he said it rather interfered with his character; he could not very well do it, but would try—I told him about his having been bankrupt, and that it was our rule to hare a guarantee from the man who was granting the leases—I asked him, and he said Mr. Sambell was granting the leases—I did not know Mr. Sambell—a few days after we got from Simmons this letter of 11th March, "I have seen the gentleman, Mr. Sambell, respecting the timber I ordered of you, and he informs me that he will write you to-night, which I think will be satis<lb/>factory. If so, please to send me the battens first, and please to send them down tomorrow, as they have the carpenter waiting," and enclosed, or in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150128"/>
               <p>another letter, was this guarantee from Sambell: "I will guarantee pay ment for your timber to the extent of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for your timber merchants"—I then supplied him with the timber, believing Sambell was the ground landlord—after a couple of months I found that Simmons was nothing more than a foreman of Sambell—I sent the timber to the premises Mornington Road, Leytonstone—I received this letter from Simmons, dated May 3rd: "I have not had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Sambell till to-day, in consequence of his being ill, but on mentioning your account he informed me that you had written to him not to pay any more money on account of my bill; but I have promised to pay him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to-day, so he told me he would see you Monday or Tuesday. I am sorry I have not known of your writing to him last Monday when I made the promise to you; to it is not my fault this time." On 5th May I received from Sambell this letter: "I regret not having answered your favour before this, haying been laid up. I find on going over the works that Mr. Simmons is entitled to a certain amount of money more than he has received. Please forward me account now owing, and I will give you the money to pay as far as the work extends." I sent the timber after the first letter of March—this other letter from Sambell was also sent to me by Simmons before I advanced the timber: "With respect to the guarantee of timber, I have no objection to do so, but of course I shall not pay you the full amount of your advance as the work proceeds, but stop the amount out of your timber bill"—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid on account before I let the timber go, and he said it was all right for the balance—I have supplied goods at different times to about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he is still indebted 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MORICE</hi>. I knew Simmons, and he told me he had been a foreman—I did not know what he was at this time—I knew he had liquidated, and was without means—it is customary for foremen to undertake separate parts of a building contract on their own account—it is very often piece work—knowing he had liquidated, I asked for a guarantee, and having got that I supplied the timber—I knew nothing of Sambell, and made no inquiries at the time as to his position—I have been paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I have not taken civil proceedings to recover the balance.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLES</hi>. I knew Simmons when he was in Mr. Manning's employment—I supplied Manning with timber on a guarantee from the solicitors—I cannot remember to whom I have spoken about this interview with Simmons—I never attended any meeting about prosecuting them—I believe there is a dispute between Mr. Marsden and Sambell in regard to this property—Sambell was summoned to Ilford Petty Sessions for stealing, and Simmons was subpœnaed as a witness against him, but I did not know he was taken into custody there—I knew Simmons had liquidated, and I said to him "How much do you expect me to trust you in the face of that?"—and he said, "Well, Sir, because a man is down is he to be kept down?"—he may have said, "If this little job turns out all right, it will be the making of me"—I said, "Well, Mr. Simmons, I will see what can be done for you. If we can assist you we will"—I said, "Who is this Mr. Sambell? Is he all right?" and he said, "I think so. Somebody has died, he has come into a considerable amount of money, and he is a man of property at Leytonstone"—I said, "All right, Mr. Simmons, I will let you know to—morrow morning"—I took the order, and next morning I wrote, asking him to get Sambell as a guarantee—I did not take the trouble to inquire who Sambell was, or into the truth of Simmons's statement—I simply believed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150129"/>
               <p>his statement to be correct—he sent me a letter with the guarantee, and enclosed the letter that Sambell had written him about the transaction—I did not believe in Simmons, and should not have supplied him, but that I thought Sambell was going to grant him leases and have something to do with the ground—I parted with the goods on the faith of the guarantee—I asked him when we should have some money, and he said, "I will get you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Saturday or Monday," and he paid it, but not till about six weeks after—I do not know if Sambell paid it—I made inquiries, because I could not understand the affair, and two or three months afterwards I heard that he was only Sambells foreman, but I did not hear he had been doing piece-work for him—I believed he was building on Sambells ground—he told me had made an arrangement with his creditors.</p>

I own property on the Grove Estate, Leytonstone—there are some carcases of houses there not yet finished—on 16th January, 1869, I entered into this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with Sambell, and from time to time advanced him money for the completion of the premises on the certificate of Mr. Hunt, my surveyor—I could not get the work done as provided in the agreement, and on 25th June I went to the premises with Mr. Hunt, and saw Sambell there—he wanted me to make him advances before he had done the work, as he could not go any further, and I refused to do so—I had previously advanced him mow than 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did on another day advance 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay his men's Wages, and subsequently put Mr. Pratt into possession for me, and the building material then there is the property charged in this indictment—I gave no letter or authority to Sambell or Simmons to remove it.</p>

               <p>for an hour or two yet;" and on getting outside, within two or three minutes, he walked off with the horses—when I saw the van move and Simmons going away with it I asked the carman if he was aware the horse was going on, but he did not seem to take any notice—I then went out to look after the van—Simmons went on walking till he got under the railway arch, and then he took the horse's nose-bag off—I saw Sambell under the arch—he said, "Where the deuce is the fellow gone?' and I wad, "Here he is, and I intend following you"—he made a bit of a trot and I followed—afterwards he saw I was behind and said "Hallo?"—I said, "You thought of doing me, but here I am"—he said,' "Well, you may as well jump up; I only did it for a lark;" and I got up, and when we got to Bethnal Green Road, Simmons employed a man to look after the van;-and Sambell came up about half an hour after and asked where Mr. Simmons was—I said he had gone away for some time, and I stood outside the van till he returned; and they went up to another house—Sambell said, "What do you want to follow the van for?"—I said, "I believe it's my place"—he said, "You have no call to; if you like to lose the van I will give you half-a-sovereign"—I said, "Not for 40 half-sovereigns"—I went up several turnings at Bethnal Green Road, and sent a boy for a policeman, and two policemen came—I charged the prisoners with having unlawful possession of the goods—the police took them to the Bethnal Green Station, and the charge was stated—Sambell answered 'that he was very sorry his horse could not get farther that night; but he would 'travel on the road the following morning, between six and seven, sad that he wanted to go to Blackheath—the police would not take him—the goods were left unloaded at the place, and I went back and told my master.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Mellish at the Steam flour Mills, Woolwich—about November last I entered into negotiations with the prisoner as to his becoming our traveller—before we entered into any definite arrangement he brought a proposal form from the Guarantee Society, which I filled up—he entered our service early in December—the first arrangement we made with him was that he was to obtain orders for flour from bakers, and if they were satisfactory we should execute them and pay him a com<lb/>mission of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sack until the guarantee was properly executed, and we held the right of collecting the money until the guarantee was carried oat, and on no account was he to collect it; in fact, it was his on proposition that we should withhold the right of collecting the money untri the guarantee was perfect—he was to travel for us, and for us only—that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150133"/>
               <p>arrangement was mode in Mark Lane—he said in January last that he should be able to get the guarantee through in a few days, but as he had been in the Bankruptcy Court, and had not got his discharge, the Guarantee Society would not fulfil the guarantee until he had obtained his discharge, which would take place in a very short time—we then increased his commission from 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sack to help him in his travelling expenses, and he was to receive 101. a year salary—up to that time he had collected no money, but afterwards he did collect money by special order—if any person's money was. ready, and it was not convenient for us to go for it, we gave him a special order in writing to collect it; the invoice of the goods was endorsed, "Please—pay our Mr. Urquhart, and oblige yours obediently"—after that he occa<lb/>sionally collected money under those circumstances, and it was his duty immediately to pay it into one of the branches of the London and County Bank, or meet me on market day, Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, and pay it to me, and failing to see me on the market he was to come down to the mill at Woolwich and pay it—the commission was paid on the execution of the order, whether the goods were paid for or not, in each case separately, by cheque at the end of the month, for the amount at 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per sack—I saw the prisoner at Mark Lane Market on, I think, Wednesday, 18th June—he paid me some money which he had received, and said that he should get. some more by Saturday, and if he did not see me on Friday he would come down to the mill—he did not come, but on Saturday evening I received this. telegram (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I told him on Monday, the 23rd, that I had received a telegram from him on Saturday saying that he had sent a cheque, but we had not received it—he said, "No, when I sent that telegram I thought I could get a cheque from my brother-in-law, but I have the money here in the bag"—he was carrying a small black bag—I said; "You, might as well give it to me"—he said, "I would rather come down to the mill, as I want to have my book made up, and I will be down there by 6 o'clock at the latest" (<hi rend="italic">The telegram stated</hi>: "Unable to see you to-day; posted cheque for 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as advised") I never received a cheque for that amount—we had the advice on the Saturday morning in a letter from him, enumerating, the accounts from persons paying—he did not come on the Monday night, in consequence of which I sent Mr. Jay up, who made a communication to me next morning, and about 2 on that day, Tuesday, the prisoner came down to the mill—I said, "Have you brought your account?—he said, "No, I have come away in a hurry, and I have not brought it, but I can tell you my deficiencies if you go over the ledger and show me the people's accounts"—it was a clerk's duty to keep the ledger—I got it and went over the accounts page by page, and he said, when we came to one account, "That account is right," and to another, "I have had that account," and the different moneys amounted to 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in addition to the 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I particularly dwelt upon the account of John Weiss, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said, "Is this account unpaid?"—he said "Yes," and to another acconnt, Mr. Holden's, for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he said, "That is still owing"—I had seen him four or five times between the 10th and 24th June, but he had said nothing about Weiss's account—the interview lasted about an hour and a half, and I think he went away by the 5.30 train—on the 26th he came down to the mill with a cousin, whom he introduced as Mr. Webster, from the Audit Office of the London, and North-Western Railway, and said, "I have brought my cousin to see—if we cannot make some arrangement respecting this money"—the cousin</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150134"/>
               <p>then said, "It is a very bad job, and I should very much like to assist him in the matter"—I said, "In what way can you assist him?"—he said, "By becoming security for his future good behaviour"—I said."what is your position?"—he said." I am in the Audit Office if the London and North-western Railway, and am in a position to become security for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Before we enter into anything for the future we must settle the past; I cannot think of entering into any fresh arrangement till the acconunts are made up"—no arrangement was come to, and on the 26th I went to his house at Dalston with a constable, and said to him, "since you were at the mill on Wednesday I have found out that you have collected more money than you accounted for then, and that, notwithstanding your having had a letter and also a verbal warning as to collecting any more money, we have found out that you have collected further sums of money, and gave him in costody—the verbal notice was at the mill on Tuesday—I said, "Have you received a letter?"—he said "No"—I said, "you will receive it on going home now, and I will tell you the purport of it is to warn you not to take any more money, in whatever shape it may be offered to you, on our account; if you do, it will go hard with you"—I wrote the letter on monday night, the 23rd, while Mr. Jay was gone to the prisoner's house—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was posted on the 24th because it was too late to register it on the 23rd—when I gave him in custody he said, "Can we not settle the matter?"—I said "No"—he said, "Well, you know what you are doing"—I said, "Perfectly"—he said, "If you had waited for your money you would have had it, but if I get seven years now I don't care." or words to that effect—I gave this bill to the prisoner at the mill at the end of may. (<hi rend="italic">This was an invoice to a Mr. Weiss for</hi> 25 <hi rend="italic">sacks of four</hi>, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">on which was written, "Please pay to our Mr. Urquhart, and oblige yours truly, R. and M.</hi>") We had also given him a document to collect 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Holden, and 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mrs. Draper—he never told me that he had got those amounts, and we did not find it out till we issued a circular, after he was in custody, and we have never had any of the money.</p>

               <p>salary for the purpose of satisfying the Guarantee Society and making him our clerk or servant—I know that they would not take him without he was ft servant, and that was the reason we gave it to him—it was to satisfy I the Guarantee Society—he has never received the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was never I carried out, and he worked on the verbal understanding, and was only allowed to collect money in particular instances—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I are from the firm—some are in my writing, some in Mr. Jay's—I wrote to I him in February, "We send you invoices of flour as wanted; look up as much money as you can, we are hard up"—that was upon the invoices he received—he did not receive invoices for all the flour delivered to his order nor advices—this is Mr. Jay's writing to him: "Hunt the beggars up for the money;" also at the end of March, "Ton will please us by making an effort to get us a large amount this week; your special attention to the above will be esteemed"—he might get orders when and where he liked so that he did it in a proper business-like way—I cannot tell what my clerk may have written to him in a friendly manner—I did not authorise him to write this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner met me at Mark Lane three days a week, I can prove that by 50 witnesses, and he came to the mill every week; he never missed a week—I do not know that so far from collecting money and pressing customers for money, he has allowed accounts to stand over for the purpose of increasing our connection and keeping people in good humour—we had a letter from a Mr. Baker complaining that Urquhart did not call upon him for the money or he would have had it long before—this is a letter of my manager's; it states, "Mr. R. is under the impression that you do not call often enough for the money; if you cannot find time to do so we shall have to collect it ourselves"—he only brought us 50 or 60 customers, and there is commission due to him on those amounts, and we have been executing his orders both before and since he was taken in custody—his commission has been coming due to him day after day and week after week since we gave him in custody—some of our books are here—I have been through them—the total amount of his sales is not 9,769 sacks; I think about 7,000—I will swear that the commission he earned from December to his being given in custody, whether paid or unpaid, does not amount to 322<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it is only about 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have calculated it accurately—I cannot say without the book what orders he sent in—he did not say that he could not go through the ledger with me because he had come away in a hurry and left his book behind—he begged of me to go through it, and I said "I shall not go through the accounts if you have not brought your book"—he said, "I can tell you how every account stands"—he gave me certain amounts, which I put down—I swear I put the 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, but not on that paper which you have or on any paper which I gave to him—that is the only paper I gave him—it only relates to the 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swore at the police-court that he had taken Holden's and Draper's money, though he had had a registered letter from me telling him him not to do so—Holder swore at the police-court that the prisoner came in a cab on the morning of the 24th and collected his money, but Mrs. Draper did not swear that he came in a cab to her to my recollection—on the next day I promised in Mr. Webster's hearing to write to Mr. Urquhart on the Thursday, but I did not do so—it was to make an appointment to go round with Urquhart to his customers to find out the exact amount he had collected—I told Mr. Webster that Mr. Urquhart had better hunt up his</p>

               <p>friends, and that I did not care to supply his customers with any more flour until all the accounts were got in—I did not give as a reason that Mr. Urquhart could pay nothing out of his commission off the debt, and that I thought it would take all the pluck out of him—I said nothing about paying the debt off by the commission—it never became a debt at all—I never used such words—to the best of my belief commission was not men<lb/>tioned—I would not have accepted commission off the debt; there was no debt—I would not have accepted commission off the amount—I did not take 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. commission off the 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in May, or credit him with it—we struck a balance "Less commission account"—if he had brought us 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. we should have drawn a cheque—119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission would have made the amount up—this is not a debtor and creditor account at all—I did not say to Mr. Webster "You had better pay 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. off the debt, as although I do not wish to push your cousin, as that would do me no good and him a lot of harm, friendship is friendship, and money is money;" nor did I ask Webster to pay 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. off the debt—I would not have taken it—I was determined to prosecute him—I swore at the police-court "I gave him in custody; if he had given me the money then I should have taken it:" but I should have prosecuted him too—I was anxious to dissolve partnership with Mr. Mellish two or three years ago, and I am anxious now—I do not know that he is anxious to take the prisoner into his service to travel for him, or that this prosecution is against his wishes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He sold about 7,000 sacks of flour, and about 5,000 were delivered, 4,000 of them between January and the time he was given in custody—there are about 1,500 to be delivered—out of the original orders about 1,500 or 2,000 sacks are cancelled—I paid him commission on flour sold and delivered—I have made up the account of the amounts he has received and not paid to us—the total is 353<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I can give you the amount of the bad debts of his customers—I made out the paper from the books, and these are the amounts he told me had collected in May for commission, and I would have given him a cheque for it if he had handed me the 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he agreed to the amount due to him for commission to 31st May—he also earned about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission between 1st Juno and the 26th, when he was given in custody—assuming we delivered all the goods he sent orders for, and that they had been paid for, the extreme amount that could be due to him for commission, including May and June, would be about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., calculating everything in his favour, and doing his work for him—I have carefully gone through the books and taken out this abstract—he has never suggested at any interview that he was not a clerk or a servant, or that he had a right to deduct these moneys and take them himself—he frequently came to Mark Lane, and if he did not see me there he accounted to me at Woolwich, and he very frequently accompanied me to Woolwich—these letters are in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">One of these stated</hi>, "Holden's money is ready any time you like to send.

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Rose and Mellish—on Monday evening, 23rd June, I received-orders to go to the prisoner's house at Dalston—I took with me this document, signed by the firm: "Sir,—We request you to pay Mr. Jay all moneys received or collected by you on our account, and request you will see us to-morrow"—I said, "I have come from the firm by the orders of Mr. Rose for the amount you have named in the telegram"—he said, "I have got the money, but I prefer bringing it down to the firm. will come down to-morrow"—I said, "It will make me appear small to go home without it, if you doubt my word, here is my authority," and produced the letter—he said, "I don't doubt you, but I prefer bringing it down"—I said, "I want the money; I have come purposely for it, and 1 shan't go home without it"—he afterwards said, "To tell the truth, old man, I have not got all the money"—I said, "You admit having taken it, if you have used some of it let us have what you have left"—he said, "I have not got any left, to make a long matter short, I spent some of the money, and betted the other away"—I went back to the office at 8.30 next morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner is considered a good salesman—he added to the connection, but hot so largely—I have been told that he is a corn factor in business for himself, but I never saw him till he was in our employ—I do not know that he has a very large connection of his own—he brought us part of his customers, I believe—I wrote some of these letters—I swore at the police-court that I never wrote that the firm was "hard up"—I wrote that they wanted money—this letter is not my writing; it resembles Mr. Boss's more than Mr. Mellish's, but they write very much alike—I do not recollect any customers calling and saying that the firm could have their money if Urquhart called for it, but they wrote to that effect—he only-had to collect money by special order—J wrote, "Mr. R. is under the impression that you do not call quite often enough for the money. If you cannot find time to do so, we shall have to collect it ourselves, as it is impossible to go on like this at such long terms from men who we are led to believe are quick payers and first-class men"—we have two customers named Baker, one of them wrote to the firm and complained that the money was not called for—Mr. Karslake also wrote to complain—I also wrote to the prisoner, "Your account will be small this month if you do not rush it into them sharper;" also, "I suppose you will be down at the end of the week with about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as we want it bad"—I was sometimes unable to go through his accounts and make up his ledger from ours while he was waiting—I used to do it and post it to him afterwards—I wrote to him, "Shall you be down on Saturday? Am so thundering busy, have not had time to do your ledger, but you have the bills, so no matter"—those were the bills that I had written on—he could collect orders when and where he liked if we approved of the customers—we did not depend upon his con<lb/>nection entirely to increase our business, we were increasing it ourselves as well—Mr. Mellish used to travel, we had no other agent—on June 4,1879, I wrote, "Let me see if we cannot pull your connection up to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. this month; you have done about 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for May, you might work it up another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I also wrote to him that if he occasionally ran down, he would soon have a connection second to none.</p>

I shall be 13 in September; I went to the home with my sister Kate in August, it was 1878 I think; she was younger than me—we did not go to the Board school—we had sop in the morning and sometimes gruel or bread and treacle, then went out collecting and did not return till night—when I got home I had bread and treacle, and sometimes Miss Addiscott asked us whether we would have a drop of tea and we said, "Yes"—when we were out collecting the ladies gave us something at times—we only had meat on Sundays; when it was wet we did not go out collecting; we had nothing for dinner and sometimes we had rice for tea—the children had dinner; my sister had been to the Board school; she was ill and on Shrove Tuesday she took to her bed—I slept in the same room very near her, hot not with her; that was the back parlour; she was very thin—when I took her out of bed she complained of her bones and asked me to be gentle with her; I saw that her bones were coming through her skin—she slept at the top of the house before Shrove Tuesday—I slept in the back parlour then; she was taken bad in the afternoon and Miss Addiscott made her a bed in the back parlour, and told us to put a mattress for her; she slept on a palliasse, and had a sheet, blanket, and pillow—I went up to call her when she was upstairs—she had one sheet to cover her and her clothes, and no blanket—we only had one blanket, but when Mr. Phillips came she got two new dark blankets, black-like—Dr. Ayres attended her—before she was ill she had the same food as the others; we all had the same—there was no tire in the back parlour till after she was dead, and that was to burn the vermin—Miss Addiscott sometimes went out at 6 in the evening, and she did not return till 1 or 2 in the morning—she slept on a flock bed on the floor in the front parlour, there were folding doors between the two rooms; she told me to shut them, because she could not bear to hear my sister's groans.' she used to groan because she could not bear the pain in her back—when I was out Florence Edgar attended her—there were only two of us at home, and four went out collecting—I don't remember how long after Shrove Tuesday Dr Ayres was called in; he used to call in several times, and once when passing the door he came in—no one nursed her but Florence Edgar and me; she died on the 6th April—I saw Miss Addiscott after on the Sunday morning at 9, she told me to take my sister's breakfast to her and I said, "Kate, here is your breakfast"—she gave me no answer and I called Miss Addiscott, who said she was dead, and told me to get a pail and flannel to wash her—I say she died at 1 in the morning, because she called me for drink every night, and she did not call me that night—she kissed me and said "Good night."

I shall be 11 next birthday—my mother is dead; my father is alive—I went to Miss Addiscott's home, and came away on 22nd April this year—I had been there a year and a half—we had baked meat and carrots for dinner on Christmas Day, and we had meat on Sundays—we got gruel for breakfast at 9 o'clock, and then used to go out collecting—I went to the Board school—I came out at 12 o'clock, and before I went back at 2 o'clock I sometimes had rice and sometimes pickled cabbage—after school in the evening) I had bread and treacle sometimes, and some<lb/>times porridge—I got no milk, but a halfpennyworth was taken for Miss Addiscott—when we went out collecting we never used to have any dinner—I remember Kate Verch dying; she died, I think, in the back parlour—I don't know who was there—I remember Kate Smith dying on a Sunday; Nelly Smith was in the house at the time—after she died I went in to pick some things off of her, and I think Miss Addiscott went out to fetch her mother—I believe the sister had been there the night before—I slept in the top bed room—it was after breakfast on Sunday morning that I first knew Kate Smith was dead—I heard somebody knock at the door on the Monday and ask for Miss Addiscott, and Eliza Crabbe, I think, went out to speak! to him—I recognise John Smith as the person—I think Miss Addiscott went out to him—I think her sister was in the house—Mrs. Addiscott was, but it was Miss Addiscott who kept the home who went out to speak to him—Miss Addiscott went out of an evening, and came home sometimes at 10 or 11, but I have sat up for her till 12 or 1 with Eliza Crabbe, and she beat us with a walking stick because wo went to sleep—I was present when Esther Edgar was beaten with a rope—when I slept in the top room had a sheet to lie on and a sheet to cover me, and after the inspectors came I blanket, but not before—that was after Kate Smith's death.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 19, Rokeby Road, Lewisham, and am head mistress of the Board school there—in November, 1877, five girls wen admitted to the school from the home, Emma Clarke, Esther Edgar, Elizabeth Goodland and Minnie, and Louisa Pearson—they were very scantily clad; in fact a fortnight afterwards I inquired about their having! so few clothes on—they were not in bad health apparently—they repeatedly stole dinners, and that led to my making inquiry at the end of December or January—I fed them, and the other teachers did so also—they estravenously, because we generally gave them food in the morning when they had had nothing, and they picked up garbage in the playground, all kinds of dirty crusts which the others had thrown away, but it was not so bad at the beginning of the year, not till towards the end of 1878—those five children continued till the end of 1878, but Louisa Pearson had left the home, and five others were admitted from the home—they left the home, but continued at school—those were Florence Edgar, Georgina Pearch, and another girl, the defendant's niece, as I understood—they looked about the same as the others; they had not the appearance of being starved at that time, but they were always scantily clad—it was their clothing first drew my attention to, them; they had only a frock, a chemise, stockings, and shoes; no petticoats, drawers, or stays, and the frocks we had to pin on them; there were so hooks and eyes—in August, 1878, Annie Crabbe, Florence Clements, and Kate Smith were there; they looked far worse than the others, and they gradually got worse in appearance and health throughout the whole of the year—their clothing was the same as the others—I cannot swear they never had petticoats, but I examined them frequently, and then they had not—I gave them all food, except Florence Clements—I don't think I gave her any, as the children took a fancy to her and fed her—it is not usual to feed the children, it was an act of kindness; they bring their own dinners—I thought Kate Smith a delicate child, but she had no disease when she first came, she simply looked pale and thin—she got rapidly worse, and had the itch very much—I was not aware what it was—I knew a doctor knew attending her in the home, and that if it was any infectious disease he would prevent her coming—the last time she came to school was, I think, the beginning of December—she could not walk across the room, and 1 told her not to come—she complained of nothing but being cold; the weather was very cold then—she was not adequately clad; I could have given her clothes, but I did not—she asked to be allowed to come to sit by the fire—she did no lessons because she could not—she was very dirty, 1 had to send the rest down with her to be washed often, and sometimes I sent them back to the home with a note, asking that they might he sent to school cleaner and more tidy—I said nothing about their food in the</p>

I held at this time an appointment at the Evalina Hospital, which is devoted to the reception of children—I lived in the wards over four years—on 13th February I examined Eleanor Mobbs on her admission—my report at the time says, "She was extremely emaciated: she had a languid exhausted manner: she was covered from head to foot with inveterate itch of long standing, as she had a harsh dry skin: there was complete absence of fat under the skin producing the plump appearance which a child ought to have: there was no evidence of any mischief in the internal organs: she was slightly feverish on the evening of her admission: she complained of pains in various parts"—I did not see that the itch had. been treated at all; if it had, it was only for a few days previous to her admission—it had existed I should say three or four months—every portion of her hair had to be cut on, for it was literally swarming with vermin—over the upper part of her right thigh was a patch of red inflamed skin and over her right great toe there was a patch of inflamed skin with matter under it—over her right heel there was a small discharging wound, and over her left heel a large wound of the same description, which was discharging matter—she had considerable difficulty in taking food, she was sick after all the food she took—we had to be extremely careful in feeding her—she weighed on 17th February 3 stone 51b. 8oz.; and on 7th March she had gained over 31b.—on 21st March she weighed 3 stone 121b. 4oz—she was when admitted</p>

               <p>considerably below the nominal weight and height of a child of her age; indicating an utter want of proper food and a complete absence of all ordinary cleanliness and proper care—my reason for saying that, is that the whole course of her treatment consisted in feeding her properly, but the itch was treated medically—I failed to detect any disease by the most careful examination—her emaciated state was another reason, and as there was not disease I take it that there must have been want of food—vomit<lb/>ing after food is an indication of weakness—the lack of proper sustenance had been continued for some weeks—no child could be reduced in that way under a certain amount of time, but I cannot fix the date—if that treatment had been persisted in the consequence would have been consumption, or she would have died—I see 350 to 400 children in a year, and out patients also—the Evalina Hospital is resorted to by the poorer classes and a perfectly free—I have never seen a parallel case to Eleanor Mobbs'—I hare never seen a child without organic visceral disease reduced as she was—tabes mesenterial is a disease well understood in the profession, but it is not common—I mean the children who are brought to us in the hospital wasting from any cause, bad food or from bad hygenic condition, are popularly said to have consumption of the bowels, which being translated is tabes mesenterica—I might discover whether it was tabes mesenterial if I made a post-mortem examination, and without one if I could feel the enlarged glands—I cannot say whether tabes mesenterica is produced from a scrofulous condition, or whether consumption proceeds from the same cause—my opinion is that the diet was insufficient in many important particulars.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The cheapest diet that a working man with 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week and five children could give them would be bread and milk; that is a cheap and wholesome diet, it would sustain life—milk alone will sustain lift without bread—it is possible to give food in considerable quantities which does not go to nourish the body—a large quantity of rice will fill a child but it will not digest—ordinary broth has scarcely any nutritive qualities in it, and children persistently given it instead of getting fatter and making bone would go downwards, and if illness supervened, the child would naturally become very emaciated, but it would die upon such a diet without the illness—you might then find a child like Eleanor Mobbs, as far as emaciation is concerned, without organic disease—if a delicate child was improperly fed and had a tendency to sores or scrofula they would be aggravated, and if it had a cut on the head there would be a tendency to festering—when a person is in a weak state of health a wound often fasten—you can foment scrofula where you might stave it off by proper means—when scrofula proceeds from syphilis it is not uncommon I believe for it to be dormant in the second generation and to break out in the grandson, but many people say that it is not so, you have a popular idea of scrofula and I have a medical one; I do not know what disease you would describe a scrofula; we are fighting upon ground on which we cannot go in common—Eleanor Mobbs is not a badly made or a puny child—she has a cleft palate, but that has nothing to do with scrofula—she was in an extremely emaciated condition—you can feel all persons' ribs—I have not seen children so thin that the chest bones are almost coming through the skin—itch does not spread very rapidly—you see crusts on various parte of the body with water exhuding from them, what is called a pustular rash—the sore on the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Everything I have been saying is simply upon what I heard last Session and now; I have seen nothing of the children—I read the depositions and made a report upon them—I had not then heard any the evidence for the defence—my evidence to-day is upon the diet given I heard the evidence for the defence last Session, and assuming it to be true it would alter my opinion if I believed that the children told lies—I I most positively that children cannot live on potatoes alone—I never was in Ireland, but I know that children in London would die—I have I plenty of experience of children living on a starch diet, and they always die if they go on long enough—potatoes and bread do not contain elements of proper diet, but it depends upon whether the bread is made of oatmeal or potato starch—oatmeal contains more nitrogen and phosphates—I have lived in agricultural districts, Somersetshire and Dorsetshire, and I know that the children of a labourer getting 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or Us. a week get bread and dripping and bacon rind for breakfast—they get dripping from the farm houses—a Dorsetshire labourer would have dripping instead of butter very often—they would get vegetables and potatoes at midday—I don't think they would get much milk, but they buy butter-milk sometimes—they would get dry bread for tea, or bread and sugar, and they get good broth with cabbages in it—I have had some experience in low neighbourhoods: for nine years I was surgeon to a workhouse in Petty France, Westminster—an ordinary working man with a family of four or five ought to have provided a flock mattress for his children last winter—two in a bed would not be objectionable, nor half a dozen—they ought also to have had a sheet, a counterpane, and a blanket, and I should say that if a labouring man did not provide those things for his children last winter he was neglecting them—I have been in heaps of</p>

               <p>houses, and they have plenty of blankets, though there are several in one bed, and they are very dirty and very ragged, but I cannot call to mind anywhere where I have gone and seen them suffering from cold through want of covering—I have heard that these were all the children of person in poor ciroumstances or destitute—if a child had <hi rend="italic">tabes mesenterial</hi> its appearance after death would be what is described in the case of Kate Smith, the legs drawn up, &amp;c., and it would waste away in the same war as in starvation—the legs being drawn up would be common to both, and the child would usually arrive at the stage of the bones almost protruding through the skin—scrofulous disease does not always produce <hi rend="italic">tabes mesenterica</hi>—you might starve a scrofulous child as well as a healthy one.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have occasionally seen children in Deptford going about clothed as these children were, and their parents are not standing in the dock charged with neglect—I visit many homes where the father, mother, and children are all living in one room—they are among the poorest, and if far as I know are honest people—they have better bedding as a rule than I saw at the home—I have never seen any so insufficient—the bed-ticking was half filled with straw; there was a sheet over that, and another sheet to come over the body, and a small rug or blanket over that, and covering that was a new quilt, which I do not think had ever been used, from its appearance—in the neighbourhood of Deptford Docks, where they all live in one room, I pledge myself that the bedding is better than that—for bed covering in winter I should give a couple of blankets and a sheet and counterpane—I don't think I should be satisfied with half a dozen of suck blankets as these children had—a dock labourer at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week would provide better accommodation I should think—I examined the children's naked bodies at the Union, but found no marks of violence or bruises and no sign of a bruise of a shoulder bone, but there might have been—I saw</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I practise at Deptford, and have had considerable experience in that neighbourhood, which is a very poor one—I have been in the habit of going a good deal into labourers' houses—I was called in professionally in September, 1878, to the home by Miss Addiscott; up to that time I had not the slightest knowledge of her—I then attended some of the children—the whole number of visits paid by me and my assistants must have been 50 or more—I am a general practitioner—children were brought to me several times by Miss Addiscott—I generally in the winter saw the children in the front parlour; there was a fire there—I attended Kate Smith—when I fist saw her her disease was scrofula; tabes mesenterial, otherwise consumption of the bowels—she was wasted—I have no recollection of the form of the head, but it was very apparent in the case of a baby named Verch—Kate Smith died on a Sunday—I saw her immediately before death and afterwards—she was in the back room the last time I saw her—she was thoroughly wasted—I thought the surround<lb/>ings of the room had an air of neglect—I mean that it did not look quite so clean as it might have done, perhaps I may not say neglect; but there was carelessness and dirtiness about it—the room did not look clean—probably it would be better if you obliterate the word "neglect"—I have been in a good many houses which do not look clean—I saw the body after death—it was laid out properly and there was proper decency in every way—I saw no insects whatever—the hair was cut short—when I saw her before her death I saw no lice or vermin—I gave this certificate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), "Tabes mesenterica, 3 months"—I mean that the disease had been in existence that time—the children's hair was moderately short; not long by any means—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150173"/>
               <p>the door was always open on account of the post office—the children did not present the appearance of being starved to death—I think they looked excessively well: I am taking the lot collectively—I have frequently been there in winter and seen them sitting in the room where the fire was; and I think they looked better than they do in Court this morning—I have seen considerably inferior accommodation in working men's houses to what I saw there—I attended the other two children who died, and gave these other two certificates (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have no interest in this matter; rather the other way—I have lost about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week in Deptford alone—I said that if Miss Addiscott had the means, then I considered that the death of the children were accelerated by the mode of living—I said "I think if Miss Addiscott had the means of properly keeping the children who died, their deaths were accelerated by what took place at the home;" but I meant with regard to nourishment and warmth, I did not mean by any act of cruelty—I gave a certificate which caused the removal of all these children to the workhouse—I said last Session that these three children were scrofulous before they were born, and would eventually have died from scrofula—I cannot say at what period—they might go on for three or four years, and they might go seven—where the scrofula is in the glands by great attention and proper diet and warmth such a case would last out longer than it would do otherwise—if they had been children of an ordinary constitution without scrofula they might have endured the want of warmth and nourishment at the home; but, given those conditions they were not equal to it—if they had been the children of parents well-to do they might have lived some time longer—I have seen cases where children die at an earlier date in the houses of the people themselves, in consequence of the want of warmth and nourishment; and supposing they came from such a home they were better treated at Miss Addiscott's—I ordered cod liver oil, and subsequently saw it there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never entered the home before the middle of August, 1878—I said September last time—it may have been the last day of August—there is no reason for my altering it—up to September all that went on was a sealed book to me—I attended Mrs. Peareon, but I know nothing of her stepchildren, nor did I know Harris or Toohey—I think I may have seen Mobbs; I fancy I know the name—I have been in East Greenwich five years, and since September I have set up a dispensary in Deptford, where I have two assistants; that is where I first knew of Miss Addiscott's existence—I was never upstairs up to the time Kate Smith died, and never saw the sleeping rooms, but I saw her in the back parlour—I have been upstairs since with Mr. Wontner—I never saw the children sitting in the downstairs front kitchen without a fire; I never was downstairs; I never was anywhere except in the two rooms on the ground floor—I dare say I swore at the last trial "I think I was only in the back parlour"—I think this is correct "Though no name of any girl that I attended in the home appears on the books, I think the dispensary has received for the whole of the medical attendance a sum of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I feel morally certain that that is true, and I am not certain we received that; I acted purely as a matter of charity, the same as with Mrs. Fry or Miss Stride, but the attendance became excessive and then I thought I had better have no more to do with it; I did not like the appearance of it, one child had the itch, and they were constantly coming to the surgery for ointment—I did not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150174"/>
               <p>like the general style, we got nothing by it but unkindness—I do not knot which child had the itch—I said that I could not attend to any more; they brought it round to the surgery—it was probably Miss Addiscott or one of her sisters—I won't bind myself to which it was because I was just passing through the surgery—that was about April, 1879—I paid six or eight visits to Kate Smith; I did not attend her in bed—I am not sure whether I attended her personally at all till six days before her death—I swore "I think it was about seven or eight days before her death that they called my attention to that particular case," Kate Smith—that is true—that was the first time my attention was called to the state the child was in—I took no means to ascertain what the accommodation was for the offices of nature, it was not my duty; I was attending 150 people every day, and have had six or eight deaths occur in a house—I think Inspector Phillips came to me after he had been to the Coroner and Mr. Long, and said that they wanted my assistance to get the children away from the home, and most probably I said "I don't see what I have got to do with the home"—I cannot bind myself as to what Phillips said—I swore a month ago that when Inspector Phillips came they said "They had been there with the Coroner and Dr. Long, and they believed the children were all starved: "I said "If that is your belief the best thing will be for you to get them away, and rather than allow any suffering I will give you a certificate with pleasure"—this is the certificate I wrote. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Park Terrace, Greenwich. This to certify that from my medical knowledge of the Girls' Home, managed by Miss Addiscott, at Deptford, I have come to the conclusion that from want of funds and other reasons the children in the home, to a large extent, suffer from want of nourishment, considering that nearly all the children are poor, disposed to scrofula and tubercle, and in such cases efficient nourishment and warmth are most desirable elements in the treatment of such diseases.") I came to the conclusion that I had been duped and that the children had boen starved; I said so at the last trial—I wrote this letter to Mr. Bond from Brighton "Gloucester Hotel, Brighton. Dear Sir,—If I can assist you in any way (in the case of Miss Addiscott), or either of my assistants, let me hear from you and we will do so; if the evidence be correct we have been most considerably duped. I am, Sir, yours truly, Jas. W. Ayres. July 10, 1879"—my impression of being duped lasted till then, but it does not continue till now because my opinion was that the woman was receiving sufficient money—it is not my opinion now that the children were starved, because death from starvation is different from death from scrofula—if those children had had more nourishment and more warmth it would not have accelerated their death—by "duprd" I meant because I charged them nothing and was rather inclined to get donations for them—I telegraphed to the Home Secretary, saying that I considered a public investigation was necessary, and an answer came back to say that they would communicate with the Board of Guardians or that they had done so—that was im<lb/>mediately before the case of assault at the police-court—the solicitor who had been my solicitor for six months appeared for Miss Addiscott at the police-court—I sat by his side once—I was a litigant in the police-court, Brighton, two years ago, and gave evidence—there was no Jury—I am very excited at times, and the Judge said that he did not believe a word I had said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> That was about a gentleman who went to Brighton and I went with him to take care of him and sued him for my bill, and I was</p>

               <p>very excited and the Judge made a remark—I said last Session "I came to the conclusion that the children had not been starved"—that was so—there was very groat excitement in Greenwich when the matter was first started; a great deal had been made of the money that was collected—I received anonymous letters from people which I considered very unjust, and I considered Mr. Besley was at the bottom of it—assuming the evidence given by the children to be true, and assuming the amounts said to be collected to be true, that led me to believe that I had been duped, assuming everything to be true about the nourishment that was given and the money there was to give it with—I never saw at the home any child that was starved to death, leaving out the three that died—they did not present the appearance of semi-starvation, they presented the appearance I should have expected—I never saw that their bones was coming through their skins—I have walked in and touched a little girl under the chin and asked if Miss Addiscott was at home, and I thought they looked very nice—I did not always see Miss Addiscott when I went there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. The three children who died were predisposed to scrofula and so are some of the others—I say so from their general appear<lb/>ance—I have been in a room with them, and talked to them—I am able to swear that some of the children who were removed are predisposed to scrofula, but I do not know them by name—I think to an inexperienced eye a child subjected to a diet insufficient in quality and quantity would show the same symptoms as a child not subjected to that diet would who was scrofulous, but a medical man seeing the children in a room could see whether the scrofulous-like appearance proceeded from impure diet or from a scrofulous tendency I think—I now come to the conclusion that these children were not starved—I have heard Mr. Long's evidence, assuming that the children removed on 22nd April had their bones half coming through their skin, I should not be prepared to say that they had not been starved—if I had seen that I should have said that they had been starved—supposing some of them to have been covered with vermin from head to foot I should certainly not think they had had proper care taken of them—if they were covered with itch I should not think they had been properly cared for—the last time I saw any child in the home was I think in April, 1879—I cannot say how many times I was there between Christmas and April, I generally called in when I was that way—I came to the conclusion that the children had been starved before the last trial—I had that opinion from the very first day up to a fortnight before the last trial—after reading the evidence I have changed my opinion in consequence of noticing the amount that has been collected on the contribution cards—I have merely changed my opinion because the contributions were very small—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assume the contributions to be small as you say, why does that change your opinion as to their being starved?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because a case of scrofula may be starved, or a person in full health may be starved, that is what I mean to infer; they were cases of scrofula—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are assuming that the other children who you never examined were all scrofulous?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly all the London children taken from the streets are scrofulous or syphilitio—there is always some taint about them—that is hospital experience.</p>

I live at the Red Lion, Lower East Street, Greenwich—I was not before the Magistrate—On Sunday night, 31st August, just before 11,1 was standing in Kelson Street, with Mason and Mr. Pascal, Mr. Hollow had just left us and we were waiting for Yarrow; Mason called across the road and said, "I want my shilling back"—Yarrow parted from his friends and met him in the middle of the road and said, "I have not got it"—he then called for his uncle and Hollow came back—a scuffle en<lb/>sued between Mason and Yarrow and Yarrow fell with his head on the kerb; Hollow called out, "Why did you strike a poor fellow like that? Strike me?"—Mason ran away; Hollow followed him calling, "Stop thief"—I had been to the Butler Lodge—I did not hear the bet made; it is a large room.</p>

I carry on business in partnership with my son as auctioneers, at 135 and 138, Power Street, Woolwich—I conducted a sale of furniture at a private house in Shooter's Hill Road, on 25th July—Gunn attended and bid for a number of articles to the amount of 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I entered in the ordinary way; and he paid no deposit—he came to my office on 28th July with five cheques in his hand and presented this one to me—it is a cheque for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked me for the difference between</p>

B.

I am surprised at the banker. There was only a few pounds short of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the hands, and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in on Wednesday. Of course, he had not got that when your cheque was presented. I enclose his letter. This is the first time in my life, and I hope it will be the last. Of course, I do not do any more business there. I enclose instruction for you to get 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Oxenhem's sale rooms in Oxford Steet is where my goods are, but they won't be sold until nex friday. I give you authority for them to pay you out of the proceeds of the sale. Send or go, and see if it is right. Being our first transaction you have ground for being suspicious.—Yours very sincerely, A. Gunn."—no letter was enclosed from the banker—I have received no proceeds from the prisoner—we followed the goods, and they were sold and the money obtained by Oxenham's successors—I have had none of the money.</p>

               <p>I get there always goes to his legs"—he volunteered that statement—I never spoke to him except to hurry him on when he did not look sharp—he appeared very muddled and unsteady, as if he was recovering from drink; but he could walk very well.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Windmill Street,. New Cut—on Tuesday, 5th August, about 2 o'clock in the day, the deaf and dumb boy was by my door with a considerable number of people—I had seen him once or twice before—my brother made some signs to him to get him out of the crowd, instead of which he thought my brother invited him in, and he came in—we were at dinner with Mary Ann Davis—I made motions to him, trying to convey that we would give him something to eat; and he made motions with his mouth, as if to convey that he would have some<lb/>thing to eat—I cut him some bread and meat and handed him a knife—he put the knife on one side and shuddered at it—he would not look at it—he ate the bread and meat and went away—about 5 p.m. he came in again when my brother and I and Mrs. Davis were at tea—I offered him, by signs, a cup of tea—he pointed to his mouth again, and I made him two cups and gave him some bread and butter—he pointed to some blood on his trousers; I motioned to ask him how he came by it—he lifted something up from the fire-place and made a motion as if he was lifting something into the bed or sofa.

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at 33, Great Charlotte Street—I was called on the night of 3rd August and found the body of the deceased lying on a bed on the floor; the prisoner was there and Inspector Whitney and one or two constables—I first examined the body in the position in which it was lying and discovered a large quantity of blood on the clothes which were covered with liquid motion which had escaped with the blood—I could not see externally where the blood proceeded from on account of the dirt which was upon the body, and requested that a woman should be sent for to wipe away some of the dirt and help to remove the clothes—I then saw blood flowing from the vagina, but there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150192"/>
               <p>was no wound or abrasion outside the vagina. (<hi rend="italic">A diagram was here put in showing the situation of the wound, and this part of the evidence was unfit for publication.</hi>) The inspector showed me the small blade of a knife which fitted the wound exactly, but it might have been done by any penknife—I made a post-mortem examination next day with Dr. Cyril Jones—the wound could have been inflicted while she was lying on the bed, but I do not think it could have been done if she was sitting flat on a chair—her clothes were very scanty—her age was 59; the brain was healthy, but almost bloodless, and the body was very empty of blood—there was a slight bruise on the right temple, and a deal of bruising under the scalp and extravasated blood—if she was sitting on a low chair and in front of the edge it might have been inflicted sitting, but I did not notice the height of the chair—I noticed a patch of blood on the hearth, it appeared to be bright arterial blood, which would be the first to flow from such a wound—my opinion is that it was inflicted near the hearth; it was the only clotted blood, the ordinary blood was soaked into the bedclothes—when the wound was first inflicted the blood would flow more freely, and being in larger quantity it would not be absorbed by the clothes—there would probably not be time for blood to be on the knife—that is the result of an experiment I made that night—my idea is that the knife was inserted under the clothes—the whole-handled knife which fell from the woman's body would inflict the wound; there would be very little difference—the blood would certainly spurt from the arteries very quickly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If she had been drinking heavily she might sleep very heavily, and the insertion of the knife without violence might not wake her, but it might have been done by a stab.**********</p>

I am a pork butcher, of 23, Garden Row, Mort<lb/>lake—on Friday afternoon, 18th July, about 2.30,1 was walking along the Lower Mortlake Road, and saw the body of a child in a ditch; I was on the pathway, and I crossed the road to look at some mowers in a field, and on looking in the ditch saw the body of the child; there was water in the ditch, and the back part of the head was partly out of the water—I called the attention of the mowers to the child, and then went and fetched a policeman—I saw him take the child out of the ditch—there were some articles of clothing on it—I saw them taken off afterwards; there was a flannel band and a diaper; that was all I saw.</p>

On 19th July I received instructions to make inquiries about this child, and on the evening of the 24th I saw the prisoner at her father's house, at West End, Mortlake—that is between 300 and 400 yards from the ditch where the child was found—I told her I was a detective sergeant, and from information I had received I believed she had recently been confined of a child—she said she had—I asked her where the child was—she said "My child is all right"—I said "But where is your child?"—she again said "My child is all right"—I asked her the third time, and she repeated again "My child is all right and at Weybridge"—I said "Who has charge of your child at Weybridge?" she made no answer—I said "You refuse to give me any further account of your child any more than it is all right at Weybridge?" she said "Yes"—I asked where she was confined; she said at the Kingston Union—I asked in what name; she said "Alice Ward"—I then left to make further inquiries—I did not search the house—I went to Weybridge and endeavoured to trace the child, but failed to do so—on 4th August I went to the house again with Inspector Shaw and saw the prisoner at the door</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner—on 18th July last I was living at Mortlake, and was assistant to Dr. Mar<lb/>shall there—the constable Warne came to me, and in consequence of what he said I went to the mortuary at Mortlake, and there saw the dead body of a male child—I could not recognise the features; the body was in a state of putridity—I could not form any positive opinion as to how long it had been dead; I should say probably about fourteen days; it might possibly have been more; I don't think lesss; it might be—the atmosphere might have a certain degree of influence—there were no marks that I could trace; from the appearance of the body I should not be able to state whether there were any marks of violenoe; I found none—it was a well-developed child—I could not form any opinion as to the cause of death; it was quite impossible to do so; from the state of the body I could form no judgment whether it had died from natural causes or any other—it was difficult to give an opinion as to its age; I did form an opinion that it was between 3 and 6 months old, probably 4; that was not a positive opinion—I came to that conclusion from the structural development—it was impossible to give an opinion as to whether it might only have been 2 or 3 weeks old; one child at 3 or four weeks old may be quite as well developed and as large as one of 2 or 3 months; we meet with such cases every day; it is quite possible that this child may have been born at the beginning of June; my impres<lb/>sion was the contrary; it is not probable, it is highly improbable—I could not trace any marks of vaccination; it was impossible to do so, it was a putrid body.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector R</hi>). Shortly after 1 o'clock in the morning of 9th August I saw Miller at the station—he showed me his hand and arm—there was a wound on the left arm above the elbow, and one on the back of the left hand, both bleeding—I sent for the divisional surgeon, who dressed his wounds—he gave a description of the person who had wounded him, in consequence of which I went in search of the prisoner—I met him coming along with a constable—he answered the description given—he was placed with several others in the charge room, seven or eight, some of his own countrymen, and Miller picked him out at once—he war charged with cutting and wounding Miller—I afterwards went to Plough-bridge and saw a large quantity of blood on the pavement from there down to the entrance of the docks, about 300 yards—that was not in the direction in which Miller went, but the direction in which the other Italians had gone—the prisoner had no hat on when I met him—I saw the other man who was wounded at the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at Rotherhithe—I am divisional surgeon to the police—on 9th August, between 1 and 2 in the morning, I was called to the Rotherhithe Police-station to examine Miller—he was. bleeding from two incised wounds, one on the left knuckle of the little finger, the other at the back of the same arm, below the shoulder—that was nearly four inches long; it was not very deep; it had exposed the muscle both wounds were bleeding very much—I dressed them—he was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw a knife afterwards at the police-court—such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">produoed</hi>) would produce the wounds, but it would also produce much more severe wounds—from such a formidable weapon as this I should expect to find more severe wounds—I never saw a foreign sailor carry such a knife as this.</p>
