I was a servant at the Walhalla from September till the middle of October—I have been there occasionally since to see the waiters—I think I was there in December, but it was after the performance was over-Mr. Pridmore was there up to October; I did not receive orders from him, but from Mr. Wolfe—I believe Pridmore was the proprietor—he had a private room on the establishment—I have seen him walking about while the music and dancing was going on, superintending—the Company paid me—they were ladies and gentlemen—Mr. Wolfe made me waiter there—I served the Com<lb/>pany with ices, champagne, and refreshment—there was dancing and music—I never heard Pridmore give orders in my capacity, I have in the decorative department.</p>

               <p>noticed that they were confused, but I saw no parcel—it was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning—when we got to Lea-bridge, I saw John Love lean over and whisper to Hill; Hill stooped, picked up a bag, and got out of the carriage—the two prisoners were sitting on the same form, but there was a woman between them—I knew the prisoners, and they knew me—I followed Hill, saw a ham, and asked where he got it—he said he bought it in London; I put him into the train again, and Thomas Love was there, but John Love was gone—I asked Hill again where he bought the ham, if he could name the street or the person—he said he should tell me nothing more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oilman, in partnership with Thomas Hopkins, at 20, Greek-street—the prisoner was our porter. On 14th May I spoke to a constable about him—he left that afternoon as usual to his tea, about five o'clock—I and the constable followed him to his lodgings 4, Regent's-place—I asked him what he had done with the oil he had taken from the shop—he pointed to a jug behind him, with two pint cans draining into it, and said, "There it is"—I found a quart there, sufficient to fill the two cans—on turning up the bedstead we found a large quantity of colour called litharge, and Brunswick green, in five or six bags, and a small quantity of Prussian blue; also an empty quart can, with our name and address on it—he denied some of the things being ours—I said, "You had better say the colours are not ours;" and he said, "No, I can't say that; they are yours."</p>

On the evening of 6th June tie prisoner was brought to me by Benning, who delivered to me a letter, and, in consequence of what he told me, I asked the prisoner what explanation he had to give—he said he did not place the letter there in the first instance, that he went down to the water-closet about four o'clock, saw a piece of paper through the partition of the cistern, put his hand there, and found it to be a letter, that he felt it, and noticed that it contained money, and he put it back for an improper purpose, and when he came in at six, he went down for it, as he intended stealing it, and threw it into the cistern—I then gave his into Peak's custody, and gave him the letter—I wrote down what he said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, in Laurence Pountney-lane. The prisoner has been in my service as clerk for sixteen or eighteen month—I am not in the habit of paying my tradesmen through the prisoner br checks—I generally draw checks for the office and for the house; they would frequently pass through the prisoner's hands—this check is not m; writing; I know nothing of it—I believe all these seven checks to be in tic prisoner's writing, but disguised—none of them are my writing, nor written by my authority—these checks have been extracted from two books; thej are differently numbered—I find that five have been wholly extracted from one book, and two are missing from another, which I cannot account for—I kept my check-book locked in a drawer in my office, the key of which was invariably in my pocket—the prisoner had no key of it—the book from which the five checks were extracted, I left for two or three hours on a desk before I put it into the drawer, and he might then have had an opportunity of getting them.</p>

I was at Mr. Goosey's house on 16th May, about three'o'clock in the afternoon—in consequence of what passed between us, I asked the prisoner, who was his barman, bow much money he had when he came into Mr. Goosey's service—he said he did not know exactly, it might be between 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked if he had laid any money out—he said no—I then told him of various things which I knew he had bought, and that I believed he bad been laying out some of Mr. Goosey's money—he said he had not, and all that he had was his own—I said I believed he had one shilling of Mr. Goosey's, and asked him to turn his pockets out, which he did—I told him to let Mr. Goosey go up stairs and search his boxes, which he did, and from a box which was locked, of which the prisoner produced the key, Mr. Goosey took a purse, and turned out its contents on the table, and amongst it was one shilling, which he claimed—the prisoner said there was about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. belonging to him, but he could not account how the other money came there.</p>

On 15th May I made an arrangement with Mr. Sams to ascertain the prisoner's honesty—it was his duty to get up at five o'clock in the morning, open the house, and to attend to the business till I came down at nine or a quarter-past nine—I examined the till, and found 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I took it all out—Mr. Sams had marked two half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence; they were put into the till—I looked in the next day, and missed one of the marked shillings—Mr. Edwards came at three that afternoon, and he told the prisoner he had got a shilling of mine, and to turn his pockets out—he did so, but the missing shilling was not there—we went up stairs, and 1 told the prisoner to unlock his box, which he did—I turned his coat over, and took his purse out, and in the purse I found the marked shilling—we told him that was the shilling we missed—he said all the money that was there was his own, and he could not account for it—this is the shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father; we are shoemakers, and have a shop at 25, Drury-lane. A lad named Moon was in our service—he was taken up and discharged—on 16th May I went to the prisoner's shop in a street at the back of Holborn; I believe it is Princess street, near Turnstile—he was asked in my presence if he knew John Moon—he said, "No," but after some time he said such a boy had been there about three months before, and offered some pieces of leather, and some nails—I asked if he had bought leather and cloth of him—he said, "No"—I asked where he bought that leather which I pointed to—he said no doubt the man would be there in about a fortnight that he bought it of—Moon's father-in-law was with me—he asked the prisoner if the boy had been there lately—he said, "No"—he said he had been seen there smoking some little time previous—the prisoner then said he had been there about a fortnight before and asked for a light for a pipe—he said he had been there several times-there was a drawer partly open, and I saw in it these two pieces of cloth; they are about three quarters of a yard—I supposed it to be our cloth, and on returning to the piece in our warehouse I saw about a yard had been taken from a piece of about fifty yards—I asked the prisoner, when this cloth was found, if he had bought cloth of the boy—he said, "No"—he did not tell me where be got it—I saw some pieces of leather on a window-board, and some</p>

               <p>very near the prisoner—they are now produced here—I have a part of the piece of cloth here; this piece appears to have been cut first and then torn, the parts exactly correspond; that enables me to identify the cloth found in the drawer at the prisoner's as our property—I did not ascertain that any leather was missing when I got home, but I have missed some since, I wrote to Northampton; I knew these skins had been sent from there before, and from the eight that were sent, about four were used, and there was only one left, so that three were missing—the leather is worth 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the cloth about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—this leather belongs to me and my partner—I did not ask the prisoner any questions as to where he got the cloth—I asked if he bought any cloth—he said, "No"—I asked him this while I was handling the cloth—I asked him if he bought any of a boy—he said, "No."</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the prosecutor's service—I have, known the prisoner three or four months—I was in the habit of going to his shop two or three times a week—he has several times said to me when I have gone there, "I shall want so and so next week, "or" I shall want a skin next week" that was a calf-skin—about three weeks before I went before the Magistrate I took a calf-skin to the prisoner; I got it from my master's: I had not my master's authority, or any one's authority to take it—the prisoner did not give me anything for that skin when I took it to him—I had taken another skin to him about the 5th May, I think he gave me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that—he knew where I brought them both from—I took some cloth to him which I cut from the whole piece at my master's premises, the prisoner did not pay me anything for it when I took it—I said it was to be made into a pair of boots for a girl, but when I went again in a day or two afterwards I said he should reckon it in with the leather—he knew where I brought the cloth from, and he knew I was living in the employ of Messrs. Kendall—I cannot recollect how much money I received from the prisoner altogether—he paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the first skin, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the second—I generally used to go to the prisoner's to smoke, and it was then that he said he wanted some leather—I did not mean to have any boots made with the cloth; I was only joking.</p>

               <p>11th Jan., between eight and nine o'clock at night I went below with my watch to supper; after I had been below about fifteen minutes, the mate (the prisoner Wilson) came down and said, 'Come, come, come on deck.' I was, standing in the forecastle and said, I wanted to get an hour or two's rest, as I had been on deck so long; the other people did not say anything, they had had a rest before; then the mate went on deck. In about an hour afterwards he came down with a sword, he again said, 'Come, come, come on deck.' I told him I was just getting ready. I was not in bed. He said,' I can't wait any longer,' and he cut me underneath the arm with the blade of the sword. I bled very much, and ran on deck towards the galley. The captain (the prisoner Hay man) took hold of me and commenced kicking me, and the mate struck me first with the flat of the sword, and the captain said,' Kill him, Wilson;' and the mate cut me with the sword on the elbow, thigh, and shin, while the captain was holding and kicking me. They saw me bleed<lb/>ing, and sent me to lie down. I was unable to do any work afterwards. The mate came to me and dressed my arm; and while he was dressing it he said he could kill me by the law of England, because I did not go on deck. I had had no words before with either the captain or mate. I had no knife about me. I never lifted my hand to the mate or the captain; it had been blowing hard, and I had been at the pump; my clothes were wet, and I had no others to put on; when I went into the forecastle, I told the mate I could stand it no longer. After the ship arrived in the St. Katherine's Dock 1 told the mate I wished to go ashore, to have my wounds dressed; he said he had got orders that I should not go ashore. I have been suffering ever since from the wound I received in the elbow; I have been in the seaman's hos<lb/>pital ship, to which I am to return; it happened at sea; the <hi rend="italic">Seabird</hi> is a British ship.")</p>

On 18th May, at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came—he asked for two yards of twist—I served him—he paid me 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he was very sorry for troubling us, but when he was there last he had quite forgotten it, that he was a tailor, and would be a customer if we charged him low for any<lb/>thing he might want in our way—about half-past seven in the evening, be came again for half an ounce of thread—he paid me 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that—he came in again from half-past eight to a quarter before nine—he wanted half a yard of yellow cotton—I served him—it came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then asked Mr. Roberts, the warehouseman, for some silk—Mr. Roberts told me to get it—I took down five or six pieces from the shelves, and put them on the counter—I showed them to the prisoner; he came from the other counter, and looked at them—Mr. Roberts came over, and the prisoner came at the same time, and said to Mr. Roberts, "I suppose you will take the money?"—that was a sixpence—we had no change; Mr. Roberts sent me for it—when I went, the silk was on the counter—a butcher, whom Mr. Roberts had served, had left before the silk was put on the counter; he did not go near it—there was 15 or 16 yards of black satin—there was only that one black—the prisoner had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184906110039"/>
               <p>seen that—he was looking through them all, and I saw him handling that—I left that on the counter when I went out—there was no one in the shop but Mr. Roberts and the prisoner—I returned in two or three minutes, and met the prisoner near the door—I noticed as he passed that his coat was bulky, and he had his arm extended out—I handed him the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he walked off—I went to the counter, and the black satin was gone—it was worth 145. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—I saw him again on 28th May, in Newgate-street—I have not the slightest doubt he is the person—I called a policeman, and gave him into custody—he asked what it was for; I told him—he said he did not steal it, he was only that minute come out of his house—I asked if he was ever at Mr. Jones's, told him where it was, and the articles he had purchased—he said he did not buy them, and he did not know where Mr. Jones's was, nor where Skinner-street or Farringdon-street was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. Jones. On 18tb May, the prisoner came in about half-past eight for half-a-dozen buttons, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered me a half-crown—I rang the bell, a person came down, whom I desired to go for change—the prisoner said, "By-the-bye, I have got some halfpence, I need not trouble you" and he paid the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him back the half-crown—he came to the shop twice more, and the last time I remember Burke's taking down the silks and satins—there was a butcher in the shop, who went out—the silks and satins were not taken down while he was there—when Burke went out there were only me and the prisoner there—I was looking into a drawer for a length of satin that I thought would suit him—Burke handed the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to me; I handed it to the prisoner, I think he was standing just by the counter—Burke said, "I can't find the silk?'—I said, "Be very particular"—while I had ray head in the drawer, the prisoner was very near the silks—I had my head out of the drawer before Burke came back—I had not put the satin in the drawer—no one had touched it but the prisoner—nobody had come in in the meantime.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, of 60, Leman-street, White chapel. On the morning of 25th May, between twelve and two o'clock, I was in Whitechapel, on my way home—I met the female prisoner, and went with her to a down-stairs back-room, at Keat-street, Spitalfields—I paid her 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I took from my left waistcoat-pocket, and left 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there—I put my clothes on the chair, and asked whether she was going to bed—I heard half-a-crown drop—there was then a knock at the door; she immediately; opened it, and the male prisoner came in, put his knuckles under my collar, and with an oath asked what I wanted there—I said, "I came to sleep"—he said, "If you do not go out I will knock your b----brains out"—I had seen to my waistcoat before he came in, and found nothing in it—I slipped my trowsers on, and ran into the yard after the woman, but lost her—I then returned to get my other clothes—the male prisoner was still there, and remained in the room while I was putting my clothes on, and threatened, if I made the least resistance, that he would knock my brains out—he kept hin<lb/>dering me, pushing me back in the chair, and keeping me as long as he could—I was about five or ten minutes altogether—it was just getting light, and I could see him distinctly—I left the house, met a policeman, and afterwards saw the woman; she ran away, I pursued, and gave her in charge—I gave a description of the man to the policeman, and he was afterwards taken—I swear the prisoners are the persons—when I went in, I had a concert bill in my pocket, I have since seen it in the hands of the police.</p>

I took out one note, found them all safe, and put the book back—my daughter and the prisoner were in the next room—I showed the note to my daughter in the prisoner's presence—I did not have occasion to go to the pocket-book again till 4th April, when five of the notes were missing—I gave information next morning to the police, and got the numbers of the notes from the bankers.</p>

On 10th May I went out about half-past eight o'clock, leaving my husband and children at home—I left a box on a chest of drawers in the front-room first-floor locked, and another in the front-parlour unlocked—my husband came to me, and arranged where I was to put the keys—I returned about half-past twelve, met him 'near the house, and we went, back together—my little girl gave me this card; it has "St. Giles's Cemetery" on it, I had left it locked up in the box in the front-room first-floor, the door of which I left locked—there was a pair of sugar-tongs, seven spoons, and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver in the box—in the box down stairs I left two lockets, one ear-ring, with a cornelian stone, and a small ivory box—I looked for the box; it was gone—the prisoner was out—she returned in about three quarters of an hour, and I charged her—she said if she were me she would have the place searched—I said that could not be done without I gave her into custody—I sent for a constable, but did not give her in charge till eight in the evening—she wished her room to be searched, and I went into it, but I was certain the things were not there—I went in again, about five, and saw a quantity of white ash in the ironing-stove—my child opened, the door of the stove, and looked at it, and the prisoner said, "It is only wood-ash"—the fire was out—I gave her into custody about eight—she was taken to the station—the constable came back with me, and the grate had then been cleared out, a fresh fire lighted, and the ironing-stove moved into the middle of the room—I was in the room when the policeman searched the grate—the prisoner was then at the station—he found a small remnant of the box with a piece of the lining attached to it; also three other pieces of lining, which had been burnt, the front hioge of the box, and the top handle, a piece of sealing-wax, an ear-ring, and the bone handle of a parasol—this locket, ear-ring, stone, and ivory box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), are all my husband's—the prisoner saw me put money into the box on the Monday; that box was open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's husband, and am a cabinet-maker. I resided with my wife at Austin-street, Shoreditch—I have been married to her four years—one morning about two months ago I had been up-stairs to work before breakfast, and came down to breakfast about nine o'clock; my wife had then poured the coffee out—I felt sick after my coffee, and said, "I think there must be something in this coffee that is not right"—I felt pains after my meals constantly—blood came up, and blood came down from my bowels—I vomited blood that night—my tongue was constantly dry, and I constantly lost the hair off my head, and there was always something the matter with my nose, I was quite completely gone rotten—in the afternoon of the day I have spoken of, I came down rather quickly, and observed my wife take the tea-cup which I usually had my tea in from the dresser, put it on the table, and when I sat down where I generally sit, she <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the cup from me to her own side, so that I could not look into the bottom of the cup—while she was getting the pot from the hob to poor the tea into the cup, I looked into it and saw some white powder in it mixed with something—I took my finger and tasted it, and it burnt my tongue—it was a <hi rend="italic">retching</hi> taste like, a salty, sickly taste—I asked my wife what it was, and she said she supposed the child must have put something into it—that was impossible, because I saw her take the cup from the dresser, and the child is only two years old, and could not reach the cup—she was in great confusion—I washed the cup out myself—nothing more passed then—two days after I searched the house, and as I had heard that she always before tea had something to do with some boxes that stood on one side as you go up-stairs to my workshop; I looked into these two boxes first—I found nothing in them; but on lifting them down, I found a packet of some stuff between them—I put my finger to it and tasted it, and it tasted the same as that which I found in my cup—my wife was present, and I said, "What is this?"—she directly said, "Throw it in the fire, it is only salt of prunella which your brother's wife gave me"—I said, "I shall not throw it in the fire; this is the same stuff that I found in my tea-cup, I shall have it ex<lb/>amined—I took it up-stairs, and hid it in a <hi rend="italic">sly</hi> corner in my workshop where nobody could come to it, as it was out of my power to have it examined directly—I kept it there six weeks, at the end of which time my brother</p>

               <p>William came to my house—I told him how I had found it—we took it to Dr. Ryan, and my brother gave it him—I returned home and my brother came again to my house soon afterwards in the evening—I heard my brother say to my wife, you gave my brother poison—I left the house with him for a quarter of an hour, and returned home alone—my wife was then in great confusion, and when I entered the door she said, "Philip, I gave you poison, God forgive me for it; you <hi rend="italic">aint</hi> dead yet"—I said, "You have done a shocking crime on me"—her father came to the house next evening, and directly he came in doors, she said, "Father, take me in protection; they have found me out, they have got it all clear against me, they took the stuff out of the house"—I then told her father what she had done, and how I had found it out; and he said, "I don't think it; I can't think it"—he then left the house and she remained with me—her father and mother came the next morning: her father said, "You shan't stop with him," and they took her away—they returned in half an hour and the paint were very bad indeed then; I could hardly stand or breathe, and I thought every minute I should die—I went to Dr. Ryan and described the symptoms—I do not know whether I told him how long I had been so troubled—about a year ago, I observed that my wife treated me with distance—she was always out day after day; I told her she should stop at home—at last I bad suspicion of a man who lived opposite, and my wife told me that he came to my house for tools when I was out—I do not know that he had any tools in my house, he borrowed them always when I was out—he came on one occasion without any cause, and stood looking at my work; and when my wife came down stairs, he pretended to go and kiss the child, I watched, and saw them <hi rend="italic">wink</hi> at one another, and heard the word "To-morrow"—at another time I was out about half an hour, and when 1 returned the blinds were shut down, and the door was locked, and I knocked for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; she then came down stairs and opened the door—she looked quite confused, and as pale as death—I heard footsteps up<lb/>stairs, and asked her who was up-stairs; she replied, it was only the cat—I had no time then to stop to search, but went away again directly—when I came home in the evening, I asked her who was up-stairs, and what busi<lb/>ness she had with anybody up-stairs?-1 said, "What a shameful thing it was to have anything to do with another man"—she said, "Who told you?"—I said, "Never mind who told me"—that made her rather confused, and she said, "Philip, I must soon die; I have done something else wrong against you, I won't tell you till I am on my dying bed"—after that nothing hap<lb/>pened—I could not stop at home, and 1 let her go on for two years as she liked—she said she would not be made a prisoner by any man.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq., M.D. I reside at Dalston. About 7th or 8th May, William Schollenberger called on me and gave me a small brown paper par<lb/>cel containing a white powder, which I afterwards analyzed—I found it con<lb/>sisted of eight grains of common salt and nearly two of arsenic, with a small portion of organic matter—I saw a man outside the gate at the time, but I did not notice who he was—next day I saw the prosecutor; he seemed ex<lb/>tremely ill—I examined him as well I as could—he had principally to relate to me his symptoms, which I could not detect, except from his own information—I have heard the evidence which has been given to-day—such effects as he describes would be produced from the administration of small doses of arsenic from time to time—arsenic would produce burning pains in the throat—combined with salt it would produce a sickly <hi rend="italic">retching</hi> feeling, having a pecu<lb/>liarly nauseous taste—it sometimes produces pain in the intestines, but not always—the falling off of the hair is a symptom following the long administra<lb/>tion of arsenic in small doses—it affects the skin—dryness of the tongue and tightness of the throat are also symptoms—I first gave the prosecutor par-oxide of iron, thinking he might have arsenic in his stomach, and next day I com<lb/>menced a course of opium—I pursued towards him that course that I should adopt for a person affected with arsenic, and the result of that course was that he became decidedly better; that confirmed me in the truth of the facts he represented—I was of course guided a great deal by finding arsenic in the parcel, because there were a great many things I could not get at—I saw none of his excretions, which I ought to have done—he called on me ten or twelve times altogether—small quantities of arsenic would in the end produce death—It is impossible for me to say how long a party might continue to be dosed in that manner—I have known arsenic given for sixteen weeks in small doses medicinally—I had never seen him before—he is quite well now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If a man has a chronic derangemeut of the stomach would not his tongue be very bad? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; all stomach diseases affect the tongue, but here there was not only dryness but tightness and burning, which are not found in mere disease of the stomach—tightness of the throat is occa<lb/>sionally a symptom of disease of the stomach, but not combined with a burning sensation—the symptoms I have named combined would show that the stomach was affected by some poisonous substance—nothing else would occasion that peculiar kind of sensation which he described to me, tightness of the throat, nausea, and a burning sensation at the pit of the stomach, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184906110050"/>
               <p>other symptoms which accompany the administration of arsenic—I have not found persons complain of those things combined where no poison has been exhibited—taking them separately they are common, collectively they are not—they are not found collectively in disorders of the stomach—arsenic acts by disordering the stomach, and it acts on the nervous system as well—I am a graduate of the University of Edinburgh—I am in practice, and am are-cognised teacher of medicine at one of the metropolitan schools for medicine in Charlotte-street—I have lectured at the Polytechnic—I am not a physician of London—I am a member of the College of Surgeons at Edinburgh, which qualifies me for practice here as a surgeon.</p>

PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But if he had told you you would have remen<lb/>bered that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly I should; they are very striking symptoms—I have not got any of the poison here—I have a portion of it in my laboratory, as it was not asked for at the police-court I did not think it would be required here—I first made a solution of it—I employed most of the tests—I did not ascertain what the organic matter was; it was evidently vegetable—I obtained metallic arsenic—a friend, who is a practical chemist, was present when I went through the experiments—they all brought me to one result—the ex<lb/>periments might slightly diminish the quantity, but not if you are careful.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq., M.D. I am a lecturer on chemistry, of the London Hospital, and have been so seven years. I have heard the symptoms described by the prosecutor of his sufferings—I do not think they are symptoms of continued poisoning—I think he is labouring under some chronic affection of the stomach—from his appearance, I should judge him to be a man of weak body—if he went into any of the public hospitals, they would directly say, that man has some organic disease of the stomach—illness would continue for a short time after arsenic ceased to be administered—the illness of a man would vary very much according as the doses were given—if the doses ceased to be administered, the effect of them would go away in about a fortnight, except a fresh dose was given—when it ceases, a man quite recovers his health—all the symptoms I have heard described are more consistent with an organic affection of the stomach, than the exhibition of arsenic—I no not think it possible that any individual could be subjected to the influence of arsenic for a continued period of six months—arsenic produces a burning tongue—there is no taste in arsenic; I have tasted it hundreds of times, it is the opinion of all chemists that there is no taste in it—it is a question frequently mooted in courts of justice, and they are all agreed upon it—it would not leave a metallic taste on the tongue, or anything like a burning, nothing of the sort—I have tasted arsenic this morning, for the purpose of satisfying myself, as I always do in a case of this kind, and I felt no influence—sal<lb/>prunella would not produce a burning sensation, it would produce an unpleasant sensation in the mouth, but I do not call it a burning—tightness of the throat is a symptom of derangement of the stomach-whenever the stomach is deranged, whether from disease or poison, there is that symptom, but in affections of the stomach it is expressly given as one of the symptoms by Abercrombie, who is one of the greatest authorities on affections of the stomach—if the discharge of blood upwards and downwards had resulted from arsenic, I have no doubt that death must have followed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That would of course depend upon the quantity of blood that came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I believe when blood comes from the intestines it indicates a strong dose—blood may come from the mouth without coming from the stomach—arsenic does not accumulate in the system; I never heard that it did—I have read Dr. Taylor's work on poisoning—he is of opinion that it does not accumulate in the system—I am not certain that Christison offers any opinion upon it—I believe there is but one physician who advocates it—I am of opinion that it passes off—the symptoms I have heard described might proceed from the taking of small doses of arsenic—the falling off of the hair is one symptom of arsenic—it affects the skin—I have not tasted arsenic combined with salt—I should not think it necessary to perform such an experiment—there is no instance in which salt gives a corrosive character to anything—I am not a surgeon—opium will palliate all diseases of the stomach, and the par-oxide of iron would do neither harm nor good; I take it to be just like a dose of water—it does not produce any immediate effect—opium would stop the pain—from the description I have heard from the witnesses, and from having looked carefully at the man himself, I have no doubt that he labours under organic disease of the stomach—I have been led to study that particular class of complaint—my parents died from organic</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184906110053"/>
               <p>disease of the stomach, and they had all these appearances, and their symptoms were exactly like those which have been described—the sallow complexion is one characteristic—I cannot say that the falling off of the hair would be any sign at all; it is a symptom of poisoning by arsenic; but, then, hair falls off from anxiety of mind, and many other circumstances—if the man was of a jealous temperament that would be very likely to keep him in a state of excitement, and that is known to have an influence upon the skin—it would prevent the functions of the body being properly performed, and the hair would necessarily fall off.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received an excellent character.)</p>

I saw Groves and Freeland together on the evening after the robbery, at the corner of White Horse-court, Whitecross-street—a party passed them, and Groves asked him if he would have anything to drink—Groves put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out more than one sovereign and some silver—I saw no more of them—they had some<lb/>thing to drink together—the next evening I saw them together, and Groves had money then—he was in conversation with others, but not the prisoners—I heard Freeland say he had let Groves in in the after part of the day, and con<lb/>cealed him in the beer cellar; and during that time be fed him several times with provisions, and when the time was appointed for the robbery, Groves let them in, and Freeland said he got in at the window, and got the things out of his master's bed-room; that he got the keys and opened what doors required opening, and young M'Carthy was there at the time—he said he did not like it, and he would go and get a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> or barrow to take the things away—Groves did not say whether it was so or was not, he could hear what Freeland said, but when the coat was mentioned he was not there—he said, he had pawned a coat for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I did not hear him say where he got it—four or five days after the burglary, I saw <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> M'Carthy with the Burkes—he and <hi rend="italic">Andy</hi> Burke said they had done a good thing—I heard cloth mentioned—I in<lb/>formed Mr. Clementson—I heard old Mr. M'Carthy say he had had a good <hi rend="italic">flare up</hi>, and I heard another party say to him; "Well, you may have a good <hi rend="italic">fare up</hi> because it comes easy to you"—I think this was on the Tuesday, in Whitecross-street; his wife was with him, and two strange men.</p>

On 5th June, about a quarter-past six o'clock in the morning, I was on the stairs of the top shop, and could see into the middle shop where the prisoner was—I saw him take a sheet of metal like this pro<lb/>duced, and bend it once or twice—he then pulled up his trowsers, tucked it into his boot, pulled his trowsers down again, and walked down stairs—I informed Mr. Simpson—the prisoner could not see me where I stood—I had an object in placing myself there; it is tin foil.</p>

                  </hi>. I have one partner. On 5th June, Young made a communication to me—I watched, and saw the prisoner come out of the fac<lb/>tory, I called twice, "Churchyard, I want you"—he said, "I am coming back directly," and went on to where he lives, directly opposite, not more than fifty feet off—I was seventeen or eighteen feet from him when I first called him—I ran and got to the door almost as quick as he did—he went into his own house, and slammed the door in my face—I got hold of a bit of string, and got into the passage in about a minute—I tried the parlour-door, thinking he lived there, and he opened the back-door, and came in from the yard—I went and stopped him—he said, "What is the matter, I have got nothing; you may search me"—I had not then said a word to him—I sent for a policeman, he came, and asked what it was—the prisoner said, "My master charges me with stealing the metal"—I had not then charged him with stealing metal, or with any specific theft, I had only said, "If you had been an honest man you would have stopped when I called you"—I then said he had been robbing the premises, and there was something secreted in his boot—he said, "You may search me"—he was searched, and nothing was found—the tin-plate is worth about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is not easy to miss anything like that from our stock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the North London Hospital. I saw the deceased there about nine o'clock on the evening of 17th May—he was quite sensible at that time—he had two contused wounds over each eyebrow about an inch long, and a few scratches about the thighs and legs, not of any importance—he was complaining of severe pain in the belly—I could discover no external mark to correspond with that pain—I applied my hand, and he complained, on pressure, and his muscles became rigid—he had the aspect of a man who was severely injured, but he did not seem to know it—on Friday evening symptoms of inflammation of the bowels came on, and he became worse, and died on the Sunday—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found a portion of the small bowel ruptured at a point opposite to where be complained of having received a blow, to the extent of about three-quarters of an inch—the bowel was entirely ruptured, and the contents had escaped into the cavity of the belly—there was very intense inflammation around the parts, almost amounting to gangrene—in my judgment the rupture was the cause of death, and the rupture was caused by a blow—it had that appearance, independent of his history of the transaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would not the rupture be as likely to be occasioned by an overstraining on the part of the man himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I think not—from</p>

               <p>the mode in which it was ruptured, I think it must have resulted from direct violence; it would not have been so extensive from straining—it would only have caused the descent of the bowel, not the rupture of it—I should say he would have felt great pain on receiving the blow—I should not think it probable that he could have walked two or three miles afterwards without complaining, although I can conceive it possible—I think brandy would be prejudicial to him, and moving about—a fall might have produced the game effects.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sandwich-terrace, Battersea. In June, 1847, I settled some accounts with Mr. Thimbleby, and received from him a mort<lb/>gage-deed of my own, within which was a deed, a promissory-note, and a memorandum belonging to Mr. Whittaker—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I got to London in the latter end of June—I recognized to whom the papers belonged, a day or two before I came up—I went up expressly to meet the prisoner, in answer to an advertisement for a partner—we entered into busi<lb/>ness</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184906110073"/>
               <p>together as perfumers, at 22, Wellington-street, Kingsland-road—the deeds were in my portmanteau at my house, 4, Great Cambridge-street, Hackney—in Aug., 1847, I was taken to Whitecross-street prison—I got out the same month, and took all Mr. Whittaker's papers to Wellington-street, wrapped them up, directed them to Mr. Thimbleby, and put them into a closet—in Sept., I went out for the day—I returned, and found the greater part of the things removed, these papers also—I saw the prisoner a day or two after, at the place of business, and accused him of taking away the part<lb/>nership things, and also the deeds—I had never told him I had the deeds—I think he denied taking them, or having them—it is not true that I handed them over to him as security for his joining in a promissory-note, or any of them—I remember the prisoner lodging at 13, Brunswick-square, Hackney-road—a person named Tooke was his landlord.</p>

I am the wife of Manoel De Sa Pimentel—I live in Northumberland-street, Paddington—my husband was an inmate of Bethlehem Hospital in 1848—I got him out in Feb. 1849, as he had a wish to get out—I had known the prisoner Simpson some time—I spoke to him on the subject, and he said he could get me a keeper to take care of my husband when he came out—my husband has some money, the dividends on which</p>

               <p>are due at Christmas, or January: Simpkins knew that, I had told him so before my husband came from abroad—when my husband came out of Bethlehem, and had come home, he went to get his dividend, the keeper went with him—when my husband came home he had 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a dividend warrant for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-note, and some sovereigns—on the day after that, he was very troublesome, and we got another keeper—Simpkins said it would be better to put him back to the asylum—Simpkins went with me to get an order for his re-admission—on our return, Simpkins called at I public-house, and he met the prisoner Bond—he seemed to know him, and they said they would find two strong men to assist Turner, my husband's keeper, but they never said they would come themselves—on the Friday, Simpkins came into our parlour, and said, "Oh, Turner, you have done it!"—he said, "What have I done?"—he said, "You have told your mother that we were going to rob Pimentel to-day," and he kneeled down and said, 80 help him God it was not true—Bond and the other men rushed into the room, and Simpkins locked me out—I tried to get in, but he would not let me—Simpkins then called for paper and pen and ink, and then I got in, and then was the money on the drawers—Bond was looking at the note, and he put the note and money into his pocket—Simpkins asked me for the certificate of my marriage; I took it out of my pocket, and he took it and put it into his pocket, that was before they had got the money—before they left the room I asked if they would not give me some money, and they would not—I afterwards went to Simpkins' house to ask for my money—he took up a knife to me twice, and gave me most gross language, and called me horrid names—I never got my money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Nathaniel Tan, of the George and Guy public-house, Spitalfields. On 5th May, about a quarter before seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoners came to the bar—there was no one elm op—one of them, I think Crammond, called for a pint of beer, I had teen him before—I have no doubt about either of them—they then asked for half a pint of gin and peppermint—I turned round to get the peppermint, and when I turned back, Watson was leaning over the counter, with his hand on the till, which was partly open—it was shut before—he must have pulled it out—it is under the counter on the opposite side to where they were—I asked him what he was doing there—he made me no answer—Crammond was standing just behind him, and must have seen where Watson's hand was—I then took 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was all the silver in the till, from it, and put it on a desk in the bar-parlour, where there was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before—the parlour is a little way behind the bar, which is a place of itself—I came into the bar again, and Watson jumped over the bar, went into the parlour, took the 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off the desk, and put it into his pocket—Crammond was holding the street-door at the time, which is three or four yards from the counter, with his face to the street, to prevent any one coming in—Watson came out at the bar gate—I called to my master two or three times—they laughed at me, and went down Fashion-street—I saw Watson at the station on the Monday week after, and recognised him at once; he was alone—Crammond was taken into custody that same night—Watson had a cap on, and he had a cap when he was in cuatody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, of Holywell-row; Fletcher was in my service. In consequence of missing hay and clover, on 20th of May, I went into Wimpress's stable in my yard, which he rents of me, and found a truss of hay and a truss of clover belonging to me—next morning, Monday, I went again, and asked him where he got it—he said it was his, and that he bought it—I said it belonged to me, and I could swear to it—he said, "If it belongs to you you must have put it there"—he afterwards said he bought it if a man in Tottenham Court-road, and he would go up with me in two hours' time—I said I would go up, and if he could satisfy me I would be satis<lb/>fied—he said he could not go for two hours (there was plenty of time for him to go there in the two hours)—I went with him in about two hours to a person named Coust, and asked if he knew the prisoner—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Are you in the habit of selling him hay and clover, because I have been robbed?"—he said he had sold or lent him a truss of hay and a truss of clover on Saturday—I said it was not his clover, I could swear it belonged to me—I afterwards went again to Wimpress' stable I could not find the two trusses, but found hay and clover resembling mine mixed with some rubbish and hay-bands—I had given Fletcher into custody in the mean time—Wimpress keeps a horse.</p>

I was on duty in the West India-road on Monday morning, 7th May, and saw Pedley—he had hold of a man, and the prisoner's friend had hold of the officer's collar—he said to me, "Westfield, take that man down to the station"—I took him as far as the Sailors' Home, on the way to the station—when we got there, he, put his leg between mine, threw me down, and kicked me on the side of the head—I pulled out my rattle, and he ran down to Sophia-street—I ran and caught him just as he was going into the door of No. 18—I laid hold of the back of his collar, and drew him into the road—Bridget M'Grath came out of No. 18 with a night-dress on, with a dark handkerchief over her head, and with a piece of iron, which she had in her right<lb/>hand, she bit me on the bead—I believe this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I fell to the ground—the man I had in custody was on the top of me—I was assisted up, went into the passage, and identified Bridget M'Grath, who was standing in the passage, in the same dress, with spots of blood on the front of her shift—my head was bleeding down the left side, and down my face—I was examined by a surgeon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 104). On the morning of 7th May I was on duty in Sophia-street, I heard a rattle spring, and saw a man running, and Westfield after him—I tried to stop him—he ran to the door of 18, Sophia-street, got hold of the knocker, and kicked and sung out—Weit-field got hold of him by the collar, and struck him with the staff—we could not get him away from the knocker—Westfield got him into the road, and Bridget came out with a poker or a piece of iron in her right hand, struck him on the head, and then put it in her left hand, and ran into the house—I took hold of the roan that Westfield had hold of—Timothy M'Grath was there, and several others—I tried to keep my grasp of the man, but he escaped—Mr. Luff, who keeps the public-house, sprung his rattle all the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you strike anybody with your staff? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I struck the man who got away, two or three times at the door, because he got hold of my legs—I do not suppose I broke his arm, I do not think I hit him hard enough for that—Westfield was obliged to hit him a blow to get him away from the door—I do not know whether that was the blow that broke the staff—he hit him two or three times—I cannot say whether he struck him over the head; be might have done so—I afterwards saw the staff was broken—when the woman struck Westfield he fell down—I cannot tell whether he struck any blow after the blow on the head—there was such t mob of them out, it was impossible to tell—I think there were five or six policemen—I swear Timothy M'Grath had hold of me—this is the shirt he had on (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of High-street, Poplar. Between one and two o'clock in the morning, of 7th May, I went to the station, and saw Westfield—he bad a wound on the right side of his head, two inches long, penetrating to the bone—it was a contused wound, and dangerous—it might have been followed by erysipelas—it was done with considerable I violence—a blow from this instrument might have caused it—he was under my treatment for a fortnight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Portugal-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields—it is my dwelling-house, and is about 100 yards from Francis-court. On 28th May, at half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed—I examined my shop, and missed t roll of cloth, three coats, a hat, and a pair of trowsers—some of them are here.</p>

On the night of 27th May I was the last person up—there is a grating outside the house, which I believe was safe—if anybody lifted that up, they could get down to the kitchen window, which was only shut down; from there a person could get to the shop by breaking open the lock of the shop door—the shop door was locked that night—the street door was fast, and had the bar up—I went to bed at twelve—all was then safe.</p>

               <p>the charge against him when I gave him into custody, I fancy; that was when last Session was going on—that was after Ashley, Fuller, and I had been sued—I spoke to Abraham Fuller about this bill the first time I saw him—I would not undertake to say when that was; it was more than two months, or five months ago—I swear that—I cannot say what month it was in—I had notice of the dishonour of the bill immediately on its being over due—I dealt with the prisoner for bread—I did not know Ashley in the business, I knew he was connected with the prisoner—I will not swear that his name was over the door, for I never saw it to my knowledge—I dealt with the prisoner be<lb/>fore he went to this shop, and I dealt with him there as soon as it opened, about two years since.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On 26th May, at five in the morning, my brother Joseph came to Union-yard, where I reside, to accompany me to the van office, near the Compter, expecting that morning to receive a parcel from my sister, who resides at High Wycomb, Buckinghamshire, agreeably to a promise made to me by her a week previously; as soon as my brother Joseph had aroused me, he proceeded to the top of the yard into Cole-street, which is about thirty yards from my dwelling; as soon as I had dressed myself, I went to my master's stable and loft, to see all things were safe, as is usually my practice the first thing in the morning: on arriving there I ascended the loft, and having on the previous day, Friday, the 25th May, left a bag of rabbit-down below in the yard, I endeavoured to make room for it in the loft, but in so doing, had the misfortune to knock down another bag. I then descended from the loft, for the purpose of fetching my brother to my assistance, whom I found still waiting for me in the road. We returned together; and as we passed down the yard, we perceived a cab standing in the yard, which had arrived there about half an hour previously; perceiving a tremulous motion from the same, our curiosity was excited, and I made a remark, I did not care who was there, I would look in, when to my surprise I found a policeman having connexion with a female; he jumped out of the further door, the female endeavoured to escape by the door at which my brother and myself stood, which prevented her egress for a short time; her person was then exposed, and her dress in a disordered state; the policeman then rushed round the back of the cab, and caught hold of me, upon which I remonstrated; he then stated he had been watching me all night, and said he should take me into custody, and my brother also, and proceeded with us to the station-house. On my way I requested the policeman to go with me and call my master, which he refused; I then endeavoured to escape from him, and <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to my master myself, which the policeman and another prevented. The policeman states he was watching me all night; if so, it could not be in the cab, and his companion, it appears, was quite sufficient to draw off his attention. The facts are simply these, I detected him, and not he me, in the neglect of his duty, and in a criminal act, for I make no doubt, upon inquiry he will be found to be a married man, probably with a family, and in order to save the publicity of the case, and himself probably reported, he had no other alternative left than to trump up the charge against me to save himself. I have lived seven years with my present masters, and have not even so much as been suspected of a robbery, and feel proud in assuring this Court I am both</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of Webb-street, Southwark. On 17th May, about five o'clock, I was returning from a vestry-meeting, and met Bridge and Webber in Bermondsey-street—they said, "Mr. Shaw, won't you treat us to-day?"—I went to the Adam and Eve—the publican is a customer of mine, and Hill has had dinners frequently baked at my house—I gave Bridge and Webber some gin or rum at the Adam and Eve—I had not taken much before that—I went with them to Hill's house, which was in my way home—it is in what is called a court, but it is a public thoroughfare, where I have been hundreds of times—Hill was in the house, and 1 think Daley, but I am not certain—after I had treated them to some more spirits, I was going towards the door—they shut it, and Hill swore I should not get out—Bridge then pulled at my watch-chain; it broke, and she got the two seals and a ring—I laid hold of the handle of the door to open it, but could not—Webber punctured the baek of my hand with a pin, and Hill took off my hat and threw it behind her to the other end of the house, and struck me in my face—my nose bled profusely—she tore my shirt out of my trowsers and tore it in half, and my eye was blacked—I had not done anything except calling the neighbours—I at last succeeding in getting out—I had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—I have not got my property since—I am not sure that Daley was amongst them—they were anxious to detain me, but I said, "No," and they shut the door—they ill-used me, and I called "Murder!"—there were, I dare say, a hundred persons in the court—it was at five in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, of Gravel-lane, Southwark. I went on 30th March to work for Mr. Hussey, in Red Lion-street—the prisoner was at work there on 3d April—he and two others were discharged by the master—they got their money about 11 o'clock—I was at work the same afternoon—the prisoner and another brother, who has got his sentence, came in between 2 and 3—his brother said to me, "You b—r, you think you have got my job"—I said I had not, and if he thought otherwise, to go to Mr. Hussey and settle the matter—he took up a hammer and struck me with it, and the prisoner, who stood by, cried, "Go it, <hi rend="italic">stick</hi> it into him, <hi rend="italic">pitch</hi> it into him"—I warded off the blow with a pair of tongs and a hot ring—I got away from him—the prisoner laid hold of me, we got into a scuffle, he threw me down with my face near the fire—after that I received a blow on the head, and was felled to the ground senseless—the prisoner went at me with his feet</p>

               <p>all over every part of my body, till another person came and took him away—I was taken to the hospital.</p>
