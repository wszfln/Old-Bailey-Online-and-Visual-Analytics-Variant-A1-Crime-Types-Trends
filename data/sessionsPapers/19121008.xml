                  </hi>, clerk, Secretary's Office, G.P.O. In consequence of losses of letters passing through the Hendon Post Office, on September 17 I addressed a test packet to "Master W.J. Currie, c/o J. Plum, Esq., 9, Powis Gardens, Golder's Green, London, N.W." Currie is an imaginary person, but there is a J. Plum living at that address. In the presence of Detective Blake I enclosed this white silk handkerchief with a special design, and these two half-crowns bearing my private mark, and I posted the packet at 12.30 p.m. at the G.P.O., securely fastened. I saw Violet specially collect it. About 11.30 a.m. on the following day, in the presence of Detective Blake, I saw prisoner at the Hendon Poet Office. I told him who I was, described to him the contents of the packet, and after cautioning him asked him if he wished to say anything about it. He replied', "I ever saw the packet." Saying he had no objection to being searched, he produced the two half-crowns. I said I identified them, and he replied, "I say they were not in the packet. The money belongs to my landlady. I had only one letter for Mr. Plum's address this morning. I have never seen the packet." The handkerchief was handed me the following morning by Richardson. I gave prisoner into custody.</p>

I cannot say if there was another letter addressed to that address. In the course of the day Holmes handed me this handkerchief, and Blake handed me a latchkey.</p>

At 8.30 a.m. he went to 9, Powis Gardens and delivered a letter to a servant standing on the steps; it was too thin to be the test packet. He finished his delivery at 8.45 a.m., and I followed shim to No. 1, Hollis Villas, Alexandra Road, where at 9 a.m. he entered. At 11 he came out. I told him who I was, and asked him to come with me to the Post Office. He said, "All right, I'll come with you." Mr. Stratford walked with us, and I was present at the interview he had with him at the office. After the interview I took him to the G.P.O., where he was given into custody by Mr. Stratford. He said, "That is what he says." When charged he said, "Right—which he has never seen."</p>
               <p>To prisoner. When I produced the half-crowns I did not write the dates down on a piece of paper and then say, "They are the same dates as on the piece of paper." What I was writing down was a list of the articles found upon you.</p>

                  </hi>, barman, "Viaduct Tavern," Newgate Street. On September 25, between four and 4.30 p.m., Murphy called for some port wine, tendering counterfeit half-crown (produced) in payment. I gave him 2s. 4d. change, and put the half-crown on the change rack. In consequence of a communication made to me by the manageress I handed that half-crown to Detective Haywood, who was in the next bar.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK HAYWOOD</hi>, City. On September 25, at about 4.0 p.m., I was in company with another officer when I saw prisoners together in London Wall. I followed them into Fore Street, where Murphy entered the "Somerset" public-house, Hopkins remaining outside some 50 yards away. Murphy came out, walked to Newgate-Street, Hopkins following ten yards behind, and went into he "Via<lb/>duct Tavern," Hopkins remaining outside. I went into the adjoining tar and spoke to the manageress; she spoke to Tuite, who handed me had half-crown (produced). Murphy went out, joined Hopkins, and they walked on towards Holborn. As they passed St. Sepulchre's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080010"/>
               <p>Church, Murphy handed something to Hopkins. As they were going across Holborn Viaduct we went up to them; I told them we were police officers and should take them into custody for passing bad half-crowns. Murphy made no reply. Hopkins said, "What is this for?" Two police-constables conducted Murphy to Snow Hill Police Station, while I followed behind with Hopkins. As I went through the door of the police station just behind Murphy I picked up a counterfeit half-crown wrapped in tissue paper (produced) off the mat. In the presence of Murphy I showed the coin to the inspector. Murphy said, "I admit the one I changed at the public-house, but I deny that one." I searched Murphy, and found on him one good half-crown—no other money. Murphy gave an address; I made inquiries—he was not known there. (To the Judge.) I did not say before the magistrate that Murphy said, "I admit the one I changed at the public-house, but I deny that one."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On the day in question I met Hopkins in Liverpool Street. She told me she was going to buy some flowers at Covent Garden. I told her I would go for a walk with her, and she said "Yes." As we were going through London Wall I met my brother with his barrow. He and Hopkins went into the "Weavers Arms" to have a drink while I stayed outside to mind the harrow. When they came out Hopkins and I, leaving my brother, went through Fore Street. I said to Hopkins, "You have had a drink, I think I will go in and have one now." T then went into the "Somerset" public-house and had a drink while she stayed outside. We then went on to Newgate Street, and at the "Newgate Tavern" I asked her if she would come in and have a drink. She said no, she did not want any, and I went in by myself. I changed the half-crown to Patrick Tuite. Hopkins did not know I had anything on me. When I came out we began walking on together, and I handed her 2s. to buy some stock at Covent Garden. There is a little house in Bow Street which is well known for its Irish. I said, "When you get there you pay for two lots of Irish," and I gave her 4d. As we were crossing over Hol<lb/>born</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080011"/>
               <p>Viaduct we were arrested. She did not know anything about the coin; she did not know I had the coins on me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have known Hopkins for years. There is so much against me that it is practically useless for me to get out of this, but in the "Viaduct Tavern" there were three half-crowns on the till, and Tuite swept them off together in his hand, so that I do not see how he could tell which one I had tendered. At the police station I admitted I changed the coin because it was no use saying anything eke. When I handed Hopkins the 2s. and the 4d. I did not know she had 1s. and seven pennies in her jacket pocket and 2s. In her purse. I knew she had some money, as she was going to Covent Garden. (To the Judge.) When I met Hopkins I had two counterfeit half-crowns, on me. One I changed at the "Viaduct Tavern," and one I dropped on the mat at the police station. It is no good my telling you where I got them, because if I was to tell you I picked them up you would not believe me; you would tell me it was trash.</p>

                  </hi>, solicitor, clerk to the Feltham justices. On September 9 prisoner appeared and was represented by Mr. Williams, a solicitor, before the Feltham justices to answer a summons (pro<lb/>duced) issued on information laid by Susan Barker, who gave evidence before the justices in the presence of the prisoner alleging that he was the father of her male child born on (March 26, 1912, and that prisoner had given her money from time to time, in support of which she pro<lb/>duced two letters which she stated she had received from prisoner. She said prisoner was her landlord and produced rent-book written by him. Prisoner on oath said, "I swear that the letter 'a' was not in my writing nor the letter 'b'; I did not write the address on the envelopes. The rent-book is in my writing. I cannot say that I see any similarity between my writing and the letters." At the request of the justices he wrote on sheet of paper (produced) "Mrs. Barker, Erith, Chestnut Road, Ashford," both in pencil and in ink. Ethel Matilds Charlotte Lobb was sworn she stated that prisoner was her landlord and produced her rent-book written by prisoner and staged that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080013"/>
               <p>prisoner had given her money to give to Mrs. Barker. Prisoner denied giving either of them any money. Prisoner was adjudged to be the father of the child and was ordered to pay 5s. a week; there was no appeal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Mrs. Lobb said, "After the first child was born, when the second child was on the way, I met the defendant and he gave me £1 and asked me how Maud was. He said, 'Give her that, and I will see what I can do next week.' Defendant confessed to me the children were his." Mrs. Lobb swore that she lived next door to Mrs. Barker and had seen prisoner frequently come in and out of Mrs. Barker's house. Prisoner elected to go into the witness-box. Mrs. Barker swore she was a married woman; there was no independent evidence proving non-access of her husband.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. Would that be material to this case?</p>
               <p>Mr. Purcell. According to the bastardy law a married woman cannot obtain an order unless there is evidence establishing non-access of the husband. At the close of the case for the complainant the submission was made to the jus<lb/>tices that the law required that for the case to be established. The justices overruled the objection and said there was a case to answer, and it was upon that decision—a wrong decision—that the defendant was called into the witness-box.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. If your contention is correct (and I am far from saying that it is not correct) as to access, the proper course would have been to say, "I am not going to take the case any further, I shall appeal to the Quarter Sessions."</p>
               <p>Mr. Purcell. I should have adopted that course, but we are here confronted with a charge of perjury which this man was put in a position to commit upon a bad ruling by the justices.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. If there is anything in your point of law you must take it elsewhere. I shall hold that the evidence given by this prisoner which the indictment charges to have been perjured was evidence given in "a judicial proceeding," and it will be for the jury simply to say whether he made the statements upon oath, knowing they were false.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination continued. The justices ordered that prisoner should be prosecuted for perjury with regard to the writing of the letters the payment of the money not with regard to the paternity of the child. Prisoner in his evidence admitted that he had paid Mrs. Barker money, but he said, "I swear I am not the father of the child and I did not have connection with the complainant in June, 1911, or since. I think it will be a job to say who the father of the child is." Under cross-examination he said, "I have had connection with Mrs. Barker previous to June of 1911."</p>

                  </hi>, wife of Ernest Seymour Barker, Erith, Chestnut Row, Ashford. I have been living apart from my husband for nearly seven years. I have no idea where he is; I have not seen him for six years. On August, 27 I took out a summons against prisoner, alleging that he was the father of my male child born on March 26, 1912. The case was tried on September 9; I gave evidence and put in two letters (pro<lb/>duced). I know prisoner's handwriting well; those two Letters are his writing:" Dear M. I send you all the 'blank' that I can manage this week. I am not allowed to have any until this affair is all over. Mother and Mrs. Austin did not go out last Saturday, and do not know whether they will do so this. However, you keep quiet, and I dare say some arrangement can be made somehow. Nil desperados. P. He always used to call me "Maud." Enclosed was a postal order for 7s. Before receiving that letter I met prisoner that morning (July 19) on his way to the station; as he passed me he said, "There is a letter in the post for you." The following day I met him again, and he gave me 3s., making up 10s. for the week. He asked me if I had destroyed the letter. I said I had not; he asked me to burn it; I promised to do so, but did not. On the following Wednesday or Thursday I received letter produced through the post; it is in prisoner's writing; "I shall in all probability be able to meet you to-night at 9 o'clock, Wednesday, on Clock House Bridge. P." I met him there, and we spent an hour together. He asked me to burn, the letter; I promised to do so, but did not. Prisoner is my landlord; I produce rent-book partly written by him in my presence. My rent was 7s. a week; although I never paid it, prisoner used to give me a receipt. He was in the habit of giving me money for his children.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Next Christmas I shall have known prisoner three years. Besides these two letters which I produced I only received from him little notes containing money which he used to slip through the letter-box, which I have not kept. One of those notes said, "Squalls at home." Prisoner has been married 15 or 16 years; his wife is the owner of independent property. I understood he did not want his wife to know that he was having any Acquaintance with me.</p>
               <p>I know his wife; some time ago we were on friendly terms. I met prisoner in the busiest road in Ashford; he was with his wife; as they were crossing the road he spoke to me "While his wife was not looking. He told me there was a letter in the post for me. On two or three occasions prisoner gave me money in the presence of Mrs. Lobb. He only gave me one postal order; that was blank, and I probably cashed it with a tradesman.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I go out charing. I am not an expert in hand<lb/>writing; I have had very little experience of handwriting. I am quite</p>

               <p>sure I have not made a mistake about prisoner's handwriting. (To the Judge.) Prisoner has given me money and told me to give it to Mrs. Lobb. He twice gave me a sovereign since March 26, 1912. I have seen him (give Mrs. Barker money nearly every Saturday night since March 26.</p>
               <p>The Recorder ruled that the jury only consider the assignment of perjury with regard to the payment of money; there was not the necessary evidence of two witnesses with regard to the other assignments.</p>

I once saw Mrs. Barker in High Street, Ashford, when I was with my wife, but I did not speak to her. I have never written her any letter.

Mr. Langdon had made a communication to us with regard to it. I walked towards the door with a view to detaining the prisoner. On the way I showed the manager the cheque. In answer to a statement I made to him he said, "Is it?"Prisoner, who must have heard this, bolted. I and another clerk, Murdoch, followed him, and Murdoch stopped him. I did not lose sight of him. He said, "All right, I shall not run away." We gave him into custody.</p>

When charged at 6.30 p.m. with forging and uttering this cheque he said, "I plead not guilty to forging it. I was sent down with it." On the following morning he said he wanted to make a statement. I cautioned him, and he said, "Yesterday about ten o'clock, as I was coming away from Maple's, I walked along Tottenham Court Road. I then went into the 'Horseshoe' public-house, where I saw two men in the bar. One nodded to me and said, 'Aren't you doing anything?' I said, 'I finished up last Friday.' The other one said, 'Perhaps he will take the thing down for you if you are going to stop here to see Alf.' The tall man said to me, 'If you have nothing to do, you might take this for me (producing a cheque). He will go down with you.' He did so, and when near the bank he gave me a cheque and told me to go and get it cashed. Previous to this in the 'Horseshoe' public-house the tall man said, 'I cannot go down, as I have already overdrawn my account by a few pounds.' When near the bank I gave some keys to him and said, 'If anything happens, give these keys to my wife,' and I gave him my address. I was to have £2 for my trouble." I went to the address—6, Ogle Street—which he gave me. His wife opened the door. I received this envelope (Ex. 2), bearing that address. She took the key from the room which he occupied and gave it to me.</p>

He did not notice it, so I walked to the ledgers at the back and gave him another signal. I returned, to the counter and asked Fletcher how he would have the cheque. The other man had then gone. Fletcher said he would have half and half. A constable came in and prisoner was arrested, The cheque was for £50 10s.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">ALBERT ORCHARD</hi>, 518 G. About 12 p.m. on september 9 I was called to this bank, where Fletcher was given into</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080018"/>
               <p>my custody. He said, "If you look outside, you will see a man in a grey suit." I found no such man. On the way to the station he said, "Some man dressed in a blue suit and a bowler hat gave it to me to change."</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY GARRARD</hi>, G Division. At the station Fletcher said he wished to explain how he came by the cheque. He said, "This morning I was out with my landlord, Mr. Hartard, look<lb/>ing for work, and when in Cleveland Street I saw Mr. Thomas White, who on Saturday night asked me to meet him there this morning, saying he had a little job for me to do. White gave me that cheque and asked me to go to the bank and get it cashed. He came with me and showed me where the bank was. On the way he gave me this pocket-book (Ex. 2, which he took from his pocket) and told me to put the cheque into it and when I go to the bank to take the case out of my pocket and then present the cheque, as it would look better, and to say that I wanted the money half and half, and if you are asked who sent you, say Mr. Hart. White came inside the bank with me, and as soon as I put down the cheque he walked out of the bank saying, 'Meet me at the "British Lion, "Huntley Street.' There was some other man with him when I met White White lives at a barber's shop named Ross in Crawford Street." I went to Huntly Street, where, opposite the "British Queen," I saw White with six others. On seeing me they disappeared. The next morning I went to 41, Paddington Street (which is a continuation of Crawford Street), the shop of a barber named Ross, where I saw him. I told him what Fletcher had said about him. He said, "I did not see Fletcher yes<lb/>terday. I have never seen that cheque before and I have never seen that pocket-case before. I had shown him the cheque and case. I took him to the station, where I confronted him with Fletcher. He again re<lb/>peated his denials. I then told him I should detain him for witnesses at the bank and Mr. Hartard to identify him. He then said, "I do not want to be put up for identification. I did go to the bank with Fletcher. I did not give him the cheque. Another man that was with me gave Fletcher the cheque." When charged neither prisoner made any reply. On the way to the Clerkenwell Police Court White said, "The man that gave Fletcher the cheque offered me £10 to go and cash it."</p>
               <p>To Mr. Fox Davies. He gave me to understand that he did not accept the offer. His wife and daughter said they had never seen the case before. I have made full enquiries as to him and find ho has hitheto borne an excellent character; he took over his father's building business in Marylebone.</p>
               <p>Re-cross-examined. I did not know any of the men whom White was with outside the "British Queen," but they must have known me as they disappeared.</p>
               <p>White's statement before the magistrate: "I reserve my defence."</p>
               <p>Fletcher's statement: "I met Mr. White on Saturday, and asked him to give me a job, and he said, 'Meet me outside the tube station in Euston Road at 11 o'clock.' I went there at that time, and I had my</p>

               <p>landlord with me, and I think he should be a witness for me. When I met Mr. White he had another man with him, and we walked round to Cleveland Street and went in a pub. at the corner of Ogle Street. In the pub. Mr. White spoke to some more men, and one of them came up to me with Mr. White, and said, 'This is what we want you to change for us,' giving me a cheque. I looked at it and gave him back the cheque, and then we went out of the pub., walked up Cleveland Street, and in that street Mr. White gave me the cheque, saying, 'There you are, you can change it for 'us' or 'them' (I am not quite sure which of those words was used), but I took the cheque and said, 'Why don't you change it yourself?' and he said, 'It is quite all right. I will come to the bank with you if you like, and I said, 'Very well.' Then I left my landlord and he went home. I think we got on a bus. There was me, Mr. White and another man in it in a light grey suit. Going along Mr. White gave me a case, saying, 'Put it in this. It will look better, and he said, 'If they ask you how you will have the money, say 'Half and half.' We got to the bank. Mr. White came in with me. The other man waited on the other side of the road. As soon as I put the cheque on the counter Mr. White walked out of the bank. I thought that was funny, but I still waited. The gentleman said 'How will you have it?' and I said what Mr. White told me. I forgot to mention Mr. White told me, 'If they ask you who sent you say Mr. Hart, but they never asked me that. A policeman came into the bank, and they told me the cheque had been stolen. I at once told them to look out for Mr. White and the other man, but when they looked they had gone. The man in the bank saw Mr. White walk out and leave me there. They took me to the station, and I at once told the police where to find Mr. White and where they might find the other man. They went and found Mr. White; they could not find the other man. I must say I am not guilty of knowing that cheque had been stolen nor uttered in any way, as I always thought Mr. White a gentleman, as he has a good business. If I had the least suspicion of it being stolen I would not have had anything to do with it. The cheque that Mr. White gave me was the only cheque I have ever seen in my life. I hope it will be the last. I swear I am not guilty."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath), builder and decorator, 41, Paddington Street, Marylebone. Over six years ago my father handed over the business to me; before he had it my uncle, Sit Edward White, had it, and before him my grandfather. My brother married Fletcher's sister about six years ago. I have known Fletcher about two years, but I have not seen him this year more than three times; I saw him a month before September 7. On September 7 he asked me to give him a job, and I told him to meet me on the following Monday at 11 a.m. at the tube station in Euston Road, and I would tell him whether I could give him a job of moving some scaffolding away. Whilst waiting for him on the Monday at the tube I met by accident</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080020"/>
               <p>a man named Cooper, whom I had seen about three times at the "Laurie Arms" public-house, Crawford Street. He was wearing a light grey suit. He asked me if I could cash a cheque for him. I never saw the cheque and he never told me the amount. I told him I could not, and he said, "If you can manage it, you can have £10." I said I would not entertain it. Fletcher then came up with another man, and I told Cooper that Fletcher might change the cheque. He suggested having a drink, and we all four went to a public-house in Cleveland Street, where we all had drinks. I did not give the cheque to Fletcher; I never had it in my hands; I saw it folded but never opened. We met a man in a blue suit in the public-house; he was a stranger to me. I rather think it was Cooper who handed Fletcher the cheque, but I am not prepared to swear whether it was he or the man in the blue suit. I took no part in the negotiations about the cheque. Another man, the man in the blue suit, Fletcher, and I left; I do not know what became of Cooper. We walked east along Euston Road; I did not hear what passed between Fletcher and anyone else, as I was walking behind. I never saw the case (produced) until Sergeant Garrard showed it to me; I saw no one give it to Fletcher. We all got on a bus to Goswell Road. I knew I was going to a bank, but I did not know which. On arriving there I followed Fletcher into the bank although he did not want me to. I saw him put the cheque on the counter and I walked out; I never saw the clerk signalling. I noticed that the other two men we had left outside were not there. I then went to the "British Queen," where I met them. I asked them where Cooper was and what was the trouble about the cheque; I asked them that because I found them missing from outside the bank. One of them said, "Serve the silly b—right." I said it was very wrong of them to get Fletcher in trouble. I went to the bank more out of bravado to see if the cheque was genuine—out of curiosity. I was expecting to get nothing out of it. I then went to my workshop. When Sergeant Garrard saw me next morning I said I had never seen the cheque or the letter-case before, which was correct. I was so confused at the time that I said I had not seen Fletcher the previous day, but I believe I rectified that directly after. (Witness categorically denied Fletcher's statement to the effect that he, White, had given him the cheque and letter-case, with instructions what to do when present<lb/>ing the cheque.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Turrell. I introduced Fletcher to Cooper. I never heard anyone in the public-house say that the cheque was all right. I did not say to Fletcher, "Yes, I will go to the bank with you." It is true I did go to the bank, but I went more out of curiosity's sake. When I was offered £10 to change it I did not know what to make of it; I did not suspect the cheque was wrong when I suggested that Fletcher could change it; there was no reason why I should not have changed it myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Goddard. Fletcher did not know me suffi<lb/>ciently well to know what public-houses I used. I met Cooper for the first lime about Christmas time at a public-house where I was doing some work, the "Laurie Arms "; he is a good billiard player, and I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080021"/>
               <p>learnt his name by the handicap sheet. While I have been out on bail I have looked for him. I mentioned his name to Garrard when he took me to the station, and gave a description of him. I have been to the "Laurie Arms" to find him, but I have not seen him there for months; I did not ask the people there where he was. I cannot understand why Fletcher should put this thing on me, because it makes no difference to him who handed him the cheque. I refused to change the cheque for Cooper because I do not like cheques; my suspicion increased when he offered me £10. The first thing I heard about the cheque as far as Fletcher was concerned was when I heard him in the public-house say, "I will take it." On the way to the public-house he and Cooper were walking on in front, and I gathered they were talking about the cheque, although I did not hear the conversation. I had no reason to give Fletcher any warning, as I did not think then that it was a wrong cheque; I had no proof. Although I went into the bank with Fletcher to see if the cheque was genuine, it is true I did not wait to see what happened. It was the other men who told Fletcher to meet at the "British Queen "; I did not know where it was, and I had a job to find it. I cannot explain why the two men waiting outside having gone when I came out made me suspicious; I went into the bank to see it the cheque was genuine, not to see if Fletcher got into trouble. When Sergeant Garrard came to the "British Queen" I and the other men did not run away; I did not see him. I got home that night at 11; I went to the music-hall. I was rather upset about the cheque, but I did not try to find Cooper that night.</p>

                  </hi>, painter and decorator, 27, Clarence Gardens, Regent's Park. Fletcher rents a room from me. On September 9 I went with him to the Euston tube station, where we saw White, whom I had met two or three times before. He introduced us to a man in a grey suit who was with him. We all then went to a public-house, where a man in a very light blue suit joined in. I saw a piece of folded paper handed to Fletcher; when he opened it I saw it was a cheque; I cannot say who handed it to him. The man in blue said, "It is quite all right," and White said, "Yes, I will go to the bank with you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Thomas Davies. I was looking for a job.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Goddard. I walked with White to the public-house; we did not hear the conversation of the two men walking in front. After leaving the public-house White handed a piece of paper to Fletcher. I cannot say who had the cheque when we left the public-house as it passed from hand to hand; I did not see Flecther part with it. The man in the blue suit said when it was handed to Fletcher, "Half gold and half 'smratch." I am positive that the piece of paper which White handed Fletcher at the corner was not the cheque.</p>

                  </hi>, 208a, Tabard Street, Southwark, waterside labourer. On September 6 I was at Nicholson's Wharf, Lower Thames Street, about 9.45 a.m., waiting to go to work; there were a number of other men there, including prisoner. He said to me, "Halloa, you b—blackleg" (I had been to work during the strike). I said, "I'm no blackleg; what I did was for my wife and children." He said, "You are a liar," and struck me in the mouth and knocked me down. I had never held my hand up to him. As I was crawling away I felt a kick in my right side and a punch; I could not say who kicked me. I was taken on the ambulance to Guy's Hospital. I was laid up for 10 days; I am all right now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There has been some ill-feeling with regard to the strike. (The story told by prisoner in his evidence subsequently given was put to witness, who denied it altogether.)</p>

                  </hi>, waterside labourer. I was in the crowd. Prisoner and prosecutor were scuffling together, and I saw prisoner knock pro<lb/>secutor down and kick him. I am quite sure prisoner was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is not true that there was a fight and that both men fell down.</p>

               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY BEACHEY</hi>. On September 7, about 12.15 p.m., I saw prisoner in Old Kent Road. I read to him the warrant which had been issued for his arrest on the charge of assaulting prosecutor, and told him I should take him into custody. He said, "I was insulted, and my coat was pulled off by the man, and I protected myself against four of them." When formally charged prisoner made no reply.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner bears a good character.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a labourer. I was in the Militia and served in the South African war. On this morning I was among the men waiting for work at Nicholson's Wharf. Prose<lb/>cutor came up to me and said, "Jerry, you had a f—lot to say at St. George's Hall about the pawn-tickets." I replied, "I've got enough trouble, and don't want to bear any more." (Some few days previously I had been to St. George's Hall at a meeting where money was to be given to men on strike to redeem things they had pawned. Bromfield was there, and as I knew that he had not been on strike I said to him, "What are you doing here?"He said, "It is nothing to do with you," and went away.) As I turned to go away he caught hold of my coat. I said to him, "Now, you're asking for trouble." He said, "What can you do?"I said, "Half as much as you," meaning that if he hit me I should hit him back. He sparred up with his fists, and swung his right hand to hit me. I smashed out and caught him on the shoulder. We both fell to the ground together; I sustained a swelling on my leg. After being taken to Brixton Prison, I was 14 days in hospital.</p>

Gray saw me, and he nudged Smith, and they both turned into Ruskin Road; I followed them and caught them in Pembury Road. I said, "Gray, what have you got in that bundle?"He said, "A few odds and ends I bought of a man at a sale at High Barnet." Smith, holding his bundle under his arm, said, "I am only carrying it for him; I know nothing about it." I took Gray to the station, where he was charged with unlawful possession. He said, "All right, sergeant." On the 19th the two prisoners were charged with stealing goods from the Society of Friends' Meeting-house at New Southgate. They made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>, 69, St. Mary's Road, Edmonton. I lodge in the upper part of the house. Mr. and Mrs. Brooker occupy the down-stairs and one room upstairs. Prisoner, is my nephew. He called on Sunday, September 8, and had dinner and tea. I do not know if he had any money. My husband gave him 1s. on Sunday night to get himself some food. He left about 9 p.m. My husband has a box in which he kept two overcoats, a blue jacket, pair of boots, and two knives. The tobacco box was kept in a tin box on the mantelpiece. The big box was locked on the Sunday night in my presence after prisoner had gone. I did not see prisoner again till the 18th, when I charged him. On Tuesday, September 10, I went out at 6.20 a.m. When I returned at 7 I saw a parcel in my husband's armchair that did not belong to him. It contained two bolsters. I found that my husband's two coats, boots, tobacco box, and two knives were missing, I saw the tobacco box at the police court. I knew it directly. My nephew wrote from Brixton Prison, "Dear Uncle, in respect to the charge which you are about to bring up against me next Thursday I shall be very glad if you could look over things and give me a little bit of a chance as I have a great deal to face without being charged with your case against me, so if you could look over things I shall be very pleased and am willing to make everything good to you by paying you a little at the time, as you know very well I was absolutely starving," etc.</p>

He asked if she was in. I said, "No, she had been gone about 10 minutes." He was carrying a parcel and asked if he could leave it in Mrs. Kelly's room. I told him he could. He took it upstairs, came down and went out. I saw no more of him. The parcel contained two bolsters. He went away without it. I saw the parcel at the police court. Mrs. Kelly had shown me the parcel before that, when she called me up to her room.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). About 6.30 a.m., on the 10th I think it was, I left my lodgings and got on a tram to go to Edmonton. I had a parcel with a few private things and these two bolsters. They were my own property, which I intended leaving there for my aunt to look after. What John Brooker has said is right. I did not tell Mrs. Brooker I had seen my aunt. I went upstairs and took the parcel out that I intended to leave there for my aunt to look after. I saw my aunt on the top of a tram in Tottenham. I have no witnesses here. I was taking the bolsters to my aunt's because I had nowhere else to leave them. The tobacco box I have had nine months. My aunt knows I have had it; in fact, I have offered my uncle pipes of tobacco out of it. I know nothing about the other things; the police cannot produce them and bring it home to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had been living in a furnished room. I left it the night before. The young woman left me. I was on my own. I did not want to leave my clothes, so I thought I would take them to Campbell Road, Holloway, where I had always been staying. I thought I could leave the bolsters at my aunt's and I could always fetch them. When I first inquired at the door Brooker told me if I hurried up I could catch my aunt; she had only been gone two minutes, so of course I took the parcel upstairs and comes back. I thought I might be able to catch her up. I could not find her. I wanted to repay the 1s. I had off my uncle. The reason I went so early is this: I stayed at White Hart Lane, that is Tottenham, and to go to Holloway and then have to come back to Edmonton would have cost me three or four times as much, so I gets on the tram and had a 1/2 d. ride to the Town Hall. I have my living to get and: have to get up early. With regard to the letter I wrote saying, "With respect to the charge against me if you will look over things I will pay you." I was up on one charge for which I was tried yesterday, and I thought to myself, "I do not see why they want to bring another one up that I know nothing about; it only means showing me up in court; they know I have got to get about and get a living." I promised to pay all the debt I owed them. I have had 3s. or 4s. from them altogether. The letter does not refer to this charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Lancaster Place Strand, with my husband. I am the housekeeper, and live at the top of the house. At half past 12 on the early morning of September 21 I heard some men talking loudly outside, and I went over to the window; I saw a coffee-stall which stands outside every night; I saw a group of men round it. I heard the men quarrelling; there were two girls standing there, and they seemed to get tired of waiting, and they walked partly over the bridge. Then one of the men made it up; they shook hands and then the girls came back to the coffee-stall. There was an old gentleman coming along the pavement from Waterloo Bridge towards the Strand. The old man was then in front of the girls. I saw one of the men strike the old gentleman, and he fell to the ground. I did not see the old gentleman speak to any of the men or the girls; he seemed to be walking straight along; I am sure the old gentleman did not attempt to kick the man who struck him before he was struck. My window was open. In my opinion the deceased man was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I live just a little way from the coffee-stall. I could hear people talking, but I could not hear what they said. There is not much traffic at that time of night. I heard these men quarrel<lb/>ling, but I could not hear what they said. I could not hear whether the old gentleman said anything to the girls or the girls said anything to him. If they were talking at all above the average I would have heard them. There is a lamp-post by the coffee-stall. This crowd of men were standing under the lamp-post between Nos. 1 and 2, Lancaster Place. I could not tell who it was who struck deceased; there was a group of men; I could not recognise them. It was a heavy blow; a swinging blow; I was shocked at the strength of the blow. I cannot tell winch way the man was facing who struck the blow. Deceased was walking by the group of men when the blow was struck; the man who did it turned deliberately round and struck him.</p>

                  </hi>, son of the last witness. I sleep on the top-floor of 1, Lancaster Place. I heard this noise on September 21, and went and looked out of the same window as my mother. I saw the two girls coming over the bridge with an old gentleman; and outside our place the prisoner struck the man and he fell to the ground; the man struck him on the jaw with his right hand. I did not hear de<lb/>ceased use bad language. I did not see deceased preparing to make a blow with his hands or his feet.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080028"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. I said it was prisoner who pushed deceased down, but I do not really know whether it was or not. I saw someone push him to the ground; I was not at the window the whole time with my mother; my mother called me. I saw this man talking; I saw the girls soon after that. The deceased was in front of the girls at first, then the girls seemed to get in front of him; they got in front of him a few minutes before he was struck. When they got to this group of men the girls seemed to speak to them. I did not hear what they said. The blow was a swinging blow; it looked a hard blow; I did not notice which way the man was facing who struck the blow.</p>

                  </hi>, parcels porter at Waterloo Station. About 12.25 on this morning I was riding in a motor-bus travelling from Aldwych to Waterloo Bridge; we pulled up outside the coffee-stall. While I and two others were drinking our tea I saw a crowd outside the lamp<lb/>post against Lancaster Place; two women left this crowd and came by the coffee-stall to go over Waterloo Bridge; the two came back from Waterloo Bridge towards the Strand. One of the women got to the lamp-post, where the crowd was; the prisoner stepped out of the crowd and struck deceased on the jaw and he fell down backwards; he was a yard behind the two women; I should say the blow was a right-hand swing. I did not see the deceased kick at prisoner or do anything to him; I cannot say whether he said anything; deceased fell with his head in the road and his feet on the kerb. I am sure that prisoner is the man who struck the blow. He stopped with the crowd for a few minutes, then he disappeared; he darted down the steps leading to the Embankment on the left-hand side going over Waterloo Bridge; from Lancaster Place he would have to cross the road to get to the steps. I helped to put deceased on the stretcher; at that time he was beat to the world.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. At the police court I said', "Prisoner appears to be the man who struck the blow." I did not hear any wrangling between the men who were standing by the lamp-post. They were about 15 to 20 yards away from us. The old gentleman was about a yard behind the girls; he was no; in front; I did not hear any conversation at all; if there had been I should have heard it. They walked towards the Strand and then the women reached the group of men; they turned round and said something to the deceased; I could hear what they said. Prisoner stepped out and struck the deceased a right-hand blow; I could not say whether it was a blow from the open or the closed hand. I assisted to pick deceased up; I did not see anybody let deceased's head fall on the ground when we picked him up; he only had one fall; we lifted the deceased round and put him down very gently without letting him fall.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">INSOLL</hi>, fish porter. I was returning home by Lancaster Place; I had just passed the lamp-post, when I saw the prisoner and four other men there; I had just passed them. Deceased came along with the two women; they were using bad language to him; he said, "I will give you in charge." They passed quite close to me. I did not hear deceased use any bad language; I did not see him kick or strike at anybody before he fell; I should think he was sober. The girls and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080029"/>
               <p>deceased got within two yards of the lamp-post and prisoner stepped out and hit him with the right hand under the jaw and he fell back into the road—half on the road and half on the pavement; his head was in the road. I should say the blow was given with a shut hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When I first noticed the girls they were between the coffee-stall and the lamp-post; when I saw deceased he was walking level with the girls; just as he got to the crowd the girls got in front; they were using bad language to deceased; they were speaking in a loud voice. It was the swearing that drew my attention to them. The girls did not say anything to the group of men; prisoner then stepped out and struck deceased; before he struck the blow prisoner was walk<lb/>ing towards Waterloo Bridge. By the way the man went down I should imagine it was a very hard blow. After deceased fell down the four other men who were with prisoner tried to pick deceased up.</p>

                  </hi>, coffee-stall keeper, Lancaster Place. On this morning I was at my stall; I saw two young women coming towards the stall from the direction of Waterloo Bridge; I know them by sight; I saw deceased walking just behind them. I heard deceased and the women jangling with one another; I could not hear what they said. I did not notice deceased doing anything to the women; they passed me and went on about 20 yards, where there was four or five young fellows standing; all at once I saw one of them step out and hit deceased; I could not say whether it was a hard blow or not. I saw the deceased fall into the road, his head in the road and his feet on the pavement. I have never seen prisoner before; I saw the man, who struck the blow come towards me; he went across the road and down the steps on to the Embankment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I know the last witness; he came to my stall that night. I saw deceased and the two women when they were passing my stall; I heard the women jangling; if they had been making much noise I should have heard what they said. Deceased seemed to me to be intoxicated; he was jangling back at the women; they passed quite close to me. I saw them reach the group of men at the lamppost; I did not notice if deceased said anything to the men; I cannot say whether it was a hard blow or not. I did not see deceased try to kick anybody; if he had I should have seen it. I did not hear what deceased said to prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. He was the resident manager at King Street; he was at liberty to take hours off when convenient.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">BENNETT</hi>, 42 E.R. I saw nothing of the occur<lb/>rence. I found the deceased lying on the footway; he was uncon<lb/>scious; an ambulance was fetched and he was taken to the King's College Hospital; he partly regained consciousness when he got to the Hospital.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Deceased was not moved while I was there until the ambulance was fetched.</p>

               <p>Dr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SHAW</hi>, house surgeon, King's College Hospital. On the early morning of September 21, when deceased was brought into the hospital, he was unconscious, but he could be roused by speaking sharply to him, sufficiently to give his name. He had two small clots of blood, one upon each nostril; beyond that he had no other sign of external violence; from that time he never recovered. The injuries might have been caused by a blow, but not a severe one; they could have been caused by the open hand. Upon the post-mortem examina<lb/>tion I found that deceased had a fracture at the base of the skull which caused compression of the brain and which resulted in coma and death. There was a big bruise on the back of the head which may have been caused by a severe fall. If deceased had received a violent blow at the side of the face I should have expected to find a mark there. I found no marks.</p>
               <p>Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM GREIG</hi>. I was present at the inquest on October 1. Just before the Court was about to sit prisoner approached me and said: "I am the man you have been looking for." I turned round and said, "Is your name Barnes?"He said, "Yes." I then said, "I am a police-inspector; I must caution you; anything you say will be taken down and may be used as evidence against you." He said, "My name is William Barnes, I wish to tell the truth about this matter; I wish to surrender myself in connection with this affair. I admit that I pushed the man and I do not wish to be put up for identification. I pushed the man and he fell to the ground on the morning of Saturday the 21st. His name is James Mead." That statement was read over to prisoner and he signed it. He immedi<lb/>ately afterwards gave evidence before the Coroner. After the Coroner's verdict had been given I arrested him on the Coroner's war<lb/>rant. I took him to Bow Street and formally charged him. He said, "Yes." He was then taken before the magistrate at Bow Street and remanded.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath). At half past 12, on September 21, I was with a friend of mine named Barney Bloom and two other young men; we were in a public-house just off the Strand. We came out of the public-house and went towards Waterloo Bridge to go home. The girls had already left our company; I had seen them before, but did not know them personally. As we were going over the bridge a young man spoke to one of my friends and we stopped. While we were talking the two girls came up with an old gentleman; they seemed to be jangling; the old man seemed to be intoxicated. The girl said to me, "You might atop this man from molesting us." I turned round and I said to the old man, "You might leave the girls alone; have not you got better sense; leave the girls alone." He turned round to me and says, "Do you want f—g kicking." I was surprised by him say<lb/>ing that. He lifted his leg to kick me and I pushed him with my flat hand, touching him right on the side of the face. I believe he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080031"/>
               <p>would have kicked me if I had not pushed him. He fell to the ground. I could not say how he fell. As I walked out from the others a woman standing by said, "You ought not to have done that, young man, he is an-old man." I said, "If he'd been a young man I should have punched him." She said, "The first policeman that comes along I shall give you in charge." I walked into the road along by the vans that were coming along, and crossed the road and went down the steps. I did not give deceased a swinging blow. I caught him with my open hand; there was hardly any force used. I only wanted to push him away so as to prevent him kicking me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had seen the two young women once or twice before; I had been in their company before. I had not been about the Strand and in other places with them. On this night we met them in the Strand. They had been in a public-house with us. I did not know where the girls were going; I knew where I was going; we were all making towards home over Waterloo Bridge. I know the girls live over the bridge. If this old man had not come along we should have gone right home. I do not know who the woman was who said I ought not to have done it. I saw the old man fall, but I could not tell how he fell; I did not see him in the road. I did not see any blood; I did not see whether he was unconscious or not. I should have stopped to help him, but I was interested in talking to the woman who spoke to me. I did not run away at once at all. When the woman spoke to me deceased was lying on the ground; I do not know how he was lying. I did not run away, I went away because of what the woman had said. I did not render any assistance to this old man. When I went away I do not know what became of the girls. It was just by luck that I met my friends again over the bridge.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I was not afraid; I should have helped the man if had not been for Bloom saying, "All right, I will see to it; you go away, Bill "; and I went away thinking that he was going to see the old man all right. Deceased attempted to kick me; his foot did not come right out.</p>

                  </hi>. On September 21 I and Violet Watts were with prisoner am these other men; we left them and Went over Waterloo Bridge. We saw the old man and he used foul language to us. We told the man to leave us alone and go away and he would not do to. We walked back to prisoner and the other men. I asked Barney Bloom to ask the man to go away. Prisoner asked the man what was the matter with him; the deceased put his foot out ready to kick prisoner. The next I saw was the man lying on the ground. My friend then walked away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I know Barney Bloom and I know where he lives; I have not seen prisoner there. I did not go over the bridge with him after this had taken place. I did not see him again that night. Barney Bloom did not come home with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with prisoner, my brother, and Barney Bloom on September 21. I saw the two girls walking on over the bridge. They came back with an old man and I heard them jangling. One of the girls came up to prisoner and asked if he would make the old man leave off jangling to them. Prisoner walked up to the old man and said, "Why don't you leave the girls alone, sir?"The old man made a kick at prisoner. Prisoner pushed him on the jaw; I could not say whether his hand was open or closed; the man fell to the ground. Bloom went to pick him up with the assistance of two other young fellows; I saw the old man get up almost on his feet and the two young fellows both let go. I do not know the young men. I then went away; I did not stop to see whether the man was hurt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not tell the police officer prisoner "punched him on the jaw," he pushed him on the jaw. I told the inspector, "The man fell down; Bill struck him a heavy blow in the face. After he fell down, Bill walked down the steps on to the Embankment." I did not say to the police officer, "It did not half go a smack."</p>

He has been living with me since that time. He has had recent symptoms of mental trouble. On August 30 I was standing with my back to the kitchen door; prisoner came out and jumped on to the back of me, put one hand on my chin and was cutting my throat with a shoemaker's knife. I called for assistance, which came, and was then taken to the infirmary. I do not think prisoner knew what he was doing. We have always lived on affectionate terms.</p>

There were several other small wounds on the hands and another small scratch or two on the throat, but nothing of any importance. She has now quite recovered. The wound was not dangerous.

               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY COATES</hi>. On September 3 I was on duty at John Street Police Station. Prisoner came in with another officer. He said, "About five or six years ago I was working for George Johnson, carman and contractor, 8, Milk Street, City. On a Saturday night a fire occurred at some stables at Wenlock Road. I went up in the straw loft, lit some paper, and set fire to the place; I ran out and assisted to get the horses out. The next morning the governor accused me of it and got out a warrant for my arrest. I am uneasy in my mind and wish to make a clean breast of it. I have never told anyone before." It is not true that there was a warrant out for him. I asked him if the statement was true, and he said, "Yes, quite." He appeared to be a man who Wad been drinking, but he knew what he was saying.</p>

               <p>Police-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN BOUSTEAD</hi>. On August 12 I took two photo<lb/>graphs of No. 8 gate of St. Katherine's Dock which I produce. The gate is about 15 ft. high.</p>
               <p>Superintendent <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES BILLINGS</hi>, H Division. On July 24 a strike of lightermen, carmen, and workers in the Docks had been going on for ten weeks. I had to arrange protection by escorts for persons working during the strike. Tower Hill was used every day for meet<lb/>ings by the strikers; there had also been processions. On July 24 about 15, 000 strikers marched to Tower Hill, where speeches were made: at about 2.20 p.m. a band struck up, a banner was hoisted bearing the words "Union and victory," and the procession of be<lb/>tween 5, 000 and 6, 000 men, accompanied by police, marched towards East Smithfield. The mood of the crowd was very aggressive. There were between 200 and 300 police present. I followed behind the pro<lb/>cession to Nightingale Lane, where it halted, and then proceeded down Nightingale Lane, which was packed with men and vehicles waiting to go into the docks Some of the men got on to carts and were shouting and booing; carmen were thrown off their seats, traces undone, horses taken out, and the contents of the vans thrown on to the road. I saw a number of men back a railway van against No. 8 gate of St. Katherine's Dock; some men were putting their feet against the van and pushing with their backs against the gate. One man called out, "All together, boys." A rope attached to a docker's hook was thrown on to the top of the gate, and when the hook caught on several men climbed on to the gate; one man was battering the gate with a piece of timber. The gates were beginning to give at the top; one man called out, "All together, boys, they are giving now." I saw Luxon jump from the top of the gate into the dock; I saw him afterwards in custody in the dock with another man—Simson. We then cleared a space in front of the dock gates; we used our truncheons to bring the men down from the top of the gate. When the police tried to pull the men down by their legs, others threw bricks, mortar, bottles, and coke. I saw a van laden with cocoa-nut fibre on fire; the crowd threw missiles at the police who were trying to extinguish the flames. With about a dozen mounted and 50 foot police I commenced to clear the lane from the bottom up towards Upper East Smithfield; I directed the police to use their truncheons. I heard cries of "Stick together, hoys." After considerable difficulty we drove them all into Upper East Smithfield. Eighteen constables and four horses were injured—none seriously. The horses of two mounted police were thrown down. I saw Warren taken into custody by a police officer.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080036"/>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Shearman. I did not see Haley. A good many of these dockers live in Wapping, Shadwell, and the districts beyond Shadwell. Nightingale Lane would be the direct way from Tower Hill to Wapping; it would be roundabout to Shadwell I did not see any women there. (To Mr. Edwards.) Near Tower Hill the meeting hooted a carman driving a van. We cleared Nightingale Lane from the bottom end; reinforcements of police arrived at the top end of Nightingale Lane; I directed them to follow the crowd in the different directions in which they dispersed. I do not think those reinforcements charged the crowd down Nightingale Lane while we were driving them up. When we started to drive the crowd up Nightingale Lane there were police at the top; there were police all the way along, they were hemmed in by the crowd; it would not be true to say that the crowd were hemmed in by the police. There is no doubt at all that a very great number of the processionists were injured by the police truncheons. The crush was very great in the Lane; men might have climbed on to vans to get out of the crush. The men on strike, if they had chosen to do so, could have proceeded in procession through the Lane; those who wanted to go on peaceably could have done so.</p>
               <p>Sub-divisional Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">ERNEST ANDERSON</hi>, K Division. On July 24 I was mounted, and headed the procession with a number of other mounted officers. There were about 5, 000 or 6, 000 people. We went along Upper East Smithfield, and had got past the top of Nightingale Lane when there was a general invitation to go down Nightingale Lane; the main body went down the lane and we and the band regained our original position at the head—we made our way through the crowd. We went right through Nightingale Lane into Wrapping High Street, when I noticed that half of the procession had stayed behind in Night<lb/>ingale Lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Edwards. I unsuccessfully attempted to lead the procession away from the docks.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">HERBERT POTTER</hi>, K Division. On July 24 I was on foot and accompanied the procession from Tower Hill about 50 yards from its head. The procession appeared to be going along Upper East Smithfield; when they had got past Nightingale Lane part of the pro<lb/>cession began shouting; they suddenly broke away and rushed down Nightingale Lane as hard as ever they could go. The mounted police at the head and the band then regained their position. Going down Nightingale Lane some of the men in the procession began using most filthy expressions towards men who could be seen wheeling trucks from one dock to another. On both sides of the lane there were stationary vehicles waiting to be loaded at the docks. Fifteen yards from No. 8 Gate a van laden with cocoanut fibre burst into flames; the crowd was very hostile; I heard cries of, "Let it burn, do some more." We took out the horse from that and from several vans and let them loose in the crowd as they were in danger of being burnt. A man struck me on the shoulder with a wool hook; I seized him and wrenched the hook from him; others closed round me and I got several blows on the face and shoulders. I drew my truncheon and struck the man who had struck</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080037"/>
               <p>me on the shoulder; he was pulled away from my grasp. Several stones were thrown; I saw a policeman's helmet knocked off with a piece of timber. I saw a van being backed into No. 8 Gate; it was crowded with men; ropes were stretched from some part of the van to the gate; two men were sitting astride he gate. Superintendent Billings and other officers were trying to persuade the men to come down from the gates. It was a perfect pandemonium—he men were shouting, urging each other to get on to the vans and gates, and booing. I went to the top end of Nightingale Lane, collected 15 or 20 policemen, and cleared the lane from the top end; we did not quite succeed in clearing it down to No. 8 Gate, but very nearly. After that I saw the strikers coming up towards the top of Nightingale Lane with the other police from the bottom of the lane coming up behind them. It is absolutely incorrect to suggest that I and the other police at the top of the lane were preventing the strikers from getting out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Edwards. When the head of the procession reached No. 8 Gates they were open, the procession did not attempt to turn in. About 1, 500 men marched past No. 8 Gate, then, the flames broke out on the van, which was about 40 yards to the South of No. 8 Gate. I do not know how the fire broke out. The part of the procession that I was with stopped when the flames broke out.</p>

                  </hi>, recalled. Further cross-examined. When I saw Superintendent Billings at No. 8 Gate the crowd was very congested. It would not be unreasonable for anyone to try and get out of the crush by climbing on to a van.</p>

                  </hi>, constable, Port of London Authority. On the after<lb/>noon of July 24 I was on duty inside No. 8 Gate of St. Katherine's Dock, when the procession, headed by a band, marched past the gate; when the hand had got about 30 to 40 yards past he gate the procession for some cause halted and the men began hooting, groaning, and shout<lb/>ing all manner of offensive things to the men at work in the docks. One of them said, "Let's charge the b—dock and clear them out of it." They at once made a rush at the gate. One half of the gate was closed; I closed the remaining half just as the rush reached it. Somebody's hand got caught in the gate; I released it and bolted the gate. I heard cries of, "Get a van and back it into the gate." They appeared to be trying to burst the gate. There being no top fastenings, the gate began to give at the top; I put two pieces of timber to act as a strut. A rope was hooked on to the top of the gate. I went to inform my inspector. When I came back several men were on top of the gate and one man was on the ground struggling; he was taken into custody. Another man had been taken into custody before. I could not identify either of those men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. If there were a danger threatening at both ends of Nightingale Lane the only means of escape would be into the dock. The man whose hand was caught in the gate was not hurt. When I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080038"/>
               <p>came back from telling the inspector there were three police officers inside No. 8 Gate: four or five had gone away with the men in custody. Sub-divisional Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS PEEL</hi>, K Division, corroborated Inspector Anderson. I was mounted, and followed the procession from Tower Hill. I saw two men climbing up the rope on to the gate; to the best of my recollection they were Luxon and Simson. They dis<lb/>appeared over the other side of the gate. A bag of fodder was thrown at me. I asked a delegate to disperse the crowd. He said, "We are not going from here till we get them all out." We drove the crowd from No. 8 gate down the lane towards Wapping High Street. We left some officers at the bottom of the lane, and cleared the lane up<lb/>wards from No. 8 gate towards Upper East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The procession was broken before the van was set on fire. Two minutes elapsed from the time when I saw the van catch fire until I got up to it; during that time I was driving the crowd down towards Wapping High Street; they offered considerable resistance; six mounted police officers were pulled off their horses. We were driving the crowd in the direction of the burning van. The gate was closed before the fire broke out. It decidedly was not the breaking out at the fire which caused the procession to halt. The procession broke into two parts at No. 8 gate. Six or seven minutes elapsed from the time when I first saw the halt till the time when I first saw the flames. I drove a great congested crowd into a narrower space past a burning van because I was directed to do so. I think it would have been a still more wicked thing for me to sit still and be torn to pieces by dockers hocks. The people could not easily have got out the way they came because there was a large number of people behind them. They would decidedly not have had to force the foot police to get out the way they came. (The witness's deposition taken before the magis<lb/>trate was read: "They could have got away as they came, they could have forced the foot police. ") I never said that at the police court. Many tried to get away; they ran in all directions when the mounted men were alter them. I saw Luxon and Simson climb the gate at the same time as I first saw the flames. It would be quite unreasonable to say the crowd was pressed back into the dock, because there was no reason why they should not walk away along the High Street. If this had been a peaceable crowd I should have advised that the dock gates should be opened.</p>

                  </hi>, 59, Wellington Road, Bethnal Green, carman to the G.E.R. On the afternoon of July 24 I was waiting in Nightingale Lane with a pair-horse G.E.R. van waiting to be loaded at the St. Katherine's Dock, when a procession came down. The processionists called out to the men working in the docks, "Come out, you blacklegs, scabs." They threw some matches out of a van. They seized my horse's head and backed the van against No. 8 gate. I tried to stop them, but they shoved me on one side and told me to get out of the way. They took a rope out of my van, fixed a hook on to it, and threw it on top of the gate. Some men then climbed on my van, up the rope, on to the top of he gate. Two disappeared on the other side; I could not recognise them. The men outside the gate shouted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080039"/>
               <p>that there were two men in there, and that they wanted them out or else they would break the gates open. They shoved at the side of my van and tried to turn it over; I afterwards found a rope tied to the wheel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was not threatened nor assaulted. The second part of the procession stopped about Burr Street, about 80 yards past No. 8 gate. I saw the burning van after the lane had been cleared by the police, it was in the middle of the road. Ten minutes after I had been told that a van was on fire I saw the police with their truncheons driving the crowd towards Upper East Smithfield.</p>

                  </hi>, carman to Ernest Clay, Old Kent Road. On the afternoon of July 24 I was driving a van laden, with cocoanut fibre through Nightingale Lane from the direction of Wapping High Street when I met a procession headed by a band at the corner of Burr Street. I saw a van being pushed up against No. 8 Gate. They called me a dirty rotten blackleg, said I ought to come down and not be at work, threatened to beat my brains out and burn the load. I looked round and saw the load was alight at the back. I tried to beat it out with a sack. The police threw the bales into the road and tried to put the fire out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The procession was broken between Upper East Smithfield and Burr Street. I should think it was the traffic that broke the procession. I should think the procession was broken after the fire. Some of the crowd were being driven one way and others the other way.</p>

                  </hi>, 74, St. Katherine's Road, motor-driver to Yorke, Stoneham, and Jones, Bow Road. On the afternoon of July 24 I was going through Nightingale Lane towards Wapping with a motor lorry and trailer when I was stopped by No. 7 Gate by a procession,; I was in the tail end of the procession. I saw the police being reinforced by mounted men, and then the confusion seemed to start all of a sudden. A man jumped on my lorry, gave me a thump on the ear, put his arm round my neck, and tried to pull me off; I shoved him back on to the pavement. He called me a rotten swine for working while the other men were on strike. The crowd was riotous and upset the carmen in the road. Half a bottle which was thrown at me from the opposite of the road hit my engine above my head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The procession was disorderly before it stopped. The reinforcements of police came from the direction of Tower Hill. There was some confusion before the police arrived; the confusion after the police arrived was caused by the police charring the crowd. The police dispersed the crowd north, up Nightingale Lane; while that was going on I saw no police at the top of Nightingale Lane; I was too far down to see. I could not see whether the police were driving the crowd towards the burning van.</p>

                  </hi>, 3, St. Anne's Buildings, South Street, Walworth, carman. On July 24 at about 2.30 p.m. I was driving a covered van containing a miscellaneous load down Nightingale Lane towards Wap<lb/>ping High Street, when I was stopped about three or four yards away from No. 8 Gate by a procession. About a dozen men climbed into my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080040"/>
               <p>van and threw the goods out. I lost seven or eight packages. They were swearing and shouting, "Go in you blacklegs," to the men working in the docks. They backed a G.E.R. van against the gate, climbed on 10 it and got on to the gate by means of a rope. I did not resist them. They cut the near side rein and stole the girth of my horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. About 2, 000 men marched past No. 8 Gate. Before the police dispersed the crowd it was so thick that people could not move. The police drove all the people who were on the burning van side of No. 8 Gate down the lane; all those who were on the north side of No. 8 Gate they drove up the lane. I saw several men in the crowd struck by truncheons.</p>

                  </hi>, 34, Lambeth Road. I am the wife of Engle<lb/>bert Schiffler. We have lived at our present address since May last year; I let off apartments to two married couples. About four years ago prisoner took rooms from me at 126, Westminster Bridge Road, passing with a man as Mr. and Mrs. Davidson; they remained with me eight weeks. In August this year she came to live at 14, Lambeth Road. At 2 p.m. on September 20 she came with a man and woman and asked me to stand bail for a friend of hers named Roberts for £5. I asked her if she would wait until my husband came home that evening. She begged me to come with her to the police court, but I said it was no use as the rent-book was in my husband's name and I would not be taken as security. The man asked me to lend £5, and she asked me to lend her the rent-book. I lent her the rent-book (produced). "Mr." has been altered to "Mrs." I pointed out that I owed one week's rent, and the man asked if I minded it being filled in. I said it was not to be touched as my husband was going for naturalisa<lb/>tion. She took the rent-book with her. I thought it would help her as a reference to get the money. She said she would not be long before she came back again. About 4.30 p.m. she returned with a woman, said she had got the bail, and returned the rent book. On leaving she said, "If anybody comes here, I am Mrs. schiffler." I never authorised her to represent herself as Mrs. schiffler or to enter into recognisances on my behalf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. In August Roberts introduced you to me by the name of Powell and you said he was your husband.</p>
               <p>(Thursday, October 10.)</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK HART</hi>, M Division. On September 20, John Roberts appeared before the magistrate at the Tower Bridge Police Court charged with larceny. He was remanded till the 26th, bail being fixed in one surety of £5. It was not forthcoming and he was taken to Brixton. Exhibit 2 was handed to me that afternoon. (An examination on oath of person offering herself as surety, stating that her name was Kate schiffler, that she lived at 39, Lambeth Road, being a weekly tenant at 26s. a week, and that she was worth £5. Signed, "Kate schiffler. ") Later I saw prisoner, who stated she was Kate schiffler. In the witness-box she swore to the statements she had made in Exhibit 2. She handed this rent book (Exhibit 1) to the magistrate, who accepted her as a surety.</p>

               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">ALBERT HEARN</hi>, M Division. On the afternoon of September 20 I went to Brixton Prison where I saw prisoner. I said to her, "Is your name Mrs. schiffler?"and she said, "Yes." I said, "Do you live at 34, Lambeth Road?"She said, "That is so." I said, "Enquiries have been made and I have reasons to be<lb/>lieve that you are not Mrs. schiffler, and that you have made a false statement before the magistrate at Tower Bridge Police Court this afternoon as regards one named Roberts." She said, "That is wrong altogether." When subsequently charged she gave the same name and address; she made no reply. On the morning of the 26th she said that her name was Kate Roberts, and she lived at 14, Lambeth Road.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of Thomas Cofield Parker, dentist, 117, Borough Road. On September 19 about 10 p.m. I was with my husband in the "Obelisk" public-house when prisoners came in to<lb/>gether. They started speaking to us; the woman said the man was her husband and that she had four children. Someone put a penny in the automatic piano. My husband said, "That is a very nice waltz. Shall we have it?"I put this bag (produced) on the counter behind John Roberts, and we waltzed to the end of the bar. The proprietor stopped us. As I came back I saw the bag being pushed first by the woman and then by the man to the place where I had put it. I opened the bag and found this little purse (produced) in the pocket of the bag upside down. Two half-crowns and a shilling which I had last seen when in the public-house were missing. I said to them, "One of you has got it." The woman said, "Do you accuse my husband?"I said, "Well, one of you has got it." She said, "Do you accuse me?"I said, "One of you has got it." She went out saying, "I will go out and fetch a constable," she never returned. Roberts said, "I don't know the woman." My husband went for a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080043"/>
               <p>policeman and I followed him. Roberts followed, and the constable who was outside said we had all batter come to the station. On the way Roberts said, "I don't know this woman. I picked her up as a prostitute in the London Road."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by John Roberts. We were not dancing when you came in. I co not remember the proprietress stopping us when there was a man playing the piano; we were only stopped once by the pro<lb/>prietor. We were not dancing there in the afternoon. You went quite voluntarily to the station: I saw you push the bag with your elbow. There were a number of people in the bar, but they were right up at the other end.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I last saw my money in the purse when prisoners were in the bar and while we were in conversation with them.</p>

               <p>To John Roberts. We had not been dancing before you came in. We were in the bar that afternoon but we did not dance. There were a number of people in the bar that evening, but they were quite at the other end; the four of us were alone in the corner. I do not remember being stopped dancing twice that evening. When I spoke to the constable and you came out you did not attempt to get away. I did not while in the public-house see the money in my wife's purse, but I knew it was there because I had given it to her just before leaving home. I remember that she opened the bag to get her hand<lb/>kerchief out, but I did not see her look in her purse. I was perfectly sober and capable of seeing you move the bag with your elbow.</p>

                  </hi>, manager, "Obelisk" public-house, St. George's Circus. On the evening of September 19 I was in the billiard room when in consequence of a communication made to me I went into the bar and saw Mr. and Mrs. Parker were waltzing. I stopped them. The male prisoner was standing and the female prisoner was sitting at the counter in the corner. When Mrs. Parker discovered her money was gone she accused both parties of taking it. The female prisoner, who became indignant, left the bar to fetch a constable. The rest were asked to leave and they left.</p>
               <p>To John Roberts. When stopping the dancing I also stopped a man who was playing the piano. I cannot say whether my wife had stopped them once before. I know you as a casual customer. The neares tpeople to you, were two or three yards away.</p>

On the evening of Sep<lb/>tember 19 I was called to the "Obelisk" public-house by Parker, who wanted me to take the name and address of male prisoner, who was present; he did not charge him with anything. I asked them all to come to the station, and on the way the male prisoner said he did not know the woman—only as a prostitute.</p>

               <p>John Roberts confessed to a previous conviction at Newington Ses<lb/>sions on August 15 of this year, when he was sentenced to nine months' hard labour for larceny from the person. A conviction in 1908 for a similar offence was proved. He had refused to give any account of himself; he was stated to be an associate of prostitutes and a prosti<lb/>tute's bully; he had been seen out as late as two or three in the morn<lb/>ing; he cohabited with female prisoner, a prostitute, who was convicted in December last year of robbing a drunken person.</p>
               <p>John Roberts, to refute the statement that he was a prostitute's bully, recalled Lucy Lambert, who stated that she had never known him to come in later than 1 a.m.</p>

                  </hi>, Roland Gardens, South Kensington. I drew the cheque produced. The words "pay cash" and the signature across the cheque is a forgery. I made the cheque out for £8. The "0" making it £80 is not mine. I posted it to Wellington and Bowring on September 30 about 11 p.m. aft the pillar-box in Evelyn Gardens. On October 2 I was summoned to the bank. The cashier asked me in pri<lb/>soner's presence if I had made out the cheque. I said, "Not in its present condition," or words to that effect.</p>

                  </hi>, cashier, Bonk of scotland. On October 2, about 1.40 p.m., prisoner came to my counter and handed me this cheque. I was suspicious of the crossing, especially as I know Mr. Rowe pretty well, I made an excuse to prisoner that I was engaged for the moment. I then went and saw one of our managers and after<lb/>wards phoned to Mr. Rowe, who came along. In reply to my questions he denied writing the signatures across the cheque, the "pay cash," and the "£80." In the manager's room I asked prisoner where he got the cheque. He said he got it from a man named Gillings in the "Victoria," King's Cross, in repayment of a loan of £4 which he had lent four yearns ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">PRISONER</hi>. I told him I accepted it in lieu of a £4 bet, not a loan. Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">ALFRED ANDERSON</hi>, City Police. On October 2 I was called to the Bank of scotland, 30, Bishopsgate Street, at about 2.20 p.m. I was accompanied by Inspector Chapman. Prisoner was there. The manager showed us the cheque. I told prisoner we were police officers and cautioned Mm. I then said, "Can you give us any explanation, how you received this cheque." He said, "I got the cheque from a man named Gillings at 11 this morning in the 'Victoria Hotel,' Penton<lb/>ville Road. I had a row with Callings. He owed me £4 for a bet</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080046"/>
               <p>made at Hurst Park races four years ago. Gillings said, 'We don't want to quarrel, take this—that is the cheque—' and there is some<lb/>thing in interest, for you.' I thought the cheque was for £8." He was then given into custody by the bank manager. On the way to the station he said to me, "I hope you will find this man Gillings; I had a fight with him in the long bar of the 'Victoria Hotel' before he gave me the cheque." At the station he said, "I thought the cheque was for £8. I have to meet Gillings at the 'Victoria Hotel' to-night at nine o'clock and give, him the balance." We went to 220, Great Portland Street, where we examined the letter-box and found it had been tampered with. Prisoner gave an address but we found that he had never lived there. I went with Inspector Chapman to the Victoria Hotel at 9 p.m. and waited till 10.30, but failed to find Gillings. We do not know who Gillings is. (Prisoner: I said to you, "It very nigh came to a fight." I did not say it did come to a fight. I said it would come to a fight; he told me he would pay me somewhere or another. They stopped it. He said, "Come outside and I will pay you. ") You said you had a fight. (Prisoner: I did not give you No. 6, Stanhope Buildings; I gave you No. 3. I lived there eight months. I have the lady in the house and three others to prove it.)</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath). On September 30, the date this cheque was supposed to have been delivered, I was in bed before 11 at night. Next morning was pension day. I daresay I came out between 8 and 9 next morning. I came down Stanhope Street where I live, and I met three pensioners whom I am going to call. We go in and have a drink. We draw our pension and went from one house to the other and are together all day till some time later in the afternoon. I do not know what time. I got intoxicated. I was taken home by these three men. They put me in the mangling room out of the way; then the landlord, landlady, and the lady living in the house took care of me and took me up to my room. I never came out till the following morning at 10 or half past. I felt bad and went in the "Graf ton" and asked for half a pint of ale. I only had 2d. on me. I went out again and walked to tire "Victoria." I was on my way to Mr. Irving, a builder and decorator, to see tie foreman named Gammon to see if there was any work going. I thought to myself, "I will go in the "Victoria" and have the other half pint, it might make me feel better." There were several men standing there, one was a man I knew by the name of Gillings, whom I had seen at different race meetings. I go to Epsom and Hurst Park once a year.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080047"/>
               <p>I said to him, "Ain't your name Gillings?"He said, "I don't know you." I said, "You soon will." I got very excited. He said, "What for?"I said, "For the money you owe me for Hurst Park four years ago. You remember quite well—when I backed the second favourite when I had a pound at 3 to 1; you went away and I have not seen you since." He said, "Yes, I recollect the time quite well when you come to speak of the second favourite; keep quiet, I will pay you; come outside." I went outside, leaving the half pint of ale I called for on the counter not touched. When I got outside he showed me the cheque. He said, "I have got a cheque for £8 sent me by a client this morning; if you like to come with me as far as the City I will cash it and pay you." I said, "Very well." When we got to Gray's Inn Road I said, "Don't you think we had better ride? I have got no money." He said, "I think we will." Before the tram came up he pulled out his watch and said, "It is too late, I shall not be able to go down; I have to meet a friend at the Mid<lb/>land," I understood at 11.35. He said, "I will tell you what I will do. You won't trust me, I will trust you; take this cheque to 30, Bishopsgate Street and cash it, and take the £4, and you can have a trifle for your trouble, and meet me at the "Victoria" at 9 to-night." I may tell you I have worn glasses for reading ever since I was 17. I glanced at the cheque and took it to be for £8. I folded it up and put it in my pocket and went to the bank. I swear I never tampered with the cheque. I had no knowledge where it came from. I am guilty of putting this cheque down under the impression that I was only doing an honest transaction to get my own money that was owing to me, so help my God.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The money had been owing to me four years. It was a bet I made with Gillinge at Hurst Park. I had not seen Gil<lb/>lings in the meantime. I saw him only once previous to making the bet. That was two years before. I met him at the "Victoria" by pure accident. I know his name by his having it on a board at Hurst Park. I did not have drinks with him. I had a few words. I could not swear to the time he gave me the cheque; it would be about 11.35. I did not know the proper way to go to the bank. I went to Essex Road, called at Irving's, but did not see Mr. Gammon. I believe it was soon after one I got to the bank.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">WALFORD</hi>. I have been a lavatory attendant and am pensioned off. Prisoner has been living in my house for perhaps more than seven or eight months. On October 1 he went out at a little after 8 a.m. It was pension day for the Militia or something of that sort. That is the reason I know the date. He came home again about 3.30 p.m. very drunk. He did not go out again. On October 2 I heard him go downstairs about 9.20 a.m. I did not hear him go out. I did not hear him go up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have never seen him wearing glasses. I do not go up in his room. My wife cleans his room. I do not see much of him. I know he went out at 9 a.m. on October 1 because I was hav<lb/>ing</p>

               <p>Mrs. <hi rend="smallCaps">LANE</hi> (prisoner's wife). I remember October 1. I was wash<lb/>ing for my daughter at No. 1. She lives in the buildings and there is wirework in the washhouse so that you can see everyone that passes. I saw my daughter's little boy and he was crying, "There is a man lives in your house, he ain't half drunk." I thought it was an old gentleman instead of Mr. Lane. I saw him carried home that day at 3 p.m. I saw him at 12 and he had had some drink then. (To prisoner.) I have never seen you wear glasses. I think you asked me to lend my glasses once on a Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi rend="smallCaps">WALKER</hi>. I remember October 1. It was pension day. My husband is not a pensioner. I have seen drunken people about and they have told me it was pension day. Prisoner was a good deal under the influence of drink on October 1. They brought him home about 3.30 p.m. I have never seen him wear glasses. I do not know much of him.</p>

                  </hi>, 14, Girler Street, Bromley. I have been walking out with prisoner for about two years; that came to an end on Sep<lb/>tember 22 because my parents disapproved of it. Prisoner did not seem to take any notice of it when I told him. On September 30 about 7.15 a.m. I met him in Devas Street. He asked me if I would go into his parlour. I told him I could not stay long as I should be late for business. He said, "This will be the last time you will see me." I said, "Why? Are you going away?" He said he was going away in the afternoon to Australia." I told him I hoped he would get on all right. He said, "Is that all you have got to say?"I said "Yes." As I was saying good-bye to him he drew a revolver from his right-hand mackintosh pocket and shot at me, first in the head which seemed to stun me. I was right close to him. The second shot</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080049"/>
               <p>hit my right arm; there was then about two yards between us. I turned round and said, "Oh, is this your game?"He fired again and hit me in my mouth, knocking three teeth out and damaging my jaw. There was nobody between us when he fired the third time. I ran into the kitchen. I saw his sister Annie there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner did not seem as though he was angry. He had no cause to be jealous. I was not in his house the day before this happened. I always treated him as a friend. There was no light in the parlour. I was not Surprised when he asked me to come home with him. He kissed me when he said good-bye. I did not see blackening or burning on my head. I was severely stunned. After the third shot I put my handkerchief up to my mouth and ran into the kitchen. I did not raise my arm; it was down at my side. I did not see his brother in the passage.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I had never quarrelled with prisoner.</p>

I heard a noise in the parlour and ran into the passage and Rosie Legg ran down the passage towards the washhouse door. My brother had something in his hand and it went off bang. Bosie Legg ran into the kitchen. I was standing between my brother and where Bosie Legg was. Rosie Legg was spitting blood from her mouth. I found the bullet (produced) in the kitchen after<lb/>wards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The first noise I beard in the parlour was not like the second noise. I saw a flash with the second noise. I did not notice what position my brother's hand was in. The direction of the flash was down towards me.</p>

                  </hi>, brother of prisoner. On September 30 I saw prisoner about nine in my house. He handed me the revolver (pro<lb/>duced) and said, "Take this; I have shot at her," or something to that effect. He said, "What shall I do?"I told him to give himself up. He then went away. I was very upset. I took the revolver to the police station and handed it to Inspector Potter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not examine the revolver when prisoner gave it to me. (To the Court.) Prisoner handed me the revolver at 159, St. Elenor Street; that is about two minutes' walk from where this happened.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">ALBERT POTTER</hi>, K Division. At 10.50 a.m. on Septem<lb/>ber 30 I saw the last witness at Bow Police Station; he handed me a small revolver. I examined it; it was fully loaded. There were five live bullets land one spent bullet in it. I smelt it after I had emptied it; it smelt the usual way of a weapon that had been discharged—a burnt smell. It was perfectly clean. When I took the spent bullet out I found that the trigger was closed upon one of the bullets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I made a search of the house a short time after the occurrence; I found no bullet marks on any of the walls. I did not find any spent bullets.</p>

                  </hi>, divisional surgeon, K Division. I examined Rosetta Legg on September 30. Her general condition was good. She had a slight contusion about the size of sixpence on the temple; a slight discoloration. On the inner surface of the right arm she had a slight abrasion and a slight contusion about an inch in cir<lb/>cumference. She had a laceration of the jaw and three teeth knocked off: The wound on the temple was consistent with having been done by a bullet just going past it, but not so likely as the other one was. It could have been done by being hit with the barrel of the revolver. The wound on the right arm was consistent with a passing bullet. There was a corresponding hole in the dress caused by a bullet. The wound in the mouth is consistent with having been done by a bullet. They were not serious wounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The temple wound was merely a contusion. If it had been a revolver shot I think the skin would have been broken. If it had been caused by a shot at close proximity I should have expected to have found some singeing or discoloration, but it depends on the size of the revolver. This revolver is a very small one. I do not think there would have been much blackening. (To the Court.) Although the revolver is a small one it could kill at close quarters.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">RICHARD NORRIS</hi>, K Division. On the morning of September 30 I saw prisoner in Barking Broadway. I told him I was a police officer and I should take him into custody for attempting to shoot Rosetta Legg, with intent to murder her, at 7.15 that morning. He replied, "I fired at her to frighten her. Is she hurt?"I con<lb/>veyed him to Bow Police Station. When the charge was read over to him he said, "Right."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He did not say, "I did it to frighten her; it fired." He said he fired at her to frighten her. I made my note at 20 minutes afterwards. There is nothing whatever known against prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath). I am 18 years of age. I have known prosecutrix for three years. I have never had any quarrel with her on any serious matter. I am very fond of her. When she broke it off with me I tried to make the best of it. I have met her several times between that and this occur<lb/>rence. I met her on the Wednesday before in my parlour. I had not given up hopes that she would come back to me. On September 30 I met her in Cross Street. I nodded to her and she came over to me and we went to my home. I asked her to come in; we went into the parlour and we were on affectionate terms. There was no quarrel or anything until she said she was going; then everything seemed to go blank with me. I drew the revolver to frighten her. I knew it was loaded. When she saw the revolver she jumped up and ran into the passage; there was no shot at all. She ran down to the far end of the passage and my little sister came out of the kitchen and my</p>

               <p>younger brother came from off the stairs; he went to rush into the street, and as he did so he knocked my arm, and that was the cause of the shot which Miss Legge received. I had no intention of shooting her. I bought the revolver off a man in Mile End Road to sell to my employer (Woodcock) as he said he would like to get hold of one, liv<lb/>ing on the premises by himself. I took it to work with me and showed it once or twice. Only one shot was fired. I have never had a revolver before. When the revolver went off my arm was down by my side. When Detective Norris arrested me he said, "You know what I want you for. Why did you want to do it?"I said, "I did it to frighten her."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We have had slight quarrels. I asked her to come to my house because if she had been seen talking to me in the street her parents no doubt would have chastised her. She has been in my house once before since she broke it off. She knew I was going to Australia; I had told her the week before. I wanted to speak to her to see whether it would be any good waiting a few years. It was entirely a friendly conversation. I drew the revolver became I thought on her seeing it she might wait and go on keeping company with me. The revolver was in my hand but the shot that was fired was a pure accident. As my brother knocked my arm, so it jerked and the revolver went off. I did not tell the officer that my brother had knocked my hand; nor did I say so at the police court.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. We kissed each other in the parlour. I am quite certain of the position my arm was in. (To the Court.) My younger brother would have "knocked my elbow, which would have jerked my arm up. I am not prepared to swear that I told anybody about my. brother knocking my arm. The man I bought the revolver from is a stranger to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I knew the deceased man Carty; I had been living with him for about three weeks. I have known prisoner about three months. On September 9 about 8.45 p.m. I went to the "Fountain" public-house, Garratt Lane, Tooting, with prisoner. He went in to get the drinks and I remained outside. Carty came out of the public-house. He said to prisoner, "F—you, she is mine; I have got her now." and he put his fingers in prisoner's chest. Prisoner laughed and said, "How do you know she is not mine?"Deceased then went to hit me. I said, "If you hit me, Phil, I will call a policeman and have you locked up." Prisoner said, "Don't hit her, hit me." Pri<lb/>soner hit him under the chin; deceased fell down on the back of his head. Prisoner then went away. I saw him again about two o'clock in the morning. I said, "Do you know that Phil is in the hospital?" He said, "Why, what did he want to poke me in the chest and f—me and go to hit you. If I have hit him, I have hit him."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not think deceased struck a blow at prisoner; it was rather a shove; deceased was certainly angry. I was rather frightened because I thought deceased was going to strike me. When prisoner said, "Don't hit her; hit me," deceased showed signs of violence towards both of us. I was not on good terms with deceased.</p>

I went out into the back garden, and in the W.C. I found prisoner sitting with his clothes done up. I said to him, "What are you doing here?"He said, "Relieving myself." I said, "But your trousers are done up." He made no reply. I took him into the kitchen. In the kitchen was the witness Fareleigh. I told prisoner I was a police officer, and said, "It is alleged that you struck a man called Carty, or 'Ganger,' on the jaw last night outside the 'Fountain' public-house; he died this morning, and I shall</p>

I cautioned him, and a few moments afterwards he said, "Ginger came up to me outside the 'Fountain,' and said, 'F—you,' land pushed me; then he went to hit her and I hit him on the jaw and knocked him down and went away." I took prisoner to Wandsworth Common Police Station, where he was charged. In reply to the charge he said, "Yes, all right."</p>

I turned round and I heard, Rose say, "If you do that to me I will give you in charge." He pushed me in the chest and said, "F—you." I said, "Don't hit her, hit me." I saw his hand move and I just hit him on the</p>

               <p>jaw and knocked him down. I thought he was going to hit me and I hit out to defend the woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not say "I turned round and saw deceased put up his hand to hit the woman "; that is wrong. I am not fond of being poked in the chest. I thought it deserved a blow on the jaw. When deceased fell down I walked away. I said before the magistrate, "I turned round and saw deceased so bent on hitting her that I said, 'Don't hit her, hit me.'" I struck him to defend her. I was not frightened of myself. She could not take her own part, a woman against a man.</p>

                  </hi>, painter and decorator, 46, Oswald Street, Clapton Park. About 5 p.m. on August 28 I went to a lodging-house in Grove Road with three watches, a ring, and 35s.; two watches were in my inside right coat pocket and the money in my trousers pocket. I had had a little to drink and I had a lay down. I was woken up by pri<lb/>soners coming into my room; I knew them as living in the lodging house, but I had not made their acquaintance. One of them knocked me off the bed into a sitting position on the floor. They knocked me about in a murderous manner with their fists. I felt their hands in my pocket. Berry took the three watches and a ring and 35S., and Swanson took 1s. 10d. from my other pocket. Before leaving Swanson kicked me in the jaw and knocked my back teeth out. For some time I was unconscious. On recovering I tried the best I could to get down-stairs by the handrail. The caretaker saw me coming down. The police were sent for and I was taken to the infirmary. I subsequently inden<lb/>tified prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Swanson. I do not remember ever having had a betting transaction with you.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Berry. I did not hand you the two watches and ask you to sell them for me or for any purpose. I produce the</p>

I could not say whether he had been drinking. On the following evening I examined Berry; he was suffering from a swelling of the right forearm with a dislocation of the right elbow; this may have been caused in a struggle or by falling. I asked him why he did not complain of it when arrested and he said he did not think he was much hurt.</p>

A little after 7 p.m. on August 28 I was standing at the gate, when prisoners passed out. About three minutes later prosecutor came reeling downstairs) as if he was intoxicated; his face was covered with blood. In the fore part of the day he seemed to be in drink. I called a constable. About 8 p.m. Swanson returned and Berry a short time afterwards; somewhere about 3 p.m. they were in drink.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">TOM TANNER</hi>, J Division. At 9 p.m. on August 28 I went to 85, Hackney Grove, where I saw Swanson. I was with another officer and I told him who we were and that we wanted him for being concerned in robbery and assaulting the prosecutor. He said, "All right; I shall give you no" trouble." Subsequently he was identified by prosecutor. When charged he said, "I was there, but I do not know anything about the robbery. It was a fair fight between the two." I found upon him 1s. 6d. silver, and 8 £d. bronze. On September 13 I explained, the charge to Berry; on his leaving the infirmary he said, "There's too sides to every tale." When charged he made no reply.</p>

On the evening of August 28 I was keeping observation on 85, Hackney Grove, when at 10 p.m. Berry entered. I followed him in. I opened a, door on the second floor, when he came from behind it. He said, "Hullo, what do you want me for—desertion?"I said, "No, for assault and robbery." He said, "I suppose it is Mr. Lewis's mob. I have had the b—stuff and this is what I get for it." On nearing the station he said, "Is my mate here?"On entering the charge room and seeing Berry Swanson he said, "Hello, mate, you here?"When charged he made no reply. He made no complaint about his elbow. In his left jacket pocket I found a man's yellow metal watch and a lady's yellow metal watch. In his right trousers pocket I found 6s. silver and 3 1/2 d. bronze.</p>
               <p>To Berry: There was a bed behind the door from which you came, and for all I know you may have come from it. When you said, "This is what I get for it," you pointed to a black eye which you had.</p>

"pay cash." I asked prisoner what he would like to take for it; he said he would like five £5 notes and the rest in gold and silver. I gave it to him and he went away. I subsequently discovered the forgery and communicated with the police. I gave a description of the man. I gave his height as 5 ft. 7 in. and his age as forty to fifty, slight moustache and stubbly beard, felt hat, dark clothing.

It had "pay cash" written across it. I had my suspicion to the signature pur<lb/>porting to open the cheque. I first of all asked prisoner how he would take it; he said in small notes; then I made as if to go to my drawer, but in reality I went round to the desk where the assistant manager and manager were sitting. I told them I suspected I had a forged cheque at my desk and asked them to come with me to the door. We went to the door and discussed the matter. Prisoner remained at the counter. In my opinion the words "pay cash" in the two cheques are the same handwriting.</p>

                  </hi>, 7, Leonard Street, City Road. On Septem<lb/>ber 21 F.L. Smith and Co. owed me £75 0s. 9d. I did not receive the cheque. My business place is closed from Friday afternoon till Monday morning. I am in the habit of going there on Sunday morning to have a look round and see my letters. When I opened the door of the ware house I found the letter-box had been forced from the outside and what letters there were were on the floor. The endorsement on the cheque is not-mine.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">FRANK HANCOCK</hi>, 10 CR. I was called to the London and South-Western Bank on Monday, September 23, at 10.25. I saw prisoner detained there. I said to him, "The cashier accuses you of forging and uttering a cheque and I shall have to take you to Vine Street Police Station. He replied, "Oh, does he?"I took him to the station where he was charged. In reply to the charge he said, "I deny the charges of stealing, receiving, or forgery. I plead guilty to what I was trying to do, that is attempting to obtain the money."</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">ALLEN MILES</hi>. On September 23 at 10.40 a.m. I saw prisoner at Vine Street Police Station. I told him I was a police officer and he would be detained while I was making certain inquiries. He said, "I don't want to give the police any trouble. I knew it was a forged cheque, but I did not do the writing on the cheque. I plead guilty to knowing it was not straight when I tried to obtain the money."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I deal in antique furniture. When I was told that the £70 cheque was a forgery I said, "If the clerk says it is a forgery it must be a forgery." I got the cheque from a man who owed me between £4 and £5. He said, "I have got one of Smiths Bank cheques from a gentleman I bet with, but he has made a mistake in the cheque and sent me too much money, and I do not like to go in with it; will you go in with it?"I said, "What will become of it if I go in with it?"He said, "There will be no prosecution; if he has made a mistake it is his own fault." I said, "What am I to get if I change it?"He said, "I will promise you £10." As to the other cheque, I have never been to Lombard Street and never have been to the City for years except to Liverpool Street when I have been going to Newmarket. On September 16 my hair was the same colour as now. I have never worn a moustache or beard. My eye has been bad for 25 years. If the cashier took particular notice of me he could not miss it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. On September 17 I may have been in High Street, Marylebone. I am there most days from 11 till 2. I take money there for a bookmaker. I live at 15, Kilburn Park Road. I cannot say where I was on September 17 because sometimes I am at a sale-room and sometimes betting. There would be racing on September 17. I would not have been at the meeting. My wife would remember where I was. The first time I was spoken to about the £70 cheque was when I was under arrest and after the cashier picked me out. I can call witnesses who are always with me from 11 to 2. I am not the man who cashed the cheque. As to what I said to the police, I found I had got myself into trouble and said anything at the time so as my friends and relatives would not hear of it. I thought I would be allowed to go when I told them. I never thought they would keep me. I did not suggest that I was privy to the commission of a forgery. I did not say I knew it was a forgery. The officer has made a mistake. I said I did not do the writing on the cheque. I do not know the name of the man who gave me the cheque or his whereabouts: we call him tall Frank. He gave me the cheque at a little after 10 a, m. at the "Blue Posts," Oxford Circus.</p>

               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">DAVID BUTTLE</hi>, H Division. On October 1 I was in Backahurch-lane, E.; I was off duty. I saw prisoner take a case off a van that was proceeding towards Church-lane. He put it on his shoulder and made off with it. I followed him and overtook him. I told him I was a police officer. I asked him what he was going to do with the case. He said he was going to Fadrolougih's with it. I asked him if he had a receipt for it. He said "Yes." He put the case down on the footway, put his right hand in his jacket pocket, drew his hand out very quickly, and struck me in the left side of the face. I did not see what he struck me with. I felt blood running down my face and felt a sharp pain. Afterwards I saw a knife in his right hand. I seized hold of his hand and a Struggle took place, in which I received another cut on the left side of the face. He said, "You won't take me to the station; I will do you in first." I threw him to the ground, took the knife from him, and held him until assistance arrived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. I told you I was a police officer and asked you where you were going with the case. I may have given you a blow in the mouth in the struggle, but not before. I did not say. "I will stop your b—game." You were in a bloody condition, the blood from my face was pouring over you; it did not come from your nose. You were taken to the station on a barrow. I did not strike you first before you drew the knife.</p>

Prisoner said to me, "You might go to the corner and see whether there is a policeman coining." I said to Mm, "That's nothing to do with me," and I walked on. I saw Buttle speaking to him on the corner. I saw prisoner put the box on the pavement, then he put his hand in his pocket and drew an open penknife and made a hit at Buttle. I noticed that Buttle's face was pouring with blood afterwards. Prisoner struck him twice. Buttle did not strike him first. I ran to the assistance of Buttle, and he got prisoner on the ground. Buttle asked me to fetch assistance, and I did. I have never seen prisoner before.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I have not spoken to Buttle about this case. I saw all that happened between you and Buttle until I went for assistance. I did not see Buttle strike you. I should think he is telling the truth if he says he struck you. I did not see him. I was about two or three yards away from you.</p>

                  </hi>, divisional surgeon. In the afternoon of October 1 I saw Buttle. I found him covered with blood and two wounds on. his face. The first one was a horizontal wound extending from the cheek near the angle of the eye to the outside of the ear, rather superfi<lb/>cial. It was a clean cut wound, but not deep. The second was a deep wound on the side of the face near the angle of the jaw; it was. a semicircular kind of wound. It was a very severe wound, about two inches and a half long. The wounds could have been inflicted with the knife (produced). I examined prisoner. He had a little contusion on the forehead, a small contused wound on the upper lip, and a small wound on the finger. These wounds have been caused by a fall or in a scuffle; they were very trivial.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I did not notice anything the matter with your eye. There was no bruising there then, your face was covered with blood; that did not come from you but from the person who was injured. The Wood on your face did not come from your nose. I did not say "You cannot expect anything else." You wanted me to put a large bandage on your finger and arm. I said, "Don't be foolish, there is nothing here to bandage." Your nose was not bleeding at all. You were not unconscious. When you were at the police station there were a lot of police officers there; they were not doing anything to you.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. While I was there nobody did anything to him. He was lying down. He was muttering something nearly the whole time.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). About twenty to eight in the morning of October 1 I went down to the London Docks, where I had been employed, for the call for labour. Coming up the way the fore<lb/>man told me it was no use coming down that morning: I had done no work for two weeks. When I came to the corner of Backchurch Lane I had nothing in my pocket; I had been walking about the streets for two nights. I had had no food for a day and a half. I saw this van; I took my knife from my pocket, cut the rope, and took the case of sherry off. I walked along Backchureh Lane with it. I cut into Severn Street. Coming out of Severn Street into Pinchin Street I met this constable; he touched me on the shoulder. He says, "Halloa, where are you going with that?"I says, "I am going nowhere with it." He said to me, "I will stop your by game; we know you long enough." He struck me in the mouth; I put my hand in my pocket: I drew the knife to frighten him; he gave me another blow on the forehead. After wards I had the knife in my hand in this position; he caught hold of me by the wrist and a struggle commenced between us. How the wounds came to his face was, when me and him was struggling the knife caught him near the eye as the was going to the ground with me. When I made to draw the knife away it caught his face again by giving</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080062"/>
               <p>the cut which he shows in court down the side of the face. When, he got me on the ground he punched me on the nose and knocked me unconscious. I remember nothing more until I woke up in the police station. There was between eight and nine detectives; all of them know me; they knocked me about down there. I said to one of them, "Now you will have to stop this game; if you don't I win use some force on some of you, no matter what I get for it." That is all I remember.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When he had me by the hand I was struggling with him and he with me; I was drawing the knife away; his face was leaning on me; he is a bigger man than I am; it caught his face on the side. Both the cuts were accidents. I did not say to him, "You won't take me to the station, I will do you in first." I may have used bad language to him, but I did not say that. I did not care whether I went to the station or not. I know he was arresting me for the case of wine. He never told me he was a police officer; I had an idea that he was one. I did not resist going; I resisted because he knocked me about. When I cut the rope of the van to take this case of wine I put the knife back in my pocket open. I do not remember how I got to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been living with prisoner for the last six months at 30, Raynham Road, Edmonton. She is a married woman, whose husband has left her. She had two children of her own living with us; one, Lilian May, was a year and 11 months; the other, Patrick John, a little over three and a half; the husband had taken a girl of seven years of age with him. Prisoner was very fond of the children. She was doing for them from the first thing in the morning till late at night. For the last four months I had been drawing acci<lb/>dent pay, 15s. 9d. a week, out of which I paid prisoner 15s. On September 20 the accident pay ceased, and in consequence we were short of money. There was 8s. rent owing. Prisoner was very much upset about it; she was worriting all day long. On Monday, Septem<lb/>ber 26, when the rent become due, she was more upset. She got up as usual in the morning. I noticed nothing unusual about her manner, only she was very much upset. At hlaf-past 10 I went to the "Brick<lb/>layers' Arms." Prisoner was at home with the children. About 11.15 she came to the public-house for her lunch beer. I got home again about a quarter past 12. We had our dinner. The children started</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080063"/>
               <p>jangling and crying, and I said, "Let them go into the passage; they have done their dinner." We had several words over the children, and I went and laid down; it would be about ten minutes to two then. I went to sleep for about half an hour. I was awakened about 3.20 by prisoner calling out, "I have done it." I went downstairs and I could see there wag something the master with the children. Prisoner was on the verge of hysterics; she was walking all over the room. One of the children was rolling about against the bedcot and the other was sitting on the bedcot. I smelt spirits of salts. I saw that the children's mouths were streaming. I immediately went for some salt and water and gave it to them. Prisoner went and fetched a constable herself. I asked her what she had given the children, but she did not answer. I then went for Dr. Shaw. I noticed the bottle (pro<lb/>duced). I had never seen it before. I did not notice anything in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner has not used spirits of salts in the house to my knowledge; she may have used it. I believe I emptied the contents of the bottle in the fender.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I know spirits of salts is used for cleaning pur<lb/>poses. Prisoner was a very good mother to these children. She com<lb/>plained of pains in the head, and she used to worry about money. She was very depressed.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. She used to go about her household duties and some<lb/>times she would forget what she was doing. She complained of pains in the head about three weeks before this happened; and only now and again.</p>

                  </hi>. I live next door to prisoner. I know their children; they used to play with my little girl. Prisoner was a good mother to them. The day this happened she came in my house; I did not notice any difference in her, but she was worrying over her rent. About half-past three she knocked at my door. As I came to the door I heard her say, "I have done it; I have done my children in." She was crying in an excited manner. She had the bottle (produced) in her hand. I went into her house and saw the children; they were foaming at the mouth. Prisoner went and fetched a policeman. She said she would give herself up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. She was worried a great deal about the rent. She was very fond of the children. I did not know that her husband would not let her see the other child.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">CHAELIS WADE</hi>, 788 N. I was on duty in Fore Street, Edmonton, at 3.45 p.m. on September 30. Prisoner came up to me and said, "I have killed them; I have poisoned them." I asked her who, and she replied, "My two children." I went with her to 30, Raynham Road, and I saw Risley and the two children in the front room. I sent Risley for the doctor. I took one of the children to the Edmonton Infirmary.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. She said, "I have killed them" before saying whom she had killed. She was very excited.</p>

                  </hi>, assistant to Mr. Davey, chemist, 128, Fore Street, Edmonton. I know prisoner as a customer. On September 30 she came in for twopennyworth of spirits of salts. I asked her whether</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080064"/>
               <p>it was for cleaning purposes and she said "Yes." I recognise the bottle. It bears the label of my shop. The bottle is a proper bottle for poison. I did not notice any tiling about her demeanour at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Spirits of salts are very commonly used for clean<lb/>ing purposes. It was about 10.30 when she came.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHNISHAW</hi>, 216, Fore Street. About 3.30 on September 30, I was called to 30, Raynham Street, and I there saw the two children. The bottle was handed to me; there were a few drops of Hydrochloric acid in it. I examined the children's mouths and saw froth and foamy fluid coming from them. I administered a solution of carbonate of soda and took them to the Edmonton Infirmary. At the time I saw them I formed the opinion that they were suffering from poisoning by some corrosive acid. On October 1 I was present at a post-mortem examination of the body of the little boy Patrick, and formed the opinion that the cause of death was directly attributable to the admin<lb/>istration of such a corrosive poison as hydrochloric acid. At 30, Rayn<lb/>ham Road I saw prisoner and asked her what she was doing with this bottle in the house. She said, "I have done it; I have done it." She was in a highly excited state. She had been sobbing and moving about the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When I asked her what she was doing with the bottle she said, "I have done it; I have done it." I did not think she was in a condition to be further questioned.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I think she fully understood what my question was.</p>

                  </hi>, divisional surgeon. On September 30 I saw prisoner at Edmonton Police Station; she was highly excited, almost hysterical; she had obviously been drinking recently, but she was not drunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was sufficiently recent to allow the smell of alcohol to remain in her breath.</p>
               <p>Divisional Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN ASHLEY</hi>. I saw prisoner on September 30 at 9.30 p.m., at Edmonton Police Station. I told her I was a police inspector, and said I have just seen the dead body of your son Patrick at the Edmonton Infirmary and as the result of my in<lb/>quiries I am going to charge you with the wilful murder of your son, and further with attempting to murder your, daughter Lilian by administreing poison to her at 30, Raynham Road about 3.30 to-day." She said, "What shall I do; what shall I do; I knew he was dead."</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS HOWARD</hi>. I saw prisoner on October 1 in the cell passage. I said to her, "How are you this morning?"She said, "Not very well; I have not had a very happy time. My boy has marks on him now; the doctor is sure to notice it; he has marks on his back. I saw them and asked the child who did it and he told me it was Uncle Walter. The row yesterday was over the boy. Walter tried to push him out of the room and I would not let him. The trouble has been over the children."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have made inquiries about prisoner. Her hus<lb/>band deserted her about six months ago and took with him the eldest child. She made frequent applications to be allowed to see the child and was refused. It upset her a lot.</p>

                  </hi>, medical officer, Holloway Prison. I have had prisoner under my observation since October 1. She was in a very depressed state, continually Bobbing, and whenever I inter<lb/>viewed her she continually referred to "My poor dear little children." She was mentally apathetic, and it was evidently a mental effort for her to recall recent events. She said she had been suffering from pains in the head and had not been sleeping very well. She said she was worried about the rent, and she also worried over the elder child being away from her. She seemed to be very fond of the children. On several occasions I asked her questions about the tragedy, but she could not give a connected account of it. She did not know how she administered the poison. When I referred to the children it upset her very much. My opinion is that at the time she committed the act she was not responsible for her actions; she was suffering from melan<lb/>cholia. I do not think she was in a condition to know the nature and quality of her act.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My opinion was founded from interviews with and observation of her. I found out from Bisley about her mental depres<lb/>sion. She would be able to go about her ordinary duties. Her condi<lb/>tion would not be observable to an untrained eye. She would be able to do certain things in a very listless kind of way. She would know that she was buying spirits of salts. When I asked her about it she did not seem quite clear about it. It is quite possible she knew it was poison. I think it was done on a sudden impulse. If she really appreciated what she was doing she would have been less likely to give it to the second child. She would realise that something had happened, but she would not realise the details. She would be con<lb/>scious of doing something, but she would not realise the gravity of the act at the time.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. If she knew that she was administering poison I do not think she was in a condition to know whether or not it was wrong.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of prisoner. I have lived on affectionate terms with my husband at 109, Graham Street, City Road. Lately he has been ill; he has complained of pains in his head and delusions. He said that a man was after me, which was not true. On the night of September 20 my husband and I went to bed about 9.0 p.m. He woke me up and said the lamp was going out and asked if there was any oil. I said I did not think there was any. He then struck me. I looked up and I saw he had a knife in his hand. I rushed out of bed and he followed. I screamed, and my grandmother came in and seized him round the waist. The knife (produced) is the knife he had. He cut me on the side of the neck. I said, "Frank, you must be mad," and he went off in a dead faint.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We had no dispute before we went to bed. He had been working very hard and had had a nervous breakdown. He was a good husband and a good father so far, and hard-working.</p>

                  </hi>. On the night of September 20 I was sleeping in the back parlour downstairs; the prisoner and his wife were upstairs. I was awakened by last witness calling out "Murder! Murder! Frank has gone out of his mind." I went upstaire to their room. I caught him and held him round the waist till we could get assistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner was exhausted; he fell down at my feet till somebody moved him away. I am positive he did not know what he was doing.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT AMBROSE</hi>, 907 Y. At 1.45 a.m. on Sep<lb/>tember 21, hearing a whistle blown, I went to 109, Graham Street. I went upstairs and saw prisoner being held down by Mr. Prior and last witness. I saw two knives lying on the table. Prisoner had a cut across the left side of his head. He said to me, "I thought the knife was sharper than it was, or else I should have had another go for her." His wife said, "Look after my children; he has threatened to kill them also. I do not know why he did it." I took him to the station. He said, "I thought the knife was sharper than it was, else I should have had another go for her; she Was asked for it long enough."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner was calm when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi rend="smallCaps">MORGAN</hi>, house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. On September 21 Margaret Verrall was brought to the hospital. She had two wounds, one on the right side of the back of the head, about 2 in. long, and another on the back of the right hand about 2 1/2 in. long. There were some small abrasions on both forearms. The injuries, I found, could have been done with the knife (produced).</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi rend="smallCaps">DALY</hi>, divisional surgeon. At 3.15 a.m. on September 21 I was called to the police station, and there saw prisoner. Across the front of his neck were six distinct marks as though done by six actions of drawing a knife across his neck. Five of them were superficial and one I had to put a stitch in. They could have been inflicted by the knife (produced). I hid a conversation with prisoner and Game to the conclusion that he was suffering from mental delusions.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080067"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. He said they were always annoying him. I asked him who he mean it by "they," and he did not know. He said he heard voices in the other room and in the street trying to get at his wife. He said his wife used to signal to these voices by moving her leg as she lay in bed. Prisoner was in a very low state of health. He looks very much better now than he did when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">LANG</hi>, G Division. On September 21 I saw prisoner de<lb/>tained at the police station. I told him he would be charged with wounding his wife with a knife with intent to do her grievous bodily harm. He said, "Yes." When the charge was read over to him he made no reply. He was calm, but he kept making mumbling state<lb/>ments.</p>
               <p>Prisoner is a man of good character, a good husband and father, and a man of sober habits.</p>

                  </hi>, medical officer, Brixton Prison. Prisoner has been under my observation since September 21. I have had con<lb/>versation with him, and I have formed the opinion that at the time this offence was committed he was suffering from delusions and hallu<lb/>cinations, which would prevent him knowing the nature and quality of the act.</p>
               <p>Crow-examined. Under the rest and treatment in prison the delu<lb/>sions have cleared up, but there is a certain amount of melancholia left, and he requires a prolonged mental rest. He was suffering from a nervous breakdown when he came in.</p>

               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">ALBBBT BOBEHAM</hi>, H. Division. On September 25, with other officers, I was watching 102, Whitechapel Road, and saw prisoner there between 9.30 and 10 o'clock a.m. About 10.30 I saw a man named Anderson come to the door, push it open, and beckon with his head, whereupon prisoner dame outride. Anderson took a small parcel from his right-hand jacket pocket, which he opened and showed to prisoner. With the aid of a powerful pair of glasses I was able to see that the parcel contained what appeared to me to be silver coins. Anderson then took a second parcel, which appeared to be similar to the first, from his hip-pocket, and gave them both to the prisoner, who went back into the shop, Anderson proceeding in the direction</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080068"/>
               <p>from which he came. I followed and arrested him, and took him to the police station, where I found prisoner also in custody. When charged with possession of the parcels, prisoner replied, "I know nothing about it."</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE CHAMBERS</hi>, H Division. On the morning of Sep<lb/>tember 25 I was with Sergeant Boreham, and saw Anderson come from the direction of New Road, and beckon prisoner from the coffee-shop and common lodging-house, 102, Wihitechapel Road. Prisoner joined him outside the shop, and Anderson handed him two parcels, which appeared to me to contain silver coins. Prisoner went back into the shop, and Anderson went back towards New Road. I followed prisoner into the shop, and as soon as he saw me he got up and ran out, down a passage at the back, where he entered a water-closet. I shouted to him, "It's all up; don't you put those down the pan, or I shall have the drain up." I looked over the top of the door, and saw him put the two packets on the top of the cistern. He came out, and turning round, said, pointing to the two packets, "I know nothing of them." I had said nothing to him about them. Some men were standing round, and he said to them. "See that he does not put any of them into my pocket." I secured the two packets and found that they con<lb/>tained the counterfeit coins mentioned in the charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was watching the coffee-shop from the first-floor of a shop on the opposite side of the road. I should think the distance was 30 to 40 yards.</p>

                  </hi>, manufacturers' agent, 36, Camomile Street, E.C. In March last I engaged prisoner as traveller on commission. Prom May 17 he had a salary of £2 10s. per week. His duties were to sell and nothing else. I represent manufacturers abroad. I went away for my holidays on July 25 or 27 and returned to the office on August 19. I had never sent him to Collect accounts. Moneys due from my customers are sent by them either to me or direct to the firms abroad. If sent to me I should send it abroad. I should not endorse such cheques. In my absence from London Mr. Henderson was left in charge of the financial work of the office. On my return to London I received a postcard in consequence of which I saw prisoner in the presence of Mr. Ward on August 26 or 27. I asked him whether he had received a cheque for £50 5s. 8d. from Messrs. Copestake; he said no. I said, "Will you come with me to Cope<lb/>stakes' and prove that?"He said, "Certainly." We all went there and the cheque was produced by Mr. Stamp, the cashier. I asked Mr. Stamp if he had paid a cheque to Arnold and Glaser; he looked it up and said yes. I believe he said to whom he had given it, but I am not certain. I looked at the endorsement on the cheque, it was in prisoner's writing. I said to prisoner, "You have forged this cheque." He said, "It is not a forgery; I have put my initials to it." I did not authorise him to endorse it. Exhibit 2 is the account which Mr. Stamp produced. It is on one of our billheads. My name has been scratched out and the name of Arnold and Glaser sub<lb/>stituted. That firm send accounts to me on the first of every month and I send them to each customer separately. The account produced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080072"/>
               <p>is the one Arnold and Glaser sent to me, which includes the £50 5s. 8d. shown upon the fictitious statement. Prisoner had no authority to use my paper to render accounts for Arnold and Glaser.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner and I have not had a settlement of the commission due to him. Business had been bad, and he was not entitled to the £2 10s. a week because his turnover was not sufficient to cover it. Prisoner said he was going to Marienbad for three weeks at the same time that I was on my holiday. He did not apply to me for his salary just before that. He asked if I could let him have something as he was hard up. This was at Charing Cross Station. I said, "You know you have done no business," and gave him £1 to go on with. He told me he had received money from abroad to go to Marienbad. I gave him the £1 not to be disturbed as I had friends with me. The last time he received his salary was the week before I went away. He said that I could discharge him at any moment if he did not do the turnover. He had not brought any orders for the last three weeks, and he was working on his own account. I said I could not afford to give him wages if he did not bring in orders. To earn his £2 10s. a week he would have to do a turnover of £70. My commission is 5 per cent., of which he got 3 3/4 per cent. He said he could not go on without ready cash every week. The order of Copestakes' for which be collected the £50 was placed five or six weeks before. I do not know that prisoner had sold those goods. Copestakes did not owe us the money at the time. After I returned from my holiday prisoner came to the office occa<lb/>sionally. He was not taken on again. He never asked for wages. He got no orders; if he did it would be only £5 or £10. I do not think he brought any but fictitious orders. He had opened accounts with different houses and got fairly large orders. In August there was not any commission owing to prisoner; there is something owing to me. It is not correct that prisoner could not get commission from me, and that was why the cheque was endorsed. If you look at the date of the cheque it is five days after I left. I did not send him out to collect accounts. He collected one without my authority of £2. I told him he had no business to collect it. I took an assignment of prisoner's furniture, but it was not in settlement of the Copestakes matter. That was done at the suggestion of prisoner's solicitor. I wanted him to be security that prisoner would not run away while I made enquiries what other things were stolen or missing, and he suggested this assignment. The writ was issued the day after the Jewish New Year as I did not want to appear at the Guildhall during those holidays. I have not seen the furniture. I went up to the depository to get a letter. I never suggested that if he paid £30 I would be satisfied. I would have given it him in writing if it had been the case. Soon after the warrant was issued prisoner paid in to me a cheque for £9 6s. 6d. I did not know anything about it till Inspector Newell told me about it two or three days afterwards. It was not done in pursuance of any arrangement between us.</p>

               <p>August we owed them £50 5s. 8d. In the ordinary course we send our cheques direct to them. On August 19 prisoner called upon us and produced an account of Arnold and Glaser's to our ledger keeper. I saw it. I believed it was a genuine account of theirs and drew a cheque in payment, which I handed to prisoner, who receipted the account. The cheque has been paid through our bank. It is endorsed, "Arnold and Glaser, R. Strauss." When Mr. Weisberger came I showed him the cheque in prisoner's presence. Weisberger said it was a forgery; prisoner said it was nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner did not deny that he had endorsed the cheque; he admitted it. I personally have not paid accounts to prisoner for Arnold and Glaser. I do not know whether my firm have.</p>

                  </hi>, Hadleigh, Essex. I am managing clerk to a solicitor. On August 21 prisoner called at my principal's office. He brought the cheque for £50 5s. 8d. payable to Arnold and Glaser. He asked me to clear it for him. I did so and handed him the cash.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Mr. Weisberger did not ask me for security; he asked me to personally guarantee £30 of the money and prisoner was to work out the rest in commission. I would not do it. They went to a place where prisoner had some furniture in store and Mr. Wein<lb/>berger took a transfer of that to his own name. It was because I refused to guarantee the £30 that the assignment was taken. There is no foundation for the suggestion that I recommended prisoner to a solicitor to defend him. I was away on my holidays at the time. I knew nothing about it until the police came down to Margate and served me with a subpoena.</p>

He then motioned me aside and said he had some guarantee or to that effect on prisoner's property. I afterwards saw them together at Cross Keys Square, when prosecutor said to prisoner, "Come up to my place and settle up certain matters with regard to my account." He patted prisoner on the back and said, "Now, Strauss, be a man and go straight."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I obtained a small order for Mr. Weisberger in September, 1911, and he asked me to see him later on with a view to doing business for him. I started with him in March entirely on commission. That lasted till about May 15, when he suggested that I should try and sell these particular goods for him. I demurred. I said he had another traveller selling those goods and that I did not like to take another man's bread away. He, how<lb/>ever, persevered at me to do it and sent me out to sell. Within half-an-hour I came back with an order. He was highly pleased. He then and there asked me to continue selling those goods. I said, "If you agree to pay me £2 10s. a week on account of commission as a fixed salary I will do it." Nothing was said about the turnover I was to do. He agreed to pay the £2 10s. fixed salary on account of commission, which he did until July 19 regularly under pressure, not willingly. 1 never got a settlement of the commission due to me. I have tried many times to get a settlement. He told me he did not mind even two months of slack time, as I pointed out to him that it would not be pos<lb/>sible to do the business in August that I had been doing in May to July, when I was very successful. On July 19 he told me, "If you do not bring orders next week as you have been doing in the past I shall not be able to pay." I reminded him of his promise, and he said even though it be two months' slackness he would not mind. Previous to that time Arnold and Glaser were dissatisfied with his results. Weis<lb/>berger told me they were going to change the agent. Through the orders I got in May, June, and July no doubt they kept him and gave him a new contract, which he showed me. He promised to give me the whole of London for the sale of these goods. When he returned from Germany he said nothing about it. I asked him. He told me there was room for two. I again remonstrated with him and told him I should be interfering with the other man. He said London was such a large place, there were plenty of houses I could call on. I have not received the full commission due to me up to July 19. There are re<lb/>peat orders coming in and I have sold roughly between May 17 and July 19 about £1.000 worth of goods. I received £1 from him at the railway station. Nothing was said then about my going for a holiday. In fact, he gave me certain instructions; I could not go away. I also bad illness at home and never intended to go away. While he was away on his holiday I received no salary. I was getting orders. I continued in his employment up to the day I Was arrested; I called at the office two or three times a day. I endorsed the cheque I received from Copestakes. There was a large amount owing to me at the time and I had not had a settlement since March. I do not know the amount: I have not had the books. Up to May 1 I had sold £600 or £700 worth of stuff. From May 1 to July 19 I sold another £1,000 worth. It is impossible for me without knowing the orders he has got to say what he owes me, but I am positive he is indebted to me now. I am entitled to commission on repeat orders. That is the biggest item. On August 27 I came into the office at 2.30. Mr. Jones was there. In</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080075"/>
               <p>his presence prosecutor said, "Mr. Jones tells me you offered him this cheque to be cashed." Mr. Jones said, "You have put me in a very unpleasant position." I said, "I am sorry." Prosecutor asked me to accompany him to Gray's. I told him there was no need because I admitted I had the cheque. He pressed me to go. When we arrived there prosecutor told Mr. Ward, "Here is Mr. Strauss, my traveller, who has had the cheque." He thereupon asked Mr. Ward to telephone to Copestakes in my presence. They told him they had paid me the cheque and said how it was endorsed. He asked me to accompany him to Copes takes. I was very reluctant to go because I was well known in the house and I told him, "You know I have had it; I admit it, and you have just heard at the telephone." He pressed me to go, We all three went. Prosecutor said to Mr. Stamp, "I am surprised that you paid this cheque." Mr. Stamp said they did on many occasions pay cheques under similar circumstances. The cheque was produced, Prose<lb/>cutor said it was a forgery. I said, "It is not a forgery; my whole name appears upon it; I have done it openly for everybody to see and I certainly did not do it underhand." He asked me to take him to the man who changed the cheque. I took him to Broad Street and intro<lb/>duced him to Mr. Heard. He told Mr. Heard he had no right to change the cheque. On the way to the office we discussed our accounts and I told him if he took an account he would find that he it indebted to me now. I told him he had left me without paying a farching. He then said, "Did you ever know a Jew who would pay willingly? I grumble a lot, but I pay do the finish." He asked Mr. Heard then whether, if he locked me up, he would have to charge me at once, Mr. Heard said he would. He said, "I do not want to do that," and asked if I could find a sum of £30 pending a talking of the account, I said no doubt I could by the next day. He then said to Mr. Heard, "Will you guarantee the £30?"Mr. Heard said, "Not a farthing, after what you have told me he has done." I appealed to Heard to do so. He again refused and asked me. "Have you got any shares at home?"It is only a promise on your part. Have you got anything to guarantee that you will pay this £30?"I said, "No, but I could transfer some goods I had in store," and prosecutor asked a fellow called Wilson who was in the office to type out a document. He also asked Mr. Heard about allowing seven days for the repayment of this £30. I do not recollect what Mr. Heard replied. Prosecutor land I went to the repository. I introduced him to the proprietor and told him the transfer was for the repayment of the sum of £30. In the office he asked me to wire for this money and Mr. Heard said to him, "If it is any satisfaction to you I can tell you if he wires he will get the money." When we came out of the repository prosecutor said, "There is a telegraph office next door: go in and send that wire." I told him it was useless, because it was late, and we parted on the best of terms. Next morning I turned up at the office as usual. He asked me if I had wired. I said "Yes." He thereupon told me I need not say anything to anybody as it was a matter between him and me. I went out that day to sell goods, for him as usual. From that day, August 28, to September 17, I was in his employment and did the best I could for him. He has stated I sold</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080076"/>
               <p>goods for somebody else. That is a lie. When I found how he had used me I made arrangements to leave him as soon as I could obtain a settlement from him. Mr. Jones's evidence is absolutely true. I cannot speak as to what he said when I was not present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prosecutor authorised me to collect accounts as long back as May. I collected three accounts of Jones. I have not col<lb/>lected other accounts. I do not know if Mr. Henderson was left in charge while prosecutor was away on his holiday; he was there. I attended to part of the correspondence. I dealt with Copestake's cheque because I wanted to force prosecutor to a settlement. I wanted to repay myself what was due to me. I did not tell Henderson I had made out the account to Copestake; he had nothing to do with that. I did not tell him I had got the cheque. I did not tell prosecutor either, he was busy with a client and I had no chance to go into it with him. It was no use asking him for my wages at the end of the week; he had none. When first taxed with having had the cheque I admitted it. At the police court Mr. Ward and prosecutor both said they did not recol<lb/>lect anything I said. Prosecutor said, I think, "He first denied it and then admitted it." I never said anything about refunding the money and he never said so to-day. I was not short of money on August 19; I wanted what was due to me. I did not know that prosecutor had no authority to endorse Arnold and Glaser's cheque. I know he some<lb/>times put them into his own banking account. I should say on August 19 there was £74 due to me. The £2 10s. a week was not con<lb/>ditional on my doing a certain turnover. It would be unreasonable to expect that if I did not do his work. I have not prepared a statement showing how much is due to me on the orders, as I have not his books.</p>

                  </hi>, 58, Peckham Park Road, builder. On September 17 at 12.30 a.m. I was in Mantle Street, Islington, when a woman came up and said, "Hullo, dear!"I said, "I do not know you, I do not want to have anything to do with you." Before I had got the words out of my mouth a number of men came up. Fitzgerald said, "What are you doing with my wife?"I was struck on the right-hand side of the face, knocked to the ground, and kicked by Fitzgerald. I shouted, "Police!"A sergeant and a constable arrived in about two minutes. Fitzgerald ran away, the police brought him back and asked me if I recognised the man. I said, "That is the man who kicked me." On September 22 I went to Upper Street Police Station and picked Sewell out from a number of men. I recognised his face in a moment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Wickham. I had been in two public-houses. I was not sober, but I was not drunk. There were four men and a woman attacked me; I cannot give a description of the other men. It was dark, but we were right under a lamp and I saw Sewell. I did not see him again till the Sunday when I identified him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Fitzgerald. I left work at 8.45 p.m., went and had a drink and then went to see the Pictures. At 11.15 I was in a public-house at the back of the "Angel" and left at 12.25. While there I changed a sovereign and paid a man 8s. 5d. I was robbed of a silver Watch and 15s. 3d.; I was wearing the chain (produced); the watch was taken off the chain; the chain was unbroken, I think it was a very smart piece of work on the part of the police to come up as quick as they did and catch you. When I identified you, you said, "That is all right."</p>
               <p>Police-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK LANGHAM</hi>, 126 N. On September 17 at 12.50 a.m. I was on duty in Liverpool Road; I heard cries of "Help! Police!"and ran to Mantle Street; saw two prisoners and another man not in custody running from Mantle Street into Mount Zion; the prosecutor was there, and made a complaint to me. At the bottom of Mount Zion I saw some large gates insecurely fastened; I pushed them open and saw Fitzgerald standing on some boxes trying to get over a wall. I pulled him down and said, "What are you doing in here?" He said, "I have just put the pony away." I took him out into Mount Zion, where prosecutor was and said, "Do you know this man?"Prose<lb/>cutor said, "Yes, that is the man who kicked me in the eye." Prisoner said, "I went in to feed the pony." I took him to the station. When the charge was read over Fitzgerald said to prosecutor, "You was with a woman, was not you?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080078"/>
               <p>To Mr. Wickham. This happened about 25 yards from where I was standing; it took me about three minutes to reach him; I could see both prisoners' faces as they ran. Sewell was arrested on Saturday night, September 22. I identified him on the following Monday.</p>
               <p>To Fitzgerald. When I saw you running I was between the prose<lb/>cutor and you. I think there are three lamps in Mantle Street.</p>
               <p>Police-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">HORACE CASTLETON</hi>, A Division. On September 21 at 8.15 p.m. I saw Sewell in Chapel Street, Islington, called him on one side and said, "What is you name?"He said, "Edward Sewell." I said, "I am a police officer and I am going to arrest you for being con<lb/>cerned with Fitzgerald in robbing a man with violence in Mantle Street, or probably you would know it better than Simon Lane." He said, "All right, have I got to come down now?"I said, "Yes, certainly." I took him to Upper Street Police Station, and said, "If you are identi<lb/>fied you will be charged." The following morning at the police station nine strange men were brought to the station, the prisoner was told he could place himself where he chose amongst them, and he was identi<lb/>fied by prosecutor. After that he was given an opportunity, if he wished, to change has position. He said he did not wish to change, and was identified by Police-constable Smith. He was then charged and made no reply.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Wickham. I know Chapel Street fairly well, Sewell works at a stall which belongs to his brother. I have seen two other men there and his sister-in-law, and I have seen him there. Sewell had not been working at the stall during the week. I was looking out for him. This robbery took place in the immediate nerighbourhood of where Sewell was found working.</p>

                  </hi>, divisional surgeon, N Division. On September 17 in the early morning; I examined the prosecutor; he had two cuts over the left eye, one on the eye-lid and on just over the eye<lb/>brow. They might have been caused by a heavy weapon or by a kick. Each wound had to be stitched.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES SMITH</hi>, 434 N. On September 17 at 12.50 p.m. I was in King Edward Street, Liverpool Road, I heard a scream, "Police," and ran into Mantle Street. I saw prosecutor bleeding from a cut under the eye. The two prisoners, with another man, ran along Mantle Street. I And Sergeant Langham followed them to Mount Zion. Fitzgerald was found standing inside a gateway on some boxes trying to climb over the wall, Langham pulled him down; asked what he was doing, he said, "I have been to put the pony away." Prosecutor said, "That is the man that kicked me in the face." On Sunday, Sep<lb/>tember 22, at Upper Street Police Station I picked Sewell out from among nine other men of similar appearance.</p>

               <p>Police-constables <hi rend="smallCaps">PERCY ATTERSOLL</hi> and <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN BOUSTRED</hi> proved plans and photographs for use in the case.</p>
               <p>Sub-divisional Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">ERNEST ANDERSON</hi>, K Division. My sub<lb/>district comprises Forest Gate and East Ham. The K Division covers Limehouse, Poplar, Bow, Plaistow, and the dock neighbourhood. Free Trade Wharf is in Ratcliffe, outside the K Division. On July 24 I was mounted with seven mounted constables on Tower Hill, where there was a meeting of nearly 20, 000 transport workers on strike, from 1 to about 2.20 p.m. A procession, headed by a drum and fife band and a banner, proceeded along Upper East Smithfield to Nightingale Lane. The band, preceded by myself and seven mounted constables, passed the head of the lane when the procession turned down Night<lb/>ingale Lane. I again headed it with the band and went on across Her<lb/>mitage Bridge into High Street, Wapping; 2, 000 to 3, 000 of the pro<lb/>cessionists there passed along, leaving the remainder behind; we got</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080081"/>
               <p>to Broad Street, Shadwell, where the band stopped outside the "East India Arms." The crowd was becoming aggressive; the men began to unhook traces of horses attached to vans, interfere with the loads and carmen, and pulled bales and boxes off the vans. Outside the "East India Arms" a van laden with, matting was set alight at its four corners. The foot police moved it into a wilder space and then into a side turning. The crowd was very aggressive and impeded the police, who unharnessed the horses. Both the van and police horses became terrified. Simultaneously there were rushes made for Free Trade Wharf, where the free labourers were at work, which were repelled by foot police; shouts of "Let us have these bleeders out of here," and similar cries were made by the strikers. The fire brigade engine arrived; the police cleared a space for the fire brigade to work; a number of men broke through and prevented the hose being used; ultimately the fire was put out. Missiles were being unrown; a piece of wood was thrown at me and fell on my horse's neck, stevedore's hooks were being used. Up to this time the police had used persuasive measures. The horse ridden by Police-constable Holtby had a gash nine inches long on its flank from a hook. My horse was thrown down; I fell on my feet and mounted again. Police-constable Nicholls horse was also thrown down. One officer's tooth was knocked out by a missile; repeated rushes were made at the gates of Free Trade Wharf. I then directed the police to draw their truncheons and disperse the crowd. We charged the mob, stubborn resistance was offered at first, but ultimately the crowd dispersed and it became a complete rout. The gates of Free Trade Wharf were closed; as the crowd rushed at the gates shouts were raised, "Have the bleeders out of here" and other filthy expressions from scores of men. A number of reinforcements of foot and mounted police were obtained; we had in all a force of some 380. We charged the crowd eastwards, westwards, and up School House Lane and two other streets northwards. When the piece of wood was thrown at me I turned my horse and saw Whitelock taken into custody. He was afterwards charged at Shadwell Police Station; he replied, "I threw no wood." I saw O'Mara assisting an the rushes on he wharf, another officer arrested him and I charged him. I saw all the defendants heading rushes and taking an active part in the riot. I particularly noticed Hughes and struck him with my truncheon; he was resisting officers who were trying to prevent him reaching the gates of the wharf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Wild. I saw none of the prisoners take part in firing the van. This, no doubt, caused confusion. The crowd were severely knocked about. I do not know Whether 94 cases were treated at Poplar Hospital. The police used their truncheons freely.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Edwards. I saw Coffey arrested a few yards from Free Trade Wharf; he was heading rushes at the gates; I did not hear him shout.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">DANIEL JAMES</hi>, K Division, corroborated. When the mob arrived at "East India Arms" I heard a shout, "Out with your hooks, boys," and I saw 30 or 40 men pull stevedore hooks from under their coats. They aimed blows at both mounted and foot police. Duhig</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080082"/>
               <p>raised his hook above his head and shouted, "Come on, boys." A number of the crowd made a rush towards the gates. Coffey also shouted "Come on, boys." I called out to Duhig, "Put that thing away "; I was eight or nine yards from him. I afterwards saw him in the custody of two police officers. I saw all the seven prisoners rush<lb/>ing and exciting others to rush towards the gates of Free Trace Wharf. I saw all the prisoners arrested except Duhig. I saw only Duhig with a hook. When Inspector Anderson gave the order to charge 1 directed the foot police to draw their truncheons and take part in dis<lb/>persing the crowd. There were upwards of 500 immediately around the gates of Free Trade Wharf. Before using the truncheons the police repeatedly exhorted the crowd to disperse. When the band arrived at the "East India Arms" I said to the man in charge of the band, "Keep the banner on the move and if you can persuade the band to play on until we get into the main road they can have a drink at my expemse." I gave him a 2s. piece and the band went into the "East India Arms." Before this happened a man named Spicer (whom I know as a speaker at meetings) put up his hand and cried "Halt."</p>
               <p>(Thursday, October 17.)</p>
               <p>Sub-divisional Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM SKILTON</hi>, H Division. On July 24 I accompanied the procession to Free Trade Wharf. I have been on duty in that neighbourhood during the whole of the strike. I saw the van on fire, and as the engine came up I heard cries of, "Don't let it go through." I saw several constables struck by pieces of wood and stone; they were not seriously injured. I heard cries of "Get the blacklegs out of the wharf." I gave directions to the police to draw their truncheons and to disperse the crowd vigorously. I saw Coffey at the corner of Schoolhouse Lane, opposite the main gates of Free Trade Wharf; he held up both hands, shouted "Rally again, boys," and headed rushes to the gate. I saw him arrested there; he shouted out, "Are you going to let them take me?"Thirty or forty other men rushed forward to rescue him; they did not succeed, and I ordered him to he taken into Free Trade Wharf temporarily; he was taken through the small wicket gate. I saw all the prisoners taking an active part in rushing at gates; some of them tried to interfere with the engine. The streets were cleared at about 3.30.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Wild. I do not say all the crowd were strikers. There were many men who were just as guilty as these men; we just happened to catch these seven men.</p>

The next thing I saw was that my load was alight. The police got my horse out of the shafts and pulled him into a gate<lb/>way; I stood in the gateway until it was all over. As I tried to get my coat off the dicky somebody hit me on the head. My coat was</p>

After the procession had stopped the crowd behaved in a very disorderly manner, shouting, making use of bad language, climbing on loaded was, window-sills, and gates, attempting to get into the wharf, and shouting, "Stand your ground; there is not enough policemen here to move three of you." I stopped Moore. He was shouting "Come on, boys, let us have the dirty blacklegs out of this wharf." He said, "You cannot f—well stop me; I will kick your guts out," kicking at me at the same time. I moved aside, and he kicked me on the right thigh. I closed with him. He became very violent, struck at and kicked at me several times. I got assist<lb/>ance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080084"/>
               <p>and held him. He shouted "Come on, boys; do not let this bas<lb/>tard take me." Sergeant Rowe came to my assistance. O'Mara seized Rowe by the arm and pulled him violently from the other pri<lb/>soner. I did not draw my truncheon. I got Moore into the wharf, afterwards took him to the station, and charged him with using in<lb/>sulting words and behaviour and assault upon me. He made no answer to the charge and made no complaint of any description. He afterwards said, "I hope you will give me bail, as I have a sick wife at home."</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE ROWE</hi>, H Division, corroborated. I was struck by a stevedore's hook which was thrown at me by one of the strikers as I was taking O'Mara into Free Trade Wharf. While the fire bri<lb/>gade were putting out the lighted van I heard shouts of "Do not let them play on it," also shouts, "Let us have these f—ing blacklegs out of the wharf." Several rushes were made. I afterwards assisted in the truncheon charge, and cleared the streets.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES BESSELL</hi>, 683 A. I accompanied the proces<lb/>sion from Tower Hill. By Free Trade Wharf the crowd was very rowdy; they were interrupting the fire brigade. They shouted out, "Let us have the blacklegs out," and repeatedly made rushes at the gates of Free Trade Wharf. A cordon of police stopped them. Several had stevedores' hooks in their hands. I saw several of them use them as if to assault police officers. I saw Duhig with a stevedore's hook in his hand strike at the leg of Holtby, a mounted officer. He missed, but cut the horse about 9 in. along the flank. I ran up to him. He struck me a violent blow on the arm with his docker's hook. I chased him for about 30 to 40 yards, and caught him in Schoolhouse Lane. I did not lose sight of him. I took from him hook (produced) with the initials "J.D." on it. I took him to the wharf. As we got to the gates the other prisoners who had been secured were being taken to the station, and I followed with Duhig without going into the wharf. When charged with assaulting me and Holtby he said, "I brought the hook with me as a protest against Lord Davenport's action, and to show the public the hooks were not in pawn as has been said." I saw Whitelock standing on the top of a pair-horse van throw a piece of wood at Anderson, but missed him. He slipped down from the van, but was arrested as he reached the ground.</p>
               <p>(Monday, October 21.)</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">THEODORE FLINT</hi>, 968 K. On July 24 I accom<lb/>panied the front part of the procession beyond Nightingale Lane. In Wapping High Street I saw a dozen instances of unharnessing horses from vans by the processionists. When I got to Free Trade Wharf the van was alight. I was struck on the helmet with a bottle; I felt giddy and leaned against the railings for a few minutes. I saw Duhig in the crowd in Schoolhouse Lane; he struck at a mounted policeman with his hook and inflicted a wound on his horse. Police-constable Bessell tried to arrest him; Duhig broke away, ran up Schoolhouse Lane to Brooke Street, where Bessell arrested him. I assisted; we 'brought him back</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080085"/>
               <p>to the wharf as the other prisoners were leaving end followed them to the station with Duhig.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">FRANCIS HOLTBY</hi>, 800 K. On July 24 I accom<lb/>panied the procession mounted. As I was nearing Free Trade Wharf I saw a van on fire being moved to the corner of Heckford Street. I drew my truncheon and assisted to clear the crowd away. As I got into Schoolhouse Lane I noticed my horse give a lurch and afterwards found he had a cut on the offside flank nine inches in length. I did not see any of the prisoners there.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">ZEBEDEE PETTIT</hi>, 62 H. On July 24 I was on duty in plain clothes riding a bicycle in Broad Street, acting generally as messenger. When I arrived the streets were being cleared; truncheons were used. The crowd was very hostile and missiles were being thrown. Opposite the "East India Arms" I saw Coffey (whom I knew before) throw up his hands and say, "They intend to break us up, boys. Get out your f—ing hooks." This was to a few standing round him; soon after the mounted police began to clear westwards. In School-house Lane I saw Duhig (who was a stranger to me) strike at a mounted officer and cut his horse with a hook. Police-constable Bessell took him by the shoulder; he got away; I saw him afterwards at the junction of Brook Street and Schoolhouse Lane in custody of Bessell. Someone shouted, "Here is the f—ing spy on the bicycle," and I was struck by a stone or brick in the back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I could not mount my bicycle after getting into contact with the crowd. The people were going in all directions. I heard nothing said about Free Trade Wharf. There were no mounted officers behind Holtby when his horse was cut.</p>
               <p>Police-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY BARRETT</hi>, 37 E. On July 24 I was called out with 10 other constables to Glamys Koad as a reinforcement. Almost immediately after the procession halted the van caught fire. I saw Coffey shouting and carrying on; I told him to go back. He said, "I am not b—well going back; I am going to fetch some of those b—blacklegs back." With a number of other men he made a rush towards the gates of Free Trade Wharf. He tried to butt me in the stomach with his head; I arrested him; he shouted out, "Come on, boys; do not let them (have it all their own way." He continued shouting until I got him into the wharf. I never drew my truncheon at all that day. I did not see any of the prisoners knocked about in the wharf. I did not see Duhig until I saw, him at the station. When charged with using insulting words and behaviour Coffey said, "This is because I did not go out of the street when you told me."</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY NEVILLE</hi>, 284 E, corroborated, and added: I arrested Whitelock; he became very violent. I saw O'Mara open his jacket, take out a piece of wood he had there, and throw it at Inspector Anderson; it missed. He then tried to rescue Moore, but was taken into custody. When charged Whitelock said, "I threw no wood." O'Mara said, "I did not throw any wood." I did not see any pri<lb/>soners ill-treated in the wharf.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Wild. It took five or six officers to stop Whitelock's violence. I did not strike Whitelock with my truncheon, nor did another officer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080086"/>
               <p>strike him in the face with his fist; it is untrue that we knocked him about and made him partly deaf.</p>
               <p>Superintendent <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES BILLINGS</hi>, K Division. Between 6 and 7 p.m. on July 24 I charged all the prisoners with riot. They made no com<lb/>plaint as to the way they had been treated either then or before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Wild. I have been in Court during the whole of the hear<lb/>ing of this case. I read the charge to them once collectively; I did not ask them if they wished to say anything; if they had said anything it would have been taken down.</p>
               <p>(Tuesday, October 22.)</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES SMITH</hi>, 143 H. On July 24 at 3.15 p.m. I was patrolling in front of Free Trade Wharf and assisted to clear the streets; I did not draw my truncheon. I saw McGregor with 20 to 60 others opposite the wharf entrance; he called out, "Come on, boys, get your hooks out, let us have their f—ing guts out," I saw no hook in his hand. He was arrested by Wakefield, 69 KR, became very violent, and I assisted to get him through the wicket gate into the wharf. At about 3.35, when the streets were cleared, I assisted in taking McGregor to the station.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT WAKEFIELD</hi>, 69 KR, corroborated. After Police-constable Smith and I had got McGregor inside the wharf he said, "I have done nothing." He was afterwards charged with in<lb/>sulting behaviour, and made no reply.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Wild. No violence was committed on the prisoners after their arrests.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">ALFRED REEVES</hi>, 485 H. On July 24 I accom<lb/>panied the procession in plain clothes. In Nightingale Lane about 2, 000 of the procession dispersed. I afterwards saw upwards of 5, 000 pass along High Street, Wapping, and stop in Broad Street; several shouted, "We are going to have a go at the Free Trade Wharf—some blacklegs are working there." Hughes said to me outside the wharf, "Let us have the f—ing blacklegs out of this wharf." He was spoken to and taken into custody by Police-constable King; I told him I was a police officer, and assisted in taking him into the wharf. After the crowd dispersed I took him to the station.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">SIDNEY KING</hi>, 919 K. I accompanied the proces<lb/>sion 10 or 12 yards from the main gate to Free Trade Wharf. I heard Hughes say, "Come on, boys, let us have the blacklegs out of this wharf." I asked him to go away: he said, "You go and f—your<lb/>self." I arrested him, and with Reeves's assistance took him into Free Trade Wharf. He was quite inside. None of the prisoners were knocked about inside the wharf.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">DANIEL JAMES</hi>, K Division, recalled. I saw McGregor, Moore, Whitelock, Coffey, and Hughes taken from Free Trade Wharf to the station. As they left the wharf Duhig was brought up from School House Lane by two constables and taken on behind the others by Bessell.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On July 24 I accompanied this procession with about 20 friends to Tower Hill; I did not accompany it back. We came buck down High Street, Shadwell; we stopped and had a glass of beer. We went along and heard the procession coming round as they had been round the docks. We fell in the rear of the procession and accompanied it to Free Trade. Wharf. We came to the front to see what it had stopped for and I saw a van afire on the opposite side of the road. We crossed the road opposite the "East India Arms "; when we go there we saw the mounted police approaching with drawn truncheons. I saw an opening and I went to get up Schoolhouse Lane. I did not want to cause any trouble, as I had my wife just out of a bad confinement. Police-constable Hughes struck me in the eye with his fist. It left a mark there for the next day. He told me I ought to have my b—g head knocked off. He gave me three or four clouts on the ribs. He then took me into custody. I had done nothing to him. I was not leading the rushes. Nobody tried to rescue me. I first saw O'Mara in the wharf; he is a stranger to me. I did not see Duhig till after I got to the station. I have never seen 'him before. I did not assault a constable or take part in any disturbance. I did not say, "Let's have the blacklegs out of London," or anything of that kind. This is the first time I have been in any sort of trouble.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not say a word as regards causing any dis<lb/>turbance. I did not utter a word to anybody until the policeman struck me. I said, then, I had no cause to join any disturbance, as I wanted' to get home to my wife. I was one of the strikers and had been on strike for some weeks. This was the first meeting on Tower Hill that I had been to. I know a man named Spacer, but cannot say that I heard him speak. I had not been on any kind of duty for the strikers. This was the first time I bad ever seen Free Trade Wharf. I did not know that work was going on there on that day. When I left Tower Hill I was going straight home through High Street, Shadwell, when the procession came up. I let it pass and then joined in the rear. That was my nearest way home. I could not tell why the procession came round by the docks and wharves. I knew that free labourers were doing the work, but I could not tell in which locality they were doing it. I knew that work was going on at the wharves and docks on the route of the procession. I did not know that the procession was going that way; they could have gone another way. I was arrested about 3.15. The crowd behaved very quietly; I never saw any disturbance; they were having a song. I did not hear anything shouted out about the blacklegs. The van had been fired before I got there. I did not see anything being thrown about from the van. I dad not know my way about that way much or else I should have taken the nearest way home. I never touched the constable; I tried to get away from him; I was not violent. My friends, Johnson and Baker, were alongside of me; we were together when the charge was made. I was taken into the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080088"/>
               <p>wharf. I did not notice any of the prisoners there; I was put up against a van by the constables. The constable struck me in the ribs as I was being taken into the wharf once or twice. I called out, "Oh!" when he struck me; that is all. I was confused when I got to the police-station. I did not say a word to the superintendent about the officer punching me in the ribs. I did not tell the magistrate of the brutality of the constable. I did not call out when I was being arrested, "Come on, boys; don't let them take me." I saw no rushes made at the wharf. I did not raise my leg as if I was going to kick the con<lb/>stable.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I did not come back with the crowd. When the pro<lb/>cession stopped I pushed in front with others to see what was the matter. I was anxious to get home. The van being on fire was the cause of a lot of trouble. The people were singing. I could not hear the words. When the mounted police charged the crowd they scat<lb/>tered in all directions. I ran towards Schoolhouse Lane. If I had stopped where I was I should have got a knock on the head.</p>

                  </hi>. I was acting-marshal in the procession on July 4 from Tower Hill. We had no idea of stopping at the "East India Arms." Inspector James said that if we got the boys together over the moving bridge he would give us the price of a drink. I told Sims, the bandmaster, and we stopped at the "East India Arms," opposite Free Trade Wharf. I left the procession and went and ordered re<lb/>freshments. The band went into the public-house and we stayed there a quarter of an hour. The band was not stopped in order that Free Trade Wharf might be attacked. I heard the shouts and the fire engine come along. I heard Inspector Anderson give the word. "Charge!"We were scattered about right and left and I saw two women struck and brutally knocked about. A policeman on horse<lb/>back tried to hit me. I tried to get the band up Schoolhouse Lane. They did not play any more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was on strike. I started from Maritime Hall with the procession, but not in charge. I was in the front part of the procession. We were on the bridge when Inspector James spoke to me. Throughout the strike James was always kind and considerate to us; he was our father. I did not see any vans interfered with. I heard the men singing. I did not hear them say, "Let us get these blacklegs out." The procession came down Nightingale Lane and through the dock area because it was the nearest cut borne, so that we should have no dealings with the traffic. I do not know Free Trade Wharf. I knew workmen were working in there. The crowd was booing, but I did not know who they were booing at. They did not boo till the police charged them. They were perfectly quiet when the police charged them. I never heard any bad language. I did not see any rush. The people on the pavement who were not strikers were dis<lb/>orderly. I did not see the van on fire, till the engine came up. Inspec<lb/>tor Anderson was galloping up and down hitting out right and left with other officers. I saw prisoners O'Mara, Duhig, and Hughes there. I did not see O'Mara do anything. I told him to get up in Schoolhouse Lane. I did not see him with any pieces of wood. I did not seen them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191210080089"/>
               <p>go to the assistance of Moore. I did not see Moore taken into custody. I did not see Hughes do anything; he was standing quite quietly. I did not see him taken into custody.</p>
               <p>(Thursday, October 24.)</p>
               <p>Moore, Whitelock, O'Mara, Coffey, Duhig, and Hughes withdrew their plea of not guilty and <rs id="t19121008-59-verdict-1" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Mr. Bodkin stated that the prosecution had no desire to press the case against McGregor.</p>
               <p>By the Recorders direction the jury returned a verdict of <rs id="t19121008-59-verdict-2" type="verdictDescription">
                     <interp inst="t19121008-59-verdict-2" type="verdictCategory" value="notGuilty"/>
                     <interp inst="t19121008-59-verdict-2" type="verdictSubcategory" value="directed"/>Not guilty as against McGregor</rs> and Guilty of riot as against the other prisoners, acquitting them on the counts charging them with assaulting the police, those charges not being pressed by the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wild said that on the instructions of some of his clients it had been his painful duty to make an attack on the police or on some mem<lb/>bers of the force, but he must not be construed as having made a general attack on the conduct of the police. All that he meant was that there might have been something of an error of judgment, but he intended nothing more. He bad considered the matter, and it was quite possible that the defendants had exaggerated—possibly unconsciously—what they believed was done to them. In any case he was instructed to with<lb/>draw unreservedly any attack which had been made on the police.</p>
               <p>The Recorder said that in his opinion the case raised an issue of the utmost gravity. A direct charge had been made against the police of having exceeded their duty in a most unjustifiable way, and he learnt with the greatest satisfaction that it had been, wihdrawn. It was impos<lb/>sible to give credence to such charges in view of the fact that there was not a whisper of them until a day or two after the hearing of the case was begun at this Court. There was, therefore, only one course open to Mr. Wild as an honourable man, and that course he had taken, and the charges were unreservedly withdrawn by him. Especially was that the case with reference to Inspector Skilton, whom he (the Recorder) had known for many years as a most able officer. He added that the jury had desired him to say that in their opinion the police evidence was given in an able manner. During this unhappy strike the police were constantly on duty and their conduct during those trying weeks was exemplary.</p>
