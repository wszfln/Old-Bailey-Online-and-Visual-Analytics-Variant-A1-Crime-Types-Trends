I tax'd him with it, and he own'd he sold it to her, that Tinsley took the Money, gave him 6 d. of it, and had the remaining Groat for her self; and she own'd that she took the Money and carried it to him. Upon this I got a search Warrant, and found 14 of my naked Babies in Tinsley's Room, in Davis's House. I know my own Babies from any other Man's, I can swear to my own Work, for there's never a Man in England that makes such Babies besides my self. Then I went to

             these 5 Years, and a very honest Body she is. For my own part, I never dress'd a Baby in my life; but on the 21st of March about Noon, Nell, what d'ye call her? a crooked Body, brought two dozen of these Dolls to my House Jenny came with her indeed, but it was Nell that had the Dolls. And so, says Nell, says she, I wish you would go and sell these Dolls for me to such a Man, in St. Catherine's-Lane, that has bespoke 'em I am afraid Nell, says I, that these Dolls belong to your Master [the Prosecutor.] No, says Nell, they are nothing but old rubbishing Dolls that lie about our House, and such as we often fling away, and I have got our Joe to paint their Faces up, and make them look a little smug; so away goes I to this Man's House, but when I came there he was provided, for he had just bought half a Gross of Dolls for 15 s. back I comes to Nell, and tells her how, and about it. Well, says she, go to Mr. Robottom's in White-Chapel, and see if he won't buy them. No, says I, Nell, any Body may see by my Looks, that I am no Doll-dresser. So then Nell was for going away, and Jenny said to her (but I don't know what she meant by it) I wish you would dress those two odd Dolls for me. When Nell was gone, I advised Jenny to go to her Master's, for fear she should lose her Work; but it raining very hard, she could not go without being wet to the Skin, and so she staid till 9 at Night, and then went home. About half an Hour after comes Nell again, and asks for Jenny. I told her she was gone, and with that Nell turns about, and beckons thus with her Finger - I ask your Lordship's Pardon - and in comes Mr. Higgs and his Wife. Says he, What's in that Basket? A Parcel of Dolls, says I. Give them me, says he, No, says I, you may take them if you will. So his Wife took the Basket, and turn'd the Dolls out upon my Bed and told them, and then she put them up again. The Jury <rs id="t17330404-3-verdict13" type="verdictDescription">

            . The Prosecutor came to me in Drury-Lane Playhouse-Passage, and asked for a Constable. I went with him to the House, where we found only the Prisoner. I ask'd him, if it was she that took his Watch, he said, No, the Women that took it were gone. I told the Prisoner if she'd procure the Watch I'd give her half a Guinea. Give it me then, says she, and I'll find the Watch. Will you so? Says I, then if you can find it for half a Guinea you shall find it without. But she would not, and so she was sent to Bridewell, and while she was there, the Watch was sent to the Keeper.</p>

            . I am Watchman in Cavendish Square. As I was standing in my Watch-box between 2 and 3 in the Morning, I heard the fall of an Iron Rail, and running out I saw the Prisoner coming from the Steps at Madam Scattergood's Door with a Bar in his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040005"/> Hand. As soon as he perceiv'd me, he took to his Heels, and I ran after him. He threw away the Bar, and ran by the Duke of Argyle's down King-street; I cry'd out, stop Thief, he got past the first Watch, but was stopt by another Watch, and he was not out of my Sight till he was taken. The Moon was up, but it was a little cloudy, though not so much but I could see him.</p>

            , Watchman. As I called Two o'Clock in Marlborough-street, I found a Bar of some Pallisades bent, and looking farther I found another in the same Condition. Upon this I thought there was some Roguery going forward; so I planted my Lanthern in the middle of Blenheim-street, that my Inhabitants might see I was upon my Duty, and then I went aside and stood upon the Watch, and presently I heard a cry of stop Thief. Says I to my Brother Watch, do you go down Tyler-street, and I'll go down Little Marlborough-street, and so we did. I met the Prisoner running with his drawn Sword (for he is a Soldier) and I knocked him down. My Liberty has lately been very much robbed, which is a sign that it is pestered with Rogues; I have lost a great deal of ron and Lead - not that it was my own, but my inhabitants; and as several Attempts have been made, they had lost a great deal more if it had not been for the Care of the Watch, which is a Sign that the Watch have not neglected their Duty; and if the Watch should sink, by consequence my Inhabitants cannot stand. And therefore, pray, my Lord, stand by the Watch whatever you do, or else my People will be undone; they will be robbed, and have their Throats cut, and their Houses burnt about their Ears. The Prisoner has threatened to be even with the Watch, but he did not say which of them; therefore, I hope, the Watch will be protected. When I knocked the Prisoner down, he reeled six Yards before he sell, and then he said I had killed him.</p>

            . I had been drinking too much in the City, and in my Way Home I parted with a Friend who call'd me by my Name, and bad me good night. The Prisoner Leakin coming by, and hearing my Name, she call'd to me, and said, Won't you give me a Dram, Master Harrison? Who are you, says I? What! says she, don't you know me, Master? I am Leakin the Waterman's Wife. So I went with her to Mrs. Robinson's Brandy-shop in Nightingale-lane, and there was a Boy playing on the Bell-harp; I threw down a Half-penny (as I thought) to the Boy; but the Woman of the Shop took it up, and said it was a Guinea. I told her, since she was so honest, if she would give me 20 Shillings in Change, I would leave the other Shilling to be spent among the Customers. So she gave me 20 s. and presently Michael Roop (

Let me see you Home; but I hope we shall drink together first; won't you give me a Pint. Master? With all my Heart, says I, and so he and I and his Wife and Betty Leakin went to the Horse-shoe and Ship Alehouse, where I gave them three Pints of Two penny, and a Pint of hot; I paid a Shilling for the Reckoning, and then he talked no more about seeing me home.

               <p>Dr. Stevens. I live in Covent Garden. On St. Paul's Day in the Evening, I went with my Daughter to visit a Friend in Silver-street. About Eleven I sent for a Hackney Coach, for as I expected to stay late I had discharged my own Chariot; the Coach waited at the Door about an hour and a half, and then I and my Daughter stept in. I suppose some Street Robbers had taken Notice of the Coach's standing there so long; for at the End of Foster-lane my Daughter told me there was a Couple of Men that follow'd us. The Coach going faster in Cheapside, she observ'd that they mended their Pace accordingly; Pappa! says she, how those Gentlemen run! She took them to be Gentlemen, for they were well dress'd. We went down Pater-noster-Row, and in <placeName id="t17330404-43-crimeloc178">Ave-Mary-Lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17330404-43-crimeloc178" type="placeName" value="Ave-Mary-Lane"/>

A Man came to the Coach-door, and holding a Pistol to my Daughter's Head, he said, Don't be frighten'd Madam! but God damn you if you squawl, I'll shoot you thro' the Head! I had a Purse with 10 Guineas in it, which I secur'd, and gave him only a half Guinea, and a Spanish Dollar, which were loose in my Pocket. God damn you, says he, you have more! No I ha'nt, says I, you shall search me if you will. My Daughter gave him her Purse; he ask'd her what was in it? She said, Not above 3 or 4 Guineas. And then he bid the Coachman drive on.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the Person that robb'd you and your Daughter?</p>
               <p>Dr. Stevens. Yes, I am pretty sure it was that young Fellow there, he in the Blue-grey Coat, 
               <persName id="t17330404-43-person247">
                  Edward

            . As soon as he was gone, says I to my Daughter, you told me there were two Men, but I saw but one ? Pappa, says she, there was another, but he stood at a Distance. The Coachman likewise said there were two, but neither my Daughter nor he saw any more; and therefore I can't apprehend that Powers and the 3 Prisoners could all be there.</p>
               <p>Miss Stevens. My Father and I were robb'd by one Man. I gave my Purse to that Man. I can't say how much Money there was in it, any farther, than that there was above ten Shillings. I know none of the Prisoners, nor who it was that took my Money. The Account my Father has given is true, and I can add nothing more to it.</p>

            . The Prisoner Elms and I went to Will. Morris's Mother's (in Eagle-Court in the Strand) to sell some things that we had stole; we staid there till 9 at Night, and then I ask'd Will Morris to go out with me; but he not being well, refus'd; then Elms and I agreed to go together; he had two Pistols, and I had one, and a great Knife. We went down Holbourn, and so to Cheapside, where we met the other two Prisoners, Kemp and Taylor. They ask'd us to give them a Dram, for they said, they had been picking of Pockets all Night, and had got nothing but two Handkerchiefs, but they must get something else or it would never do. We went to a Gin-Shop over-against Stocks-Market, where we had half a Pint of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040008"/> Gin, and we agreed to go out together, and get some Money.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that Agreement made in the Shop?</p>
               <p>Powers. No, it was as we were coming out.</p>
               <p>Court. What Time was this?</p>
               <p>Powers. It was between 9 and 10 at Night. I don't remember the Day of the Month; but I think it was on a Friday. We went as far as Fleet-Street, and return'd thro' St. Paul's Church-Yard, and so to Cheapside again, before we met with any thing; but then we saw this Coach and agreed to rob it. It was then between 12 and 1 a-Clock. We all follow'd it to Cheapside-Conduit, and there we agreed that Elms and I should still follow the Coach, which went down Pater-noster-Row, and that Kemp and Taylor should go thro' Paul's Church-Yard, and meet us. We did so, and met in the Street that is over-against Warwick-Lane, and turns out of Pater-noster-Row into Ludgate-Street; I forgot the Name of the Place, and there we stopt the Coach.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you all four together then?</p>
               <p>Powers. Yes, but not very close. We were in Sight of one another.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that Kemp and Taylor agreed with you to rob this Coach?</p>
               <p>Powers. Yes, we agreed so to do as soon as we saw it, and they two agreed to go thro' Paul's Church-Yard for the same Purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. And how did you dispose of your selves when you met?</p>
               <p>Powers. Elms bid the Coachman stand. Says I to Taylor, the Watch is hard by. But says he, they don't see us; but for fear they should disturb us, it was agreed that he should stand and keep an Eye upon them. Then I went to the Coach-door, and desir'd the Doctor to deliver. The Doctor gave me a Dollar, and something else, but I don't know whether it was a half Guinea or a 6 Pence, for I dropp'd it out of my Hand. Then Kemp came and robb'd the Doctor's Daughter.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that kemp robb'd the young Lady?</p>
               <p>Powers. Yes, I am positive of it. I sold the Dollar for 4 s. 4 d. to a Silversmith in the Hay-Market in the Borough; 'tis on this Side the King's-Bench, and almost over-against Blue-Maid-Alley.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that Silversmith here?</p>
               <p>Powers. No.</p>
               <p>Court. And whither did you go after the Robbery?</p>
               <p>Powers. We went to Smithfield, and there we shared the Money in the Street. There was 11 s. 6 d. in the Purse. I had the Dollar for my Share, which they reckon'd at a Crown, and said, it was more than my Due. Then I cross'd the Water, and they went over the Bridge, in Expectation of meeting their Wives who walk'd the Streets.</p>
               <p>Elms. Where was I ever drinking in your Company, or in any Robbery with you?</p>
               <p>Powers, I have known Elms three Years. He never robb'd in my Company before, except only trifling Things, as when we took some Goods out of a Sash Window in Chancery-Lane. I was with him in the Poultry-Compter, where he robb'd two Taylors, and it cost me six Guineas to have the Bill brought in Ignoramus. And we have been in Newgate together too.</p>
               <p>Court. Call the Turnkey; swear him; Have you seen Elms before?</p>
               <p>Turnkey. Yes, my Lord; he and Powers were both Prisoners together, in the Common Side in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Elms. I was sent to the Compter only for an Assault.</p>
               <p>Kemp, to Powers. When we were in the Brandy Shop [at Stocks market] was any Body else with us? Powers. No.</p>
               <p>Kemp. Was I ever with you since you have been an Evidence?</p>
               <p>Powers. No, I have been in Jail ever since.</p>
               <p>Kemp. I mean, before you was an Evidence.</p>
               <p>Powers. Yes, when my Lady Page dy'd, he carry'd me down to Greenwich to cut Pockets at the Burying, and we follow'd her to Bunhill-Fields.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Was I ever drinking with you?</p>
               <p>Powers. Yes often, but we never were in any Robberies together, except in picking of Pockets, of Handkerchiefs and such Trifles.</p>
               <p>Kemp. Powers took me in Bird-Cage-Alley in the Mint, (on the 15th of February) to bring me on this Side of the Water. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040009"/> resisted, and desired to go before a Justice, and so I was carried before Sir

            , Coachman. Not by Name; but if this is he, I have seen him before; he robb'd my Coach. I took up Dr. Stevens and his Daughter in Silver-Street. He bid me drive to King's-Street in Covent-Garden. That Day was three Weeks, about 3 in the Morning, I had taken up a Fare, to carry to the Sun in Clare-Market, and going behind Paul's my Fare was robb'd. And therefore not thinking it safe to go that way again, I drove down Pater-noster-Row. I was got but a little way down, when I saw two Men by my Coach side, one kept even with my Fore-Wheel, and the other with the Hind-Wheel. If I trotted, they mended their pace. There was no Watchmen on that side of the Way, but there were some on the other. I having been robb'd so lately, I had a Suspicion of them, and taking fast hold by my Seat. I stoop'd down and look'd hard at them betwixt the Wheel. I saw they were well dress'd, and Zookers, thinks I, why should I have an ill Opinion of these Persons, they look like Gentlemen? So I drove on; but in Ave-Mary-Lane, before I came to Stationery-Court, one of them catch'd hold of my Horse's Head, and the other went rou nd to the Coach Door, and open'd it, on that Side next to the Watch, which I thought was a little bold, for the Watch stood but at the Corner of Pater-noster-Row. When he had robb'd my Fare, they did not run away, but stood still, and bid me drive on, which I did. I look'd back three or four Times, and saw them both walk leisurely off together.</p>
               <p>Court. Both? Did you see but two?</p>
               <p>Headly. I saw no more.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they both go to the Coach-door?</p>
               <p>Headly. No; but one of them, and that was Powers.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you very sure of that?</p>
               <p>Headly. Yes, I am certain of it; for the other all the while walked to and fro by the Horses Heads, and cried, Hoy! - Have a Care! - What's the Matter? - Stand away! - to make believe that the Coach stood still to set down a Fare.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the Prisoners - go nearer - Did you see either of them there?</p>
               <p>Headly. I think that Man [Elms] is very like him that stopt the Horses, but I can't be positive; I would not swear away any Man's Life for the World.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Stevens, I think, Sir, you said, that the same Person who robbed you, robbed your Daughter ; are you positive as to that Particular?</p>
               <p>Dr. S. I am positive it was the very same Person.</p>
               <p>Court And are you, Madam?</p>
               <p>Miss S. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. And neither of you saw any more than two Men. Both. No more.</p>
               <p>Court. The Coachmen swears the same; and yet Powers has sworn, that there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040010"/> four concern'd in the Robbery, and that self robb'd the Doctor, and Kemp the young Lady: This considerably lessens the Credit of Power's Evidence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peters. On the 26th of February, near 8 at Night, I and my Daughter were returning from Kensington in a Hackney Coach; the wooden Shutters of the Coach-doors were drawn up close; a little on this side of <placeName id="t17330404-44-crimeloc186">Knights-bridge</placeName>

I took out some Money, I guess it might be about 12s. and gave him. He then said, Give me your Hand, which I did; and he pulled off my Ring. It was a mourning Ring, I had it made with several others of the same kind, on the Death of my Uncle; the Inscription was, Dan. Brown 22 May, 1732. AEt. 80. He asked for my Sword; I told him I had none; Then give me your Watch, says he. I pulled my Watch out, and in pulling, the Chain slip'd off. I gave the Chain to my Daughter, and the Watch to the Prisoner. Whether it was after I had given him my Watch, or before, I cannot be certain, but he snatch'd off my Hat and Wig. I expostulated with him on that Occasion. I told him it was very unusual for Men of his Profession to take such Things, and that it being very cold it might indanger my Health. He swore plentifully, gave me a great deal of opprobrious Language, and told me that he would take all he could get. While we were in this Debate, a Man came from the Causeway with a Candle and Lanthorn, upon which the Highwayman rode off. The Man with the Lanthorn follow'd, and alarm'd the Neighbourhood, and my Servant (

             ) who was behind the Coach, got down and went after them, but return'd before the Prisoner was apprehended. I ty'd a Handkerchief about my Head, and the Coachman drove on. Next Morning, being Tuesday, I sent for Mr. Delander, who made my Watch, to have it advertis'd. He went home to look for the Number, and brought me word, that the Prisoner was taken at Knightsbridge. I have a Friend there (Major Aldy) who is a Justice of the Peace. I sent my Man that way, to enquire if any of my Goods were found upon the Prisoner; my Man went to the Major, who sent me word of the Particulars, and that he could not detain the Prisoner without my Evidence. I took Horse, and went thither that Afternoon. Mr. Aldy shew'd me these Goods. This is the Watch, I have Reason to know it, for I have had it these 20 Years. The Swivel is broken off, and here's my Name F.P. In a Cypher engraven on the Back of the Case. This is the Wig, 'tis seal'd with black Wax ('tis my Daughter's Seal, with my Coat of Arms in a Lozenge,) this, with as much Certainty as is possible, I believe to be mine; and this is the Ring which I verily believe is mine too. Here's the Inscription on it, which I mentioned before, tho' indeed I gave away several of the same Sort upon my Uncle's Death; but they were all made fit for the Persons they were design'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040011"/> for, and this fits me exactly. Mr. Aldy told me, the Prisoner was in the Round-house, and ask'd me if I would have him sent for, but I chose to go to him. There's an Inner-Room in the Round-house, in which the Prisoner was lock'd up. I told him, he had used me hardly, in taking my Hat and Wig. He said, he had no Remembrance of it, but he was sorry -</p>
               <p>Court. What did he say he was sorry for?</p>
               <p>Mr. Peters. He did not say for what, but only that he was sorry. I told him I did not expect him to make a Confession to me. As near as I can guess, he at that time had on the same kind of Habit as the Person had who robbed me. And I thought him much of the same Bulk and Size, being a very lusty tall Man, though I am the less certain as to that, because he that robbed me was on Horse-back, and I could not so well determine as to his Height. And as it was near Eight at Night, it was too dark for me to distinguish his Person, or the Colour of his Clothes, though when the Lanthorn came, the glimpse of the Candle gave a better Observation, but not enough to enable me to be positive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the Gentleman came to me in the Roundhouse, he said that I was the Man; upon which I told him, if I was, I was sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Court. The Gentleman speaks very fair, he does not swear that you said you was sorry you had robbed him, but only that you was sorry.</p>

            . I was behind the Coach when my Master was robbed; it was about Eight o'Clock on Monday Night, betwixt Knightsbridge and the Park-Gate. I believe the Prisoner to be the Man; I could distinguish his Person by the light of the Lanthorn; he had a whitish great Coat on; he bid the Coachman stand, and then went to the Window and bid them open it. Then he said, Give me your Money; which I suppose was done, because I heard him say, Is this all? Then he said, Give me your Sword. My Mistress answered, My Father has none. And then he asked for my Master's Watch and Ring, and I believe they were delivered to him, but I do not know for certain. And about that time I saw him make a Motion with his Hand in the Coach, and he brought out my Master's Hat and Wig. A Man coming along with a Lanthorn, I beckoned and spoke to him softly. He came towards me, and I jumped down, and told him, that a Highwayman was robbing my Master; the Light coming up, the Prisoner turn'd his Horse and rode towards Knights-bridge. That's the Man, says I; and so I and the other Man follow'd, and alarm'd the People; but the Prisoner was not then taken. So I came back, and found my Master with a Handkerchief on his Head. Next Morning my Master sent me to Newgate, to see if any such Person was come in. I heard of none there, and then I went to the Gatehouse, and there was none there neither; but going towards Kensington, I called at the Sun Alehouse, where I heard that such a Man was taken, and coming back I saw the Prisoner going from the Roundhouse to the Justice's. The Justice gave me a Note to my Master to desire him to come and see the Prisoner in the Afternoon, and my Master went.</p>

            . As I was coming home from London with my Lanthorn, I saw a Coach standing in the Road, and the Footman behind beckoned to me. I went towards him, and said, What do you want honest Friend? He made me no Answer just then, but presently such a Man as the Prisoner is for bulk brushed by me. He was in a white Rug Coat, he had something in his Hand, which I guess was a Pistol; I struck at him, and cry'd out, Stop Highwayman. The Town was alarmed, but no Body stopt him.</p>
               <p>Court. How so?</p>
               <p>Spencely. Because I suppose they did not dare to do it. I followed him, and Mr. Peters's Man came after me, expecting the Highwayman had been taken; but finding that he was not, he return'd to his Master, I continued my Pursuit till I came to the Halfway-House betwixt Kensington and Knights-bridge, and looking through the Window I saw the Prisoner sitting on Horseback in the Kitchen.</p>
               <p>Court. On Horseback in the Kitchen? Was the Door high enough for him to ride in?</p>
               <p>Spencely. Yes; I saw he was such a Man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040012"/> as I had seen at the Coach-side about a Quarter of an Hour before; that was at about Eight a Clock, and this was at about a Quarter past Eight. I would have gone in and taken him directly, but 2 Women (who were with me, and saw him sitting upon the House - the Horse, I would say - as well as I) would not let me. Says I, There's a Highwayman, by God. - I beg your Lordship's Pardon - and I'll go and pull him off his Horse; ( for I was Man sufficient to do it without any Assistance) but as I said, the 2 Women would not let me. They begged me not to venture ; for said they, If you should be murder'd, we shan't bear to see your Wife. Though I had certainly done it nevertheless, if he had been alone; but besides the Prisoner, I saw the Landlord there, and a Woman, and a Soldier, and the House was a House of ill Repute. So I proceeded to get more help, and met the Kensington Stage-Coach with some Men in it, and desired them to assist, but they refused. Then I went to Mr. Swinnow's, where the two young Women (who went forward while I stopt to speak with the Kensington Coach) were got before me. There I found

            , and he agreed to go with me. We went back to the Half-way-House, but the Prisoner was not then in the Kitchen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peters. When you saw the Prisoner thro' the Window, had he one or two Hats on?</p>
               <p>Spencely. I can't say as to that; but not seeing him in the Kitchin when I came back, I asked the Landlord if such a Man had not been there. He did not answer me readily, which made me suspect the Prisoner was concealed in the House; but at last he said, such a Man had been there, but he was gone. I told him that Gentleman was my Friend, and I should be glad to drink with him. My Landlord made me no answer, and I finding that the Pretence I made would signify nothing, I told him that that Man was a Highwayman, that I had seen him thro' the Window but a little while ago, and that I had been to get Assistance to take him. Presently a Man came to the Door, and cry'd Hollo! some Body said, That's he. I was just going to step out, but my Landlord pushed out before me, and seized him first; I followed directly, and others after me, and then my Landlord pulled him off the Horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he make any Resistance?</p>
               <p>Spencely. After we had seized him, he dragged us, I believe, a matter, of 18 or 20 Yards before we could get him down, and he struggled a little upon the Ground, but I believe that was rather to make away with what he had about him, than upon any other Account.</p>
               <p>Court. What Clothes had he on at that time?</p>
               <p>Spencely. A dark Wig, a light Rug Coat, with a Red Coat under it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Spencely. He was seemingly very sober. We brought him into the House and searched him. I examined his Right hand Coat Pocket, and took out a Handkerchief, a light

            , and this Ivory Whistle; it has a single Call at one end, and a double Call at the other. You shall hear now - Here's the single Call [whistles] - and here's the double one [whistle again.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Peters. The Wig that Spencely found was not mine.</p>
               <p>Spencely. While we were searching him, the Landlady seem'd to take the Prisoner's part; What! are you going to rob the Man? says she - He's a substantial Innkeeper - and as he is a Gentleman, use him like one. I carried him before the Justice at Knights-bridge, and there the Things that were taken from him by several Persons were produced and put in a Hat. I saw there was a Mourning Ring among them with the Name of Dan. Brown upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peters. I have People here, who made the Watch, the Ring, the Hat, and the Wig, if your Lordship pleases to have them called now?</p>

               <p>- Arundel, I am Landlord of the Halfway-House. On Monday the 26th of February, about 6 at Night, the Prisoner, on Horse-back, call'd at my Door for 2 Mug of Beer; he drank and did not stay a Quarter of an Hour, but went away, and came again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040013"/> in about half an Hour more. Then he alighted and came in a-doors, and I put his Horse in the Place where I Brew my Beer, for my Pigs were in the Stable. He call'd for a Quartern of Brandy, and when he had stay'd a little while, he bid me bring out his Horse, which I did, and he mounted, and rode away. It was then 7 a-Clock, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Court. Which way did he go?</p>
               <p>Arundel. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peters. Had he but one Hat on then, or two?</p>
               <p>Arundel. I saw but one Hat. He came a third Time, and call'd at the Door for a Mug of Beer. It wanted then about 10 Minutes of 8. We desir'd him to come in, as People often ride into our Kitchen. He did so, and had another Quartern of Brandy, and would have had a third Quartern, but I did not care for drinking any more. Then he rode out again, and said, Now for London.</p>
               <p>Court. Had he one Hat or two when he call'd this third Time?</p>
               <p>Arundel. He had two Hats, and the uppermost had a Crape Hat-band - Presently after he was gone, Mr. Dukes a Distiller of Hammersmith came in, and said, You had a Highwayman drinking here just now. I don't know what he was, says I, but he paid me honestly for what he had, and it was no Business of mine to inquire into other People's Affairs; tho' if I had known as much before, I should have taken him if I could. Then Spencely came in and said, a Highwayman had been there on Horse-back, and that he saw him thro' the Window, but was afraid to come in. While we were talking, the Prisoner came the fourth time to the Door, and cry'd, Hollo! I went to the Door, and catch'd him fast by the Arm, and said, I take you on Suspicion of being a Highwayman. He snatch'd his Arm away, and I catch'd hold of the Lappet of his Great Coat. He made off 18 or 20 Yards, but I still hung by his Lappet, tho' I could not have held much longer; but then I fetch'd him off his Horse, and said, I have him! Spencely, I believe, was the next Man, for he was just by at the Door, when I came out; but I think no Man was anewst me when I first seiz'd the Prisoner; then he was search'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peters. Did he pull out a Watch when he came in with the two Hats?</p>
               <p>Arundel. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peters. Had it a Chain?</p>
               <p>Arundel. No; it was a Silver Watch, I look'd on it to see the Hour.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that the Watch?</p>
               <p>Arundel. It was about this Size, but I can't swear to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Arundel. I don't think he was quite sober, but he was thoroughly merry; for if a Man is capable of sitting upon his Horse, I can't think, he can be said to be drunk.</p>

               <p>S. Arundel. The first time he came into the House he had but one Hat; but the second time he had two.</p>
               <p>Court. The second Time?</p>

               <p>S. Arundel. Yes, he held it in the Palm of his Hand by the Fire-side. I said it was 8 a-Clock, but he said, it wanted 10 Minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. Had it a Chain or not?</p>
               <p>S. Arundel. I saw no Chain.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it a Silver Watch or a Gold one?</p>
               <p>S. Arundel. Silver. Then he paid, and went away, and presently Mr. Dukes came from Hammersmith, and said, we had a Highwayman there, who had robb'd a Coach. Upon which I said to my Husband, My Dear, if he comes again stop him. After that there came in five or six People more, and the Prisoner came a fourth Time, and rid to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040014"/> the Door as usual; says I, My Dear, that's the Man, I beg you would go and take him.

            , Constable. On Monday Night the 26th of Feb. the Beadle told me, that a Highwayman was apprehended, and I must come and take him into Custody; I found him at the Beadle's House, from whence he was carry'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040015"/> to the Round-house, and next Morning he was taken before the Justice. Several things were given me in a Hat; there was a Whistle and three Keys, a Bag with some Powder, and five Bullets, and a Mourning Ring - this is the very Ring; and the Justice gave me a Wig that was deliver'd to him by

            ; this is the Wig, I have kept it ever since under Lock and Key.</p>
               <p>J. Walker. I was quarter'd at Mr. Arnold's [Arundel's] House, where the Prisoner was taken. The second time he came into the House he had two Hats on, and the top Hat had a Mourning Hat-band. He asked what a Clock it was; Somebody said near 8, upon which he pulled out a Watch without a Chain. He ask'd how far it was to Kensington? I said half a Mile. Then he said, he'd go to London. Soon after he was gone, Spencely the Baker came in, and enquired for him, and in a little time the Prisoner rid up to the Back-Door, and call'd. I saw him thro' the Window. I ask'd him what he would have? He said, A Mug of Beer, Soldier. I went into the Back-Parlour, and told my Landlord. Then I went out first, and took hold of the Prisoner's Horse's Bridle, and then my Landlord came out, and seiz'd him. Upon which he spur'd his Horse, and broke the Bridle out of my Hand, and as he turn'd about; my Landlord slipt his Hand, and catch'd hold of the Lappet of the Prisoner's Coat, and cry'd, I have him. The Prisoner got Seven or Eight Yards from the Door, and then we secur'd him.</p>
               <p>Court. Seven or Eight Yards?</p>
               <p>Walker. It was there or thereabouts; I won't swear to a Yard or two. The Prisoner was brought in, I saw two Wigs taken out of his Pocket. This Wig with the Black Seal is one of them; there was a Whistle and a Ring too; I heard it said before the Justice, that there was the Name of one Mr. Brown upon the Ring. There was a Purse of Powder found upon him too, and five Bullets, and a green Silk-Purse, with 16 s. 3 d. After he was search'd, I and another Man went out with a Lanthorn and Candle to the Place where he was taken, and there we found two Hats stuck-together, the same that he had on in the House; the outermost was a new Hat, with a Mourning Hat-Band. I left a Mark on it, and this is the very same. We found a brown Double-breasted-Coat too, I suppose he might let it fall, when he was pull'd off the Horse. I brought all these Things into the House, and the Prisoner own'd his own Hat, and his Wig that was in it.</p>

I was present when the Prisoner was taken; I saw him search'd, and two Wigs taken out of his Pocket, one of them had a black Seal; a Mourning Ring was taken out of his Breeches Pocket, the Inscription upon it is Dan.

            . Coming from Kensington, our Stage Coachman, Will. White, said there was a Robbery committed between Hyde-Park Corner and Knights-bridge, and the Highwayman was at the Half-way House, sitting on Horseback in the Kitchen. We went thither; the Prisoner was gone; but in a quarter of an Hour he came again, and knock'd at the Door, and said, Hollo! let's have a Pint of Beer. Says Spencely, That's the Man. The Landlord and Gritton went out and seiz'd him, and cry'd, Help! I lifted the Prisoner up, and said Let's bring him in, and see that he don't kill some of us. Gritton took a Watch out of his Hand, and a Wig with a black Seal, out of his Pocket. The Watch had no String, nor Seal, nor Chain, and there was a Cypher on the Back, for I took Notice of it, and this is the same Watch. I took the Powder and Ball, and Ring, out of his Pocket, and I saw the two Hats taken up where the Prisoner was pull'd off his Horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Delander. I made this Watch for Mr. Peters, and I had it to mend about a Months ago. And this Ring is one of those I made for him, on his Uncle's Death. The other Rings had the same Inscription.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Pray let Gritton or the Constable be ask'd if I was drunk or sober.</p>
               <p>Gritton. I believe he was drunk.</p>
               <p>Wichelow. And I believe so too, because after I had put him in the Watch-house, I heard him a hammering and thumping, and I called to him, and told him, I'd be with him presently, and when came he had broke down the Bracket of a Bench; I asked him why he did it? And he said, he wanted to get out.</p>
               <p>Court. Is a Man's endeavouring to get out of Custody a sign of his being drunk?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Coat had I on?</p>
               <p>Wichelow. A lightish-colour'd Rug Coat, with a Nap</p>
               <p>Gritton. The Morning after the Prisoner was taken, he said, he believed the Ring and Watch would be of detriment to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, I said I had committed the Fact, they wou'd be so - I own such Things were taken from me; but I found them on the Road, and I was so drunk that I fell twice off my Horse at the Park Gate. And it is strange that a Man in such a Condition should in 5 or 6 Minutes afterwards commit a Robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any Witnesses to the Fact, or to your Character?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. None to the Fact; but I have several to my Character.</p>

Yes indeed did I, Goody Trumper; and besides, I can swear to the Cap by these two Holes - Well, and I can swear by the same Holes that it's my Brother's Cap.

               <p>George Binnington. On Saturday last I went with my Fellow-Servants to see Chelsea Hospital, and coming back in the Evening we went into a House to drink; the Prisoner and another Woman were at the Door, and they went up with us without asking.</p>

            . Yes, to my Sorrow; we drank a Glass of Ale together, and I must needs own we were very busy and familiar. The Prisoner led me to the Bed-side, and leading me to the Bed-side, I tumbled her upon the Bed; and tumbling her upon the Bed, I felt her Hand at my Fob Pocket; and feeling her Hand at my Fob Pocket, I got up; and getting up, I declared that she had stole 7 Guineas from me. Upon this the other Woman asked me, what Present I would make her if she got me my Money again? I offer'd a Crown, she puffed at that; I bid her 10 s. but that would not do neither; then I said I would take 6 Guineas for the whole. No, the Prisoner said, if I would take five Guineas, and be easy, I should have them, and so she put five Guineas into my Hand, and putting them into my Hand the Constable came up that moment; (for I sent for a Constable when I miss'd my Money) and the Constable coming up, he carried her before his Majesty the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the Money in a Purse, or loose in your Pocket?</p>
               <p>G. B. It was in a Purse, but she had taken the Gold out of the Purse, and was putting the Purse into my Fob again; for when I felt her it was half in and half out.</p>
               <p>A Juryman. Were your Breeches up or down when you lost the Money?</p>
               <p>G. B. I must acknowledge my Breeches were loose, an't please you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where was the other Woman when we were tumbling upon the Bed?</p>
               <p>G. B. At the Door with my Fellow-Servant.</p>
               <p>P. Was not she at the Bed-side?</p>
               <p>G. B. She did come to the Bed-side indeed, but not upon the Bed.</p>
               <p>P. Did not you shove me up Stairs?</p>
               <p>G. B. I did not shove her, nor touch her, till she came into the Room.</p>
               <p>P. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>G. B. Very sober.</p>
               <p>P. You swear this against me because I would not comply with all your Humours, but you gave the other Woman a Note, and conveyed her away, because she did any thing that you desired her.</p>
               <p>G. B. There was a little Writing indeed, but that was before I got any of my Money again; my Fellow-Servant wrote it, to signify, that if the Prisoner would return us so much we would acquit her, but she did not dissolve to give me the money then, and so the Note was riven, and I sent for a Constable; the other Woman got away while we were bargaining.</p>
               <p>P. No, they let her go, because they had carnal Dealings with her, and they would have been concerned with me in the same way, but I said I would not do any such Thing when there were four Men in Company, and therefore they beat me.</p>

Pray Friend, says I, take away your Pistol, which he did. Mr. Wightman, who sat on the other side, said, What's the Matter? Why, don't you see his Pistol? says I. Upon that Mr. Wightman starts up, and says, I have got two half Guineas, and some Silver, and I'll give them you presently. Mr. Wightman gave him something; but not satisfied with that, the Prisoner would search him, and then making me stand up, he searched me.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you certain that the Prisoner is the Man? Had you any Light to see him by?</p>
               <p>Mr. Lloyd. Yes, a Servant attended the Coach with a Moon, and I saw the Prisoner plainly by that; I look'd full at him all the Time. The Moon was a little way off, as far perhaps, as from your Lordship to me; but it was so placed, that it cast a Light into the Coach. After the Prisoner had robb'd us, my Coachman leaning from his Box, I heard a Pistol go off, at which the Horses started and run forward. Next Morning I went to Newgate, and desir'd the Keeper to let me see the Man who was committed. the last Night for such a Robbery; the Person who went to show me the Prisoner, told me, I should not see him singly, because it was a Case, in which a Man's Life was in Danger. This I thought was Humanity; and as it was what I little expected to find in Newgate, I was the more pleas'd with it, and gave the Man some Money. He brought me to a Place, where the first Man I happen'd to cast my Eye on, was the Prisoner: I knew him immediately, and said, That's the Man that robb'd me. The Prisoner answer'd, I am sorry that I ever saw you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Lloyd has been to Mr. Akerman, the former Turnkey, to know if I had not been in Jail before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wightman. When the Coach was stopt (as Mr. Lloyd has Sworn) I ask'd what was the Matter? Mr. Lloyd said, Don't you see? And I then perceiv'd the Prisoner presenting a Pistol in the Coach. Says I, pray be civil, I have a Guinea and some Silver. I gave him two half Guineas, and he took half a Crown and some Shillings out of my Pocket. I desir'd him to leave my Keys, and he said he had. He ask'd me, for my Watch, and I told him I had none. My Man rode before the Coach with a Moon, that had 3 Candles in it. But there was another Highwayman, who brought my Man back with the Moon, to the Head of the Wheel-Horses, so that by that Light, I had a full view of the Prisoner, for he had no Mask, and am as positive, as I can be of any thing, that he is the Man who robb'd us.</p>

            . I was in the Coach with Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Wightman, when they were robb'd; but they turn'd so directly to the Coach-Door, that I could not see that Highwayman's Face, and for the same Reason, I believe, he hardly observ'd me; but I saw the other Highwayman bring the Moon back near to the Coach, and stand over him, to prevent an Alarm. I had got my Money ready to deliver, when the Coachman getting off his Box, fell upon the Highwayman next us; I heard one cry, Shoot! Shoot! and presently a Pistol went off, which I suppose, was fir'd by the other Highwayman; the Horses started at the Noise, and ran to the Turnpike.</p>
               <p>Oxton Chapman. I carry'd the Moon, and coming thro' Mile-End, at the End of the Dog-Row, a Highwayman rode up to me, and said, if I offer'd to open my Lips he'd shoot me thro' the Head directly. While the other was robbing the Coach, the Coachman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040019"/> jump'd off, and knok'd him down. Then I got off my Mare, and help'd the Coachman, till farther Assistance came, and the Prisoner was not out of my Possession, till he was taken into Custody.</p>

            , Coachman. When the Highwaymen stopt the Moon-Man, I thought it had been a Quarrel, and cry'd Hai! what would you be at? I shall make one among you presently! With that, the Prisoner comes up to me, and says, You saucy old Rogue, I know you well enough, and I have a good mind to shoot you thro' the Head - Stand! And my Master called to me and said, Stand, James! The Prisoner went and robb'd the Coach; and the Light being betwixt me and the other Highwayman, I thought he could not well see to shoot me, and I knew the Prisoner could not, because his Head was in the Coach, and upon that Consideration I struck at the Prisoner twice, and knock'd him down dead.</p>
               <p>Court. But he came to Life again ?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes, yes; for at the second Blow he call'd to his Comrade and bid him shoot, and shoot he did; Aha! says I, * thee hast mist me, but I have hit + thee.</p>

            . Coming between Stratford and Bow I saw the Coach stop, and saw the Coachman make a Blow at the Prisoner, and knock him down, and I went to assist, and no Body meddled with him but the Coachman and I.</p>
               <p>Court. Is this the Prisoner's Witness? He confirms the Prosecutor's Evidence; the Prosecutor should have call'd him.</p>
               <p>Bird. The Prosecutor would not have me call'd, because his man should have all the Reward, tho' I ventur'd my Life as well as he when the Pistol was fired. I pick'd up a Pistol where the Coach stood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was no Body knock'd down but me?</p>
               <p>Bird. Yes, Mr. Vanghan, who came to assist too; but I believe, the Coachman mistook him for one of the Highwaymen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Moon-Man said in Smithfield, that he'd hang me right or wrong, for the Reward, and he own'd he never see me before that Night.</p>

He held a Pistol to my Breast, and demanded my Money, and threaten'd to shoot me dead if I did not deliver. I gave him two Guineas; and I am very positive to his Person, for I look'd full in his Face all the Time he was robbing me, which was about a Minute, and I have since seen him at Hertford.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Clothes had I on?</p>
               <p>Mr. Richardson. A great Coat, with a large Cape; but I can swear more positive than his Clothes, for he had no Mask, nor any manner of Disguise, not so much as the Cape of his Coat turn'd up.</p>

            . I was behind the Coach. The Prisoner rid up to the Coachman, and said, If he did not stand, he'd shoot him thro' the Head that Moment. Then he went to the Coach-Door, and putting his Pistol into the Coach, he demanded my Master's Gold, and said, he would shoot him, dead if he did not deliver that Moment; my Master gave him something; but he was not contented with it, for he said, he must have more, he would search himself; and then he put his Hand into the Coach. He had a brown Cape-Coat, with the Cape down; he had no Disguise, and I had a full view of his Face, and am very sure that this is the Man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you never own to your Master that you did not know me?</p>

            . I was on the Coach-box; the Prisoner came leering along, and gallop'd up to my Horse's side. Damn you, says he, Stand! or I'll shoot this Minute. Then he went to the Chariot, and said to my Master, If you don't deliver your Money this Minute, by God I'll shoot! He was bare-faced; I observed that his Hand shook, and I thought I had seen his Face before, but I could not recollect where, nor when.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you came to see me in Hertford Jail, you said you did not know me.</p>
               <p>Jones. No; I told him I had seen him before; and upon that he turned about and said, I might see him behind too.</p>

               <p>Court. Are you a Housekeeper?</p>
               <p>Kenny No; I keep a Shop there, but not the whole House. I have been there 2 Years. I served part of my time at the Corner of Bow-street, and lived there five Years for my self.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure the Prisoner was all Day at your Shop on the 27th of January.</p>
               <p>Kenny. He was my Journeyman from September last to the half an Hour past 8, on the 14th of February following. On Friday Night, the 26th of January, we lay together; he got up to Work next Morning at 7 o'Clock, and he worked with me till 8 that Night. We both work'd at one Table, he at one end, and I at the other, and I was not out of his Company in all that time, except about 2 o'Clock, when I went to the King's-Head over the way to get a Pint of Beer, but I was not absent above half an Hour.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to take such particular Notice of the 27th of January? was there any thing remarkable in that Day?</p>
               <p>Kenny. The 27th of January was a Saturday, which is always a very busy Day with us; and therefore he could not be absent that Day without my taking particular Notice of it. Then he went out of Town the 14th of February, which was but 2 Weeks and odd Days, and 4 or 5 Days afterwards he sent me a Letter that he was in Hertford Jail, and this put me upon recollecting the Day.</p>
               <p>Court. What Countryman are you?</p>

He turn'd back at the sore Part of a Coach; we met, I stepp'd aside to give the Way; he jostled me, I gave way again, and he jostled me a second Time. I ask'd him, what he meant by it? And as I look'd him in the Face, I felt the Bag drawn out of my Pocket. He got past me; but upon missing my Bag, I turn'd back upon him, seiz'd him by the Shoulder, and said, You. Rascal, you have robb'd me! As I spoke, I saw my Bag upon the Ground. He stampt upon it, and said, If you have lost any Thing, there it is - Let me go. No, says I, I don't know but you may have taken something out of it. I took the Bag up, and sent for a Constable. We carry'd the Prisoner to the Blue-Anchor Alehouse, and search'd him (because another Man had lost 17 Guineas the same Day) and we found a Guinea and a Half upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you find any of your Money upon me?</p>

            . I live in Moorfields; as I was by Billingsgate there stood a Gentleman, and a man pick'd up something White, and the Gentleman said it was his, and the man gave it to him, and the Gentleman said he believed his Pocket was pick'd; but I met the Prisoner 6 Yards off before the money was pick'd up; but I was upon urgent Business, and could not stay to see the upshot. I was afterwards drinking at a House in Moorfields, and there happened to be an Acquaintance of the Prisoner's there, and I was telling him what I had seen, and so he desired me to come and give Evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray, what was your urgent Business ?</p>

I am a Mantua-maker<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040024"/> I live in Smithfield; as we were going to Billinsgate to buy Fish, there was a Dispute; the Prosecutor ran after the Prisoner (who was walking gravely and moderately a few Yards before him) and the Prosecutor said to the Prisoner, If you won't give me my Money, I'll send you to the Compter. So they carried the Prisoner to the Blue-Anchor, and then they put him in a Coach to go before Alderman Brocas, and we follow'd; but before we came there he was sent to Newgate; and we went to him there, not that we had any Acquaintance with him, but only out of good Nature.</p>
               <p>C. Officer, take Sulvan out of Court while this Witness is examined; what did you and Sulvan do at Billingsgate?</p>
               <p>E. M. We cheapened some Eels.</p>
               <p>C. Did either of you buy any? E. M. No.</p>
               <p>C. What did you buy at Rag Fair?</p>
               <p>E. M. Some old Linnen for Body Linings.</p>
               <p>C. Of whom?</p>
               <p>E. M. Of a Woman that stands in the Fair.</p>

               <p>C. Was the other Woman with you then?</p>
               <p>E. M. No; we both went into an Alehouse, and had a Pint of Beer; I left her there, and went and bought the Linnen, and then I went to her again.</p>
               <p>C. Where did you part after you went from Newgate?</p>
               <p>E. M. At Pye-Corner, and then I went home.</p>
               <p>C. At what time?</p>
               <p>E. M. Between 2 and 3 o'Clock.</p>
               <p>C. Now bring the other Woman in again?</p>
               <p>Officer. My Lord, she's run away.</p>
               <p>C. Why did you let her go, when she was committed to your Care?</p>

               <p>Court. Describe the Goods.</p>
               <p>Powers. There was a Silk Gown striped, it was a sort of darkish Purple and White, a Crape Gown Black and White, a Camblet Gown Brownish. A Camblet Cloak, - I don't remember the Colour. A Rug Coat, Red; A Wastcoat Brownish, and a Banyan of a stingey Colour - A sort of a Roarer [Aurora]; there was a Pair of Black Stockings too. We carried the Goods to the Prisoner, Eliz. Morris; she keeps a Smith's Shop at the Sign of the Jack and Half Moon in Eagle-Court by the New Church in the Strand, and we sold her the Silk Gown. She knew how we came by them. Her Son Will. and I have gone a thieving together these three Months.</p>
               <p>Norman. Powers swears this against me, because he knows I have been under Misfortunes, and have been an Evidence in this Court. But I have Witness that I was sick on the 2d and 3d of January, when this Fact was done.</p>

               <p>C. How came you to remember those Days any more than any other?</p>
               <p>J. B. I have cause to remember the 4th of January, for it was my Wedding-Day 24 Years ago, and I have acknowledged it ever since, and I had a Bit of roast Pork that Day; and Norman and his Wife were both sick of the new Distemper, and they had Rosemary and Treacle, and they both eat some of my roast Pork.</p>
               <p>C. Then they were not so bad but they could eat Pork? Did you never see Powers at your House.</p>
               <p>J. B. I don't know him. - But I can swear that Norman was not abroad the Day before the 4th of January; for I was at home all that Week, though sometimes I go a Nursing.</p>
               <p>C. Can you be positive that you was not out at all in the Evening of the 3d of January ?</p>

               <p>Eliz. Morris. I own I had an undutiful Son, but I could not help what he did; for if I spoke but a Word, he would presently beat and abuse me. I have often forbid Powers coming to my House.</p>

I never knew that she bought any Goods but old Iron.
