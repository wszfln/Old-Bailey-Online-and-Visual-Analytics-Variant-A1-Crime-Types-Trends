On Saturday the 16th of September, the prisoner served a warrant upon the deceased for using a woman ill that he had lived with. The prisoner used the deceased very ill, in dragging him up and down the street, before he carried him to the justice. They quarrelled; upon this, after he had served the warrant, Justice Sherwood had him put into the watch-house upon the deceased's complaint of his ill treatment, and behaving ill to the justice himself. He continued in the watch-house from Saturday till Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any warrant?</p>
               <p>Rosmanson. I did not see any.</p>
               <p>On Monday he was brought before Justice Sherwood at his own house. I was there from ten o'clock in the morning. When the prisoner came in, he asked the justice's pardon; the justice said, he would forgive him if the deceased would; the deceased said, he would forgive him, provided he would go on board a ship with him, that he might come into no more trouble. The deceased was going to sea, and wanted to take him with him. They were common seamen.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they ever gone together before?</p>
               <p>Rosmanson. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner agreed to go, and then the prisoner was carried over to the Virginia planters, a public house, in which they confined people, and locked up, till he could find money to discharge the justice's warrant, and such like. I fetched for that purpose, five shillings first, and four afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that money paid to the justice's clerk?</p>
               <p>Rosmanson. It was given into the deceased's hand, and he went over to pay what demand there was.</p>
               <p>The deceased made the prisoner promise before the justice, that he would go with him; I saw him kiss the book upon it, and he made his compliments to the justice that he would go to sea with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he returned from the justice to discharge the demand, as you call it, where was the prisoner then?</p>
               <p>Rosmanson. He was locked up there, in a lock-up room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner sober, or in liquor?</p>

             went down stairs first, the prisoner went down again, and the deceased followed after them; we went over to the prisoner's own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner's wife there?</p>
               <p>Salmon. Not at that time. We went into the lower room; the prisoner threw himself upon the bed again; the deceased said, Ellick get up and go on board a ship; you know I have given my affidavit for you to go on board a ship and you are not to be seen here any more; he would not give any answer whether he would go or no; then the deceased said to me, go down and see if any of the justice's runners are at Mr. Winn's, that is, the Black Horse, and fetch them up here; he said, he would have the prisoner carried to prison again; as soon as the prisoner heard those words he ran up to the chimney and took down a cutlass, he drew it, and said to the deceased,</p>
               <p>"go out of my house directly." The deceased took up a quart pewter pot, and the prisoner cut him on the head with the hanger; the deceased held the pot up as if he was going to throw it at the prisoner, but he did not throw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hold it by the handle?</p>
               <p>Salmon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hold it the height of his head?</p>
               <p>Salmon. Before he had got it so high as his head the prisoner struck him with the hanger on the left side of the head, near the temples.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it bleed?</p>
               <p>Salmon. I did not stop to see; the deceased then put both his hands upon the prisoner's shoulders and said, see what you have done?</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in a friendly manner or a struggling way, or how?</p>
               <p>Salmon. He wanted to get the cutlass from him I believe, the prisoner made a second stroke,

               <p>Salmon. I was in the room, I did not know what to do; still the deceased had his hands upon the prisoner's shoulders, then the prisoner thrust the hanger into the deceased's left side; the deceased fell immediately upon his back, and the prisoner dropped the hanger upon the floor and ran out directly; I ran out and alarmed the people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased die immediately?</p>

            . I am a weaver. I never saw the deceased before that day; I was with one Faulkner and the prisoner and the deceased at Mr. Winn's, the Black Horse, in new Gravel-Lane, in the afternoon at about three o'clock, which was about an hour and a half or two hours before the accident happened, Faulkner and I called for a pint of beer, the deceased said, make it a pot and I will join with you; that was agreed upon, and we had a pot; after that was drank the prisoner got up and struck<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180006"/> Faulkner; soon after that the prisoner went out and the deceased with him; when the prisoner struck Faulkner the deceased said, it was a malicious thing to strike a man without provocation; the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"he would serve him worse if he said any more."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make use of any other threat ening expressions to the deceased?</p>
               <p>Orange. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. They had not been quarrelling before, had they?</p>
               <p>Orange. Not as I know; they came in there together from the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Tate in point of sobriety?</p>
               <p>Orange. I believe he had been drinking a little, but was sober enough to know what he said and did: then they went out together very agreeable. I sent after the deceased for the money for his pint of beer: not knowing him, I did not know whether he might come back again: he sent me three halfpence. I went up after that to one Downes's, in New Gravel-Lane. I had not been there above ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, before I heard Ellick Tate had killed his brother-in law. I had staid about three quarters of an hour at the Black Horse after they went away, to drink out my beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased his brother-in-law?</p>
               <p>Orange. Yes. I ran down directly after him, and asked the people which way he had taken. We found him about two hours after among some cabbages and raddishes behind Vauxhall: he was lying upon his face; we turned him upon his back, and tied his hands behind him. While I was tying him, he said,</p>
               <p>"Jack, what have I done! I have done</p>
               <p>"murder!" Parker said, he had done so. I said he had not, in order to get him along quietly. Then he said,</p>
               <p>"Jack, I am sure my</p>
               <p>"hands are bloody, wipe them for me." I said, Ellick, they are not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem to be in great agitation at that time?</p>
               <p>Orange. Yes; we brought him to the justice.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

            . I am a surgeon: I was sent for to the deceased upon the 18th of September, about half after five in the afternoon. I found him to every appearance dead, and I imagined he must have been dead half an hour. Mr. Calve, a surgeon present, opened a vein before I examined further. He is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it bleed?</p>
               <p>Walley. Very little, as is common with people soon after their death just a spirt or two. There was a wound upon the side between the fifth and sixth rib: we examined it as accurately as we could: it had entered two inches and a quarter in an oblique direction, though not into the cavity of the thorax, but superficial.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend that wound to be the occasion of the death of the deceased?</p>
               <p>Walley. No, I found a large wound accompanied with a fracture upon the head. The substance of the brain was wounded by the instrument: it must be some instrument very sharp.</p>
               <p>Q. Would a cutlass have made such a sort of wound?</p>
               <p>Walley. Yes; it went into the substance of the brain about two inches and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What length?</p>
               <p>Walley. About two inches long.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of his death?</p>

               <p>Walley. The wounding some principal vessels in the brain by that stroke.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that occasion an instantaneous death; or would death come on by degrees?</p>
               <p>Walley. I have known the substance of the brain wounded where a person has lived thirty days after.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you distinguish between the cerebrum and the cerebellum; the cerebrum may be wounded; and the party live?</p>
               <p>Walley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The other is instant death?</p>
               <p>Walley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the cerebellum lie?</p>
               <p>Walley. In the front of the forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great effusion of blood?</p>
               <p>Walley. There had been; it oozed out at the time I came.</p>
               <p>Q. After receiving this stroke at first, he continued struggling with him upon his legs<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180007"/> for a minute or two, and then afterwards fell down?</p>
               <p>Walley. I imagined the deceased to be falling.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole, you have no doubt but the wounds were the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Walley. I am fully convinced within myself.</p>

            . I keep the Black Horse. The prisoner and the deceased came into my house that day they were both in liquor: the deceased insisted upon taking him on board a ship: the prisoner was much in liquor: he made a slip and fell upon some people in another box. I desired him to go home about his business: he went away directly. The deceased missed him: he had been gone about one hundred yards out of the house, when the deceased missed him and went after him: he went away without paying his reckoning; a person went after him, and brought back some halfpence. I went up to his house; I saw this cutlass lie in a closet close to the fire-side; there was some blood upon it then.</p>

               <p>Q. Has this man been frequently at your house?</p>

               <p>Q. He insisted upon the prisoner's going on board a ship with him?</p>
               <p>Winn. Yes, he said, he would never leave him till he did. The deceased was of a quarrelsome disposition.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner did not live with his own wife, did he?</p>
               <p>Winn. No, the deceased and this man's wife have been at my house together many times.</p>

I unlocked the door for the prisoner; the deceased caught hold of the skirt of his coat, and came in with him; the prisoner flung himself upon the bed in the kitchen; this was at the prisoner's own house; the deceased said, the time draws on, you must go down to the ship; the prisoner made no answer. I said, Bill, for Christ's sake let him have a couple of hours sleep, then he will go, for what can you do with a man in liquor; he said; Buggor my eyes, he shall go, for there is no time to make any delay, and he pulled him off the bed upon his backside upon the ground. Ellick jumped up, and took him by the hand, and said, Will, I love you well, but if you will use me so ill as this, I will suffer imprisonment. The deceased struck him in the face, and Ellick struck again; then the deceased took a quart pot off the table to strike him, but I cannot say I saw him strike him with it; I saw him lift his hand as high as his head; then after the pot was taken up by the deceased, the prisoner took the cutlass; I saw it, and I cried murder immediately; I thought it was improper to be, I went between them, I tried to prevent the mischief; I pushed my hand against the cutlass, and got cut a lit-little, but not to hurt me.</p>

I believe the stockings to be mine; the prisoner first said, he bought them of a smuggler, afterwards he confessed he took them from me. He first confessed it to a Mr. Howard, while I was gone for the constable. I don't know that any promise was made to him; I gave Mr.

            . I am the prosecutor's wife; I was present at the searching of the prisoner's box. I found in it twelve neck-cloths, and eight pair of stockings: he took them out himself; they were delivered to the constable. I believe them to be the property of Messrs. Needs and Strutt; my husband sells for them; they are like what we had in the house. The prisoner was our porter; the prisoner said he bought them of a smuggler. Mr. Harris and I went down, and left Mr. Howard with him: my husband went for a constable. When we went up stairs, Mr. Howard said, he had confessed that he took them out of the warehouse. I asked him it he had? he said, Yes, I took them all out of the warehouse. When the box was first searched, Mr. Harris said, he would be as easy as he could; he would endeavour to send him for an East-India soldier.</p>
               <p>Robert Row. I am a constable; I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner. When I went into the garret, I saw the stockings and neckcloths lying on the floor; the prisoner said, he took them all out of the warehouse. I was sent for on the 13th to take charge of Lloyd for receiving part of the goods: as soon as I came to him, he said, if I would go to his house, he would give me all the things that belonged to Roger. We went with him to his house at Lambert Hill; he there desired his wife to go and get the things that belonged to Roger. We went with her to College Hill, and there she produced a box with ten pair of stockings, and six neckcloths in it: he said, he bought one pair of stockings of him.</p>

I then caught hold of Jones's hand, and held them both till the watchman came up; then Jones dropped the money in the kennel. I saw it fall; I had six guineas and a half. The watchman picked up three guineas; we could not find any more. I then counted my money, and said; I missed a half guinea; upon which Sturgess stooped down, and laid down half a guinea; I saw it between her finger and thumb. I took it up, then I counted my money again, and said, I missed three guineas more. The watchman took charge of them.

            . I am a watchman in St. Dunstan's parish; at half an hour past twelve at night, I saw the prosecutor with the prisoner about three yards out of the city, in Little Shire-lane; the prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him. I saw three guineas picked out of the kennel, and then half a guinea; the prosecutor then counted his money, and said, he missed half a guinea; I said, that was picked up; then he counted his money again, and said, he had lost three guineas more, and that he had in all fifteen pounds. He was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Did any such familiarities pass between you as to make it possible for the money to drop out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; my breeches slap was unbuttoned, but the waistband was not; it was not possible it should drop out. Sturgess was pretty nimble with her fingers.</p>

               <p>I am not guilty at all; I was going through Temple Bar with the other prisoner, Jones; she asked me to drink with her; we met the prosecutor with two women in white cloaks, who were singing to him; he came up to us, and unbuttoned his breeches, and the money fell out of his pocket; he said, we should not stoop to pick it up; the watchman came by, and they picked up three guineas; then he said, he had lost half a guinea more, and he stooped, and picked that up.</p>

               <p>I am not guilty of the crime alledged to me; I know nothing of it; the man was very much in liquor; he fell asleep in the watch-house; we asked him to search us; he would not; he said, there was no occasion for it.</p>

Last Monday was a fortnight, as I was going across a field that leads up to my house, by myself, at about nine at night at the upper end of the field, about two or three hundred yards from my own house, I was stopped by two men, one of them was the prisoner; the other man had a pistol; the prisoner had something like a hanger. They demanded my money; I told them, I had none; they made answer, I had; the prisoner said, you have a watch then, and clapped his hand to my pocket, and took out my watch; then the other said, you have got some money somewhere, and began searching me; he searched my breeches and waistcoat, and coat pockets, and took out a linen handkerchief, and then they bid me go home, and say nothing, and they would see me in. I went home as fast as I could: I alarmed the house, and pursued them that night, but could not take them. The prisoner was taken by Justice Fielding's man a week after; I knew him by sight before, there was a moon a quarter old, it was light enough to know any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to distinguish a face?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. O yes, I could know any body</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. No, nor handkerchief. I am very confident in my own mind he is the man; if I had any matter of doubt I would not say so. I had seen him many times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. Yes, as sober as I am now.</p>

            . I am a journeyman weaver, I live at Bethnal-green; the prisoner worked with me in the picking and quilting in our way; he worked very regularly; he had worked with me a fortnight when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make no holidays in that time?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. No, not one.</p>
               <p>Q. Not of a Monday?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. No. On Monday the 2d of October, the day he is charged with committing the robbery on, he was with me from between two and three in the afternoon till eight o'clock at night, in Wentworth-street, at the end of Rose-lane; he went out with me and another man who works with me, in the afternoon between two and three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Instead of working you went out together?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. We had a little business out, we went to the other man's mother-in-law in Wentworth-street, and there we had a pot of beer; from thence we went with that man to Rag-fair to buy some things for his eldest boy, he was going to britch him; it was after seven o'clock when we came from Rag-fair; and when we came home where I parted from him, it was after eight o'clock. He lodges in Wentworth street, the corner of George-yard, at one Mr. Maynard's. We parted at the end of Rose-lane. I got home about the hour of nine. I believe my house is a mile from Rose lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it full nine when you got home?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. Yes, rather after nine. This gentleman swore before the justice that he was robbed at half after eight, and it is above a mile and a half from Rose-lane to Bishop Bonner's. This young man had no money when he came to work next morning, and had no money all the week, but what he had of me, nor hardly a shoe to his foot; I should suppose if he had stole a watch he would have made money of it.</p>

We went with my mother-in-law to see after some money that was owing to her by a person; I don't know his name; It is in an alley in Wellclose-square, facing the Black Horse; my mother went in, and we waited at the Black Horse for her; we drank a couple of pots of beer, and staid there till after six; then we all went back to my mother-in-law's, in Wentworth-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180015"/> the prisoner and Godfrey then went away; I don't know where they parted.</p>

               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. You told me on your evidence that you was robbed about nine o'clock. Did you always say it was about nine?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. A witness here says, that you said before the justice it was half after eight?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you could swear to the person of the other man?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I don't think I could. I took most notice of this man; his face struck me; it was not many minutes over or under nine o'clock; I had been with some friends upon the green; I pulled out my watch there, and it wanted a quarter of nine: I then said it was time for me to be at home, and went away. Just as I got in the fields, the church clocks began to began to strike nine: I heard several of them strike.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any clock in your house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes. I did not look at it but rung the bell, and called my men out immediately to pursue them.</p>

I expected she was killed, though she was very forward in calf. I made enquiry after her, but I heard nothing of her till Saturday morning; then I heard there was a carcase to be sold at one Mr. Massey's in Whitechappel, which had been killed at the slaughter-house of the widow Hunt, in George-street, Spittal-fields. I went to the slaughter-house, there I saw the hyde of my cow; it was a black cow, with grissle hairs; it had a mark upon the horn, which was in part rased off.</p>

            . I keep a slaughter-house: the prisoner came to me on the tenth of August, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and asked me to let him kill a cow at my slaughter-house. I said he might; and asked him what time he should bring it; whether he would bring it at dusk. He said no; it was very wild; that the weavers would be just done work, and it would be fine sport for the boys for three or four hours. Then I asked him what time he would bring it. He said at eleven at night, and then all would be still. I went to bed between ten and eleven, and my daughter sat up for him. I heard him come in at five in the morning. I got up at six. He had killed it, and was then taking the hide off. It was a cow very forward in calf. I did not take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180016"/> notice of the colour of the hide. At about four o'clock on Saturday morning, he came with a porter, a horse, two hampers, and a basket; and took away all the carcase but the hide and the feet. He took away only the offal on Friday morning. When I went to market on Saturday morning, Massey asked me if a cow had been killed at my house; and said, Mr. Stapp had lost one. I told him there had, and that the hide was at my house.</p>

             the Younger. Did the skin that Stapp owned belong to the cow that was brought by the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hunt. It did. The cow appeared to be very same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming from the country; I met a farmer with some beasts; I helped him on. I bought the cow of him for five pounds; the farmer's name is May. There were two men present at the time; I advertised for the two men; they did appear, and promised to be here.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Benjamine Cross. I am a butcher, and live at Shoreditch: the prisoner is a butcher: he lived with me as a servant fourteen months; there could not be a better servant for sobriety and honesty.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago did he leave your service?</p>
               <p>Cross. About thirteen months; he lived with a person in the same street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual to kill cows when they are with calf?</p>
               <p>Cross. Yes, the very day before they would calve.</p>

On Friday the 16th of September, between one and two in the morning, I heard a noise in the room I lie in; I got up in the bed, but could see nothing; I lay down again; I heard a noise again; I jumped up, and caught hold of the prisoner by the hand, at my trunk; he said, he was locked out; I called out to one of the boys; my master came up with a light; I found my box open, and missed a crown piece and two shillings, out of the pocket of a pair of breeches that were in it. I charged the prisoner with having it; he denied it; I found it afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180017"/> on the bed. The prisoner had lived at the house, and was my bedfellow two or three months; he has been gone from the house a month or six weeks. I asked him how he got into the house, he said, he got over the wall, and in at the cellar window.</p>
               <p>Charles Poulter. I am a peace officer. I was charged with the prisoner; he confessed he took the key, and unlocked the box, and took the money out.</p>

               <p>The apprentice let me in; I was told I might lie there any night if I was belated. I knocked, and the apprentice got up, and let me in; there were four other persons lay in that room besides the prosecutor. I was very drunk.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

Finding me sitting alone, he began to be rude with me, he pulled me about, and used me in a rude manner; I endeavoured to pacify him, and then he was more rude; he locked the door, and put the key into his pocket, which so frightened me that I could not speak; then he forced me into the bed-room, which is in that room, and did with me what he intended to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he force you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he carnal knowledge of your body?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it against your will?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, my husband was then at a benefit club; I told him of it as soon as he came home, which was about twelve o'clock. I was not able to cry out; there was no one upon that floor, nor no one near me as I knew of.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a married woman?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your husband?</p>
               <p>Atkins. A stone mason.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go out?</p>
               <p>Atkins. He went out to work about five in the morning; he came home before he went to his club at between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How near does the prisoner live to you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. About a dozen doors off on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. You used to buy your beer of him?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband came home at half after eleven at night?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him what Burdock had done to you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you leave off taking beer of Mr. Burdock?</p>
               <p>Atkins. As soon as my husband went to take leave of him the beginning of September; the reason was, my husband owed him some money, and he desired he would have beer at his house till he had paid him.</p>
               <p>Q. Does no one lodge on the same floor with you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. There are four rooms on the floor; I have two; one Mrs. Hopper has the room next to me; one Mrs. Martin, a maiden body, has the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What divides Mrs. Hopper's room from your's?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Lath and plaister, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you capable of hearing any thing that passes in Mrs. Hopper's room?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No, she had not been in the house some days; I had not seen her for several days.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body live above you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, there are people lodge there, but whether they were at home, I cannot tell; there are four rooms up three pair of stairs; one Martin has one room above me, and one Call as another; I don't know the names of the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180018"/>Q. Were any of them at home?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lodges on the one pair of stairs floor?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner's business; when he came to you; I suppose the door was shut?</p>
               <p>Atkins. It was ajar: he asked me if I had any of his pots?</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. After he had pulled me about. I went to get up to go to the door, and he flew to the door and locked it: he refused to quit the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you cry out?</p>
               <p>Atkins. He frightened me; he came in unawares; he confined me in that manner that I was not able to speak.</p>
               <p>Q. How, did he confine your tongue?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I talked to him as loud as I do talk in common, while I was able.</p>
               <p>Q. There are such a number of people in the house: here is a house four rooms upon a floor, with different occupiers almost in every room; if I had been you, I should have cried out and took the chance of their hearing.</p>
               <p>Atkins. They are as often cut as at home; I talked as loud as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he locked the door? You talked to him, reasoned with him, and argued with him in a very mild way?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I did not reason with him at all; I endeavoured to resist.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be before he locked the door?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Six or seven minutes, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he locked the door, had he done any thing more than put his hand into your bosom?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No, he crouded me into the bedroom.</p>
               <p>Q. Before or after he locked the door?</p>
               <p>Atkins. After.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not desire him to lock the door?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No, he locked it, and put the key into his pocket. I asked him where the key was? as well as I was able: he said, he had it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the bed-room door?</p>
               <p>Atkins. It goes out of the other room: he took hold of me, and perfectly lifted me into the room, and threw me upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts did he lay hold of you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Round my waist.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your arms were at liberty?</p>
               <p>Atkins. And I endeavoured all I could to resist.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it began to be serious; did not you call out then?</p>
               <p>Atkins. As much as I was able, I did, and desired him still to quit the place.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did not call out to any of the neighbours?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I was not able to call loud enough for any body to hear me then above or below; but I was very sensible there was no body there to hear me.</p>
               <p>Q. You told your husband as soon as he came home?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, I said, Why don't you go and see what you can do with him, for I am used exceeding ill by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not desire your husband to go to a justice of peace?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, I did immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your husband to do with Burdock?</p>
               <p>Atkins. To tell him of his fault before he went to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, did he not know the fault he had committed?</p>
               <p>Atkins. It was fit my husband should go to him, and let him know that he knew it.</p>
               <p>Court. That he might not be out of the way?</p>
               <p>Q. Then I suppose he told Burdock his fault, and he said, he was sorry for it, and no more was to be done?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you expect Burdock to do; to ask your pardon, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Atkins. He must know very well it had been a great trouble to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Burdock to do?</p>
               <p>Atkins. As the law was to direct - I had nothing to do with that.</p>
               <p>Q. As your husband and he could agree it?</p>
               <p>Atkins. As I had a husband, I left it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times was you in Burdock's house yourself before the complaint was made to a magistrate?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180019"/>Atkins. I never went any further than the door to order a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times has Mr. Burdock been in your room since the 1st of August, to the time he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Atkins. He came in twice afterwards in my husband's absence.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him so good encouragement, he came a second time, did he?</p>
               <p>Atkins. There was no encouragement at all?</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that Burdock came first into your room, after the first of August?</p>
               <p>Atkins. About six or seven days he made it his business to come in for a pot as before, and he began to come up to me as he had done before; but I was guarded against him, and kept my door wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. So you was guarded against him, and kept your door wide open. Do you remember his coming to some of the other lodgers?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I never minded who came to any body in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember upon the 3d of August, Burdock going past your door, and though it was open, he would not come in?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I don't know any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say upon the 3d of August to Burdock, So, now you will not speak to your old acquaintance?</p>
               <p>Atkins. That is false. More than that he wished his hands and legs might drop off if he ever came into the house again; and swore more than that, that he never heard a woman talk and cry like me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not in a few days after the first of August, say to Burdock,</p>
               <p>"So now you will not call on your old acquaintance;" or words to that effect?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I can safely take my oath I never saw him come up stairs, only when he came into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter: did you ever see that before. (Shewing the witness a letter.)</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, I have seen that letter to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see that letter?</p>
               <p>Atkins. The day of the month is in it I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Who wrote the letter?</p>
               <p>Atkins. It was a gentleman, who said, my husband was to blame that he did not follow the law with this man.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that gentleman's name?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Robinson.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I don't now justly; it was at the Hole in the Wall in Chancery-lane, where he happened to call upon my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he know any thing that you had been used in this manner?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Because both my husband and I told him.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him before, did you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he advise you to do?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No farther than to send to him in that manner; but I thought it was best to go to a Justice of Peace. We did not take his advice.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how that letter came into the hands of Mr. Burdock?</p>
               <p>Atkins. It was a chairman carried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you deliver that letter to Mr. Burdock?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No, I had another note I went to give him. I saw the chairman in the court just now that took that letter.</p>
               <p>Court. You say, that you advised your husband next day to go to Burdock and talk with him.</p>
               <p>Atkins. I did so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband follow your advice</p>
               <p>Atkins. Directly, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he go to Burdock?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I think in about three weeks after.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not apply to any magistrate, then till after he had told him that?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go to Burdock's after that three weeks, after he had been told of it?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, just over the cell of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that Burdock carried you in his arms into the inner room; now you knew his design then.</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, and resisted all that in my power lay.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not cry out: I think, you said you only spoke loud.</p>
               <p>Atkins. As loud as I was able. I was very ill at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had committed this foul deed. did you tell him that you would prosecute him?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, and told him that my husband would do it as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180020"/>Q. Why, both of you knew he was to be hanged if he was found guilty.</p>
               <p>Atkins. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. But you told him he should be prosecuted then?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>You went and got a warrant to apprehend Burdock?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get that warrant?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I think the fourth of September.</p>
               <p>Q. What constable did you give the warrant to, to execute?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Smallwood and Sturton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go along with them to execute the warrant?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No; but my husband did.</p>
               <p>Q. What instructions did you give them about the warrant?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I did not know that I had any occasion to give them any.</p>
               <p>Q. But did you desire them to go to the house and call for a pint of beer?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire the constables, or either of them, to take Burdock aside and tell him the business, and if he saw him inclinable to make it up, to come to your husband and settle it, because the constables are in court?</p>
               <p>Atkins. The last time it was, those words were mentioned, the other time no such thing was mentioned. One came and said he could not find him; that he was absconded, and likely he would send some friend to make it up. I said, I did not desire to make it up; but we would go as far as the law would go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell one of the constables that we will get as much as we can and then let the affair drop?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was not a word then about getting what you could?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No. I have had several people mention such a thing to me to be sure.</p>
               <p>(To be continued.)</p>

                  <p>THE CONVIVIAL MAGAZINE, AND POLITE INTELLIGENCER; Or a real REPRESENTATION of the CHARACTERS and SENTIMENTS of the TIMES.</p>
                  <p>CONTAINING</p>
                  <p>The Portraits of the most celebrated Toasts; Men of Rank conspicuous in the World; Statesmen, Orators, Preachers, Petits Maitres, Actors; and Buffoons.</p>
                  <p>TO THE PUBLIC.</p>
                  <p>THE Authors of this production will not attempt to delude the Public by a parade of words and specious promises, which they are incapable of performing, and shall therefore only mention such particulars as are within their reach, and which they will assiduously exert themselves to display to the almost.</p>
                  <p>Besides their seizing every Object that can contribute towards the Entertainment and Instruction of their readers, they will be enabled to lay before them Topics that never yet appeared in a Magazine, by the assistance of some Gentlemen of consequence in polite life, who have promised to transmit them all the amusing conversation that shall pass in the most respectable parties. This will not be confined entirely to the Metropolis, but Bath, and all the other polite Watering-places will furnish them with Materials for cultivating this Correspondence. In this pursuit they will extend their Information from Scarborpugh to Brighthelmstone, and whether the subjects be Gallantry, Intrigue, Politicks, or the Drama, they will equally find a place in this Miscellany, if judged either Amusing or Instructive. This deportment of their Magazine, which is entirely upon a new plan, and which will never exceed the bounds of the strictest truth, will justly entitle it to the Appellation of the CONVIVIAL MAGAZINE.</p>
                  <p>In fine, every possible Endeavour will be exerted to render it one of the most entertaining and instructive production extant; in the execution of which the proprietors are resolved that no Pains or expence shall be spared. To this end, they have engaged some of the most capital Artists to furnish them with copper plates which shall not be inferior to those of any Monthly publication whatever.</p>

               <p>You are desired to call upon me to-morrow at three of the clock in the afternoon, at the Robinhood Tavern Butcher Row, Temple Bar. By default an action, will be brought against you at the suit of Mr. William Atkins.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Who is that Robinson that wrote that letter. You saw it wrote you say?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes; and the man wrote it according to his own directions; he would have had my husband give him money to have brought an action, but my husband thought he had better go to a justice, and he did not take his advice.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prosecutor.</p>
               <p>How came you about Chancery Lane?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Because my husband works at the New Six Clerks Office, and I am there almost every day since this affair happened, because I was unhappy at home.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Then you live at the Six Clerks Office for fear of being ravished?</p>
               <p>Atkins. It is a very sad thing to have things disturbone so.</p>
               <p>The jury informed the court that they did not desire to have the prisoner put upon his defence.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. This watch (producing it) was brought to me on Monday morning the 18th of September, by Jones, the other prisoner was with him; there was only one link of the chain to the watch; I asked where the rest of the chain was; Jones pulled the remainder out of his pocket, but it being of no value, I did not take it.</p>

Upon the 12th of September, she was going away from us into the hospital; we promised to take her back again if she recovered. Upon looking over the things to see if every thing was right, we missed two table-spoons; we missed no linen; we asked her over and over again if she knew any thing of these spoons; and conjured her, as she at that time was exceeding ill, to tell if she knew any thing of these spoons; she answered in the most solem manner, as she thought herself a dying woman at that time, that she knew nothing about them; she persisted in this denial two or three days. In the mean time, we sent a Mrs. Ellis backwards and forwards to her to the hospital; at last she confessed to Mrs. Ellis, that they were at such and such pawnbrokers, and there we found the two spoons.</p>

She denied them from the Tuesday to the Friday; on the Friday, on their telling her she should not come into the service again till the spoons were discovered some way or other; then in hopes of being admitted into the service again, she confessed she had disposed of them; that they were pledged at two pawnbrokers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180024"/> in Prince's-street; I went there, but Mr. Bell had been there before, and had taken the spoons out, as I had told him what had passed. I went to enquire if there was any thing further there; I found some linen at one of the houses, two tablecloths and a shirt, the shirt was Mr. Crozier's, the table cloths belonged to the partnership. The prisoner all along, while denying this theft, said, the things must be taken away by the draymen when they came with beer.</p>

            . I am a mantua-maker, and an acquaintance of the prisoner's: she came to me one time, and desired me to pledge some table-spoons and shirts: she said, she wanted to make up some money; she was to make up her book, and wanted to make up a little money for that, and begged me to pawn this table-spoon and shirt for the money. As soon as the money could be raised in any other way, they were to be taken out of pawn again. I pawned part at one pawnbroker's and part at another. One lent twelve shillings on one spoon, and eight shillings upon the other. The prisoner went with me to the door; she did not go in, but only staid at the door.</p>

I sat up one morning till four o'clock to let Mr. Crozier in; I caught cold, and was exceeding ill. Mr. Bell kindly put me into the hospital, and he took me out as bad as he put me in, and sent me to prison. Miss Ellis came to me to enquire where the things were, and said, she would redeem them unknown to Mr. Crozier and Mr. Bell. I said, I did not want her to secrete it from Mr. Crozier, as he had given me leave to make use of his property. I wish Mr. Crozier had come here.</p>

            : my husband was formerly a peruke-maker; he has been afflicted with a palsy these six years, and I have maintained him by washing. I washed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) for Mr. Wilson, a grocer, in Bridge-street. The prisoner had carried linen for me several times. On the 22d of July in the morning, I delivered to him the linen mentioned in the indictment to carry home to Mr. Wilson. At nine at night, Mr. Wilson sent to me to know why I had not sent home his linen; upon that I had the prisoner taken up. When he was before the justice, he said, he sold the things to a Jew for thirty-six shillings.</p>

I had not been there long before the prisoner came into the vault, and immediately laid hold of me and began to use some indecencies toward me: she put her hand into my pocket where my wages was: I pushed her from me: she came again and endeavoured to attack me a second time. I pushed her off again when I had got up, and then I missed my watch, which I had not felt for before, thinking that secure, because my custom always was, and I had done so at that time, to twist my chain and key through a button-hole, that my watch might not fall out, but it was gone; I found I had been robbed.

I had heard something of a noise about one, but it was a rainy and windy night; I did not therefore much attend to it: I got up about six, and found the cellar window which opens into the street had been forced. A board had been wrenched off that admitted a passage for a hand to unfasten the bolt, and the chain that fastened it on the outside; so that the bolt being wrenched off, it was practicable to get the cellar window open: it was open, and the door of the cellar which opens up into the tap-room was forced likewise; the lock hung by a single nail, and there was a hole bored into the door, so that a hand could be admitted there likewise to undo the bolt which was upon the inside. In this manner, I suppose, the thieves got into the house; that room door was not locked when I went to bed. In the tap-room there were plain marks of the thieves having been there; the till lock was forced, and a quantity of halfpence taken out of the till; there were about twenty-five or thirty shillings worth of halfpence and farthings, and the linen was taken out of the bar, and the snuff-box off a shelf in the bar. The prisoner was a neighbour's son. I heard by his father such an account as occasioned my charging him with this fact. I got this information upon the Sunday following.</p>

As I was going by a house in Wentworth-street, I heard of one Brown and the prisoner Clarke having brought some things into that house at a very late hour; I watched there, intending to apprehend them; I saw Brown come down, and let two men in, and go up stairs again; I followed them gently; I overheard Brown say to the two men, they had got some things; the two men looked at them, and said, they would not do for them; upon which, I burst into the room, and said, they will do for me, and I seized Clarke with one hand, and Brown with the other; there was a scuffle, and they threatened me very much, calling to one another to cut away, and they got me down, and were struggling with me in order to get the better of me; I disengaged myself; Brown ran away, and I secured Clarke; in the room I found two cardinals, two handkerchiefs, three chequed aprons, a muslin apron, and two shifts. In Clerk's coat pocket I found a white apron, and afterwards, when I had taken him to the Coach and Horses, I found a bag of half-pence in his pocket, among which is a remarkable farthing.</p>

               <p>Hebber worth. I can swear I put that farthing in the till over night.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's sister. My brother, the prisoner, gave me that snuff-box in New-prison after he was in custody.</p>
               <p>All the things except the half pence were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I came into that house only to sleep there; the things must have been brought in whilst I was asleep. Whether Brown committed the robbery, or who, I don't know; Brown gave me the things that were found upon me; he desired me to take the halfpence for him: I did not know how he got them.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

            . I waked about, eleven at night, with the noise of the thieves breaking into my room; they had a candle in their hands; they broke open a large desk; they took a quilt and several other things out of my room; they went out of the room, and I heard them jump out of a front room window; I gave the alarm. When I came to examine, I found there was a square in that window broke, and the sash that used to fasten down by a nail; but the square having been broke, they could get a hand to the nail, and open it. I conclude the thieves got in that way.</p>

I went to bed about nine o'clock. I have two lodgers and a servant girl; they went to bed before; I saw all the house fastened; I was awaked about the dead of the night: I have no clock nor watch in the house; the first thing I saw was a man just entering my room with a cutlass in his hand; he shook it over me, and said, hush. The door was ajar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any light?</p>
               <p>Cousins. Yes, he had a candle in his hand. Then I saw another man with a mask on his face; he had a candle. They threw the bed cloaths over me, and blinded me; then I screamed a little; then I heard a voice demand the key of a chest that was opposite the door. Gentlemen, said I, the key of that chest is in that little drawer, (pointing to it) I then said, have mercy upon me, and spare my life; I then heard a voice say to me, hold your tongue, I will cut your throat if you speak a word, I said, gentlemen, I will not speak till you give me leave; then they went to the chest, and opened it, and said, there is no money here; then a voice said to me, you bitch, where are your pockets? I said, gentlemen, my pockets are under my right side, underneath my pillow, and one of them leaned over my breast, and took my pockets. If I had had a thousand pounds I should have parted with it; then I thought I heard them wrangle, but they bid me lie still, for they should be there for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after was the house quiet?</p>
               <p>Cousins. I heard them go up to my lodgers afterwards, but I lay still for fear.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay in the house?</p>
               <p>Cousins. It is my opinion they staid hardly a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them go down?</p>
               <p>Cousins. I think I heard them go down very softly. I lay in that condition about a quarter of an hour, Then I got up, and went up to the lodgers. I lost about twenty-seven pounds in gold, and about thirty shillings in silver out of my pockets; it was loose, but was in a private pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down, what did you observe? Where did they get in?</p>
               <p>Cousins. They got in at my kitchen window; the two bolts of the windows were untwisted, and the screws drawn; I apprehend it was done with this (producing a small crow with two teeth) which they left in my bed-chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your kitchen window, a sash or casement?</p>
               <p>Cousins. A sash. When I came down I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180030"/> found it quite open, and the door was open too.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that window fastened when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Cousins. With a shutter on the outside; the shutter was forced open, and the screws were drawn that were in the two bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. In your fright had you any opportunity or power to take notice of the people?</p>
               <p>Cousins. I had no power because they blinded me immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you any thing of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Cousins. By the heighth and thinness of the prisoner, I think he is the first man I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the colour of his coat?</p>
               <p>Cousins. I had not time.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor his face?</p>
               <p>Cousins. Not to-swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover any of your money again?</p>
               <p>Cousins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Cousins. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken up?</p>
               <p>Cousins. The Sunday following.</p>

            . I am a lodger in the prosecutrix's house; about the dead of the night I heard my mistress scream out; I got out of bed to go down stairs; when I had got down one stair, and went to step down the second, I met a gentleman with a lighted candle in his left hand, and a cutlass in his right hand; he desired me to walk back to my bed, and made me get into bed. I got into bed; he stood over me a few minutes; I viewed his face while he stood over me. When the prisoner was taken I was sent for and immediately knew him to be that man.</p>

               <p>Joseph Hall. The prisoner, who calls himself a printer, and I were acquainted; we met upon the Sunday the fact was committed, at the Green Man in Peirpool-lane; there the prisoner proposed to me to go and break open this house, and talked of asking two or three dust-men to go with us. I did not like that, because they were strangers; then he said, he would go and get somebody he knew; we met with Hartley, and he agreed to go; we all three went to Hartley's lodgings, in an Alley between Grub-street and Moorfields, where we staid till past twelve o'clock; then we went to this house; Hartley was the principal manager; he broke the window shutter open with a chissel and crow; he lifted up the window, went in and struck a light, and then opened the door and let us in; he bid us go up stairs first, and desired Andrew Gray to stop at the woman's door whilst he went into her room. Hartley went into the woman's room, and asked h er for her pockets and the key of her chest. He got the money out of her pocket; then he blew out the candle, and said, come away, and we all went away. We got about twenty eight, or twenty nine pounds, which we shared by the light of one of the brickkilns; we went together till we came to the Alley Hartley lives in; then we parted. Gray and I went to Hatton-wall, where we lay all night. I was taken up upon the Sunday; the prisoner was dressed in brown cloaths when the fact was committed; Hartly had a crape over his face; I had a handkerchief over my head; Gray had a handkerchief or cap.

I had an information on Friday respecting this robbery: I went to the Sluce-house on Saturday, and asked the woman if she knew any thing of the persons? she said, No: she sent for Miller, who described one of them, which I thought a sufficient authority to take Hall, who I before suspected. When I had taken Hall, he informed me where I might find Gray; he said, he had left Peirpool-Lane, and I might find him somewhere in Moorfields. I told him I had reason to suspect Andrew Gray was one concerned in the robbery, because I had seen them together. Hall did not make any confession till Monday morning before the justice.

I saw them together, I believe, the same Sunday morning that the robbery was committed; I know it was of a Sunday morning, and I believe it was that Sunday morning.</p>

I lodged at the King's Arms, in Holborn, when I came to town, I have nobody here. I came in drunk when I was committed to Newgate the other night, and broke the windows, and they put me in the cells. I could not send for any body.</p>

I saw it between five and six in the evening, and missed it about seven or eight; it was lying upon a chest; I was called out; it was there when I went out; I don't know who took it; I received it again from Bennett.</p>

            . There were some handbills printed to recover this shag; some days after that the prisoners came to my house, and said, they had the shag in their custody; they brought it, and asked me to conceal it till they could dispose of it. I delivered it to Mr. Mackey directly, that it might be returned to the owner. Mrs. Burgoyne told me she took it out of the house herself; and he said, that he helped carry it home. It was lost on the Monday, and brought to me on the Saturday following.</p>

            . On the 22d of September last, I was ordered by the justices at the rotation, at the Curtain in Shoreditch, to Clerkenwell prison.

As we were coming along in the coach, Delaforce, who I had never seen before that day, wanted my money to pay for the coach. I told him I did not chuse to pay any thing; and I told him, I had no money: then Delaforce took my knife out of my pocket, and cut my gown to pieces; he cut my pockets off and took them away; he beat me all this time; there were in my pocket three pence in halfpence, a shilling, and four keys belonging to my boxes; he carried one of my pockets to Newgate with him; he twice knocked me off my seat, and he cut my eye out with my own knife; he also took my hat and cap, and a handkerchief. I cried out, Murder! but the coach never stopped till it came to Newgate. Mr. Llewin rode on the coach box; I complained to him, when the coach stopped, of the ill usuage I had received from Delaforce, and I desired Llewin to get my things from him; he got only my keys and my pocket from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Lumley do all this time?</p>
               <p>Bignell. When Delaforce was beating me, and I cried out for help, Lumley said, he might murder me for what he card; he did one time attempt to take Delaforce's hand away when he was beating me. Lumley is lame with one hand.</p>

            . I am a servant to the governor of Clerkenwell prison; the prosecutor, Delaforce, and two other prisoners, were put into a coach, and Lumley was with them as a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180034"/> guard. I went upon the coach-box; I did not see what passed in the coach; I did hear the prosecutrix cry out in the same manner as she had done in the morning at the justice's; she had been in fits at the justice's, and had behaved very strangely. Immediately as the coach stopped at Newgate, the prosecutrix complained to me of Delaforce having beat and robbed her. I searched Delaforce, and I found a pocket in his coat pocket; and I also found three or four iron keys upon him which I delivered to the prosecutrix. Lumley had a cut upon his hand; he is as harmless a man as ever breathed.</p>
               <p>Delaforce's Defence.</p>
               <p>I did not cut the prosecutrix; she would not pay her share of the coach; we were both very much in liquor. I did strike her with my elbow; she fell down in fits in the coach; I did not take any thing from her.</p>
               <p>There being no evidence to affect Lumley, he was not called upon to make his defence.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it dark?</p>
               <p>Leigh. The moon was up at that time; a man passed us on horseback very swift; as we were going up a hill, he came back to the right side of the chaise, where the lady sat; he presented a pistol, and cried out, money, money! the lady was frightened, I desired him to come round to my side and I would give him money, which he did; I gave him half a crown and a shilling; when he took the money out of my hand, he said, he had been shot; he dropped some blood in my hand, then he left us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of him, or his horse?</p>
               <p>Leigh. The left arm of his coat had been shot; it was shattered up the arm, it was open in two places. He had on a dark blue coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the horse?</p>
               <p>Leigh. I believe it was a little dark bay horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the person of the man?</p>
               <p>Leigh. Not particularly; I wanted to see his face, but he would not let me. He went off towards London. He was taken in a quarter of an hour after I saw him, the same night, at a public house on the road, about a mile and a half from the place where I was robbed; he was then in the same dress; I knew him by his shattered coat, and I knew his voice as soon as I heard him speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Then upon the whole you are satisfied the prisoner is the man?</p>
               <p>Leigh. Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine his arm to see if it was wounded, after he was taken?</p>
               <p>Leigh. No, here is a man, I believe, did; he was bloody.</p>

            . I live at Kilburn, on the Edgware road. I was at Edgware on the 11th of September, about some business; I returned at at eight at night, on horse-back. Going up the hill, I overtook Mr. Harrison and Mr. Mascal, in a chaise, and Mr. Norton, on horse-back; they said, they had been robbed by a highwayman, and that they had shot him: as we were riding together, and talking of the affair, there came a man galloping along the road very fast towards London; they said, that was the man that robbed them; I immediately pursued him, when he came near my house, his horse fell, and threw him; I jumped off my mare, and laid hold of him; the first thing he said, I think, was,</p>
               <p>"Are you the man that shot me?" I said, no, he wanted to see the man that shot him; I and Mr. Norton took him to the first public house, and Mr. Mascal and Mr. - came up, and said, that was the man that robbed them. There was a piece out of his coat and shirt; he was much shot in the left arm, face, and hand; I believe both hands were shot. There was in his pocket a guinea, a half-crown, a six-pence, and five penny-worth of half-pence; there was blood on the half-crown, (it is produced in court.)</p>

            . I was with Mr. Leigh when the chaise was stopped by a man; he came to my side of the chaise, and called out money money four or five times. He presented a pistol; I was very much frightened. Mr. Leigh desired him to come round to him; he went round, and I saw Mr. Leigh give him something, but could not see what. He had on a dark blue coat: I took notice that he had been shot. I believe he stopped about a minute after Mr. Leigh had given him the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180036"/> money, and said, Oh, I have been shot, and then rode away.

            . The prisoner came to my house upon the night of the nineteenth of September; he begged a lodging: he left the house about a quarter after nine. There was a person sick in the house who called me up: I and my wife went up stairs, and left the prisoner at supper; and left a little girl, who was in a concealed bed in the room unknown to the prisoner. When we came down, all these things charged to be taken in the indictment were found missing; they were there when we went up stairs, and the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dansier confirmed her husband's evidence, and said, she came down for a candle, the prisoner was then there. That when they came down at last, all the things mentioned in the indictment were gone, and the prisoner was gone. That when she went up stairs the handkerchief was pined to the gown. That the prisoner came to lodge there that night.</p>

            . I am neice to the prosecutor; I was in a concealed bed in the house; I remember the prisoner being there. While my uncle and aunt were up stairs I saw the prisoner look about the room; then he took a hat, and after that replaced it. I remember my aunt's coming down for a candle; then the prisoner put his hat upon his head, and sat at the table; but as soon as my aunt went up stairs again, the prisoner then took the things mentioned in the indictment; and as to the gown, he folded it up three times; and when he had wrapped the things up, he went out of the door with them. I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

Upon Saturday, the 16th of September, when I was in an inner room, my sister called to me, and said, there was a little boy gone out of the shop with something in his hand; she said, he had on a brown coat and round hat. I was shifting myself. I went in pursuit of him as soon as I could get my cloaths on; a neighbour who keeps a public-house, informed me there had been such a boy at his house with two men, but he did not know which way they were gone. I pursued them towards Stepney; I met one of the men and the boy coming towards Bow; I did not suspect them because they were coming that way. I passed them, and heard them say something about shirts, that made me look at them; but seeing nothing in their hands, I thought they were not the persons, and went on. When I came further in the field, I saw Johnson lying in the grass at the further end of the field: it being wet weather, I thought he could not lie down to rest himself, but that there must be some bad design: in the mean time some of my neighbours called out to me, they had seized Hall, and were pursuing Basset, who was coming towards me. I stopped him, and he begged of me to let him pass: he said, he had done nothing, but was pursued son taking blackberries. I said, if that was all he had done, I would take care he should not be hurt for that I went forwards and took Johnson likewise; my neighbours then came up, and some of them searching about found a blue apron near the place where Johnson lay at, with my things in it. I said, if they were my things, they were six shirts and six handkerchiefs; it was opened, and the things were found in it. I charged a constable with them, and took the boy to my house, and my sister knew him directly. I took them before the magistrates at Whitechapel, who committed them.</p>

            . I am sister-in-law to Mr. Sweeting; Basset came into the shop on the 16th of last month of an errand. I saw him again soon after go out of the shop with something under his arm; that was a little after one o'clock. I was coming into the shop; I saw no one in the shop but him. When he was in the shop before, I observed he had a blue apron tied round him (a blue apron shewn her). It was like that: he came the first time and asked for a pennyworth of twist. I did not serve him with any. When I saw him go out with something under his arm, I looked in the window and missed six shirts and six handkerchiefs that were lying there. I called to Mr. Sweeting to go after the boy; he was then dressing himself, and could not go after him immediately, but followed him in a few minutes; he was afterwards brought back; I knew him again directly; I am sure the prisoner Basset is the boy. The goods were brought back; I am sure they were the same I laid in the window in the morning; they were tied up in the same form when they were brought back. I saw nobody but Basset in the shop.</p>

               <p>Mason. Yes; it is to speak the truth. I was present when Johnson was taken in a field just by our house; he was lying on the ground, A gentleman that was with me, who took him, desired me to jump over the hedge to see if I could find any thing there; I found some things in a blue apron (looks at the blue apron) this is the apron the things were in. A lad that was with me opened the bundle; there were six shirts and six handkerchiefs in it. I believe these to be the same.</p>

There were no chairs in the room, so I sat down upon the bed with the two women: while I was upon the bed with them in this manner, Turner picked my pocket of three guineas, which were loose in my pocket. I felt her while she was about it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180040"/> immediately missed the money. I was perfectly sober; I insisted upon having my money again. The women and I had a great struggle; I kept hold of them, and would not let them go; upon which they called out for assistance: then two lusty women came up, and soon after came up the prisoner Hawkins; Hawkins swore a great oath at me, and asked me what business I had with his wife, and struck me a violent blow; this was about five minutes after the woman came up. When my pocket was first picked, they put out the candle, and then Hawkins ran off, and they all left the room, and I went down stairs but could find nobody. I was resolved to know the house again, therefore I unscrewed the knocker, and laid it down at the door, that I might know the house again. I went away to the constable, and he took his lanthorn with him, and came to the house with me that had the knocker unscrewed, and laying down at the bottom of the door; by that means I found out the house, and he took all the people that were there, into custody.</p>
               <p>Ann Hall. I am one of the woman that were in company with the prosecutor; Turner and I were in Whitechapel together; we went with the prosecutor to Irish-court; we sat upon the bed for want of chairs; while we were there, the prisoner Turner picked the the prosecutor's pocket of some money, as he said, three guineas; he immediately perceived her, and stopped her and me, upon which Turner called for assistance, and then two women came up, and Hawkins immediately after; Hawkins said, what business have you with my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this woman pass for his wife?</p>
               <p>Hall. No, only he chose to call her so at that particular time. When I went down, I saw Turner give Mrs. Kelly three guineas, and said, here is all I have got, and all I have; Hawkins immediately went off.</p>

            . I am headborough of Whitechapel. Upon the 22d of September, the prosecutor came to my house, and said, he had been robbed; I perceived he had had a violent blow upon his forehead. Kelly's is a notorious house in that neighbourhood; he told me the same story he has told now; I know Hawkins pretty well; he had the reputation of being a person concerned in that house, a kind of bully; he had been in my house just before this accident happened; he was called out from my house in a hurry; I went to the house, and took up all the people I found there; but the prosecutor said, none of the women I found there were concerned in robbing him; but as soon as I found Turner, he has the reputation of being concerned in this house; when at this house in the morning I wanted to take up another, and said, he hoped I would be favourable to him: I said, I had nothing to do to be favourable to one or another, it was my business to execute my duty; he took out a guinea, and said, he had that guinea only, and he would make up another guinea.</p>

               <p>Hawkins's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of this matter. Hearing a noise, being in the house, I went up to see what was the matter; the candle was blown out. I am innocent of the business.</p>

After we had took them, we brought them back to my uncle's door, and informed him what had happened; we sent for a constable, he searched the prisoners; out of Reading's pocket he took a dark lanthorn, matches, a flint, and a couple of knives. Mr. Clarke examined the basket; the things mentioned in the indictment were taken out of the basket. It was tied up with a cloth over it; we took them before the justices at the rotation in Litchfield-Street; both the prisoners were examined. There they were asked what they had to say in their defence? Archer said, they had little to say; Redding said, he never was in the house, but a dark lantern was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was Redding taken?</p>

            . The two prisoners were apprehended upon Thursday morning. I was in the house in the afternoon before the robbery: at about four o'clock every thing was safe; then I double-locked the door when I came out, and hung the key up at Mr. Morgan's.</p>

             again. I took it upon Archer. Mr. Clarke, the constable of the night, came soon after; I desired he would attend to the goods in the basket. I sat down and opened it; it contained the goods here produced. I took Archer to justice Mercer first to be examined; he wished to be an evidence. Justice Mercer did not choose to admit him: then I brought him back, and kept them in custody till the afternoon, when I took them to the rotation office in Titchfield-Street, before Mr. Mercer, and several other justices, and took the goods contained in the basket there.</p>

               <p>Cooper. I went to Lady Mostyn's house afterwards and searched it, and found the locks broke: the lock of the street door did not appear the least damaged. We found these picklocks of different sizes, and a tinder-box (producing them). I went up stairs and found a quantity of wearing apparel, and a great deal of table-linen strewed all over the house from the first floor up to the garret. I went into the rooms, and found every lock, I believe, broke open; I don't know that one lock escaped. Some clothes presses which they could not break open, the backs of the woodwork was broke all round, and they had eased themselves in both these rooms. I found these two tea-pots in the kitchen, and the two silver spouts which were found in the basket to fit them exactly.</p>

Not being satisfied with this account, I took him to the Rotation-office, before the justices; he said, he took it off a coach-box, and described where, in consequence of which Elwood was sent for.</p>

The chamberlain told him he could not call to mind the person. The witness then asked him what man it was that was drinking in the Tap-house, along with the coachman: that then the chamberlain said, that was the person that lay in the room, and he knew him very well. Then the witness went to Mr. Motts, and informed him of the circumstance; and then went to the bank. Upon enquiry at the bank, he was informed that the note had been there and was accepted. He left his direction at the bank, in consequence of which he was sent for when the bill was offered at the bank for payment.</p>

               <p>THE Authors of this production will not attempt to delude the Public by a parade of words and specious promises, which they are incapable of performing, and shall therefore only mention such particulars as are within their reach, and which they will assiduously exert themselves to display to the almost.</p>
               <p>Besides their seizing every Object that can contribute towards the Entertainment and Instruction of their readers, they will be enabled to lay before them Topics that never yet appeared in a Magazine, by the assistance of some Gentlemen of consequence in polite life, who have promised to transmit them all the amusing conversation that shall pass in the most respectable parties. This will not be confined entirely to the Metropolis, but Bath, and all the other polite Watering-places will furnish them with Materials for cultivating this Correspondence. In this pursuit they will extend their Information from Scarborpugh to Brighthelmstone, and whether the subjects be Gallantry, Intrigue, Politicks, or the Drama, they will equally find a place in this Miscellany, if judged either Amusing or Instructive. This deportment of their Magazine, which is entirely upon a new plan, and which will never exceed the bounds of the strictest truth, will justly entitle it to the Appellation of the CONVIVIAL MAGAZINE.</p>
               <p>In fine, every possible Endeavour will be exerted to render it one of the most entertaining and instructive production extant; in the execution of which the proprietors are resolved that no Pains or expence shall be spared. To this end, they have engaged some of the most capital Artists to furnish them with copper plates which shall not be inferior to those of any Monthly publication whatever.</p>
