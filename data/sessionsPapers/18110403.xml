            . I am a Chelsea pensioner. On Tuesday the 19th of February, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw the constable take the prisoner with a basket of linen out of a house in St. Giles's; I followed the constable, he was taking her to Marlborough-street; the prisoner took a belcher handkerchief out of her pocket, and dropped it into a woman's lap that was sitting down as she passed by. I took it out of the woman's lap, and gave it to the constable. This was between twelve and one o'clock; I saw her putting her hand into her pocket again, I said, stop, constable, she has got more handkerchiefs in her pocket. I took her hand out of her pocket, and took out of her pocket five more handkerchiefs; I gave them to the constable; that made six, and the one on her neck was seven. They were all belcher handkerchiefs, but different patterns. The prisoner was very much in liquor.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner at No. 18, Backeridge-street; I went there from information, called her out; I told her she must go up into her room, I would tell her what I wanted with her. This was between twelve and two o'clock; we went up into her own room, she asked me what I wanted with her; she said she would not open the door; she had the key in her hand; I took the key out of her hand, and opened the door myself. In the middle of the room stood a basket, I asked her how she came by it; she said a young man gave it her. I asked her who the young man was; she said she did not know, she had never seen him before, he had promised to bring her some more. I packed up the basket of linen and tied them up; I said you must go with me.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not produce the hankerchiefs - A. No. She said, what occasion have I to go with you, you have got your own property. I took the basket of linen and her to Marlborough-street office. She dropped the handkerchiefs, as was related before. I saw the handkerchiefs taken out of her pocket, and one was on her neck; they were all marked the same as the linen in the basket. The prisoner was intoxicated. She told the magistrate that a young man brought them to her to wash, that she had lived with the young man some time. She was committed. I advertized the property. Mrs. Davidson came and claimed the property.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. You said these goods were left in the parlour - A. Yes; the parlour door was open. The basket was tied down when in my parlour, she must have opened them at her own home to have taken the handkerchiefs out. I was sweeping about the door at the time they were taken away. If she had opened them in my room I should have seen her. The shirts were worth a guinea each, when new; they may all be worth about two pounds now. I am not certain. They are all the gentleman's property that sent them me to wash.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This basket was delivered to me by a man, it had a cloth over it; the handkerchiefs he gave me loose out of his pocket; he told me to go home and he would bring the rest of the things to me. We had something to drink together in the forenoon. I took the handkerchiefs of the man at the end of Oxford-road; I took them home. I asked the man where he came from, he said he had disagreed with his relations. I had been in his company before, we agreed to live together. The constable came and took the things away; he said he would advertise the things, he did not think I came honestly by them.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square office. On the evening of the 12th of March I saw the prisoner at the top of Cockspur-street, he was coming from towards Piccadilly, he had this bag on his shoulder; I stopped him, I asked him what he had got upon his shoulder; he said, some flour, he had got it from his master, he was going to take it to a man at Charing Cross. I asked him the name of the man and his business; he said he neither knew the name or business, nor yet whereabouts at Charing Cross he lived; I asked him his master's name, he refused to tell. I told him I was sure he had not brought it far, we would go back, and I would find out his master. We walked back again, we passed his master's house forty yards, there I found him shuffle the bag, as though he wanted to get it off his shoulder. I told him it was no use. I took him into the Sun public house in Hare-street, and handcuffed him. Mr. Lawrence, a master baker was there, he saw the bag and knew the bag. The prisoner then said, he was sorry for it, he was going to give it to a man that had three children; he had never done so before. Mr. Lawrence went for his master. The next morning I weighed the bag, it weighed sixty-six pounds. I have had the bag in my possession ever since.</p>

            . I am a labourer. On the 28th of February, in the morning, I and Neale were employed to watch Mr. Holmes's premises; we placed ourselves in the little shop, about half after five in the morning a person came past in a direction from Mr. Fletcher's premises. There is a tree by a wall that a person could get over; I saw him go to the great barn, it was light enough, I knew him directly. I have known him between five and six years, and when he passed me I was sure it was him. When he got to the barn I saw a light in the barn. I heard him rattle the deals about as if he was picking them out. I saw him come from the barn with a light, and go to the mahogany house. I saw him come from the mahogany house to the barn; when he got to the barn the light was put out; he then took up his load, and when he passed by where I was waiting for him I opened the door and seized him by the collar; he throwed the deals and mahogany at me, and broke two or three squares of glass; the prisoner struggled very hard; I threw him down, and one of his shoes came off. He arose, collared me, and struck me; I told him I would take him, do whatever he would; he said he would lose his life before he would be taken, and I replied, I would lose my life before I would leave him. I dragged him about ten yards, he got from me and ran five or ten yards. I called out, if he did not stop I would fire; he did not stop, I fired the pistol at him, I hit him; he fell. He arose and came to me, and catched hold of the pistol. We had a struggle; I got it from him. He said, d - n your blood, I have got you, and tried to get at his right hand pocket; I said, Neale, mind, he is going to get a knife, he will stab you; I knocked him down with the pistol; he said, I did not think you would have served me so; I said, is not my life as sweet as yours. After that he was delivered to the constable. From the time that he passed me, to the time that he had the deals on his shoulder, he was never out of my sight. From his person and voice I knew him.</p>

            . On this morning, about half after five, I was along with the other witness in the little shop, for the purpose of watching.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, ever since he worked for Mr. Holmes, after he lived at Twickenham. I saw nothing till I saw the light in the barn. I heard the boards moving; I saw a person come along with the boards, and my partner seized him; it was the prisoner. As soon as he was seized he threw the deals down; they struggled; he got away, and my partner fired at him. He was afterwards delivered to my master.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The deals and mahogany are mine.</p>
               <p>MR. ADAMS. The prisoner was put into my custody. I found upon him a tinder box, a knife, and skeleton keys.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never was on Mr. Holmes's premises till that morning. I never stole any thing from him in all my life. I am very sorry for being there then. That man shot me in the side and broke one of my ribs. I have suffered a great deal.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 26th of March I went with the prosecutor to apprehend the prisoner. When I went in, I said, Poll are you here; she said, yes. I said, Poll, you know the thimble; she said she did not know what I meant.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the cant phrase, a thimble - A. That is the ordinary name for a watch. I asked her if she had the thimble; she said, no. She turned out her pockets, and in taking the things out she was longer than she ought. I said, stand aside. I heard something fall, I said what is that, she said a little rouge. I said, what you do your face with? she said, yes. I picked it up, it was this seal and key. The prosecutor said it was his; the prisoner denied ever being with the prosecutor at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor went with me into Parker-street, he paid a shilling for the room. He told me he had but one shilling in his pocket. I went down stairs, and he lit me down himself, and half an hour afterwards he met me again. He had the gold seal and key in his hand; he said, if I would go with him he would give it me; he would return and make me a compliment; I was not to make away with it; I did not. I know nothing of the watch, no more than you do. The prosecutor said he had given six shillings to a young woman that ran away.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not give her the seal and key. She took the watch, two seals, and a key; the prisoner had six shillings and sixpence of me; no other person took a shilling from me.</p>

On the 25th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was informed by my little boy, four years old, that a man had taken away one of my cheeses, and was rolling it along the street. Upon the child telling me the second time I went out and saw the prisoner rolling it he was about twenty yards off; I pursued him, I took hold of his collar, I asked him where he was going with that cheese; he answered, I found it in the street. I requested Mr. Daniel to take charge of the cheese while I took the man back to my shop. This is the cheese, I am sure it is mine, there is my name on it. In the morning I had put out three cheeses on my area bars, and when my little boy gave me the information there were only two.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home from my work, I was crossing Wild-street, I saw a tall man in a blue coat carrying the cheese, he let it drop; and at the time the gentleman came up I was wiping it; I called for assistance. I suppose the gentleman heard me. Speak the truth gentleman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a watch on the 28th of February - A. Yes, at eleven o'clock in the morning, it was my husband's watch, it was taken from a brass hook, under the mantle, in the front dining room, on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the day had you seen it before - A. About eleven o'clock in the morning. I came down for a pitcher of water, and on my return I saw the prisoner coming down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before - A. No. He was dressed in a light coloured great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you particularly remark his person so as to be able to speak to him again - A. No; it is very much like him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you speak to him or not - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went in your room was your watch there or gone - A. It was gone. On my seeing the strange man come down I had suspicion. I told my husband. I went down and told the people of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person pursued - A. No; I went out, he was gone; I did not see any body. On the week following I saw the watch at Worship-street. The watch is here, the pawnbroker has it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt the prisoner is the person - A. I have no doubt.</p>

            . I am a private in the Royal East London Militia. On the first Friday in March I received a duplicate of the prisoner, he asked me if I wanted to buy a watch; I told him I did; he asked me thirteen shillings for the duplicate; he said he had pawned the watch for want of money; I agreed with him for it. I advanced no money untill I had seen the watch. I took the duplicate to the pay-serjeant, and asked him to redeem it for me. This is the same duplicate that I received of the prisoner. I afterwards saw the prisoner, and told him the duplicate was stopped. He told me he would redeem it for me if I would advance him the money; he was not afraid of being stopped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found this duplicate in Featherstone-street, I could not afford to get the watch out; I asked this man to purchase the ticket of me. I belong to the Royal West London Militia; he told me the watch was stopped two or three days after he got the duplicate. I told him I would get the watch out if he would get the money for me.</p>

I said I could not give my watch to any person but the mistress of the house, and after being up stairs I took the watch out of her hand, as she was not the mistress of the house, and put the watch into my hat; the prisoner got out of bed and snatched the watch out of my hat, and ran down stairs in her smock. I ran after her and went against the wall; I fell down, and never have got my watch since.</p>

            . I am a watchman in that street. I was fetched to that house. I went in; the prisoner was sitting in the house by the fire, in her smock; she told me that the man up stairs had took all her clothes away. I went up stairs, I said, give the girl her clothes; they were done up in a bundle; he said, I charge this girl, she has got my watch.</p>

I took the prisoner to my lodgings, he promised to give me five shillings, and two shillings for the bed; we both went to bed together; when we awaked this man said he had a watch to leave till the morning, he had no money; I said, send down to the landlady; the servant girl came up, he began to play with her; he gave no money, nor no watch; he said, you be answerable for the bed, if you come to Mr. Roach's in the morning I will pay you; I said, no, I cannot be answerable, I owe the landlady money. He knocked me about the room, I cried out murder; I ran down stairs and sent for the watchman. He had no watch or money.</p>

Walter looked at a gown piece, and presently she pulled out some plaid handkerchiefs, and looked at them, they were hanging inside the door. They remained there about a quarter of an hour; I stood close to the prisoners; I heard Walter say to Fowle, it would not do yet. Fowle said, you know best; she said, stop a bit. Fowle frowned, and Walter said, as I was looking at them, it was one shilling and nine-pence a-yard; then my friend stepped over to me; she said, has that man bought any thing out of the shop; I said, no; she said, the man has walked off with the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your friend was not standing with you - A. No, she was on the opposite side of the way; the man went away, and the woman stopped to see if any one went after them; I went into the shop and asked the gentleman if he had lost any thing; they looked to see what they had lost, and they missed a piece of handkerchiefs that hung at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner Walter remain while they were searching, or go away - A. She remained; she stood round the corner of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When they searched and found one of the pieces were gone, did any body go after them - A. Yes, Mr. Davis, the manager of the business, and I went with him; we apprehended the woman, but the man made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you apprehend the the woman - A. In Long Acre; she went into a gin shop; we watched her out, in hopes we should find the man. We watched her some distance from the gin-shop, she perceived we were watching her; she did not go the same way as the man; then Mr. Davis took her; she was searched, but no property was found on her. When the woman had her hearing at Bow-street this man was brought in, I knew him again, I am certain he is the man. I never lost sight of the woman from the time that I first saw her untill she was taken.</p>

               <p>Q. And where was he when you perceived him with the handkerchiefs - A. Just beyond the linen-drapers shop: she was with him at that time, and I saw him tucking the handkerchiefs under the top part of his coat. The woman stopped to see if any of the gentlemen of the shop were looking after them; we gave the alarm. I saw Walters taken.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Mrs. Walsh and the other witness coming in - A. Yes, and I looked where the handkerchiefs hung, I missed them immediately; they were buff plaid handkerchiefs, I had seen them about a quarter of an hour before that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever get the handkerchiefs again - A. No. Fowle was brought to the office at seven o'clock at her examination, the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Fowle seem to know Walter - A. No, they seemed to be strange to each other. I catched Walter in Great Russell-street, Covent Garden. When I came to the door she stood by the door, and when she walked away I followed. I thought she might go into a house, and I might catch the man and her together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Walter. Q. I asked Mr. Davis the price of some linen, he told me it was one shilling and nine pence a-yard - A. You did, and when I asked you to walk in you withdrew, and about two minutes after you withdrew Mrs. Walsh came in and asked me if I had sold her any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fowle, Q. to Mrs. Walsh. What time did you see me there - A. I believe, about four.</p>
               <p>Walters' Defence. As I was returning from Oxford-road this person talked with me, as I was walking along I stopped at the house of Mr. Craig, I asked that gentleman what the print was a yard; from that I went into St. Martin's court, and returned back again. I heard a person say, that is the woman. I was taken in Russell-street, I willingly went back with him.</p>

I saw him before he got out of the house, and pursued him instantly; he had got about twenty yards from the house when I collared him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost sight of him - A. I bad. It was so short a time I am sure it is the same man. When I collared him my brother was after me, we took him into the warehouse. I sent to the Police office, Hatton Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the carpet - A. We brought the prisoner and the carpet back again to the warehouse. He had the carpet upon his right shoulder when I collared him.</p>

On my arrival at the door the prisoner had got three pieces of printed cottons under his arm, and was going off with them. I cried stop thief, and he dropped the goods in the street. I took the goods; the prisoner was pursued by the constable and brought back.</p>

            . I am a carman. I went with two bags and half a chest to the Three Cups in Aldersgate-street, on the day this man was taken. I took them from Messrs. Haddans and Bond, No. 17, Trinity-lane, I could not go up the Three Cups gateway, there was a waggon shot out in the yard, I was obliged to stop and carry them up. I took up one bag on my back, I was gone about a minute; as soon as I came back for the other bag I missed it out of the cart. I went to the book-keeper, I said I had lost a bag out of the cart; he said, no, we have got the bag and the man too, and when I saw the bag it appeared to be the same bag. Both the bags were directed to one gentleman.</p>

From that information, he said, will you take share of half a pint of beer. I accepted the offer, and said, I was going to the Old Change with this trunk, we would walk down there; we went there. After we came out and had drank the pint of beer, I found my trunk gone. I left my trunk within the door, rather inclining to the outside of the door of the tap.</p>
               <p>Q. What beer did you drink - A. One pint of beer between us two. When I came out I said to the man that was with me, by the great God my trunk is gone; he said, d - n it, that is a queer thing. I went into the yard to see whether any of the porters had took it, he said he would go and see after it; I stopped at the door, and when he came back Mr. Lee said he saw a man run down the Old Change, and go into Moor's-yard. I found my trunk in Moor's-yard, in Mr. Phillips's house.</p>
               <p>Q. All you know is, that you lost your trunk, and that you found it afterwards at Mr. Phillips's. Are you a Londoner - A. No. I have been in London five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you ought to have more sense - You know nothing of the prisoner, do you - A. No.</p>

            , carwoman. On this day, about two o'clock, I was standing with my cart, I saw a man run across Old Fish-street Hill with a trunk on his shoulder. He took it up Moor's-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was that to the Queen's Head - A. About an hundred yards. My fellow-servant said he had suspicion he had stolen the trunk; I did not think so; the man came back again in the space of a minute, without the trunk. I knew every person in Moor's-yard. I did not think there was any body in the court that would take a stolen thing in. There was an outcry that the trunk was stolen, I and my fellow servant followed the man up Old Change, met with him, and took him into custody. I am certain the same man we took is the same man that went up Moor's-yard with the trunk. When we stopped the prisoner he asked what was the matter; we told him a person wanted to speak with him concerning the trunk; and coming along I gave him into the custody of the officer that met us.</p>

My brother-in-law, said he might leave it and wellcome, but the man I do not know. My brother in law is here. When the man was brought back by Mr. Smith I thought it to be the same man, but now I do not know. I had no doubt at the time; I was flurried.</p>

I saw one of them take up her apron and pick up something, I did not know what; they then both went into a public-house next door; I went to the door immediately and asked Mrs. Cooke if she had lost any thing; she came out of the door, and said, yes, all my china plates; I went to the public-house bar door, they were both coming out; I asked them what they had got there; the first woman had nothing, the second woman had the china in her apron; I took them from her, and delivered them to Mrs. Cooke; I had a child in my arms. They both went away. In the evening we went to a public-house in Vine-street, and found the two women about nine o'clock.</p>

Mrs. Humbleby, saw him go in; I staid at the front of the house and the witness at the back; she saw him come out with the tools, and gave me the alarm. I pursued him and took him, I saw him drop the saw and the plane as he was going through the field; I found the rule in his pocket. The prisoner said he took them to go to work with, and wished us to send him on board the Tender. The saw is worth seven shillings, the rule eighteen pence, and the plane three shillings. They are all my tools.</p>

On the 5th of March, about half past eleven in the morning, I met the prisoner in Holborn with another young woman, whom she said was her sister. She informed me that she and her sister were natives of Ireland, that they had no friends, and were destitute, and in consequence of kindness that I had received in Ireland, when in the navy, I was induced to return my gratitude to the country that were deserving of it. I took them into a wine vaults and gave them something to drink, and took them into another public-house and got them something to eat, and remained in their company some time that afternoon. They behaved very discreet; they saw my change was right at the public-house; the prisoner was particular in observing that I was not 
overcharged.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you drink any considerable quantity together - A. We were not perfectly sober. They had so many places to call at; I found myself at Portman-square at eight o'clock at night; I was tired, I took a coach, we stopped at the <placeName id="t18110403-20-crimeloc112">Dolphin, Oxford-road</placeName>

I endeavoured to persuade her to return my pocket-book; she then said that I belonged to the Vere-street gang. The people in the tap-room said I ought to give charge of her; I did. I was astonished at her conduct; she behaved so different all the day.</p>
               <p>Q. You think she was drunk by your giving her liquor - A. Yes, and had not she been in liquor I am positive that she would not have done what she did.</p>

We had a few little commissions, we called at several places; he treated the people; he acted very civil and good-natured,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030011"/>he behaved indeed foolish, he doubly paid them for every thing that we had to eat.

               <p>Q. Did you lose a sheet on the 22nd of March - A. Yes; the sheet was hung upon the heath to dry. I hung the clothes between seven and eight, and did not leave them after eleven; I was turning a shirt then on the heath, the prisoner came and took a shirt and walked away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her - A. Yes. I walked to meet her, and when she saw me she threw it upon a bush and walked away. I told some butcher boys, they got a constable, and she was taken. I am sure the prisoner is the person that took the sheet. When she took the sheet she put it under her apron, as if to conceal it, and upon my going up to her she threw it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she run away - A. She walked away. I was afraid of losing some more; I desired the boys to take her. This is the sheet, it is my mistress's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming past the wind blew the sheet off the bush she put it on, and I put it up again.</p>

            . On the 1st of March I was in my father's kitchen at work, between four and five in the afternoon, I heard somebody go up stairs, I did not go up immediately, and when I went up I saw the prisoner come down the stairs, she was going out of the street door, she had her gown up and something in it. I asked a person up stairs if any body had been there, they said no, not to them. I followed the prisoner and over-took her in Long Acre, crossing Bow-street, I asked her what she wanted; she said she had not been there; I asked her what she had in her apron, she said some things of her own. I took her apron of one side and saw this counterpane, it is my fathers, it was taken off his bed. I am sure the prisoner is the same person.</p>

            . On the 19th of March, about five o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop and asked me to shew her some print, I shewed her some, she purchased of me to the amount of three shillings, and paid me for it, and while she was buying them she conveyed this piece of print off the counter under her cloak, she went out of the shop. I and another young man followed her and brought her into the shop, and then about two yards from the shop door, when she was brought into the shop a piece of print fell from under her clothes, I immediately sent for a constable. This is the print I am confident it is my masters property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop to purchase two yards of print, I gave three shillings for it, and when I came out of the shop the gentleman brought me back, there was a great deal of print laying on the counter, another young woman stood there, the gentleman saw the print lay at a young woman's feet, they said I dropped it there.</p>
               <p>Jury. How near was the other young woman to the prisoner. - A. About a yard distance, the prisoner was not close to the counter, but the other young woman was, the prisoner was about two yards in the shop, and the print lay about a yard from the counter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Messrs. Hancock. On the 22d of February, at half past six in the evening, I saw the prisoner behind the mill, he turned to go into the stable that is under the mill, I followed him, he turned round to me, he had this bag in his hand, he said he had some sugar to put into some beer, he put it down on the ground, I took it up it was ground lump sugar, about four pound, it was worth about 9 d. a pound. He said he would give me a guinea if I would say nothing about it, and went down upon his knees, I put the sugar down again, he took it up and shook the sugar in the dung in the stable, and then kicked the dung with his feet to trample it down. I sent for Mr. Hancock, and then a constable was fetched. This is the bag, the sugar was not recovered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. That bag does not belong to you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And the sugar you could not swear to. - A. I looked at that in the bag, and that in the mill, it was all alike. I have no doubt of it being my masters sugar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The man used to take sugar out and put it in beer, and grate nutmeg upon it, I was never told that I was not allowed to have sugar. I took this sugar to put into small beer.</p>

I told the prisoner I had lost them things out of the place, she said she knew nothing about them, do you think I have taken them, I said nobody had been in the bed room but her, she then opened her handkerchief and said, Madam, do you think this shift is yours, I said no. I found three keys down her bosom, one key fitted a drawer which I had my money in, and another key, which was a key of mine, which fitted a sideboard drawer, which key I occasionally left when I went out. I searched her box, I found a leather purse containing three duplicates of my property, the Russia cloth, the callico, the shift and the blanket, the blanket I have not put in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Q. How far did he carry them. - A. It might be a couple of hundred yards, I and another man saw him, we went and gave the alarm, we went to the place in the garden where we saw the prisoner place them and saw them lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Smith go with you. - A He did afterwards, we found four pots in a concealed place.</p>

            . I was going along with Cope by the Bedford Nursery, I saw the prisoner in the nursery ground, he was running from the frame with two pots in his hand, he looked over the pales two or three times, that made me have suspicion that he was stealing the plants, he came from the frame through the ground to the ditch, he put them down there and covered them over with some old grass, he went back again, I saw him come with two more. I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

I went to where the prisoner lived, there I found the barrow empty, the prisoner was at home and going to bed, the barrow was wet as if mortar had been in it, the mortar could not have been out of the barrow but a few minutes, because I could take it out with my fingers.</p>

               <p>MR. STANHOPE. I live at Fulham. I am a carpenter. On the evening of the 1st of April, I saw the prisoner on Mr. Plowman's premises about eight o'clock, I saw him wheel the barrow out, he stopped and looked round to see if any body was coming, he then wheeled the barrow to the back of the Bell and Anchor, to one Dalley's, it is a Cottage. I went and informed Mr. Plowman.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A poor man living by there asked me if I would give him some mortar to fix up his fire place, I brought a bit of mortar there in the barrow, and in the morning I meaned to take the barrow back again, it was not half a barrow of mortar.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The barrow was as full as it could be wheeled, it was worth about eighteen pence, I valued it only at a shilling.</p>

If a patient in that Ward went out the sister or the nurse would feel it their duty to apply to me, and they would be discharged.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner and tell me whether you know her person. - A. Yes, she came to me on the 19th of March, the day before the fast day, between twelve and one, she came by herself, she had no child with her, she asked me for a glass of gin, she offered to pay me by a sixpence, the glass of gin was twopence, I gave her four pennyworth of halfpence and took the sixpence. I put the sixpence in the front of the till where there was no other, and she went out. In five minutes afterwards there came in another woman, she asked for a glass of gin, I gave her the gin myself, she gave me a sixpence to pay for it, my husband stood at the left hand of me, I asked him to look at the sixpence, I had suspicion by their being two Irish women, and by my shewing it to my husband I concluded it was a bad one, I told my waiter to call her back, she came back with the four pennyworth of halfpence in her hand, it was not the prisoner, it was the second woman that was brought back that uttered the second sixpence, she said she had no more money in her pocket, she would go and ask her friend who was in the street, I immediately went out and saw the prisoner in the street, I told the prisoner that she had offered me a bad sixpence the other woman ran away, the prisoner refused coming back with me at first, afterwards she came back with me, and took out of her bosom a bag and put some sort of money out of her pocket into that bag, tied it up and kept in her left hand. We sent for an officer, Mr. Herman came, she was taken up stairs and searched, he searched all her pockets, she had four pockets round her, two at the front and one at each side, and in them was twopence or twopence halfpenny, and a bad sixpence, I laid that bad sixpence on the table and the prisoner took it up, we could not find it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards did you before the Lord Mayor deliver the sixpence that was uttered by the prisoner. - A. Yes, to the constable, he has it and the sixpence uttered by the second woman, I now produce, this is the sixpence.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 19th of March I went to the Black Boy, the prisoner was sitting in the tap-room, I took her up stairs and searched her as close as I could with decency, I found she had got four pockets on, in one of the pockets I found twopence halfpenny and a sixpence, I have had it ever since. The sixpence that I took out of her pocket I put on the table to Mrs. Burch, to know whether it was a good or a bad one, and before I took it up again it was gone, Mrs. Burch delivered to me the sixpence that the prisoner uttered before the Lord Mayor, I have had it in my possession ever since. I brought the prisoner down stairs, they began to look under the seat of the chair where she was sitting, they found this bag under that chair, the waiter gave it to his master, and his master gave it to me, I have had it ever since. The sixpence that Mrs. Burch took of the prisoner is wrapped up in that bit of paper, and Mrs. Burch has put a mark upon it.</p>

Yes, I saw the prisoner come and put a box on a cask on the outside of the room door, he then went into the colour room and looked round a little while, he took a scoop from underneath the counter and went towards the box that the colour was in, I heard the colour rattle as he got it out with the scoop, but I did not see it, and then he put the scoop under the counter and began to do the scales, he went to the box a second time, came out and worked at the scales, he went the third time and got some more, came out, took his box and went down stairs. I got out of the hogshead and told the foreman what he had been doing, I went and asked the prisoner why he took the prussian blue out of the box, he said he wanted to paint his house with it.</p>

I sent for a constable.</p>

            . I serve in Mr. Flint's shop. On the 9th of March the prisoner asked me to shew her some ribbon, I did, and cut her one yard and three quarters of black ribbon; she then asked for some coloured ribbon, I believe I cut her a yard of black ribbon, and then she asked me to measure a remnant, and when I had measured it, I saw her put a piece of ribbon under her gown on the counter, I said nothing to her, but went and told Mr. Flint of it, I did not see her take any black whatever.</p>

               <p>Q. As the women were gone, did Fallon ask his wife to get any more liquor. - A. Before they went he asked her to go and fetch something, the wife asked him what he wanted, Fallon said,</p>

               <p>"I told you to please yourself, why did not you go," the woman said,</p>
               <p>"you know very well I have spent all the money that you gave me," she said,</p>
               <p>"I don't care for you."</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any peculiar in her saying the words. - A. She spoke in a very saucy manner. After these words he struck her with his fist upon her head and once against her head, and then she fell down. She laid upon the ground about four minutes, I told Fallon he had better leave her if he could not live with her, he told me he would not touch her any more. She got up of her own accord, and Fallon sat down between her and me, I told Fallon that Nance had drank a drop too much, she jumped up at me and said something, I cannot recollect what, Fallon struck her upon her side with his fist, and she fell down in the corner, I told Fallon that I did not like that he should beat his wife. She laid a bit in the corner, and then got up again he struck her again, he was standing by her, and when she arose he struck her two or three times with his fist all over her body, she fell down again. The woman cried out,</p>
               <p>"do not my dear, do not kill me," something like that. When she got up he beat her down by the head, and when she was down he beat her about the head with his fist again, he hit her with his fist clenched very hard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to hit her with his full strength. - A. I think so, but I cannot tell. She got up again herself, he beat her again that she fell down upon the bed, he struck her upon her head, breast, and all about, and upon her body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman cry out this time. - A. She cried out,</p>
               <p>"do not my dear, do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try to interfere between them, - A. Yes, Fallon told me to let him alone, he fell down upon the bed at that time, and beat her while she was laying upon the bed, he struck her upon the breast and body. The woman got up upon the bed again, he beat her again, and she came down from the bed on the ground, Fallon beat her with his double fist the same as he had done before, she cried out,</p>
               <p>"do not kill me my dear Jemmy."</p>

               <p>Mr. Andrews. Why did you take hold of his arm. - A. I took hold of his arm two or three times before that to stop him beating her. I told him not to beat his wife so hard, he was sure of killing her, he pushed me down on the chair and told me to sit down or he would serve me the same, he put his fist in my face, I looked at the door to go out, and Fallon seeing me want to go out, put himself between me and the door to prevent me going. Fallon went to the other part of the room to beat his wife again, I opened the door and ran out to call assistance, I never saw any thing more after that.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had left the room what did you do. - A. I went up stairs and found three women standing there to hear the noise, I asked the women to come down to stop Fallon beating his wife, they did not come down, and there was a man, I asked the man, the man asked me whose wife it was, I said Fallon's wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after this, hear any noise down stairs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030020"/>- A. I heard her cry,</p>
               <p>"do not my dear," and the sound of blows.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it that the noise continued after you left the room. - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go back into Fallon's room that night. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Fallon stay all night with his wife. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After every thing was easy, did you sleep in the same room with him. - A. Yes, for that night I slept upon the stairs, I sat down upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you when you were upon the stairs, hear any noise in the room where Fallon and his wife was. - A. No, not a single word all the night after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into their room the next morning. - A. Yes, Mrs. Fallon was in bed, Fallon came out dressed in his drawers, I said,</p>
               <p>"you are easy now, you are friends after the battle," Fallon said, yes. I went to light the fire, I said,</p>
               <p>"Nance, how do you do to day," she told me she was very sore from the blows, and told me it was my fault, Fallon was in the room at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say why it was your fault. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you said any thing to provoke Fallon and his wife, for her to say it was your fault. - A. No.</p>

Yes, I told him I was very sorry that he should make such a riot in my house, and that he should use the poor woman in the manner that he had done, he said, he was very sorry, but it was his passion, I told him, at the time I did not know which I had best do, stay where I was or come down, he smiled at me, and said,</p>

               <p>"it was well I staid where I was, for if I had come down he would have served me the same, this was on the Sunday. On the Monday morning I sent for the doctor by the prisoner's desire, she continued ill untill she died, but I never heard of any danger, she complained of her side. On Sunday week about three o'clock in the afternoon she died. The day before she died the Welch woman Lewellin called me, she was casting up blood, I dare say she brought a quart full of blood up.</p>
               <p>Court. When the woman shewed you the whalebone what did she say. - A. She said that is what he was beating his wife with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you all the particulars of the beating. - A. No, she did not.</p>

On Saturday night I was awakened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030021"/>by the young woman Leweltin coming up to me and asking me to go and part them, I heard her crying out, I said I did not think the man was touching her, I was the other side of the house, she cried loud for me to hear her, I did not go down.</p>

Her bruises were black, they appeared to have arisen from very great violence, her face was black and swelled, I bled her, and at the time that she was bleeding the man came, he was very attentive, he waited upon me, held the bason to catch the blood, and after I had bled her he paid me. I told her as she was so very much bruised it was necessary for her to take something, he said if I thought it was necessary he would come and fetch it, he never did call for it. I called the next morning to know how she was, and to know why the medicine was not sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her. - A. I did not, untill the Saturday following, they sent for me, I found her exceeding ill, her pulse was very quick and exceeding weak, and she was very faint, she complained of a violent pain in her side, I examined it, and when I pressed her rib it gave her a great deal of pain, I had reason to believe that her ribs were broken, I applied a plaster to it. I was sent for on Sunday morning about seven o'clock, she was dying very fast, and by the side of her bed was a great quantitity of blood, they told me she had thrown up in the night.</p>
               <p>MR. READ. I am a surgeon, I opened the body of the deceased on the Tuesday, I examined the body first, there were several bruises, not that I considered of any consequence towards life. On tracing the course of the ribs on the left side I thought I perceived one or more was broken, and having been told that she had complained much of the side, I was induced to open the cavity of the chest, on doing this I discovered a very large quantity of blood effused in the cavity, and on further examination I found four of the lowest that we term false ribs broken, two of them had penetrated the membrane called the pleura.</p>
               <p>Q. The pleura lays at the cavity of the chest. - A. Yes, two of them had penetrated the membrane called the pleura, and indeed the lower and posterior part of the left lobe of the lungs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that any quantity of blood had issued from the lungs. - A. No doubt of that, the blood must have issued from the wound of the lungs, occasioned by the penetration of the rib.</p>
               <p>Q. Must a great deal of force have been used to have broken these ribs. - A. Most assuredly a considerable quantity of force must have been used to have broken these ribs.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it have been effected with a flat piece of whalebone. - A. Most assuredly not. The fracture of these ribs occasioned her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the examination of her body could you see any other cause. - A. Certainly not, every thing appeared to be perfectly healthy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. - MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY.</p>
               <p>In the awful situation I now stand, poor, and destitute of the means of obtaining the assistance of counsel, I feel it incumbent on me to submit to your attentive consideration, the substance of my defence in writing.</p>
               <p>On Friday the 8th of February, one day previous to this unhappy occurrence. I was discharged his Majesty's service by the Board at Chelsea College, on account of a liver complaint, and had that day only left the hospital, in which I was confined for the last three months. On the next day (the day stated in the indictment) two comrades visited me at my lodging, they staid and drank with me and my wife till past nine at night. We were joined at half past seven by two female servants from the Duke of York's school, who partook of porter and spirits with us until half past ten, when they took their departure. Soon after they had left us I asked my wife the reason of her bringing porter from the public-house instead of spirits, which I had ordered her to fetch with four glass tumblers. At this she instantly flew in a passion, words arose, and a violent quarrel took place. She told me she thought porter was quite sufficient for me, and upbraided me in very insulting language for presuming to send for liquor to make punch. I said to her, if any other person had requested her to bring the spirits and tumblers, there was no doubt but she would have readily brought them. She was rather intoxicated, and I myself was nearly tipsy, provoking words were used on both sides, and at length I slapped her in the face with my open hand. She sat down on the bed and cried, but quickly after got up and abused me in still more gross and irritating language, which urged me to chastise her again. I struck her several times with a small piece of whalebone which I found lying on the floor, such as women wear for a busk-bone, Mrs. Lewellin interfered, but I told her to sit down and say nothing, or probably I might serve her the same. My wife still continuing to provoke me, and my passion increasing in consequence thereof, I struck her again, when, striving to get from me she fell over a trunk that was placed on the floor. She complained of being hurt by the fall, and requested me not to beat her again, I replied I would not provided she would hold her tongue, she ceased scolding me for several minutes, and then began again calling me blackguard and other opprobious names which induced me again to have recourse to the whalebone. At this time a man on passing the door called out and said if we did not make less noise he would fetch the watchman, upon which I asked my wife if she heard what the man had just said, and if she would be quiet and say no more, she answered yes, and in a short time afterwards we retired to bed. On the next morning, (Sunday,) Mrs. Lewellin came into my room and found my wife and me in bed; she wished us both a good morning, and said she was glad to find us reconciled and in good humour.</p>
               <p>In the course of this morning my wife complained of being unwell, I asked her if I should send for a doctor that she might be bled, and she answered yes if I thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030022"/>proper, I immediately sent a boy for Mr. Lanskear, who attended himself in the course of an hour and bled her. I enquired of Mr. Lanskear his opinion of my wife's complaint, who told me he thought her in no danger; but if I would send to his house he would prepare some medicine for her. My wife, however, informing me she found relief from bleeding, and saying there was no occasion for any medicine, there was none got.</p>
               <p>I continued at home with my wife upon the most affectionate terms from the Saturday, when the lamentable quarrel took place, until the Friday following, when I told her I should go and seek after some employment, and return home on the Sunday week following. She said if it were not for her black eyes, that rather disfigured her, she would very gladly accompany me. At the time I left her, eighteen shillings was all the money I had; out of which sum I gave her eleven. I did not imagine when I left home my wife was in a dangerous state; she eat and drank as usual, and appeared cheerful. I returned home on the day promised; went to my lodging, enquired for my wife and was told by Mrs. Lewellin she was gone to another lodging. Shortly after I was taken into custody, informed that my wife was dead and buried, and that I was suspected of being the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury.</p>
               <p>Whether my dear unfortunate wife came by her death through my treatment or not, is now left for your impartial judgement; but this much I can most conscientiously affirm, that if blame be imputable to me, I had no intention to incur that blame at the time the melancholy quarrel took place. I had no malice in my heart: no premeditated design upon her life; on the contrary I loved her most dearly, nor have I ever ceased to mourn her premature and untimely end.</p>
               <p>Passionate, and given to abuse she certainly was - she had hers: - I too had mine. My passion, by her grossly abusive, provoking language, was wrought to an ungovernable pitch; and in that state, with my senses heated and bewildered by liquor. I unhappily did chastise her with the busk-bone, besides striking her, probably once or twice, with my hand. Whether she received any serious hurt from the fall over the trunk is not for me to say; but sure I am she first complained immediately after she fell. I was told when taken into custody that one or two of my wife's ribs had been broken; now if that be truth, is it not likely they were broke by her falling or stumbling over the trunk.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, if I had beat my wife with the degree of violence that made it reasonable for me to suppose her life was in danger, should I not have implored the assistance of the doctor when he came by my own order to bleed her. Had I been conscious of inflicting a deadly blow, should I have remained at home with her five days and five nights after the unfortunate affair happened; or if I had suspected danger should I have returned home to my lodgings at the time and in the manner I did.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lewellin the witness swore before the Magistrate my wife declared on her death bed she considered herself to blame, and that I would not have beat her at all had she held her tongue.</p>
               <p>The crime of murder I always held in the utmost abhorrence; and my conscience on the present most destressing occasion is perfectly tranquil, and fully acquits me of the offence I now stand charged with at the bar of this honourable tribunal.</p>
               <p>I have served my King and Country in the capacity of a private and as non-commissioned officer in the first batalion of the 62d Regiment for a period of ten years, with honour and credit, and if my health had permitted I should at this moment be fighting with my brave comrades the common enemy.</p>
               <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
               <p>I rest confident you will weigh in your minds with the most scrupulous attention the evidence this day adduced against me; that you will look at the cause and origin of the unhappy quarrel. My motives - the provocation: - the state of intoxication we both were in at the time. My conduct and anxiety the next day when I procured medical aid; the circumstance of my returning home on the precise day and hour I had promised, and the dying words of my dear unfortunate wife when she absolved me from blame.</p>
               <p>I entertain not the smallest doubt but that your verdict will meet the justice of the case; and with this persuasion on my mind, I shall bow with reverence, humility, and submission to your impartial decision.</p>

            . I am a servant to these gentlemen, on the 28th of February I received instructions to watch the prisoner, I marked certain brushes and placed them in the back warehouse under some baskets, I then returned into the front shop where the prisoner was, and requested him to take some corn fans into the back shop, and remove the baskets and put them into a proper place, which he did, and by so doing I was certain that the prisoner would see the brushes that I had placed there, he was gone long enough to accomplish what I told him, and came down into the front shop again, I immediately went into the warehouse and found all the brushes missing, I communicated it to Messrs. Francis and Barker. The prisoner was then sent out with a load, and as soon as he returned I went into the same room again and placed four other brushes that I had marked, I came down and took the prisoner with me up into the same room where I told him I wanted to look out certain articles, and that I would take part of the articles into the shop myself, and requested him to bring the remainder, he did, I went and missed three out of the four brushes of the second parcel, and those three brushes I saw on the 1st of March in possession of the officer. The prisoner I believe is a soldier in the guards.</p>

            . I keep a stand with hardware in Bishopsgate Street. About the begining of February, the prisoner asked me to buy four dozen and a half of shaving brushes, I offered him three shillings and sixpence for them, he agreed to take it and I bought them. About a week or ten days afterwards he asked me if I would buy any clothes brushes, I answered no, they were too cumbersome for me, I had some suspicion that he did not come honestly by the first brushes, and as soon I saw the officer I communicated my suspicion to him, he bid me to buy them and he would speak to the master about it. On the 28th of February the prisoner brought me two brushes, and on the 1st of March two more, and in the afternoon of the same day he brought five, and two pieces of spunge.</p>

I told him he must know what he had got behind, he then produced a butter boat and laid it on the table, this is the butter boat, I sent for an officer and took him in custody.</p>

I strongly suspect it was put into one of my pockets by one of the waiters out of joke or with design. I am totaly innocent of the charge. I have a wife and four children, and have always maintained them by honest industry.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you meet any one - A. A Portuguese, as I supposed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man - A. The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt - A. Not any. I am quite certain it was the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the wall - A. I had; we were both going one way; he apparently was first; when I came up I went between him and the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there room for you to go - A. Yes. He reeled or shoved against me sideways, and threw me against the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing to him - A. Not any thing When he reeled against me I said, holloa, shipmate, or messmate, I cannot say which, do not run a fellow down. I said nothing else to him. He talked something in his own language, but what I did not understand. I went from him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing further occurred at this time more than you have stated - A. Not any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received this shove how far were you from your own house - A. About thirty yards when this happened. I walked up the court to my own home, and when I got to my own home I heard a footstep coming up the court very quick and very light, I did not think it was the prisoner coming after me to do any thing to me, but directly I saw his right hand draw my right shoulder of the left side of my face.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the blow aimed at, and where did it take place - A. On the left side of my cheek, by my chin, it cut me very deep; I could put a finger in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. He cut you on the left cheek and chin - A. Yes, then he turned upon his heel and made his escape. He ran away, and I ran after him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him - A. Not any time. He ran into Wapping-street, and ran down into Gun-alley; he ran into the side door of the Gun public-house, I went into the house immediately after him, I called out, where is he, where is he who has cut me. I saw him in the house by the side of a little passage, just within a little kitchen, or washhouse, the passage door and kitchen joins together.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him just within the door of a little kitchen, was there any light in that room - A. Not any. There was no company where he was, he ran out again by me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw him run into the house, and you saw him within the door of the kitchen - in order to get there had he ran into the tap-room where the company was - A. He had not. I holloaed out stop him, and calling out, where is he. When I got in Mr. Watkins, a person that was in the house, he said, here he is. He ran violently out of the same door into Gun-alley again, I pursued him myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him before he was taken - A. No, I did not, except in running into the door. When he ran out of the

               <p>Q. When he ran into Gun-alley again did you call stop thief - A. I did; he was taken a little way off Gun dock, in Wapping-street, I saw him stopped and detained by Wood. I was then about a dozen yards from him when Wood stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite certain, upon your solemn oath that no provocation took place, except what you have stated - A. None at all, at any time whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. Were there other persons passing at the time - A. I saw not any.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a public place - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had not jostled him in the street - A. I am certain I did not. I was coming very seriously to my own home without touching him, or even looking at him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing in his hands - A. I saw something glistening as he came in, in his right hand, he seemed to wish to conceal it, coming by me, but turning round I had a sight of it. When he was against the wall, Lawrence the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030026"/>came in, he said, where is he, where is the man who has cut my face; I said, here he is; the prisoner dubbed himself down, and ran with his head down between Lawrence and me, and went out the same way.

On the evening of the 23d of February I was at my master's door between nine and ten o'clock, I heard the cry of stop thief, I observed the prisoner running along the street, from the Gun public-house; upon that I instantly caught him by the collar and stopped him. I observed him put his right hand to his pocket to take out something, it shined, I immediately caught at it and took it out of his hand; I kept it in my possession untill I gave it in the charge of the officer the same evening, and I delivered him up to the officer.</p>
               <p>MR. M'CARTHY. I am an officer of the Thames police. The prisoner was brought to our office on the 23d, about ten o'clock. I saw Lawrence, he was terribly cut, and this was delivered to me, a brass ink-stand case, with a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wood. Look at that - A. I believe it to be the same.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 23d of February, in the evening, did you examine the wound of the prosecutor - A. I did; the wound was about four inches in length, a deep wound, part of it on the inferior jaw, and part of it on the superior, it was in a semicircular direction; had the maxillare artery been cut there would have been a risk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it all pass over the maxillare artery - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at all cut - A. No, by no means; the maxillare artery was not cut, the wound was not so deep in the situation of the artery.</p>
               <p>Q. It would have caused death in all probability if it had cut the maxillare artery - A. Yes, there would have been a serious operation of taking up the coracoid artery, which is a doubtful operation.</p>
               <p>Q. With what sort of an instrument was it done - A. I cannot say. It could not be smaller than the knife I saw. I imagine that knife would have inflicted such a wound. I have no doubt it was done by a sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>COURT. The maxillare artery was in danger - Yes, which is a branch of the coracoid artery.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by taking up the coracoid artery - A. Passing a ligature of wax thread, and tying it.</p>
               <p>Q. That would stop the flow of blood - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That inkstand is not mine; I want to see it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Let him see it, do not let him have it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had an inkstand similar to this, the handle of the knife was on a small bit of iron. I recollect nothing of the affray, nor cutting any body with a knife. I found myself in prison all over mud, and my bones all over beat. I lodged a week at a public house, I wrote to the landlord of the public-house to come, he has not come.</p>

On the 19th of January, about eight o'clock in the evening, my wife went up stairs to see if all the doors were fast, I heard her cry out murder. I suspected there was more than should be, I went forward and locked the foredoor, in order to see who there were in the house, and on my going up stairs I met the prisoner coming down. I knew his person perfectly well, I do not know what occupation Driver is, he used to frequent my house. When he came down stairs I followed and shoved him into the parlour, and sat down upon a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to him by his name - A. Yes, and I went out to get a constable to take charge of him; the constable refused coming. I was detained sometime, and when I came back he was gone; he had made his escape through the parlour window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go up stairs - A. Yes; the sleeping-room door on the first floor was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he got into the house - A. The doors were open as usual, he had come in at the street door, and had walked up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the sleeping-room door was broken open, what was there taken out - A. A guinea, and a seven shilling-piece that was taken out of my desk that was broken open, and a little trunk was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen that guinea and seven shilling piece - A. I had not seen it perhaps for a week; the man got away, and was away a month or longer before he was taken up. I am confident that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner throw any thing away when you were taking him into the parlour - A. Yes, he put his hand into his pocket and threw away this bunch of keys. I did not know what it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030027"/>then. I saw him put his hand into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q What are these keys - A. They are skeleton keys.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask Mr. Reeves if he has never received any remuneration for the loss of his money, and the locks that were broken that night - A. One of his associates brought me a two pound note and begged me to take it; I said I could not take it onconsideration of stopping the prosecution. If he had brought me more I should have took it.</p>
               <p>Q What other view had you of taking it except stopping the prosecution - A. I took it, and I believe if he had brought more I should have took it.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember the night of the 19th of February going up stairs - A. I do. I found my chamber door open, I saw a glimmering light in the room on the bed, that light proceeded from a dark lanthorn; I saw my little red trunk that we put our tea spoons and tablespoons in. I saw that on the bed, towards the foot, two salts and two pepper castors, they all laid together, they were on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q What else did you lose - A. A guinea, a seven shilling piece, and a shilling, a pap-spoon and silver strainer. The pap spoon was part of the eight spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they worth altogether - A. I should think, between three and four pounds, without the guinea and seven shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. These things had been all removed, had they from their proper place - A. Yes, they had.</p>
               <p>Q. The guinea you did not see, nor the seven shilling piece - A. No, they were in a purse; the bag was left. The eight spoons were all on the bed, and the silver things, they were taken out of a little red trunk, and that was broken open, it was taken from under the head of the bed. I saw the prisoner looking over some papers, and all the books, to see if he could find any value, I suppose: I saw the prisoner and another man looking at them, the other man was not touching any thing, he was looking at them. I shut the door, and halloaed out murder, as loud as I could holloa out, with the door in my hand; these men came to the door to get out, they could not, I held it so tight; they burst the frame of the door, and shoved the door through; the prisoner came out first, I catched him by the collar; the other brushed by and got down stairs, and I saw no more of him; my husband was coming up stairs, and I saw the prisoner at the bottom of the stairs, I catched hold of him again, he said d - n your eyes, what do you want to stop me, have not I been endeavouring to assist you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention in what way he had been endeavouring to assist you - A. No other way than that; my husband took charge of him, and another man that was in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the guinea, and the seven shilling piece - A. I believe about three days before to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing here that you found upon the bed - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were eight spoons, was there a pair of salts, and a pair of pepper castors - A. Yes, and three table-spoons, and five tea-spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. The table-spoons are large spoons I suppose, what may they be worth - A. Between two and three pounds altogether. The three spoons I should not like to take two pounds for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then altogether they may be worth about two pounds - A. Yes. I cannot say particularly, they being old silver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask her whether she is certain that she was assisting Mr. Reeves in securing me - A. Yes, I held him while my husband and another man took and drove him into the parlour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you sure that when you went into this room that you recollect the features of this man by the light upon the bed - A. I am, he has been at our house frequently at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known him two or three years - A. No, not so long as that, about six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no sort of doubt about his person, have you - A. No, none at all. I have always said it was the same person.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is far from my intention of delaying the court, but it is a duty incumbent on me to impress on your lordships mind, and the jury, my innocence and that it is in my power to invalidate the evidence of Mrs. and Mr. Reeve; I had not been there five minutes when I heard an alarm, I thought it was fire. After the other man was apprehended I own one of the men said I was one of them; I said, am I not assisting you? I was never searched, nor never made a prisoner. I went voluntary into the parlour. Mr. Reeve has said I threw the picklock keys away, I never had them. I was not secured on the stairs, I was never beyond the bar-door, and with respect to the woman, by the glimmering light alone she could not observe my countenance. I can prove that she had no other light than the glimmering light till after the prisoners, whoever they were, were gone, and after that it is impossible, from the agitation of her mind to know the prisoners at all. Mr. Reeve said he had no other motive of putting him into the parlour, as he says, which he never did, as I was there, than to see whether I would suffer the prisoner to escape. Call

I instantly went down and told to Mr. Reeve, and told her that I had seen a suspicious person in the passage, Mrs. Reeve went up stairs, and I went into the tap-room, and within ten minutes I heard an outcry of my wife, crying murder, and Postan, calling me by name; I instantly ran to her assistance, I found a man coming down stairs within three or four steps of the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same man you had seen before - A. No, it was not. Whom I instantly collared, he tried as much strength as he had to get from me, but I held him so as I secured him, my wife was behind at the bottom of the stairs; my wife saw him drop a watch stolen out of Mrs. Reeve's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it yourself - A. No. I dragged this man into the tap room, and a man in the tap room said, do not choak him. I instantly loosed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that man was that you seized by the collar - A. I should know him if I were to see his face. He went into the parlour, I made an attempt to follow him, but by Mrs. Reeve telling me that I was not to go into the parlour, that there were gentlemen there to take care of him, I did not follow him. I instantly turned to Mr. Reeve, and said, I conceived there was a party concern. I saw in the parlour five or six gentlemen drinking brandy and water and rum and water to my knowledge; the room was not so large but I could see the man escape through the window, by the moving of the curtain, as I thought he did not come out the way that he went in, he was not present. I instantly ran to Mr. Reeve, who was at the outer door in the passage, and repeated these words. He was keeping the outer door that nobody could come in or out. I said, Mr. Reeve open the door instantly, the man that was confined in the room is escaped through the window.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw five or six people in the parlour - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had escaped while these five or six people were in the room - A. I positively do declare it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not make so much action, behave decent I hope you are perfectly sober - A. Perfectly sober. Mr. Reeve open the door instantly, for I can catch the man again; he made answer, do not make a noise, I know what I am about, and afterwards he opened the door and came into the tap-room, I asked him the reason why he would not open that door to me; he told me that he kept the prisoner in the parlour to see if Driver would let him escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Driver in the parlour - A. No, not when I missed the man to my knowledge. Mr. Reeve told me he left him along with Driver to see whether he would let him escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Driver in the parlour - A. No, I saw him in the tap-room. I spoke to Mrs. Reeve concerning her not letting me go into the parlour. When I saw the prisoner I saw him between me and the door adjoining the bar window. When I had hold of the man somebody accused the prisoner of being one of them, whom I know not, he he said, I am just come out of the parlour, father, am I not been assisting you in the best manner I can, meaning Mr. Reeve. He has been in the habit of calling him father, I have been informed by Mr. and Mrs. Reeve a twelvemonth before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Why they have not known him above six or seven months - A. They informed me that I heard a voice say in the tap-room, by whom I do not know, that Driver did come out of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at the time that the alarm was given - A. In the tap-room, and Mr. Reeve was in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr Reeve leave the bar at the same time that you did - A. I went out, and Mr. Reeve followed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Reeve assist in taking the man that you had hold of - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mr. Reeve at that time - A. With his back against the outer door, to prevent any one going out or coming in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did Mr. Reeve go up stairs - A. He did not, nobody but myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were you between the stairs and me at the time that you secured the man - A. The stairs were between me and you, you were against the door by the bar window.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first instance that you remarked me - A. When somebody accused you of being one of them, you said, I am coming out of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Reeve secure me - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consider me a prisoner at the time you put the man in the parlour - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. It does not matter what he considered you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever observe me obstruct you in your duty of taking the other man - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. You do not know any thing about the keys - A. I saw nothing of the keys until they were picked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lodged any time at that house - A. Only a fortnight, a week after this happened I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with this man - A. I never saw the man in my life, only during the time I lodged there; I do not lodge there now.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this business did you quit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030029"/>this house - A. That day week following. I was afraid of losing my life and property by people that resorted there.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this business was it that you saw the prisoner again - A. I saw him yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the first time that you have seen him since this transaction up to the present time - A. On Wednesday I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the first time since the 19th of January - A. Yes. I went to see a boy that was confined there that had burned clothes, a shopmate's son of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a witness upon that prosecution - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know there was a search about this man - A. I thought it was all done away by the money being paid.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not the person that offered the money, are you - A. No, God forbid.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he alone in the parlour - A. I believe there were more people in the parlour, I did not go in, nor into the tap-room; I did not see any body in the parlour; Mr. Reeve was with his back against the taproom door; my husband wanted to go out to go into the yard, because he said the man would escape through the parlour window; Mr. Reeves would not let him go, told him to be quiet, and as soon as Mr. Reeve had gone from the tap room door I picked up a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs Reeve. Had you lost a watch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Postan. I picked up a watch and an iron crow, and the handle of the tap-room door.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you take them up into your room for - A. Because I had left the babe crying in the cradle. Mrs. Reeve said to the servant, I have lost a guinea, a seven shilling piece, and your master's watch; I went to her, I said, you shall have the watch, I have got it; she came into my room, and I delivered her the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever hear Mrs. Reeve make any remarks respecting of her agitation of mind - A. She said she was so very much in a fright she did not know who the man was; she said so that night.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my box is against the large china manufactory in Fleet-street, my beat leads into Bride-lane. I went down Bride-lane calling the hour of one, and returning back I saw Mr. Dodd, and I saw three ladies, whom I knew perfectly well, Smith, Powell, and another; Mr. Dodd appeared to me to be wanting to pass along, two of them had got him up against the shutter, I ordered them to disperse.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the two that had got him up against the shutter - A. Powell, and the one that is not here. This was about two doors from Bride-lane. Smith was standing just at the corner of Bride-lane, against the post, and as this gentleman extricated himself from the other two she laid hold of him as he passed along; he appeared to me to wish to extricate him to pass; she is a lusty woman, and he a slight man; she was too powerful for him, she pushed him down Bride-lane, and was followed by Powell; when he got five or six paces down Bride-lane he called out watch, I have lost my watch. I kept following them down, I expected to be given charge of them; he pursued them untill he got to the corner of a passage that leads into Bridge-street, there he secured her, and I took her in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other woman with her - A. Powell was the only person that passed down Bride-lane, she passed them and kept running along, never stopped, but went into Bridge-street; she was taken into custody by a watchman, upon hearing the cry of stop her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watch ever found - A. No, not as I know off; the watchman that took her in custody took her down to the watchhouse, he knew nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Powell before - A. I knew her person very well, and I knew Smith perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You did not know the prosecutor before, did you - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. This was one o'clock in the morning - A. I dare say it was half past one at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes you have seen young men in the street freshish at that hour - A. I have, too many of them, it did not appear to me that he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe that the watch has never been found - A. I do believe that the prosecutor, nor any person here knows any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Your watch had a chain and seals to it - A. Yes. I never found them again.</p>

I looked over the curtain and saw a man sitting in a chair. One part of the shop is divided off, and the window looks into her bed room. I saw a man sitting in a chair, most terribly intoxicated; a a very rough and dirty looking fellow. I just touched his breast, and said, who are you, where did you come from, what do you do here; he repeated my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030031"/>words, and said, what do you do here; I will let you know about that, I replied. I went to the door, shut the street door, double locked it, and left the key in, and get two watchman; I left them in the house, I returned with two watchmen; the man was taken in custody; I called the prisoner, she came up out of the cellar. I told the watchman to take her in custody, they took her to St. Bride's watchhouse. I gave charge of the man for being in my house at an unseasonable time, and as to her I could hardly tell what to say, I had lost a great deal of property, sheets, table linen, my shirts changed, others inferior placed for them.

               <p>Q. Had you lost your keys - A. I had, and the three keys found upon her was mine, which she had positively denied ever seeing. I then asked her if she would give me up the accomplice I would take the linen home myself, which she refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the duplicates that were found upon her was there any thing that turned out to be yours - A. One sheet, and that duplicate was found on her in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she afterwards say any thing else on the subject - A. No, she took it with a deal of fortitude, and refused that clemency I had offered her.</p>


               <p>Q. These keys that I had found upon her were yours - A. Yes, they are keys of a book case, and secretary, and a drawer that served as a wardrobe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any business with these keys, or did you trust her with them - A. I never trusted her with them; I have never given her any key to open any place; I generally kept these keys in the buffet, or behind the book case.</p>

I am a marshalman; I was in Mr. Adams's house at the time the last witness came in with Mr. Adams's sister, she told me there was a piece of work in the street; I went out immediately, I got into the middle of the bustle, there were twenty or thirty people there; the woman did not know me, she was loth to give up the man; the neighbours said they knew me, and then she delivered him up. The prisoner wished me to be delicate, said he would not run away, he had a deal to say for himself, he pitied the boys loss; he seemed to say that he was not such a character as to do such a thing. I told the boy not to be frightened, and told the prisoner to come a little higher up, I knew there was a public-house, and I should not loose him. I should hold him. The neighbours came with me, the woman and the boy; the child was alarmed. I set him on the taproom table, told him nobody should hurt him; he told me the same as he has told your lordship now, and as correct; the prisoner was full of talk, I searched him, in one of his pockets I found this clasp knife open I told him when I had clasp knives I generally had them shut; he said he did not know how it came open; I asked him what trade he was; he said he was learning one with his uncle, his uncle was a bag maker. He said before the Alderman that he had been to taken at party to the Liverpool coach; I asked the bookkeeper, every thing that he said was false; he said his employment lived in the City gardens.</p>

On the 4th of March a few minutes before twelve, I was on duty watching the dock, I went over this bridge, I saw four persons on the pier-head, in a craft, they seemed to be busy engaged, it was a moon-light night, I met Covey at the foot of the bridge; I then went for assistance; in my course to the pier-head I met Ellis, Robinson, and Hanover; we went through a narrow passage, I saw two men on the pier-head, about twenty or thirty feet from the Thames; one of the men I saw is Coombs; I asked them what they were doing, a voice answered nothing; they came towards us, and we advanced towards them; I then asked them what they were, and what business they had there at that hour of the night; they made no reply; myself and Robinson went to the spot where they came from, there we found these eleven bladders containing thirteen gallons of rum, the black bags, four empty bladders, and pump and a claw hammer; we took Coombs, I asked him who he was; he made no reply. The other man ran away round the pier head, into a timber yard, and I lost sight of him. We took Coombs into the guard house, and I lodged him in the care of the serjeant of the guards; Coombs said in the guard-house that he was a taylor, that he came there after a bill that Rawlinson owed him. On Friday night, the 8th of March, Eddis and myself were going down on duty to the West India Docks, we met the prisoner Neale.</p>
               <p>Q. You, I believe, did not know him - A. No, I did not; Ellis knew him, he said he was the person that made his escape from us the over night, he immediately took him by the collar, I assisted, and as we were conducting him to the guard-house on a sudden he twisted and got away from us; I ran after him, he ran about forty or fifty yards before I overtook him. We secured Neale.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me at the time that you first saw the four men at the pier-head that there was a craft laying there - A. Yes, and when I got down to the pier-head it was gone.</p>

            . I am an established Excise watchman. On the 4th of March I was applied to by Ellis to go and assist Barber; I went with him to the pier-head, I observed two men standing up by the wall, where these goods were afterwards found; upon going on the pier head they came towards us slowly; Mr. Barber asked them what they were doing, one of the men said, nothing; Coombs was taken in custody; I and Barber went to look to see if we could find any thing, I called to Hanover that we had found the goods, and upon my calling out one of the men run towards the fence, that divides Mr. Curlings premises from the dock; no person could get in there that was a stranger; I went with Coombs to the guard room, I asked him if he belonged to the revenue; he said, no, he was an extra tide waiter, he had the misfortune to lose it; he said he came down to the pier-head to get a bill of seventeen shillings and sixpence of a man of the name of Rawlinson. I know a gentleman of the name of Rawlinson, a lighterman, I cannot say whether it is the same. There is no house on the pier head.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the curiosity to go and see the place by which the man escaped - A. I did; he escaped round the corner of the post.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go the next day after this for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was any deficiency of the rum - A. I did. I went on the 5th, and the deficiency was eight gallons in six casks, on board the Jonathan; I found spills in the bulge of the casks, which were for the purpose of drawing the liquor out. I made allowance for the samples.</p>

I asked her if she was a married woman; she said she was not, but she lived with a person of the name of Smith, she went as his wife, but she was not married to him. On the Monday morning I went to this house in Snow's-fields, No. 12, on searching it there appeared to be in a room at the back of the shop, better than a quarter of a pound of tea, and about two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030035"/>pound of moist sugar.

               <p>Q Look at that note, and see if that is the note she offered to you - A. It is. I asked her what her name was, she told me Brown; I then wrote Mrs. Brown on it. I am sure it the note that I received from her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. to Mr. Lee. Is the note of the same plate charged in the indictment - A. It is not from the same plate, it is in the same writing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say it is the same writing you form a comparison with the note that is produced - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no knowledge of the hand-writing - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Clark. The hand-writing on the front of the note Mrs. Brown was written by you Mrs. Clark - A. Yes, at the time I took it I thought it was bad, but I was not certain. I wrote that before I gave her the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever write upon any other note the name of Brown - A. No, not exactly at that time. I did not put it out of my hand until I wrote the name of Brown upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Attend to my question - you have wrote the name of Brown upon other notes, have not you, it is a common name - A. I do not know that I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with this note after you had written Brown upon it - A. I put it along with other notes I had in the house to send to the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said at the time you took it you thought it was bad - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you that come forward to prosecute a poor woman you put it along with other notes to give it to an honest tradesman - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not I understand you to say that you put it along with other notes that you had to send to the bankers - A. We had a bill to pay the next day, it was put along with them; the bankers clerk came the next day, he had it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell the bankers clerk that it was forged - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. Is that your handwriting - A. It is.</p>

I think it was the 8th of March, she asked for a pound of plumbs and a pound of currants, I had but half a pound in the house, and a pound of sugar; my daughter reckoned it up, and signed the note; the prisoner said, before I give you the trouble to weigh the plumbs can you give me change of a one pound note; I said I would see; I called my daughter, I took the note of the prisoner and looked at it, I thought it felt thicker than bank notes generally feel; the note I received from the prisoner I gave to my daughter, and in the prisoner's hearing I said I could not see the watermark plain. I was almost afraid of it. My daughter marked it in my presence. I asked the prisoner her name and address; she told me,

            . I live at No. 12, Meeting-house Walk, Snows Fields. The woman at the bar lived with me as my wife, she has four small children; I keep a chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect her being taken in custody on Saturday night on this charge of forgery - A. Yes. On the Saturday night I took the baby in a blanket to her in Bow-street, because a friend came forward. I gave her the note, I took it in the shop for a loaf of bread, a bit of cheese and bacon; I gave her the note and told her to buy meat, sugar, and tea, and what we wanted, and on Monday I came forward at Bow-street and said I gave her the note. I thought if there was any danger I would take it all upon myself. I gave the officer leave to search my premises. The sugar and tea was not brought home; on the Sunday morning I had none, I said to Mr.

             I'had no tea and sugar; he said he had some, I was welcome to it, he furnished me with some. I lived in Northumberland-court near seven years, she had a brother a coalmerchant that lived in Northumberland-street. Northumberland-street and Northumberland-court are connected together; the prisoner was well known there as the sister of Mr. Dell.</p>

               <p>Q. After she and you came to live together how long did you live in Northumberland-court with her - A. Near seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it that you lived in Northumberland-court - A. More than two years.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at Bow-street were you in custody - A. I was no otherways in custody; I went forward myself, I waited to see if they had got any thing against me. I was ready, and then I was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mrs. Clark and Mrs. Warner - A. I saw that lady to-day in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. In the Lord Mayor's parlour - A. I do not know the name of the room. I saw them under the roof of this court; I went in along with the prisoner's sister, I asked them if they knew this woman; they said they did not know much of this woman; I said it was a hard matter to swear a thing unless they were sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the solemn oath you have taken now did not you take the prisoner's sister into the Lord Mayor's parlour, where the bank witnesses were, in hopes that they would be able to say they were one like the other - A. I did not take the sister, she was against the door at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that the object - A. It was not. Mr. Bellis was in there, and I went in to speak to him; Mr. Bellis called me of one side, he asked me to speak the truth if I knew any thing. I said I was an innocent man, I knew nothing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Mr. Bellis is the attorney of the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was in the Lord Mayor's parlour - did you see him there - A. He was in one of the rooms. He is the solicitor for the prisoner; he said, if I knew any thing against the prisoner to speak the truth, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. And all that did pass from you to these women was you asking them whether they knew the sister before or not - A. I said, do you know this woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she pretty much about her age - A. No, she is older; I asked them if they knew this face.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was your reason for asking them if they knew this face, is it like the prisoner's - A. No, not exactly. I did not know there was any harm of it.</p>

I had seen the shoes a few minutes before they came in.</p>

            . Q. You are one of the Marshalmen of the City of London. - A. Yes, on the 25th of February, I was in the top shop of Mr. Adams' shop, I went there after I had my breakfast, there was nobody there but the prisoner and his son, I went about half after eight, and about eleven I had done all what I had to do, I went to look for some salt petre and charcoal that I had hid behind a door were there was three or four shelves and very dark, I put my right hand in to feel for the salt petre, and at the very extent of the shelf was this parcel that I hold in my hand with a great piece of loose mortar clapped against it close to the wall, I found it heavy, I looked at it, and to my surprise I found it was silver, it struck me whose silver cuttings it was, I thought it was Latham's I put in the corner again, and acquainted Mr. Adams what I had found, it was then half past eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information that you received did you go to the prisoners lodgings. - A. I did the same night, near eleven o'clock, when I went there the prisoner was absent, and after making the best of it that was advisable not to frighten the woman, I said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030039"/>she had better send for the man, and when the man came Mr. Adams said he had come upon a disagreeable business, he wanted his own he said to the prisoner, be so good as to let me have that parcel of silver that you took from behind the door, he said you shall have it, it is here, do not hurt me, and I hope you will have mercy upon me for the sake of my family, I lit another candle and went towards the bureau, and when I was going towards it the prisoner said it is there, it is up in the corner, when it was opened Latham said it was his silver in his presence, he meant what silver he had worked upon, Latham said he was a bad man for taking his silver, if you must take it why not take your own as he might have got into trouble, he begged of me and Latham to intercede for him, I took him to the compter that night, I weighed the silver it is nine ounces, is is thirty-nine shillings in the indictment, it is worth forty-nine shillings, I said you have a key, no man can take such a quantity without having a key, because it is put through a hole, he said I have no key, I took it at several times.</p>
               <p>Court. Q (To Mr. Adams) How did this man behave himself. - A. He neglected his work, he had three pounds on Saturday night, borrowed a pound of me on the Monday, he had goods of me that made it up five pounds, and then he took away these nine ounces of silver.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

            . On the 15th of March I went with Mrs. Macey and another officer, went with a search warrant to Madden's house No. 6, Brackley Street, Golden Lane, we found a little girl there, the man and woman was not at home, Mrs. Macey picked out three aprons, a sheet, a pair of drawers, a pocket handkerchief, a neck handkerchief, and this she said was the bag that the clothes were in, it is not a bag now, we went up stairs and searched in the two pair of stairs room, there we found this basket under the bed, and in a box six shirts, four neck handkerchiefs, a silk handkerchief, and a pair of drawers. And at the next door a woman had got some things to wash, the woman is here, there we found two shirts, one pocket and one neck handkerchief, which the woman said she had of Mrs. Madden to wash on the 29th. I apprehended Madden and his Wife at the two blue posts Bartholomew Close, we were looking after them from that time to then, I told them what I took them in custody for, she said what do you take the man in custody for, he has done nothing, I said I could not help it, I should take them both in custody, she said I have lived with him a number of years, and have a number of children by him, he knew nothing of it, and she was not his wife. I took them both to the compter.</p>

On the 6th of March the prisoner Hunt brought me a hunting watch, I was then standing in the tap-room; he said, Mr. Taylor, I have bought a watch for a silver gilt hunting watch, he said, I am not a judge of a watch, I wish you would take it and know what it is, and what is the value of it; he had bought it of a man that wanted a little money to pay for a suit of clothes, and shewed him a bill; he said he knew the man by sight by attending at different inns.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say when he bought it - A. No I told him I would ascertain the value of it, and I would speak to Salmon, an officer, whom he well knew; he said, very well, I wish you would shew it to any person that you like. On the next day, Thursday, I sent to the pawnbroker to know the value of the watch, be sent me word that it was a gold watch, and the value of it was ten pounds. I saw Hunt on the Friday morning, he said, let it be what it may I bought it honestly, I assure you; he expressed his doubts of the watch on the Friday; he said he knew the man when he saw him, but he had not seen him since; he said, if the watch was gold it was a watch that he did not want; he would change it for a good silver watch, and one that kept time, and a one pound note, being a mail coachman time was all that he wanted it for. On the same day I acquainted Salmon all that passed from Hunt. Salmon took the watch and went to the office to examine it. The prisoner was taken up on the Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again between the Friday and the Tuesday - A. Yes, on the Friday the prisoner told me he was not in an hurry about the watch, he should see me again on the Tuesday following. The prisoner called on the Sunday to know if I had done any thing with the watch, or if any enquiry had been made respecting it; for the last journey on the road he had heard that there was a parcel missing, and in that parcel was a gold watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about any seals - A. No, he was afraid that that watch might turn out to be the watch that he bought. I told him that Salmon had the watch, and had examined the books at Bow-street of stolen and lost property, and it had not at that time been advertised, he had better see Mr. Salmon, a lodger of mine; he immediately upon that went into Salmon's apartment and was with him some time. The man went out with his coach that night. I have known him nigh twenty months, he always bore a good character. I never heard any thing to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Hunt - A. Yes, I apprehended him on the 12th of March, at the Inn-yard, Charing Cross. This is the watch, it was given me by Mr. Taylor, the last witness. On the Sunday I saw the prisoner at Mr. Taylor's house, where I live; he was sent to me. I was ill a-bed when he came; he said he came respecting the watch, there was a parcel lost, and among the rest there was a gold hunting watch lost; he said he bought it of a man of the name of long George or long Jack, he was a person that worked occasionally at Charing Cross, as a porter. I said I was very ill, I would get up; I dressed myself, and went with him; I proposed that I would wait in St. Martin's-lane, that he should go to the yard to see whether he could see him, and I would come and take him up; he seemed so much alarmed it struck me that he was some way concerned in it. When he went in at one gateway I went round the other. I was there speaking to one of the bookkeepers, and he was there telling the case to the clerk, which I did not suppose he would have done. Hunt went with the coach to the Swan and Two Necks, and I went there about this man, Long Jack, or Long George, the porter: he went in and spoke to the publican at the bar; I could not learn that he knew any thing of him; he went out with the mail that night.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Hunt accuse you of having sold him a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030042"/>gold watch - A. I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that watch, and tell me whether you ever sold him that gold watch - A. I never sold any watch to any body. I have not seen a gold watch for this twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Gooch. Look at that watch, is that the watch that was made by your father and sold to Mr. Bennett - A. It was. It is a new watch, it was charged in the bill sixteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Wright. I am certain this is the watch. I am confident it is the same seal that Mr. Bennet sent Mr. Gooch. I sent the seal back, it was put in the parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. to Salmon. On the day that Hunt was examined at Bow-street, were you there - A. Yes, Mr. Thomas was the clerk.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS. Q. You are one of the assistants of the magistrate - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the examination of the prisoner, and see whether the statement of the prisoner was taken down by you - A. Yes, it is. (Read.)</p>
               <p>"On Monday was a week, about a quarter before eight o'clock, he was at a public-house near the Swan and Two Necks Lad-lane, when a man known by the name of Long Jack, asked the examinant to buy the watch, which he said was a silver gilt watch. Jack pressed me to do it, he offered it for three guineas and a half. Examinant gave him two pounds ten shillings, and told him to meet him the following morning at the White Hart. Examinant went there on the following morning, Jack was not there, nor has he ever seen him since."</p>
               <p>Q. Was any man produced of the name of Coterell - A. There was a man, I think I should know him again, he was a little man; I do not recollect his name, at the desire of the prisoner he was brought forth. To the best of my recollection the man said he saw him pay two pound ten shillings to Long Jack, he understood it was for a watch; he at first said he saw the watch, upon being questioned again he said he did not see it, only the prisoner said it was for a watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I was there. Do you mean to state that the man said he could not state whether it was a watch or no, but it was something yellow - A. First of all he did, and again he said he saw no watch at all, and again he said it was two dollars and a bank note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 4th of March I had finished loading my coach at the Swan and Two Necks, Lad-lane, and had a glass of porter, while drinking it I was accosted by a man that I had seen as porter, he offered me a watch, he said it was a silver gilt hunting watch, I should have it for five guineas; I said I did not want a watch of that cost. I treated him. Mrs. Walter said he should have treated me, not I him. He came to the door with me and asked me what was the most that I would give for the watch and small seal that was attached to it; I replied three guineas and a half, and I was to buy the watch; I had not money enough about me; I went to Lombard-street, he followed me; he said I should have the watch and small seal, he would take what money I had; I engaged to pay him the remainer at the White Hart on the Wednesday morning. On Wednesday I stopped at the White Hart, no one had been enquiring for me, I went to the White Hart again, and finding no man had been there it raised my suspicion that it had not been honestly obtained, which induced me to take the watch to Mr. Taylor, knowing his house was frequented with Bow-street officers. I likewise went to Salmon of my own accord to make these enquiries to and the man that I bought the watch of; I humbly request you will perceive that what I have done will shew the purity of my enquiries. Had I been guilty I should not have taken these measures that would lead to my detection.</p>

               <p>COURT. How do you know that - A. Because I saw it. I saw the watch, it was a yellow watch; Mr. Hunt paid the man two one pound notes and two dollars; I heard him say that he was to meet him on the following Wednesday morning, and to receive the remainder part of the money, at the White Hart in the Strand As for the sum he was to give for the watch I do not know; he was just going to pay for the watch as I was going by.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to stop - A. I was passing by, that is the way I came to stop. I said, Mr. Hunt, how do you do. They had bargained what he was to give for it before I came up.</p>

               <p>Q. Be cautious what you say and speak nothing but the truth, it is of importance that you should do so. In the first place you have called God to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030043"/>witness that you will speak nothing but the truth, in the next place the administration of justice requires it. If you speak that which is not true you are liable to be transported for perjury, therefore it is important that you should speak the truth.

               <p>Q. You were close to him, and close by the man - A. Yes; he was a tall thin man, with a fustian jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at Marriott, is that the man - A. That is not the man, I will swear positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man tall like that man - A. He was a tall man, I did not take particular notice of his face, he was a tall man; I do not think he was that man.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sworn positively that was not the man - A. Yes, that was not the man, it was a tall thin man.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sworn that you were there three or four minutes before the money was paid, what were they talking about - A. I do not particularly recollect the words; Mr. Hunt looked at the watch, he opened it, all that I saw it was a yellow watch. I am pretty sure there was no glass about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner looked at it did he ask him what price - A. I did not hear him ask the price; I only saw him take the watch and look at it.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you say at Bow-street that you never saw a watch - A. It was a watch. I said at Bow-street it was a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say at Bow-street that it was a watch - A. It was a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Attend. Recollect, if you do not give a direct answer to a direct question I shall send you to Newgate. The question I put to you is, when you were at Bow-street did you swear that you saw a watch at the time that this man was in company with the other person - A. I forget what I might say there.</p>
               <p>Q. You were upon your oath, you are now upon your oath, did you swear it was a watch then - A. It was a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. I tell you I will send you to Newgate if you do not give a direct answer. Upon your oath did not you at Bow-street swear that you did not see a watch, it was something yellow, and there are two witnesses here, and more that were present, and if you do not speak according to the truth I shall order you to be committed for perjury - A. It was a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have an answer. Did not you at Bow-street swear that you did not see a watch on that day - A. I do not recollect that I did not see a watch there.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you oath did not you swear that you could not tell whether it was a watch or no - A. I could not swear what a kind of a watch it was, it was a yellow watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been grossly prevaricating. I ask you when you were upon your oath at Bow-street did not you say you could not swear whether it was a watch or no, it was something yellow - A. It was a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not the question. Did not you swear that you could not tell that there was a watch there at the time, and I tell you here is Mr. Thomas who took your examination - A. There was a yellow watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. He has said at Bow-street once that it was a watch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you swear at Bow-street that you saw a watch in Lombard-street - A. Not the second time at Bow-street. I did not take my oath the second time at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you sworn the second time at Bow-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you took your oath.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Are you the person that was in the habit of riding behind that mail - A. I have, before now, I was behind that very morning; I was going to my work. Mr. Salmon was behind himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had you behind that mail, has not the guard turned you off - A. I have never been turned off, nor flogged off.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Hunt - A. About a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. I will now ask you whether at Bow-street you did not say that Hunt paid him in part shillings - A. I said two pound ten; I will not be positive about saying shillings. It was two one pound notes and two dollars. It was not paid in shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say at Bow-street any of the money was in shillings - A. I might.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 28th of February, about one o'clock, the two prisoners came into the shop under pretence of purchasing a watch; I shewed them several; they kept me constantly employed a considerable time, and at last declined purchasing. While they were going out of the shop I missed a watch, which one of the prisoners had just before in his hand; I did not suspect their honesty, kept looking about, and found it was gone. I then supposed the men were gone too far, that it was impossible for me to overtake them.</p>

I put the gallon of Hollands gin into bottles, and sealed them, put them into a basket. I then gave him change for a two pound note and gave him the liquor to carry The gin came to twenty-eight shillings; I gave him twelve shillings in silver, he went away with it and returned in a quarter of an hour: he said, the captain desired change for a ten pound note, he was going out of town immediately. I gave him six one pound bank notes, a two pound note, and twelve shillings that he had before made up the change for a ten pound note; he went away with the change, and did not return. I communicated it to the officer, and he was apprehended. I enquired at the house and found that no such person as Captain Lewis lived there, he had three weeks before; I went to Houndsditch and enquired for Mr. Mason, I could not find any such person lived there.</p>

            . The magistrate bound me over on account of being in danger of my life, to appear against him next sessions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The indictment for which I now stand charged I am innocent of. On that evening I had occasion to pass Brook-street, Holborn, to a shoemaker to get a pair of boots; after I had passed Mr. Burnham nigh the distance of ten yards I was collared by him, and accused of picking his pocket of a pocket book; he said, you have not picked my pocket, but in point of law it is the same; I will prosecute you. He called the watchman, and then stated that I had not robbed him, but made the attempt. I was held to bail, two in forty pound each, and myself in eighty pound. I attended at Hicks' Hall, when a bill was found against me for a misdemeanor. I was informed on the Thursday that a bill was found against me for a felony. I am aware of the unfortunate situation I am placed in, and the evidence, Maxtead, was a witness against me. I am charged of stabbing him; when I was confined in my bed at Hatton Garden I said I would ring his ears, for which I was bailed. I am likewise in an unfortunate situation, not having the benefit of counsel. I hope for your candid and impartial verdict.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. to prosecutor. Are you sure that the prisoner had got your pocket book in his hand - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>

I immediately went up to her, I said you have got a piece of leather; she said, no; I said, you have, I saw you put it in. She at last took one of these pieces of leather from her petticoat; I said you have more; she said, no, I have not. I put my hand into the hole of the petticoat, and pulled out four more; these are them, they are my master's property.</p>

               <p>JOHN BULL. I was at work at this building. About eight o'clock the 11th of March, as I was going by the building, I heard a noise in the kitchen, I stepped over the garden wall, I saw the prisoner pulling a story post out of the kitchen window; I said, halloa, what are you about; he dropped it and ran off. I pursued him, and never lost sight of him untill I took him. He acknowledged that he was going to take it to a timber-yard in the Curtain-road to sell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He never saw me do it. I went into the building to do my occasion.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my beat is in Bruton Crescent, near the New-road, Somers Town. On the 20th of February, about seven in the evening, I stopped the prisoner, he had four pieces of pipe on his shoulder, I found afterwards it was twenty-one feet. I asked him where he was going; he said he was a master-man, he was going home with it to No. 7, Norton-street, Fitzroy-square. I said, you must go with me to the watchhouse; he said, suppose I take you to where I am doing the job. I said, that would be as well. He took me to the Norfolk Arms in Leigh-street with this property; he went into the bar, he said, let me leave this here, the watchman has detained me; I suspected he was employed by that publican, Mr. Hill to do the job; I let him go, and as we were coming out I had suspicion that it was stolen. I went to Mr. Stiles, one of the commissioners, he took me to Mr. Clarke's, and after that I went with Mr. Clark to the prisoner's lodgings in Cleveland-street.</p>

            . I am a labourer to Mr. Clark; the prisoner and I were employed at Mr. Paine's houses; I left work at six o'clock, the prisoner told me to go home, as he had a friend to meet at Mr. Hill's public-house. I left some leaden pipe in the back parlour, the prisoner had the key of the room to lock the lead up. On the next morning I heard that he was taken up, I went to the house and missed the lead; I was afterwards shewn the lead that was taken from the prisoner, it was the same lead to all appearance that was left in the back parlour, about twenty-one feet.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of this lead - A. I pay seventeen shillings for it. That is the kind of lead I employed the prisoner to fit up this house with.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see this house in a state of security, before any lead was taken from it - A. Last Monday, about ten o'clock, when I went to bed, it was all safe. I live in the house; the next morning, a little before eight, my servant came and told me that the pipe was gone from the cistern; I went and found from eight to ten feet of leaden pipe was gone, it was torn from off the front area. The watchhouse keeper brought the lead to match it with the cistern, it appeared to be torn off the cistern, it is worth two shillings.</p>
               <p>- SEDDONS. I am a watchman. In the morning, a quarter before one, I was going up North Baker-street, I stopped the prisoner, he had got a bag upon his back; I asked him what he had got in it; he said, working tools. I laid hold of the bag, it was heavy. I told him it was no thoroughfare. I examined the bag, it contained lead; I took him and the lead to the watchhouse; he resisted when I laid hold of him, but when there were two he was quiet. I found the top of the prisoner's hat in the area, it fitted his hat.</p>

One of them is well supported and connected with a captain in the West Indies.

At the same time the prisoners Healy and Smith ran by me; I observed that an attempt had been made at my pocket, and determined to walk slow that we might observe them. When we reached Mr. Cato's the two prisoners were looking and appearing to make some observation on the birds in the window, which caught my particular attention; I expected a probability of being attacked again, and therefore it put me on my guard. I am confident they were the same men. When we had proceeded as far as the Swan gateway on Holborn bridge I felt again a second attempt, much more severe than the first, and a man's hand at the mouth of my pocket; I do not say it was his, it may have been his. I applied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030051"/>my hand to my pocket, held my handkerchief tight, the same moment the two prisoners ran by me a second time, I had only a few paces to go after them. I left my wife and went after them, I was determined I would take them; they went into George-court, when I came to the end of the court I surprised them, and they ran; I ran after them, and in consequence of a cart loading or unloading at the top of the yard they escaped by getting under the horses bellies, and ran down Chick-lane; I pursued them to a narrow passage that leads to the entrance of Chick-lane, but from prudent motives I thought it best to retire.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen them before - A. I knew their faces perfectly well, we lost some goods a few days before. Their persons were very familiar to me, I have no doubt of their persons.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Sepulchre's parish. On the 11th of February, about half past six in the evening, Mr. Lutwych came to my house, I went with him in search of the two prisoners. In Holborn, opposite of Field-lane, I saw two men standing close together, as if they were waiting for something; Mr. Lutwych said, here they are; I laid hold of one, and he the other. As we were conveying them to the Poultry Compter I kept looking behind me, in the middle of Cheapside I missed Mr. Lutwych, I conveyed my prisoner in, I went to see for Mr. Lutwych, he said he would deliver his prisoner up to me, he had endeavoured to make a rescue, and when he found he could not he accused him of being one of the Vere-street gang. I then conveyed Healy to the counter, and there Mr. Lutwych said, that is the man that accused me of being one of the Vere-street gang; he replied, I do not doubt but you are one; he put his hand to his backside, made use of a bad expression, and said he might kiss his backside. I searched Healy, I found two knives about him; this is a French knife, he said his father gave him that knife, he used it to cut cows tails.</p>
               <p>MR. LUTWYCH. In consequence of our having lost the goods some days before I followed them into George-yard, and there I thought fit to retire, but thinking it was my duty to take them if I could I went to Warrell, it was getting darkish; we went down Saffron Hill, to the extremity of Field-lane, by Mr. Cato's; I saw the prisoners, I immediately seized them both; Smith I gave to Warrall, and the other I took myself; in Skinner-street he was very troublesome, he wanted me to strike him; I told him I would not. When we came as far as Newgate market he taxed me with indecent liberties, I told him if he said any more about it I would knock him down, but I did not strike him; in Cheapside he would not go on any further he said; I made him go on; bye and bye he said I belonged to the Vere-street gang. I asked one gentleman to assist me in taking this man, when the charge was given by Healy that I was one of the Vere-street gang they all shrunk; if he had had any of his accomplices about him I do not know the consequence. I said, let me be what I will, go you shall, and in the presence of Warrall, when he came, he then accused me of being one of the Vere-street gang.</p>
