About two o'clock in the day I heard a noise in the prisoner's room—I saw her throwing things out of the window—the prosecutor came up afterwards—directly he entered the room, she got hold of his jacket, and struck him in the stomach with the knife—there was a scuffle between them for three or four minutes, and both fell on the floor—I ran into my own room to get my boots, and the prosecutor ran down stairs, and cried, "I am stabbed"—he was taken on a barrow to the hospital—the prisoner was very drunk—she had been locked in the room some hours before, in conse<lb/>quence of her being drunk.</p>

I am a worker and manufacturer of furs, and live at No. 37, Liquorpond-street; Mr. Gardner is my landlord; I am employed by Mr. Poland and Mr. Finigan, of Noble-street A man named Mayor was in my employ five or six months ago—he left me suddenly—I sent him away—the prisoner Weigener was in my service—on the 22nd of June I sent Weigener to Mr. Finigan for fifty boa tails, which he brought—that increased my stock of Mr. Finigan's goods—I had property on my premises belonging to Mr. Poland also at the same time, and some of my own—I had an uncle living at Preste, <hi rend="italic">in</hi> Hungary—on the 22nd of June, about ten minutes or a quarter past two o'clock, I received a letter—Nixon and the prisoner Weigner were at my premises at the time—on receiving the let<lb/>ter I and my wife set off to Denmark-hill, leaving Weigner and Nixon on the premises—I asked Nixon to remain there till I came back—that letter re<lb/>quested me to go to No. 21, Carforland-street, Denmark-hill, for a parcel, precisely at three o'clock, over London-bridge—it purports to come from William Ryder—I went, and hunted for William Ryder there, but could not find any such place or parcel—I returned in about four hours; and when I <hi rend="italic">got</hi> borne, about six o'clock, I found nobody there—the place was empty—then was nothing but my furniture left—the doors were locked—cll the furs were gone, and Weigener was gone—soon after the apprehension of Weigener saw a black bag, containing furs, at the station—a part of them belonged to Mr. Finigan, a portion to Mr. Poland, and a portion to myself—they were all in my care and custody, and were worth between 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and were safe on the premises when I went away—the officer produced the key of my door to me.</p>

About six weeks before I was before the Magistrate, I had been living with him—he gave me in charge for robbing his aunt, and I was put in the Compter for three days—I was examined before Mr. Alderman Gibbs, and was let off—in Dec, 1844, I was out with Sharp in Gos well-street—I was living with him at the time—Sharp stopped at Mr. Cowan's shop—Sharp was looking in at the window, and I too—he went away and left me there—he came back, and took up some boots from Mr. Cowan's shop door—I believe there were twenty-four or twenty-five pairs—he went away with them up a turning which I believe is called French-alley—I saw him again in about three hours—he asked me to go to my sister's with him—we went there—he then went and fetched the bundle of boots—he asked James Connor, who was there, if he would buy a pair—he did not buy any—Sharp said he had dropped a pair, and a boy picked them up and went away with them—he then said he knew a person who would buy them, would I go with him—I went with him to Mr. Ryan's, in Peter-street—Sharp carried the boots—he asked Ryan 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, and Ryan gave him 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw that—we left the boots at Ryan's, and Sharp and I went up to my sister's again—my sister asked Sharp where be got them—he said, "Not five minutes' walk from here"—my sister said, "Did you buy them?"<hi rend="italic"/>—he said it made no matter to her—the policeman came, and Sharp was taken into custody for taking things from a furnished lodging—the policeman said I was to go as well, and he took me too—my sister followed us, and, as we were going along, Sharp said, "Oh, Mary, if they had come five minutes sooner they would have catched me with what I had got with me"—my sister said, "What, the boots?"—he said, "Yes"—she asked him where he got them—he said, "Out of Goswell-street"—the next day I was going down Peter-street with Sharp—we saw Ryan—he said to Sharp, "I had you to <hi rend="italic">rights;</hi> you know what I gave you for those boots; I have sold four pairs to Mr. Green at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is a pair"—Sharp said, "You had me for a</p>

The prisoner was letter-carrier there, in June last—on the morning of the 26th June, I was in attendance at the time of the arrival of the Exmouth bag, which was between half-past five and seven o'clock—I opened the bag, and deposited the letters on the table—in the course of business they would be carried from that table to another, to be stamped—it was part of the prisoner's duty to take them to the stamper's table to be stamped—we opened twenty-six bags at that table—five persons were employed to carry the letters—the prisoner was one of them—he was on duty that morning—I saw him employed in carrying letters to the stamping-table.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the constables attending the General Post<lb/>office. On Friday morning, the 26th June, I was standing at the basement of the building, to see what was going on in the water-closets; this model properly represents the arch, within which the water-closets are, except that these round holes are a narrow wire grating, so that nobody can see that anybody</p>

               <p>is looking through—a gas-light throws a light over the whole of the water<lb/>closets, and I could see everything that was going on—Peak was at the other grating—I had been on the watch for an hour and a half, ever since half-past six, and about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner come to the second closet di<lb/>rectly opposite me—the room was perfectly light, I could see everything—I saw him enter the closet, undo his things, and sit on the seat—he remained there a short time, and then put his hands behind him into his coat-pocket—he drew from his coat pocket a small piece of writing-paper, which he dropped in front of him down the hole, between his legs, without making any use of it—he placed his hands into his coat pocket again, kept feeling there some little time, as if feeling for something, and then he brought in front of him a piece of white paper rolled up small, in the shape of coin, he unfolded the rolls several times—I saw it was very fine paper—I then gave a signal to Peak—he took my position, and I went round to the prisoner, who was then in the act of putting his things up—I laid hold of him, and asked what he had put dots the watercloset—he said, "Nothing but what I have been using"—I searched him, and in his waistcoat pocket found 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, a few loose coppers in his trowsers pocket, and a sovereign loose in his left hand breast coat pocket—I found a small canvass bag in his left hand trowsers pocket, tied up closely, containing a sovereign, and 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—a plumber was sent for, the water<lb/>closet was opened, and I saw him take from the closet, from the seat from which the prisoner rose, this piece of tissue-paper, from the basement, and also this letter from the same place—there were no marks of use on them—one has the appearance of having been used—it was in halves, but they are put together—part of the half seems to have been used—he certainly did not use the part that he put down in front of him—the tissue-paper was in one strip at the time it was found, but it has got split—I told the plumber when he came, to look for a fine piece of tissue-paper.</p>

On the morning of the 26th of June I was called to examine the water-closet—it acts of itself—the moment the weight of a person sits era it, the seat jumps one inch, opens a valve, and water flows into the box at the bottom of the cistern, and when the person rises from the seat, the water rushes into the basin—I examined the water-closet in question, and found two portions of a letter, an envelope, and a small piece of tissue-paper on the surface of the water—the basin does not contain water, but the trap under neath contains about three quarts—there is no bottom to the basin—I took the papers out, and handed them to the officer—there were several pieces of brown paper besides in the trap.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the 18th of June, about a quarter after three o'clock, I went to the house, and found a carving-knife in the back kitchen, with a sort of duster thrown over it—I produce it—there is the ap<lb/>pearance of blood on it which has been wiped—it is smeary—a liquid being wiped off would not make it the same—it has a red appearance—I imagine the gravy of meat would make a similar mark—it is not grease—the color of blood was distinct on it when I first saw it—I showed it to the surgeon—I showed it to the prisoner—he said, "That is the knife I stabbed my wife with"—I saw a handkerchief taken from him at the station, which I produce—there were blood marks upon it, which are here now.</p>

               <p>I was called in to see the prosecutrix—I found her lying on the ground, in a very alarming state—she had received very severe injuries, which had caused very great haemorrage—the injury was in the vagina and in the perinaeum—it had been caused by a stab from some sharp instrument—the perinaeum was cut through, and the wall of the vagina—I imagine it entered from the peri-naeum under the vagina—it was a very dangerous wound, about three inches deep—the immediate danger was from the loss of blood, and there was danger to be feared from inflammation—this knife would very likely have caused the injury—she was in great danger for some days—I consider her out of imme-diate danger now, but she is still in a very exhausted state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you observe any bruises or wounds about her neck or head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—my attention might have been called to it, but my im-pression is there were none.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> All I have to say is, I left work at nine o'clock in the morning; my leg being swollen, I went there as I had done the Tuesday before; I went down into the kitchen, and told them to make some tea; I made two jugs full, and waited for it to get cool to put into a bottle; I was waiting for the water to be boiled, to bathe my feet in the back kitchen; I sat down by the side of the fire-place, cutting a piece of old boot to put into the boot I then had on; my feet were swollen, and I was obliged to cut my boots about; as I was cutting the leather to go into the toe, my wife passed me; I made the remark to her, "Here is a state I am in," as she passed by me I received a most cruel kick on the side of my contused foot; in the agony I was in with my bad foot, she stumbled against me, kicked with her leg against my arm, and the knife went into my arm; I did not know I had thrust the knife into her, or what I had done, till I saw the knife there; it happened in the struggle, and when I saw what I had done, I was paralysed and horrified, and could not take it out; when the policeman came I said, "I am the man: if anything is done, I am the murderer;" I was truly hor-rified at what I have done; 1 was unconscious of using the knife; I never quarrelled with the woman, never put a hand on her the whole time I lived with her but once, six or eight years ago; on the Sunday I went down to make a separate arrangement with her and the child, as I had got permanent work; my sister asked me to stop dinner; I was anxions to get away, be-cause I felt more pleased that week than I had been during all my life, as I had permanent employ, to carve work for the House of Lords; I never put a hand on her; as she kicked up her foot, I put up my hand, and run the knife into my arm; I was in agony at the moment, and went to thrust her foot away; she went from the table to the cupboard, which will prove I did not follow her into the kitchen; I was paralysed at the evidence she gave before the Magistrate; she fell over the fender; it was merely accidental.</p>

The prisoner has been occasionally employed by us as a carver, until within about three weeks of this time—in Feb. last, about ten or eleven one morning, he came in a most excited state, the pers-piration was pouring from him, and he could scarcely speak—he said there was a conspiracy to murder him—he begged to be allowed to sit down, and sat there some little time—he stopped, I should think, a couple of hours—I was out some part of the time—I returned in about an hour, and he was still there—on one or two occasions he has come in with something of the same tale, that people were conspiring against him, and seemed to be continually im-pressed with a notion that somebody was trying to do him an injury—he did not mention who the parties were—he went to the door, and begged us to look out—he thought somebody was following him, but nobody ever came near—it</p>

               <p>was quite by accident I saw this affair in the newspaper, which made me attend here—for some time I thought the excitement was from liquor, but be never smelt of liquor—I never saw him drunk—he had worked for us occasionally for the last year and half—the last time I saw him in this excited state was about three weeks before the 18th of June—he said people were still conspiring against him—I asked what he meant—he answered <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in a very <hi rend="italic">long</hi> strain—I cannot tell you his answers—they were not very rational ones—he did not name any person in particular—he followed his work <hi rend="italic">as</hi> usual, but very carelessly—the last work he had from us was in hand four or five months—it ought to have been finished in four or five weeks at the most—we had great difficulty in getting him to do it—he was very clever in his business—it is my decided opinion that at times he scarcely knew what he was about.</p>

The prisoner's brother called on me last night, and asked me to attend here—I attended the prisoner about a month ago, or rather less—about the 6th of June, about one o'clock in the morning, I was called up by the prisoner—he brought a large earthenware mug, with some dregs of porter, I believe, in it—he said he believed he had been poisoned, that he had come from Limehouse, and called on several medical gentlemen on the way, but they were all in bed—he wished me to give him some medicine—it was my impression that he was labouring under a strange delusion—I gave him a simple draught, and recommended him to call on me next day, which he did—I had a longer con-versation with him, which left no doubt on my mind that he was insane, that he had some strange delusion—he mentioned his wife and her sister, and coupled them with the <hi rend="italic">odd fellows</hi>—he said they were watching him where-ever he went, and were poisoning his food, that they had gone so far as to send people to the shop where he was at work, and caused charcoal or some-thing to be burnt so as to fumigate the place, with a view of poisoning him—I saw him a third time, and recommended him to let me see some of bit friends—the last time I saw him was about a week after the first—it was not three weeks ago—he was just in the same state, perfectly sensible in his con-yersation in every point but what I have mentioned, that his sister and wife and the <hi rend="italic">odd fellows</hi> were watching him to poison him, putting poison <hi rend="italic">into</hi> his beer, and if he went into a public-house, they poisoned him—the <hi rend="italic">term</hi> conspiracy was rather a favourite term with him—he used it more than once—to the best of my knowledge, he was not drunk at any of those times—he decidedly did not appear so—I told him once to put his tongue out, and it was not in a heated state, which it would have been if in liquor—he was cool and collected, except when he first came to the door—he was rather excited in his mind.</p>

On Sa-turday night, June 27th, I was sent for to the police-station—I examined the prosecutor's head, and found three serious scalp wounds—they were serious combined, each wound of itself was not serious, but from the number they were serious, if not dangerous—one on the forehead laid the scalp bare about an inch and a half—the one on the back of the head was not so large—the third was a punctured wound on the top of the head—he was much excited, which I think was from the contest—he did not appear intoxicated—if he danced and drank afterwards, that would be calculated to increase the danger—when I saw him again the symptoms were augmented, but next time the wounds were nearly healed—I do not think it would require great force to inflict the wounds—it was merely the skin laid open—I should say the man's scuffling would much impair the power of the party as-saulting.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Cox and Co., army agents, Craig't-court; I live in Ebury-street, Pimlico. Last Monday night, about eleven o'clock, I was going home from a friend's house, where I had been dining—the prisoner came behind me near the Westminster hospital—she came past me and spoke to me—nobody was with her at the time—she asked me to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> with her more than once—she kept on speaking to me—she accompanied me perhaps 200 or 300 yards—I said I was going home—I said nothing else to her—I observed that she felt my left-hand trowsers' pocket—I suspected that her intent was to rob me, and transferred a small bag, containing gold, to my coat pocket for security—she still kept by my side, and at last made a thrust at the same pocket—I was 200 or 300 yards from the hospital then, in the direction of Pimlico—at that instant two men suddenly came up, caught hold of the tail of my coat, and ripped it up behind with great force, from the skirt to the collar—I had not seen those men before—I do not know where they came from—the woman had said nothing before they appeared—she repeated the thrust at my trowsers' pocket after I had transferred the money to my coat-pocket—she seemed still trying my pocket—while the men were tearing my coat her hands were on my trowsers' pocket—they seemed confined to that—that seemed her object—she was in front of me—I called "Police!" loudly—two policemen came up immediately—the prisoner and the men instantly fin away, both in the same direction—I believe the prisoner was apprehended within three or four minutes—after the policemen came up I found my trowsers were unbuttoned one or two buttons—I saw this bunch of keys on the ground—the prisoner was standing by—they had been in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> coat-pocket—they are my property—I thought I had lost the bag and gold, but found it in my coat pocket where I had placed it—this penknife is mine—there were some coppers in my coat pocket—I was not aware that I had any there before they were found by the policeman—I very often carry copper in my coat pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at No. 29, Edward-terrace, Cale<lb/>donian-road. On the 7th of July, after nine o'clock at night, I was returning from Frederick-street, Gray's-inn-road, into Frederick-place, and saw the prisoner at the corner of Frederick-place with another man—when I got up to them they begged of me, they desired me to give them money—they both spoke—I made them no reply—they renewed their request for money—I said, if they persisted, I should be under the necessity of giving them both in charge—they then allowed me to go a few paces in advance of them, when I heard footsteps, and heard them muttering something—the only word I could distinguish was "now," and before I could turn round the prisoner made a grasp either at my watch or chain—his hand caught me just under my waistcoat pocket—I had a watch and gold chain in that pocket—I seized him—a struggle ensued—he overpowered me, and got away—he had not proceeded far before I caught him again—I called, "Stop thief!"—he said nothing the first time he was taken—the second time I caught hold of him he begged of me to let him go, saying he was only begging, and he got away again—the third time I caught him by the corner of a street—a crowd collected, who seemed disposed to yield to his statement—he got away again—I pursued—he ran round Regent-square—he never was above four yards in advance of me, but I was afraid of him, seeing him put his hands into his pocket, and apparently arranging some<lb/>thing behind him—at the corner of Regent-square a man secured him, and I gave him in charge.</p>

On the morning of the 4th of July, I heard a cry of "Police!" in Goswell-street—I went, and saw the driver of a cart—he complained to me that the prisoner and another, who were there, had jumped into his cart with the intention of driving away with it, tad that was the reason he called me—he said he had not time to go to his station—I said, "As he don't choose to charge you, I wish you both to go away"—the other one went away, but the prisoner said he would go away then he thought proper, and he would mark the driver another time—I said, I certainly should lock him up if he made use of these threats—the carter then said, "I don't know whether I won't charge him, if he makes use of that language, and of those threats"—I then took the prisoner by the collar—he said, "Let go"—I said, "I shan't till I hear whether he will charge you"—the carter then said, "If you will go away, I don't wish to charge you"—I let go of the prisoner's collar, and said, "Now you go away"—he immediately up with his fist, and struck me in the mouth, which made it bleed, and loosened two of my front teeth—he then ran away down Bell<lb/>alley—I followed him, and <hi rend="italic">G</hi> 151 stopped him—I came up and he had him in cus<lb/>tody—I got hold of him again, and he pulled me down upon him, and kicked me under the chin—that was not more than two minutes after the first blow—that kick made my chin bleed very much—there were four constables then—we proceeded from Goswell-street, along Arthur-street, to Golden-lane—when we got there, he was very violent, and kicked me again in the back, which I have suffered from ever since—he then took hold of my * * which tare been very much swollen, and in pain ever since—he was at that time on the ground, and I was down with him—we strapped his legs, but another constable came up whom he knew, and he then said he would walk quietly—I could not follow to the station, I was so much hurt—I was forced to draw my staff—the doctor examined me, and said there was a small bone broken in my back.</p>

I am a shipwright, and lodged at No. 17, Hand-street, Woolwich—the prisoner was landlady of the house—I was about to leave my lodging on the 17th of April—I left my chest in my bed-room when I went out to work—I returned about seven o'clock in the evening, and found the chest removed down into the kitchen—I found it still locked, and took it away in about an hour and a half to Martyn'a-passage, where I removed to—I had seen six sovereigns safe in it on Monday, the 13th, but not afterwards—I did not open it till the 18th, and then missed the six sovereigns—the prisoner told me she had moved my chest into the kitchen when I came home—I had the key in my possession—I was going to leave, but my time was not up till the evening.</p>

I saw Bramley on Saturday night, the 30th of May, alone—I was with a sailor, coming down the street—I am known by the name name of <hi rend="italic">Norfolk</hi> at Woolwich—Bramley came and said, "<hi rend="italic">Nor<lb/>folk</hi>, would you mind doing me a favour?"—I said, "What is that?"—he asked if I would sell a flannel shirt for him—I said, "I don't mind, if it don't get me into any trouble"—he said, not the least, what trouble there was he would take upon himself—he then unbuttoned his jacket, and took out one flannel shirt—I did not see the shirt at all till he unbuttoned his jacket—I went into Mrs. Cahill's shop, and asked her to buy it—she asked whose it was—I did not like to say it was the marine's, and I said it was the sailor's that was with me—she gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I came out and gave the money to Bramley, who was standing just outside the shop door—he then asked if I would go in and sell another—I said I did not like, I was afraid I might get into some <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—he then asked the sailor if be would—he said he did not mind if he did not get into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—Bramley then unbuttoned his jacket a little higher up, and pulled out another flannel shirt, which he gave into the sailor's hands—the sailor went with it, into the same shop—he came out again, and gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into Bramley's hand—Bramley then asked the sailor if he would mind selling him another—the sailor said he did not mind if it did not get him into a scrape—Bramley said, not the least, there would be no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> about it—he said they were his own, his mother had sent him them for him to go to sea—he went up against the old station-house, opened his trowsers, and took out another flannel shirt—he gave that third shirt to the sailor—I saw the sailor go to the same shop, and he brought out 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and gave it to Bramley, and Bramley gave the sailor 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we then parted—next morning, (Sunday,) Bramley came to my bed-room window, between seven and eight o'clock, and asked how I was—I told him I had got a headache—he asked if I would have something to drink—he put his hand against his trowsers pocket, and said he had got plenty of money—he told me not to say anything about what happened on Saturday night—he then went away—I have since then been ill-used by some of the men in the barracks—I have a black eye.</p>

On Sunday night, the 21st of June, I was at my door—these people were about six doors up on the other side of the street, at Mr. Willis's, No. 12—I saw this disturbance—the last witness was among them—the deceased was very tipsy, and was taking indecent liberties with her—her husband came over and struck her—the deceased got out of the chair, and said he would fight him—he said, "What made you strike that woman?"—he said, "Because she is my wife"—deceased said, "If you strike her I will strike you"—the prisoner said, "I will fight you"—he afterwards said he would not fight him, but would fight his b——brother <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>—the prisoner at that time was com<lb/>ing out of the public-house—he went to his own door, stooped over, and asked the deceased what he meant—the deceased said he would fight him for last boxing-day—the prisoner said, "I do not want to fight you, but if you fish to fight, I will fight you; wait till I go in-doors and pull off my new trowsers, then I will fight you like a man"—he went in and changed his trowsers—in the meantime the deceased took off his things, and kept strik<lb/>ing his breast, saying he would fight any b——man in the street—when the deceased saw the prisoner come out, he ran at him—they both had a alight blow a-piece, and the deceased happened to fall under the prisoner—they never ran at one another; they never squared or anything; you could not call it a fight—the back part of the deceased's head fell against the curb<lb/>stone; that part rather more behind than his ear—I assisted him up, ordered "me cold water, and bathed his temples—he did not seem much worse—he would have arose again, I think, but for the liquor—I directly lifted him up, and before he got on his knees he again said he would fight any b----man in the street—I afterwards saw him go away with the woman—on Thursday I saw a man dead at the house of the deceased's mother, but I did not know him when he was alive, and cannot say that he was the same man.</p>

On Monday morning, the 22nd of June, between nine and ten o'clock, I went to Moss-alley, Bank-side, to the house of the deceased's mother, and saw Dim lying on the bed in a collapsed state—I expected that he was labouring under compression of the brain—I observed a diffused swelling on the back pwt of his head—he had had a knock on the right side of his neck—he died about half past one o'clock the same day—on the following Thursday I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and have no difficulty in saying that his death was caused by the rupture of one of the arteries of the <hi rend="italic">dura-mater</hi>—that diffused</p>

               <p>the blood over the brain—there was a large quantity of coagulated blood—the effect of any injury of that sort would most likely come on by degrees afterwards—he might have no difficulty in walking a short distance after he received the blow—the blood would become discharged from the artery afterwards, and spread itself upon the brain, and then he would become insensible.</p>

On Saturday, the 13th of June, I was coming up the garden and saw the prisoner Love coming out of the kitchen with the plate-basket, which I had left in the front kitchen on the bedstead—I went towards Love, but she had got out before I caught her—she dropped the basket on the threshold of the door—I stopped her—I saw Beadle on before her—I said to Love, "You have got my plate"—she said,"I have not"—I said, "Come back, and let me search you"—I wanted Beadle to come back, but she would not—Love said to her, "Come back, and Be a <hi rend="italic">pluckt</hi> one"—Beadle came back—I counted the plate, which was theft on the threshold of the door in a basket, and there was nothing missing—it con<lb/>tained the plate stated in the indictment—I let the prisoners go, as I did not see a policeman—there was only ray mistress in the house, and she was poorly—I saw a constable shortly afterwards, and gave him a description of the prisoners—Love had a black necklace on—I mentioned that to the police<lb/>man, and he has such a necklace as Love had on at the time—this is the plate and basket—here are twenty-four spoons, forks, and other things, the value of them is about 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the kitchen door was latched, but not bolted—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Burns, and live in Wallis-alley, Southwark. I went to bed drunk on the 22nd of June—I awoke between five and six o'clock in the afternoon—my gown, shawl, and skirt were gone—these now produced are them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same house as Mrs. Burns. On the 22nd of June she was not quite drunk—I recollect her lying down and going to sleep—I afterwards saw the prisoner tying up a bundle by the table in Mrs. Burns' room—I saw him there when Mr. Newlyn came with a tract—I am sure the prisoner is the person who was making up the bundle, while Mrs. Burns was asleep.</p>
