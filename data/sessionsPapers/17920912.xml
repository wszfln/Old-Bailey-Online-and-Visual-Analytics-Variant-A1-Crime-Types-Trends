I said there is a robbery; I immediately ran and got half way up the lane, I laid hold of a man that was running; says I, I have you, and I seized him by the collar; I put him into the turnpike-house; and says I to the man at the turnpike-house, I will go again; just at the end of the lane the prisoner was running at a very great rate, I pursued him about one hundred yards, he passed me, I overtook him; says he, I am not a thief: says I, damn me, I do not think you are an honest man, by your running, if you are, it will be soon proved; I brought him to the turnpike-house, and the next morning I went to the place where I took him, and I saw this stick and cutlass laying near; I searched him immediately when I took him in, and found a knife and handkerchief; it is not above nine hundred or a thousand yards from the place of the robbery; I can run as quick as any person of my size, and had the hardest work to overtake him; he had a light coloured drab coat and blue stockings; the coat he had on was taken off his back, and there was fresh blood on it.</p>

               <p>I bought this horse, and my brother has a joint property in it, to sell a few things about, being lame, and selling greens, and roots, and old rags; my arm was so bad I could not work; and I turned my horse, (by leave) into Mr. Rhodes's field; the prisoner made bricks there; I went to see for him, and going down Cow Cross, I heard of a horse, and I went and found it was my horse; there are a great many vacancies for a horse to get out of the field.</p>

               <p>I am licensed for slaughtering; I am a widow; on Tuesday night of the 5th of September, the horse was brought by the prisoner; to the best of my knowledge he is the lad; if I said he was not I should perjure myself; I am positive sure it was him; I detained the horse and boy; I thought he did not come honestly by it; it was a bay horse, and blind, his knees were broke, and lame withal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, in such a case, to see such a boy brought into such a situation, for such a horse, must give pain to your minds as well as to ours; but my brother Gould, whose humanity is as large as his knowledge, has suggested to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179209120016"/>me, that there have been cases in which a jury have fixed the value of the horse at 10 d. now, if ever there was a case of that kind, this is that very case, therefore, if you think fit to find him guilty value 10 d it will of course save him from the punishment attendant on the crime of horsestealing.</p>

I asked her if she remembered a bustle coming out of the church, and taking hold of a lady's arm: she said yes. I said the lady had lost her purse, and I suspected she had it, and should detain her. Backrack was standing by Jones; she was there the whole time; afterwards there was a search made of both of them in our presence: eight guineas was found on Backrack, and a dollar; the dollar was found under Backrack's foot; Jones was searched; nothing was found on her.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Jones readily acknowledged that she had been at church, that she had been a party in the bustle, and that she had laid her hand on the lady; and every thing else to which you interrogated her? - Yes.</p>

I called the prisoner, and asked him how he came to put the turnings in the melting-pot with the dollars; had he ever done so before: he said at first that I had ordered him to do so, and afterwards that his mind was so disordered, that he did not know what he did; I did not suffer him to go out; I was then called to dinner, and not suspecting the man, I sent up his dinner from my own table. I returned to him in about ten minutes, to melt the other two quantities; it might require an hour and an half; I staid with him till the whole was melted. We have three garrets all in one passage; he went to the extremity; I directed him, after pouring off the last, to bring them to the scale to be weighed; he brought it forward; I weighed, and found a deficiency; he was then below stairs; on his return I told him of the deficiency; the prisoner said he could not give any account of it. I sent two of my men below stairs to search. I went down and found under some tiles, four and twenty new dollars. I brought them up stairs; I asked the prisoner how he came to be such a rascal: he said it was the first time; he had never done so before. I believe the dollars were mine; and the turnings were put in to supply their deficiency. There is no particular mark to them. When before the alderman, he said he hoped the gentleman would be merciful. When we first put the coin into the melting-pot, it will not hold so much as when it is in the state of fusion. The turnings might, when the pot was in a state of fusion, have been thrust down. I had sent the prisoner to Mr. Binns that day; he had lived with me three months; he brought from thence 350 oz. of dollars.</p>

I went up to him and he seemed to be easing himself; I asked what he had there, he said some starch, he was going with it to Catherine Wheel Alley; that was about ten o'clock in the morning, I think on Saturday the 7th of July.</p>

               <p>"Nail it down tight;" they stopped at the White Swan, and had some oysters and beer; I got upon the fore-wheel of the waggon, and looked in where the property was lying: the waggon then went on, and stopped at the bottom of Holborn Hill at Mr. Stafford's; and while they were getting out the boxes, I went in and told Mr. Stafford he had been robbed. Mr. Stafford said,</p>
               <p>"My lads, this box looks as if it had been opened;" they denied it, and Mr. Stafford had the box opened; I went then into the waggon, and brought this parcel and this bag out of the waggon.

We got a warrant next morning, and went to a house which I knew to be the prisoner's house: the constable went in; after some difficulty, I think he broke the door open; he went up stairs to the room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179209120049"/>of the woman with whom the prisoner cohabited; she ran up stairs and fastened the door; the constable broke in and found a trunk, with hair of different sorts, and part of that which I had delivered out to the prisoner the night before. I have every reason to think it is Mr. Smith's property; there was a mahogany chest of drawers filled with hair, that was a very valuable commodity; I believe it to be Mr. Smith's property; he had not missed it; it is supposed to be of the value of 60 or 70 l. The prisoner had worked for Mr. Smith a year and an half; he said he bought it of a man who was to call again.</p>

               <p>I met the prisoner peeping into the room which we call the boring-room; he stood at the door looking to see who was coming up; it struck me as particular; I spoke to him; he said he was going to make some number fixes; I told him to make them long ones, and left him: I enquired who made the dust-brushes; I went to see for the prisoner, and he was gone; I immediately went up stairs to see whether those hairs were there which Crawford said he had given him; I could not find them any where by diligent search: I obtained a search-warrant the next morning; I went with the constable and Crawford to a house; I never learned from the prisoner that it was his house; the constable opened the door; the prisoner cohabited with them, and looked down the staircase, and he said he wanted to speak to her; she ran up stairs and locked the door; he repeatedly asked her to open it, which she refused; he immediately broke the door open, and there was a basket covered; this basket contained the hair described to me by Crawford, which he had given to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Was that the bag that they usually carry the blocks home in? - It seemed to me to be of that sort.</p>
               <p>Do you ever permit them to carry the baskets home? - By no means, but the blocks they do. After I had found the basket, I ordered them to go and secure the prisoner: I found also a basket with 3-qrs. of a hundred of hogs bristles; I have not the least doubt but they were mine; there was likewise another basket in the room with hogs bristles in it; below stairs there were three drawers full of hairs; and the fourth drawer had some in it; the value was 70 l. they all belonged to Mr. Smith, I think; but I cannot positively swear to any part: we took them to Union Hall; the magistrates returned them to us; we have had them ever since. I was before my Lord Mayor; the prisoner said then that he bought them; he could earn five and thirty shillings a week.</p>

               <p>Where was the letter opened, before it was carried to the Dead Letter Office? - by Mr. Doe, in my presence; he had a son coming from the East Indies, and he expected it might be a mistake; he opened it in my presence; he looked at the top of the letter, which said, dear brother, he immediately said that was not for him, and returned it; it contained two bills; one of two hundred, on a ship-builder at Blackwall, whose name I believe was Perry; the other was a fifty pound, I do not recollect the name.</p>

               <p>Is there a drawer to each carrier? - Yes; every letter carrier returns his letter, and I kept them in my drawer till the time came, they remained therefore under my own care, till delivered some time the latter end of April, or beginning of May; I met the prisoner in Lombard-street; I was delivering my letters, that was my district; Mr. Dean asked me for such letter he asked me if I had not returned a letter; containing two hundred and fifty pounds, directed to

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you remember having a letter to deliver in Castle-street, No. 9, to Mr. Dean? - Yes, I recollect it perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the time? - I cannot say the time exactly.</p>
               <p>As near as you can? - I believe the first of my having a letter might be the beginning of March.</p>
               <p>Where did you apply? - In Castle-street, No. 9.</p>
               <p>Who then kept the house? - He was a shoe-maker; I believe the name was Chairs; I kept the letter for some time by me; I had two letters; the first time I ever saw the prisoner was in the Post Office Yard; I cannot ascertain the time.</p>
               <p>

               <p>What passed between you? - Nothing between him and me.</p>
               <p>What became of the two letters which you had? - The prisoner met me when I was ringing our bell, in the Seven Dials; that was after I had seen him in the Post-office yard, but I cannot say how long; he asked me if I had any letters for

            , I told him I had; he asked me if I would deliver them to him; I told him I had two, but they were at the Post-office; it was of a Saturday night, and he said he should wish to have them if I had not got them by me: then, said he, if you will meet me at the New Turnstile, Holborn, between six and seven o'clock; I told him he might enquire for me at the Lamb, and he said he would meet me there; it was in the spring of the year; it might be in the beginning of May, I cannot say; he met me again at a barber's, an acquaintance of his; he was not there just when I went, and so I went to my brother-in-law; I did not see him that evening; I took them to Mr. Chaddick, a brother-in-law, a hair dresser, and left them at his house.</p>
               <p>Look at that letter? - That is one of the letters that I left at Chaddick's, for Dean, the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Look at that? - This I do not know any thing of.</p>
               <p>Look at the date of that? - It is January the 31st, but I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Was you the letter carrier at that time? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Was it your duty to receive those letters and carry them to the place of destination? - Sometimes they are delivered by the penny-post; this has no penny-post mark upon it.</p>
               <p>It was your common duty to have delivered it? - If it came to my hands it was my duty to deliver it; if I had it not, I could not deliver it.</p>
               <p>Did you see Dean after this time that you left the letter at Chaddick's? - I never saw him till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the application of Flower and the other Mr. Dean to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go with them to the lodging of the prisoner? - Not into the house, but I was there at the same time.</p>
               <p>Who had the first opportunity to speaking to or saying any thing to the prisoner? - I believe Flower and Dean before me, I was out of the room, I went to look to see if I could see him any where.</p>
               <p>Did you yourself hold any conversation with him at all on this occasion? - After he came in I asked him if he recollected receiving this letter from the hair dresser in the New Turnstile, and he said he recollected it perfectly well; I asked him if Daniel, the letter-carrier, had delivered him a letter, and he acknowledged he had.</p>
               <p>Carry yourself back to the Post-office, where you saw Daniel giving him the letter? - Upon my word I cannot ascertain the time exactly, for there is so many circumstances of that kind, it is impossible for any man to charge his memory with it.</p>

The next transaction was after I had returned it about a week or ten days after he came to me again; he offered me any pecuniary reward for what I had done, I told him that was not my motive, nor did I chuse to accept it; he came again and said he had got some more remittances; came and shewed me copies of the two bills now in question, for the sum of 800 l. and 50 l. not the originals; he desired my assistance to get them accepted as I understood, but I found otherwise afterwards. He met me by appointment, and desired me to go with him to Mr. Reads; Mr. Read had an objection to give him the bill, not believing him to be the person that the bill should come to, from his appearance, and from his appearance only; that he said in the presence of the prisoner, that till somebody came that knew him he did not chuse to give up the bill; I told him he need be under no apprehension, I knew him to be

I had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Before you went to Batson's had any indorsement been put upon it in your presence? - Yes, Sir, at Batson's coffee-house; it was indorsed by the prisoner at Baker's coffee-house; he did not know that it was necessary; I told him it was necessary to put his name upon it, and they gave him an recountable receipt likewise for the two hundred pound bill.</p>
               <p>Then your credit was not interposed between him and the banker? - No.</p>

               <p>When did you last receive any letter from him? - In the year 1789.</p>

               <p>I believe you went in consequence of a hand bill, in search of the prisoner? - On Saturday the 18th of July, by the directions of the solicitor of the Post Office, I and Mr. Ferguson went to Hatfield after the prisoner, who was gone to see his wife, who lives at Lady Salisbury's, I went to the house, he was not there, we waited a considerable time, and in the evening, near dusk, I apprehended him, and took him to Lord Salisbury's Arms, at Hatfield, and searched him, and in his breeches pocket, I found two duplicates, one of which was a duplicate of a great coat, pawned by the prisoner at one Clarke's, a pawnbroker; we staid till morning, at four in the morning we came to town; the prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179209120064"/>committed; this is the duplicate brought out of the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did the prisoner in all his conduct attempt to evade your apprehension of him? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Was not he ready to give himself up? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>In July last I was a servant to Mr. Clarke, in Ryder's Court, Leicester Fields, a pawnbroker; the prisoner many times and for two years pledged things there; I know him perfectly well; on the 2d of July, he pledged a great coat; it is my writing; this is the duplicate for it.</p>
               <p>(The great coat produced and deposed to, having silk lining to the sleeves, very singular.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Foreigners pledge great coats with you that have coloured silk sleeve linings? - Yes; I have seen such.</p>

               <p>I am a shopman to Mr. Brown, salesman in Monmouth-street; I remember selling this great coat on the 23d of June, at half after nine; I either sold it to the prisoner, or a man very much like him; to the best of my knowledge it was him.</p>
               <p>In what way did he pay you? - By a ten pound note, in two halves joined together; I applied to a neighbour, to give me change for it, his name is Gabb; I hesitated a little at first; he told me if I did not like that he would give me another; and he shewed me another, which was cut likewise; I went to a neighbour to ask their opinion of it, whether it was good; he said he had received two or three, or three or four, but they were all cut, and came from the country, in the morning of that day in a letter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This was half past nine at night? - Yes; the evening was shut in, it rained; I understood that the party I sold it to (as he told me) was going to Salisbury that evening, and if it was not ten o'clock, he should be time enough for the coach.</p>

Mr. Fielding in his opening, having observed, that there was a singularity in the act of parliament in this case; the preamble says; Whereas, it is of the utmost import to the trade and commerce of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179209120065"/>this kingdom &amp;c. and then it says, if any person employed, shall secret any letter or letters containing a bank note - this must, as he contended, refer to the division of them; and that here was a bank note sent in letters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys observed, that if the case was meant to be reserved for the opinion of the judges, he wished to be heard when they met for judgment, instead of the present time.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Was you present at any time, and where, at a conversation that passed respecting the service of a notice on the plaintiff Jolly, in the original act in the Court of King's Beach? - Yes, sir, it was in Fleet-street; upon my word I cannot tell the day and month, it was at a public house by Temple-bar, I do not know the sign of it; I believe it was about July, but I cannot take upon me to say; it was this prisoner at the bar; I knew him for some years prior to this; I do not believe I have been at the public house four times in my life.</p>
               <p>How many times? - Once or twice; it is up a passage by Temple Bar, not Bell Yard, nor Shire Lane; I believe it is the Star, I cannot tell who keeps it; I believe it was the latter end of July, or thereabout.</p>
               <p>You are coming to swear to a conversation, when you do not know the month, when you do not know the place, and yet your memory is so very accurate as to recollect the conversation; you shall go on, but it is at your own peril, that is all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. State the substance of this conversation, and the very words as you can state them? - I will; that man came and spoke to me and said, he had a notice to go to serve; the prisoner belonged to the Post Office; some years back he used to carry letters about; I am a shoe-maker; I never bailed three people in my life; I do not believe I bailed four people.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Three Manner Court, Fore Street, No. 1 and 2; I have two houses there; I am landlord of the houses; I have lived there between six and seven years.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the last six or seven years? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you never swear that you lived in Fleet Street, when you made an affidavit in the Court of King's Bench? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Nor in the neighbourhood of Fleet Street? - Never.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three more witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
