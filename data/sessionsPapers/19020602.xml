                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). I was with Williamson and Purkiss on April 29th—I found Costello sitting on the bed with a file in one hand and a coin in the other, milling it—on the bed were a number of coins—I picked nineteen half-crowns off the bed—the coins were separate—I was about to search the bed when Costello said, "I will save you the trouble," and he put his hand between the mattress and the bed and produced this cloth—in it were five packets, each containing twenty half-crowns—twenty half-crowns is called a <hi rend="italic">load</hi>—Lindsay said, referring to Costello. "I have known him eight months, but I have only been working with him here about a week"—Williamson told Lindsey that he recognised him as having been discharged on the charge of uttering bad coin—he admitted that, and said he had uttered about twenty coins all of which' he had from Costello—altogether I found fifty-six coins of 1890, fifty-eight of 1895, and five of 1901.</p>

I answered him 'All right'; he gave me sixpence, I have given him the proof"—I told the prisoner that he would be taken to Bridewell Police Station and charged with inciting the boy to commit a felony—I asked him for the slip, which he refused to give me—I was just about to move when Hall touched me on the arm and pointed to the pavement where this slip of paper was—I wanted the prisoner to take his hand out of his pocket—I picked the paper up—the prisoner said, "All I can say is it is a put up job"—on the way to the station Hall handed me the 6d.—at the station the prisoner was charged with inciting the lad to commit a felony—the prisoner answered, "I did not ask him to get me a proof copy.

I am chief sub-editor of the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> newspaper, of which Sir Edward Lawson is one of the principal proprietors—in October last a boy named Langley was discharged for purloining proofs containing racing matter which had been handed to some agent for racing—5 a.m. is the earliest hour the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> is sold by retailers—the first issue of copies is at 3.10 a.m. to wholesale houses like Smith and Son, Simpkin Marshall, and so on, for dispatch by the early morning trains for the North, the understood condition being that it is not sold to the public before 5 o'clock, at which hour the retailer comes to purchase—we go to press not before 2 to 2.15 a.m.—the time varies from that to 2.45 a.m.—proofs are previously struck off to be read and corrected, which become accessible to employees—my attention had been called to the production in a periodical of matter in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> connected with racing information—early in May a communication was made to me by Hall, in consequence of which I gave certain instructions, calling the police to my assistance and taking their advice—under their instructions I handed Hall this proof early on Tuesday, May 6th—Hall's communication having been made three or four days or a week previously—he acted under my directions—I am not supposed to know everything connected with the printing of the paper, but should say this copy of the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> marked "W" is a waste copy—if it was purchased in Fleet Street at 3 a.m. it was by some such method as this—we do not sell papers to the public—and newsagents cannot sell at 3 o'clock—these copies are rejected as waste, and are not to be sold—they belong to the proprietor.</p>

Last May I lived at 65, Woodstock Road, Finsbury Park—I am a commission agent—and have lived with the prisoner for the past nine years—about nine years ago a boy was born—we called him John Henry—we were called Mr. and Mrs. Marks—we lived happily together—the prisoner's name is Jones—a month before the boy was born the prisoner's people turned her out of doors, and I had her on my hands—it was difficult for me to find shelter for her, and the only thing we could do was to live together as man and wife, which we did—I have taken good care of her since—she did not speak of marriage before the boy was born—she</p>

               <p>has since—she has not mentioned it for five or six years—I did not definitely decline to marry her—I said I always intended to take care of her, and I always did—I considered we should live happier this way than if I married her—I could not introduce her as my wife to my friends because of her education—she was fond of the boy, and so wag I—he used to go to the school opposite our house—I have been out of health for a consider<lb/>able time—during the last year the prisoner has been very depressed and got worse gradually—her memory seemed to be getting defective, and she became very silent and sullen—she has suffered from rheumatism for three or four months and sleeplessness—we lived very well as regards food—I gave her money to keep the house—on May 7th I went to my employment between 9 and 10 a.m., leaving her at home—I think the boy went to school before I left—I did not notice anything about the prisoner except that she was very quiet—we kissed <hi rend="italic">ourselves</hi> before I left, and that is all that was said—I returned between 7.15 and 7.30—I went downstairs—a little while afterwards a police inspector came in and I went upstairs into the bedroom with him and found the boy lying on the bed dead.</p>

I am medical officer at His Majesty's prison at Holloway—I have had the prisoner under my observation since May 8th—when she was first admitted she seemed very depressed, that depression ha continued—I have had several conversations with her—I think the cause of her depression is the long mental strain and worry on account of he position and dread as to what might happen to her and her son, aggra<lb/>vated by the recent illness of herself and Mr. Marks—I think she may have suffered from rheumatism and sciatica—she said she had been unable sleep, and that would affect her mind very much—she appeared to be very fond of the deceased—she said she felt so miserable that she thought the best way would be to end her life, that she could not leave the boy behind her so she took his life, but that her courage failed her, so she did not strangle herself as she had intended—I believe she has been suffering from melancholia, for some time—I do not think she could distinguish between right and wrong properly on May 7th—she is suffering from melancholia at present—I have had reports about her put before me—her mother was in Colney Hatch, I believe, from depression.</p>

               <p>and doubled back through Albert Street and caught him up—he then stopped, put his pistol in a line with my face, and said, "If you touch me 1 will shoot you stone dead"—he fired, and the bullet struck me below my left breast and above my belt—it went into my coat and then fell out—the prisoner turned round to run away—I drew my truncheon and struck him across the shoulders with it—he fell down—I went to catch hold of him, and he kicked me in the stomach—I hit him again with my truncheon—I went for his body, but he was struggling, and I hit him on his forehead—that is the place which is plastered now—the revolver was in his right hand—he attempted to use it again, but I struck him on the head again, and prevented him from doing so—another constable came up, and we secured the prisoner, and took him to the station—he started going all right, but when we got near the station he became very violent and tripped us both up, and we all three fell down—the revolver was picked up in the road where I had struck him—I did not feel the impact of the bullet when it struck me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in the force about four years, and have often given evidence before magistrates—I said before the magistrate that the pistol was aimed at Clay's head—I did not hear the prisoner say anything to Hawkins and I do not think Hawkins was near enough to hear what the prisoner said to me—my first blow struck the prisoner on his shoulders—the second and third blows struck him on his, head—he was in an excited condition at the station—when he tripped us up two more constables helped us to get him on his feet, and then they left us.</p>

Wender, also on oath, said that she knew nothing about the tieing until she heard the window broken, and that the prosecutor had a grudge against her because she would not yield to his solicitations to immorality which Faller had never done, and that both were nothing more to her than employer and companion in the house; but that she continued to stop in the house because the prosecutor promised to set her up in a boarding-house.</hi>

On May 1st Panton spoke to me about 1 o'clock in Gower's Walk—I went to Cherry Tree Court—I saw Henry and Abraham Delafuente in the latters wood-chopping yard on the left of the court—I asked Abraham if he had seen anything come up the court on a barrow—he said, "No, but if it has it has gone through the <hi rend="italic">boozer</hi>," meaning the Cherry Tree Court public-house—the court has an entrance in Gower's Walk, but the principal entrance is in Backchurch Lane—I asked Abraham which way he could get through the public-house, and he took me through into Backchurch Lane—in Abraham's hearing I asked the landlady if she had seen anything go through, and she said "No"—I returned in about ten minutes through the lane into the court, and entered Abrahams' shed—I saw a large fire, and wood burning similar to that of the tea-chest—I again spoke to Panton and took him to the station—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the Cherry Tree public-house, 111, Backchurch Lane—it backs on to Cherry Tree Court, which leads into Gower's Walk by a side passage, the front part of which is wide enough for a cart, but there is an iron bar and steps to go down—I know Abraham, who keeps the shed in the court, he is a wood-chopper—no chest of tea came through my premises between 12 and 1.30 on May 1st—the constable spoke to me and Abraham.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective H.</hi>) On May 2nd I went with Wensley and saw Henry Delafuente in Cherry Tree Court about 10 a.m.—Wensley said, "We are going to take you into custody on suspicion of being con<lb/>cerned with others in stealing and receiving a chest of tea yesterday"—he replied, "I know there was a chest of tea brought here, but I was not here, I can prove I was at my father's place, but Abraham brought a pound of tea, and the tea lying about dropped from his pocket"—about a pound of tea was scattered about the floor—he was taken into custody—the shed was left in charge of other officers—I returned to the shed about 12 o'clock—I said to Abraham, "You will be taken into custody for being concerned with others in stealing a chest of tea yesterday"—he replied, "All right, you have got to prove it; a policeman came here, and I took him down the court to find it," and that he had some tea in his overcoat pocket, which fell to the floor—later, on examining the fireplace and getting these pieces out, he said, "This is my shed, I pay 8s. a week for it, the tea has gone, we have done you with all your b—cleverness, do what you like"—I examined his overcoat pocket—I saw no sign of tea or dust—I have examined the court—it would be difficult to get a chest of tea out through the passage—the chest could be broken up in a few minutes and the tea carried away if the bags were ready to put the tea in.</p>

B. bought a pound of tea, and the tea you see lying about the floor dropped from his pocket"—tea was lying all over the floor, and he saw me looking at it—I raked up about 1 1/2 lbs. or 2 lbs.—later the same day I arrested Perrin at his employer's address—I told him the charge—he replied, "I left three chests at crutched friars, and know nothing about it; I never left my van all day long"—I arrested hill on may 5th—he said, "I am not working for delafuente now; I was there, but I did not have anything to do with it—I examined Abraham's shed—I picked up in the fire-place and produced at the police court these pieces of melted lead that go inside a tea chest and the wood and the iron banding which is used to bind the chests—they have been burned—there was a largish fire in a large grate, capable of holding a hundredweight of wood—i searched for coal, but found none.</p>

And he turned and struck me in the throat, knocked me down, and jumped on me—I made a report at the police station—I did not see him again till, I think, May 21st, when I identified him amongst a dozen men—I have not recovered from my injuries yet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old, and live with my parents at 37, Kingsdown Road. About 3.45 p.m. on the Thursday in Easter week I was at my window, I saw the prisoners coming up Kingsdown Road and going in the direction of Stanley Terrace—they crossed over—they looked round the corner as if they were looking for someone—they stood there for about five minutes—I saw the deceased coming up the same way that the prisoners had come—the prisoners came across the road to meet him—I heard them say something about" skip"—they used a vulgar expression and said "Fight him"—Waller took off his coat and handed it to Stokes—Waller struck the deceased in the face—he had not made any attempt to strike Waller—there was no sparring—the deceased fell to the ground—Stokes picked him up by the scruff of his neck and got him partly on his feet—Waller then struck him again, I think it was about his face—then Stokes let him drop, and he fell on his back—I saw a policeman at the corner of Cornwallis Road—the prisoners ran off—later in the month I was taken to the Hornsey Road police-station, when I was shown a number of men—I did not pick out anybody then, but later on I identified Stokes, and a day or two afterwards I picked out Waller—I do not remember the date—I have no doubt that they are the two men I saw in the Kingsdown Road.</p>

The man who had done this then went down Kings-down Road with the woman. We walked as far as Stanley Terrace, past the man and woman and stood round the corner. The man left the woman in Kings<lb/>down Road, and was walking alone. Waller crossed the road to the man and stopped him and spoke to him. I do not know what he said. I then crossed the road, Waller said to the man, 'What have you got from the woman? give it her back.'

Waller then took off his coat and said to me, 'Hold this, Jim.' I held his coat. They then went into the road together, they shaped up, Waller struck him and he fell. The man then asked me to pick him up, and I did so, and put him on his feet and stood on one side. The man put both his hands in front of him and</p>

               <p>Waller struck him again, and the man fell again and the back of his head struck the road.

A man had gone down a woman's pocket, I asked him to give back to the woman what he had stolen from her, we had a fight and he fell."</p>

I do not deny that I signed for the letter because I was simply acting on his behalf. I got him work. It does not hardly sound that I am stealing a letter or that I am acting in any way under false pretences, when I distinctly say and can prove that the man went with me to fetch the letter from the post office, and waited outside whilst I went in for it. Not being able to quench his insatiable thirst with an empty pocket he must go again by himself and thereby set the post office officials wondering as to two men coming</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 234. Victoria Dock Road—that is unfortunately a lodging-house—I am a ship's clerk—I first saw you at the Wave lodging-house—it was before I knew the prosecutor—I did not notice that you were very kind to him when you became associated with him—I did not see him feeding with you—on April 24th I had nothing to do in the dock and I asked you if I might fetch some beer in for you so as to earn a few pence—I went out to fetch it—I do not remember that on that occasion you said you had been to the post office—the prosecutor did not give me any money to pay for beer that morning—I did not see him drinking any beer—I do not know if I saw him there that morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went with the prisoner to the post office on April 23rd—he said he was expecting to receive a letter with some money in it—I understood him to say it was coming from his sister at Glasgow—when I went for the beer for him I signed an acknowledgment that I had received the beer—it was the customary thing as it was on credit—in a letter from Holloway the prisoner suggested that I should say that I had seen him hand the prosecutor some money—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "Holloway Prison, May 5th, 1902. Dear Millar, Just a few lines to you alone, privately, I mean no one is to know where your letter is from or what it contains. Well, it is just this. You know the trouble I am in, and something of the cause, and more than that it has just come to my mind that you can be a most important witness on my behalf on Wed<lb/>nesday next, at West Ham Police Court. You will only have a few words to say but they will be all important, and I will pay you your day's money and something besides. You remember last Thursday week, the 24th, being at D Jetty, and you remember meeting me against the Tidal Basin Dock Gates, when you were going in with five pints of beer. You asked me where I was going and I told you I was going to the post office for a registered letter, and when I returned don't you recollect standing close to where two men were marking off the teas, and you saw me hand the letter and money to Fergusson. You then said, 'Any more to give away?' and I told you it was his letter and money, not mine. Now, Mr. Millar, I feel certain you can remember this little incident if you try, and it is most important, because he swears he has not had the money or the letter, and you saw me hand both to him. I therefore ask you to please be at the West Ham Police Court on Wednesday morning at 10 a.m., and just answer these questions on my behalf, and you will do me a great service and one I shall not forget.—Your sincere friend, J. Howard."—I did not go to West Ham Police Court—I do not remember any such circumstances as those; they did not take place—I also got this letter from him, "May 21st 1902. Dear sir, I am informed by the prison officials that in answer to my application to you to attend my trial at the Old Bailey, on June 2nd, that you decline to do so. Now, sir, I have no wish</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190206020058"/>
               <p>to appear hard or to threaten you in any way, but when I know that you saw me give Fergusson that money and letter on the 24th April, at D Jetty and when by only just saying so at my trial you can get me acquitted, I think it only right and just that you should attend, and I warn you that if you do not do so that I still hold your handwriting forging my name for five pints of ale obtained from Mr. Ernest Payne on the same date, also that the same ale is not yet paid for and a word by me and you will be most probably where I am now. I enclose herewith copy of your order in my name to refresh your memory. Now, old friend, we have been friends you know and I have no wish to be anything else, so like a sensible man write me a line by return to say you will be my witness on June 2nd. You will not have half-a-dozen words to say, but it is most important that I should have you there. Awaiting your reply, I am, Sir, yours respectfully, John N. Howard."</p>

I live at 6, Bromwell Gardens, Clapham Common, and with my mother and sister carry on a boarding-house there—from April 6th the prisoner was in our employment as indoor servant—there were no other servants in the house—the only occupants of the house were my mother, my sister, myself, and a gentleman lodger, named Mr. Nicholls—on May 21st the prisoner was out in the evening for some hours—that same night we missed seven spoons and eight forks, and in the morning we missed a cash-box from my mother's bedroom—it may have contained a little money—it had some papers in it—we sent for a detective—the prisoner returned the same night and wanted to leave next morning—he had told my sister that he wished to leave—the property has not been discovered—the prisoner came down next morning at 7 a.m., dressed ready to go away, and he had his portmanteau packed—we kept him until a policeman came.</p>

I am the sister of the last witness, and live in the same house—on May 17th the prisoner said he wanted to leave and get a better situation, and on May 21st he went out to see about one—that evening Mr. Nicholls missed a coat, and then after the prisoner returned we missed some silver—he said he wished to leave next morning at 8.45—he had previously said he would stay about eighteen months.</p>

I saw the prisoner at Battersea Park Road police station on the evening of April 12th—I charged him with attempting to murder his wife—I read the charge over to him—he made no reply—I said to him, "You are charged with a very serious offence, do you fully understand it?"—he made no reply to that, but nodded his head—I said, "Am I to understand by that that you mean yes?"—he said, "Yes"—I charged him with the wilful murder of his wife on May 7th—the charge was read over to him—he made no reply—he appeared on remand several times at the police court.</p>

               <p>Battersea Park Road—about 5.10 p.m. on April 12th I was called to New Road—I saw the deceased lying on her back on the pavement outside No. 166—her feet were towards the door-step, and her head towards the kerb—there was a large wound on the left side of her head—she was uncon<lb/>scious—a light brown overcoat was thrown partially over her head, and there was much blood on the pavement—I had her carried upstairs, where I examined her further—I found a number of wounds upon her head—they were circular, blunt cuts, deeper at one side than at the other—there was a large wound just above the left side of the forehead, consisting of four or five separate wounds merged into one—there were six other wounds on various parts of the head, all through the scalp down to the bone—I think that at least ten separate blows were struck—the wounds could be caused by this hammer—there was a lot of dark hair stained with blood hanging from it when I saw it in the constable's hand—I dressed the woman's wounds, and had her taken to the hospital—she did not smell of alcohol.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner and house surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—the deceased was admitted there at 6.15 p.m. on April 12th—she was in a semi-conscious condition—I made an examination of her, and, owing to the serious nature of the injuries, I at once admitted her—she was operated upon about one hour after her admission—she was suffering from two compound compressed fractures of the skull—the fractured bone pressed on the skull—her head was shaved, and there were ten scalp wounds, and the two compound compressed fractures there—we removed about three square inches of bone—the symptoms of brain irritation subsided after the operation, and her health improved—she was unable to have any conversation with anyone, but she showed signs of intelligence—on the 28th her temperature began to rise, and I observed symptoms of an abscess on the brain—she died at 3.30 p.m. on April 29th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found ten lacerated scalp wounds on the head, one behind the ear, 1 1/2 inches long, one over the forehead about 1 inch in extent, one over the right vertex, and several scattered over a small area of 5 inches in extent—nine of them had healed up with one exception, that one had suppurated or become poisoned, and had laid the foundation to this abscess in the brain which resulted in her death—I think extreme violence must have been used to inflict the wounds—she was a healthy woman—there was no pathological evidence of any alcoholic history—I should say she was a sober woman.</p>

I have not yet heard of any scheme as to the delivery of the notes, their examination and payment which, in my opinion, is safe and practical, and I look upon the whole business with the gravest suspicion"—the number of the notes to be delivered was 1,150—the prices for the notes were, first 30s., then 35s., and then £2—the 1,150 notes were to be sold to Fry's principal for £3,162 10s., which worked out at £2 15s. per note—I do not remember whether I had twenty-three notes to add to the 1,150—looking at this pocket book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) £1,552 10s. was the purchase price of the notes—the profit was £1,685, which was to be distributed between Devenport, Fry, and myself—the £1,552 10s. was worked out upon the basis of the purchase price of the notes being 27s. per note.</p>

In company with Atkins I kept observation upon a number of people in different places between February 13th and March 8th this year—observation was kept upon Fry and amongst others the four prisoners—I have heard the account given by Atkins as to the result of the observations, which is substantially accurate—I have my notes—on March 8th I was present at the meeting between Hurley and Gibbons outside the Morgan Arms—I met Hurley as he was coming down Coborn Road—he frequently looked back—he went into the Morgan Arms and met Gibbons—Atkins has given it all correctly.—I followed Gibbons from the Morgan Arms—he went to College Street, where he stood at the corner looking about—I was present when Brown was arrested, and I corroborate Atkins as to what was done and as to what Brown said—I was with Atkins on March 21st when Hurley was arrested, but I might mention one thing that occurred at the station when they were detained on March 8th—Devenport said after what Brown had said "This is what you get for getting these things. I was told I could get the money for the notes at the Bank of England if I could get some and then as soon as I get them this is what it comes to"—it was about half an hour</p>

               <p>after the arrest that Devenport made that statement—I arrested Hurley—I saw him leave his place about twelve o'clock with another man—they went into Tradegar Square and as they left the house the other man kept looking back towards the house—I came alongside of Hurley and said, "Hurley"; he said, "Yes "; I said, "We are police officers, I am going to arrest you on the charge of being concerned with Devenport. Brown, Gibbons, Wyndham and Levy, in custody, in forging and uttering £5 Bank of England notes with intent to cheat and defraud the Governor and Company of the Bank of England "; he said, "I am as innocent as a new born baby of what you say; I know Fitzy and Wyndham," meaning Gibbons and Freeman. "everyone knows them who goes on the race<lb/>course; I do not know Devenport and Brown; this is a serious thing for me: this will ruin my business; everyone knows about this at Leicester; we were reading about it in the papers there"—he was taken to the station and amongst the other things found on him were two cards bearing the name "H. Barker, 9. Adam Street, Strand"—that is where Hurley has an office as a betting and commission agent—there is more than one name outside those premises—there are "A. Hurley" and "H. Barker" one over the other—on the previous day to Hurley's arrest I kept observation from 10 to 1 and from 2 to 6 on his office, and I saw nothing of him on that day—I was outside the Bodega on the evening of March 4th and saw Hurley. Maitland, and the other man come up Bedford Street—I know Maitland to be in Hurley's employ—I have seen him in and out of the office in Adam Street—I kept observation the next day and saw Hurley go into the Bodega, and Brown, Wyndham, and another man whom I believe to be Gibbons, but I am not sure.</p>

Gibbons sitting down on a couch behind the door—he was also told he would be taken into custody—on March 6th I kept observation with Atkins in the Minories and I corroborate what he says.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Chief Inspector</hi>) In March I kept observations with other officers in the Minories—Atkins's account is accurate—on March 7th I was in room 61 at the Cannon Street Hotel about 3 p.m.—the adjoin<lb/>ing room is 62—a door leads from one to the other—I heard a conversation in the next room, and wrote down as much as I could—I knew that Sammes was in No. 62—Fry entered that room and said, "I have brought Devenport here with leave to explain how the matter stands; now just tell Mr. Sammes what is being done"—Devenport said, "Well, it is just like this, I am waiting to get £150 from Walter Brown, as my man will not part with them unless he has the cash. I believe I made a mistake in intro<lb/>ducing Fry. I am sure it has delayed matters as we do not want so many in it"—Sammes said, "Well you know I have the cash, and am prepared to do business on production of the notes"—Devenport said, "Yes, I know, and I cannot expect you to part until you see the notes, but I will see Brown again, and then arrange an appointment to apply to tomorrow"—Fry and Devenport left—on the 8th I was again in room 61 with the same officers, about 11.40 a.m.—I heard a conversation in No. 62, and wrote down as much as I could—Sammes said, "Well, have you arranged"—Devenport said, "No, I have not got the money from Brown yet, but I have an appointment with him at 12.30, which I must keep, as I do not want to hang him up"—Sammes said, "Well, when can you complete the business?"—Devenport said, "I can be back at one"—Sammes then said, "You had better make it two as I have an appointment which I must keep '"—Devenport said, "Very well, I will be here at two"—I heard some<lb/>one leave the room—in the afternoon interview, when they met, Sammes said, "Well, have you got the notes"—Devenport replied, "Not yet, as I cannot get my man to come into the City with them, but if you will bring the money to him at the East End you can examine the notes there and do the business"—Sammes said, "The business must either be done here or at my office; is it all right?"—Devenport said, "Yes, I have been to Wynd<lb/>ham's house and seen the notes myself, they are so good you can put them down anywhere; I had no difficulty with mine; I expect to see Wyndham at the station in about a quarter of an hour; I have twenty five or at least twenty-three at home"—Sammes said, "No good to me, it would not pay me, I want the bulk, but I will consider your proposal and let you know later; I cannot get a reply before four, can you come back then"—"Devenport said, "Certainly"—I heard someone leave—then first Sammes land then Fry came into room 61—Fry brought what purported to be some £5 notes, put them on the table, counted them, and there were nine—the numbers were taken, and they were handed back to Fry—the third interview was in the same room at about 4.30—the same people were present—I heard Sammes say, "There are only nine notes here "'—Fry said, "There were ten"—Devenport said, "There should be ten, there were eleven '"—Sammes said, "I have decided to take a cab to any address you mention, and bring the money with me, and the business can be done in the cab, as I do not want to be seen by anyone of your people"—Devenport said, "Very well then,</p>

               <p>if you take a cab to Coburn Road Railway Station, Bow, I will meet you there and hand you the notes; you can then take them to the lavatory at the railway station, examine them, and do the business in the cab; you can return, and I will come on later by rail"—I then heard some people go out of No. 62—I do not profess to have taken down everything that was said—I was present at Coborn Road Station that evening with other officers—I saw Devenport go up to a policeman on point duty—I did not hear what he said, but the officer replied, "First to the right and second to the left"—Devenport went in the direction of College Street and returned with Brown—Atkins's description is accurate—I was present at the arrest of Wyndham and Gibbons.</p>

Early in February I had a com<lb/>munication from ex-Inspector Outram, and, as a result of that, on the morn-: ing of February 10th I heard a statement from Fry, and another one on the 11th—I saw him many times after that, and he received instructions from me and made reports from time to time—in consequence of his information I was able to place my men where observation was kept—on March 8th I was outside Coborn Road Station with six officers—two parcels were found on the floor of a cab there, which I opened and which contained what pur<lb/>ported to be 200 £5 Bank of England notes—Devenport and Brown were arrested on the spot—afterwards I went to 3, College Street, and arrested Wyndham and Gibbons—I said, "Wyndham, you are my prisoner, you must consider yourself in custody on charge of forging and uttering £5 Bank of England notes"—he said, "Mr. Davidson, I know nothing about any forged notes"—I said, "You had better go into the parlour"—as he</p>
