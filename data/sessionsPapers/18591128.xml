                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAMHENRYWELLS</hi>. I am a jeweller of 14, Corn-market, Oxford—about the latter end of August the prisoners came to my shop, and I made an exchange for them of some jewellery, these bright chains (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I paid them 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in exchange and bought some Napoleons of them then—they said that they expected a brother from Australia who was going to get married, and they would come when he arrived and buy a lot of things for wedding presents—Jacob and Rosa came two or three days afterwards but they merely talked about goods which they wanted—on Friday, September 9, they all came and selected a number of things, of which I made out this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) the same evening after they were gone—they are silver salts, forks, spoons, and all sorts of jewellery; my counter was entirely covered with them—my young man and my sister were also in the shop at the time—Rosa Levy fainted, and I went round the counter and helped her into a chair with the elder prisoner—he Said, "Give me some brandy"—I said, "I have none, but I have some very fine old rum"—he said, "That will do"—my young man fetched a bottle—Rosa had some and was restored—she had been about three quarters of an hour in the shop before she fainted—she had been taking part in the selection of the articles, but nothing had taken place to make her faint—Jacob wanted to know whether I had any loose diamonds—I said no, but that I could get some—I went to get some, but they would not arrive till the next day—he wanted some pearls for ear rings; I showed him a parcel to select from, and he selected four which were put on one side—when the counter was covered with articles Jacob selected from them—he continually</p>

               <p>put his hand in his pocket and took out a box; he had asked me, between the first and second occasion, whether I could get him a larger snuff-box; his was almost as big as my hand, and I said that I should have to make a larger one expressly—after Rosa recovered, Jacob asked for a violin which was hanging up; my young man got it down and Jacob began playing it in the shop—one tray which Jacob had selected, containing jewellery to a large amount, was taken at his desire into my back shop, and he went in there and played—my shopman was showing things also, and Jacob took him by the shoulder bodily to take him outside the window to show him a tray of coloured gold seals and keys which he wanted to look at—I told the young man not to go—I said, "Let him go out and point, and you can stay inside; but he took him by the arm and took him out—Louis first took up one thing and then another, and began to play again—Rosa fainted again, and had some more rum; they all had some; they drank half a bottle—the value of the goods they selected on the 9th was about 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they then said that they should require some diamonds, and some fine gold chains, and a lot of other things which I had not got in stock—they left my shop about half-past 6, Jacob saying that he would come next morning, when the invoice was to be made out, properly numbered, and pay for them and take them away—they said that they were going to stay in Oxford four weeks—they all left together, and Louis returned within two minutes and wanted to buy an opera glass apart from his father-in-law—while he was there Jacob came back and said something to him in German—he made a great to do and they both went away; they did not take the glass—after they had gone I missed a diamond ring which had been among the articles I had shown them, and after I had had my dinner I went to Solomon's to ask him if he would tell me where they lived, as they had told me that they had bought things of him—I went to the railway station and made farther inquiries, but could not find them till I saw them in custody—I examined my stock minutely on the Saturday, which is a busy day, and again on Monday—I missed six antique forks, six double thread fiddle spoons, ten pearls, eleven seals, a chain and other articles—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a ring which I took in exchange from them—this gold chain, pencil case, and ring, are mine; but I had not missed them till I saw them—I then went through my stock and missed eleven seals from the bunch of twelve—a dialogue had passed between us respecting the seals; they had the mark of a horse shoe, which is good luck, and I explained to the prisoners what good luck means—I must have thrown the bunch into the tray; they came from the same tray as the pencil case.</p>

               <p>appeared respectable—Mr. Solomons lives in the Corn-market about a dozen doors from me—mine is a large shop and well stocked—my sister was in and out of the shop; she went to fetch some water to mix with the rum when Rosa asked for it—I told Mrs. Evans that they had robbed me and mentioned a diamond ring—I do not think Rosa went into my back room after the tray was moved in there—the amount of foreign money, exchanged was I think, 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or perhaps more—I buy my jewellery of the manufacturers, but I make several short chains—the seals were all alike in pattern and cutting and were all strung upon a hoop ring, but the stones were various in colour—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the jewellery they exchanged with me—they spoke very good English.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a West India merchant, and carry on business at Lime-street, city—on 11th September I went out of town and remained out until 27th October—the prisoner was in my employment as a clerk—I had no other clerk or any other person at the office—when I left London I merely left him in charge to forward me the letters he received, and to let me know who called, and what was going on in the business—he wrote to me from time to time—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), dated 21st October, is in the prisoner's handwriting—I received this on the following day, the 22nd—this postscript is also his writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "P.S. The 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque received from Mrs. Logan I duly received and paid into the bank")—I received that by post—before I left London there was a bill for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coming due on 23d Sep<lb/>tember, drawn by Messrs. Blogg and Martin and accepted by me; this is it—it was payable at 1, Lime-street; my place of business—before I left London I had arranged with Mr. Martin that they should pay the bill; I paid the half of it, 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to Mr. Stevenson of Blogg and Martin's, and I gave my acceptance for the other 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was to be renewed for six months—it was arranged that when the 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill became due, Blogg and Martin were to send the money to my office—I think that was arranged about 10th September, the day previous to my leaving London—I told the prisoner that Blogg and Martin would send 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the following day, the 23d, to retire the bill—he knew that it was to be presented at my office, and I told him he would receive the amount of Blogg and Martin on the 23d to pay it—on the after<lb/>noon of 26th October I received this letter from the prisoner—I was then at Boulogne—<hi rend="italic">Part of this letter was read as follows:</hi> "I have now to call your attention to a matter of the greatest importance to myself, which causes me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280014"/>
               <p>great anxiety. You will no doubt remember that when you left London you told me that the said gentlemen (Blogg and Martin) would furnish me with the means to retire their bill for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which fell due on 23rd September, on which day they handed me 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without any explanation whatever; and upon observing your entry in my diary, viz. "65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. renewed for three months from date," I naturally concluded that some error had occurred, and that they had retained for some purpose 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and retained the bill themselves, as it was not presented here to my knowledge. I paid the amount, less a small deduction which I made on my own account, in to the Bank of England to your credit, for safety—on the following day a person (Mr. Stevenson) called here and told me that the bill had been returned to them unpaid, and that they had given their cheque for the amount, and requested me to return them the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they paid me on the previous day. I gave him a cheque, signed as I sign the letters; I wrote "per pro Logan brothers, H. Leach." Some time afterwards he called and told me the cheque had been refused payment; I then paid him 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, of my own money, and he gave me a receipt for it, which receipt is of course in my possession; but to my utter astonishment I received a note the latter end of last week, addressed to you, from Blogg and Martin, and which, as usual, I opened and found that from the purport of its contents that their clerk had misrepresented the circumstances of the transaction to them, and totally ignored the fact of my returning the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him; I shall therefore leave you to judge the effect this produced upon me. I immediately took the advice of a friend, who advised me to consult a solicitor upon the matter. I did so, and he wished me to send a copy of said letter to you and retain the original which I have now to hand you. I called this morning, in company with my solicitor, and saw Mr. Martin, and Stevenson positively denies having received the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me, except by cheque. At Mr. Martin's request I gave him your address, and he will doubtless communicate with you concerning the matter."—I left Boulogne the morning after receiving that letter and came to London—I did not go to my office but went direct to Blogg and Martin—I went to my office next morning, the 28th, and saw the prisoner—I told him that I had come over to inquire about this trans<lb/>action with Blogg and Martin, the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me that he held a receipt for the amount, that he had paid them 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my account, and he held a receipt for the amount—he did not show me the receipt—nothing else occurred for a day or two, when I went again to Blogg and Martin to converse with them on the matter, and make myself perfectly acquainted with the transaction—I told the prisoner that I had spoken to Mr. Stevenson on the matter and that he had denied altogether having received the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner still persisted that he held the receipt—a day or two afterwards I had a conver<lb/>sation with him about the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque; that was at my office—I asked him if he had paid it into the Bank of England—he said no, but he would make it all right with me; that he would take care to repay me the amount—I said "Very well, I shall see about that"—I had not at that time ascertained that the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had not been paid in to my account—I did not send for my pass<lb/>book fur a day or two afterwards, when I did, I found that no such sum had been paid in; I have the pass-book here to prove it; no credit is given to me for that amount—I did not say anything to him then, because I wished to let it stand over for a day or two until I had examined into the account, to see if it had been allowed in any other way—I had some conversation with him about the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day or two, afterwards; he said that he was very desirous to repay the amount, and he would see Mr. Williams, a friend of his,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280015"/>
               <p>and would get the money from him to repay it—nothing further took place until I gave him in charge to a policeman—before I gave him in charge he had said that he kept the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back, as he had made an advance of 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my account—I think he said that a few days after I came over from Boulogne—he repeatedly said that—I had not learnt from the prisoner before I came over on the 27th October that this money had not been paid in to my bankers—I continually received letters from him, generally every two or three days—his wages were 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

London, October 20th, 1859 Sir, on the 23d of last month we handed your clerk 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards your acceptance of 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due on that day, for which we should have sent the whole amount as arranged with you but through the amount having been entered by our cashier to the smaller amount in his diary. The bill was returned on the 24th unpaid. When we gave our cheque for the full amount, and made application to your clerk for the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be returned to us, his reply was that the bill had not been presented at the office. This was in reply to our telling him that he should have brought it to us and made some inquiry about it, as he acknowledged he knew he had to receive the whole amount from us; and he gave us a cheque for it on the Bank of England; upon presenting which it was refused payment, the bank not having his signature. We then requested him to send a cheque to you for your signature, which he said he did at once, and has been daily expecting to hear from you or to see you back. We cannot think that you are treating this matter in the manner you ought to have done, in as much as it was done for your accommodation, and you should have at once returned the cheque signed, to reimburse us for our cash; we therefore beg you will immediately on receipt of the present send us the amount. We are, sir, yours obediently, Blogg and Martin.")—the prisoner told me he would repay me the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before he told me he was retaining it for the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that, either on the 28th or 29th, I am not certain which—there was no one present at the conversation—I had not seen the pass-book at that time; I don't remember Mr. Wil<lb/>liams being present; he was present on one occasion, I think about the 28th, 29th, or 30th—it was a day or two after I had seen the prisoner—I can't say the exact day, perhaps it was the 29th—I first saw the prisoner alone—I am sure that I spoke to him about the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before I saw the pass-book—I think I spoke to him before I saw Mr. Williams—I did not know that the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been advanced until I received Blogg and Martin's letter at Boulogne, dated the 20th, and which the prisoner sent to me in his own letter—the first time I saw the prisoner he told me he had paid 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Stevenson and he held his receipt—I asked him where he got the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me that he had borrowed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Williams—Mr. Williams was present when that was stated and he confirmed it—I asked if he had any objection to show me the receipt for it—he said he would, but he never did—Mr. Williams is now bail for him in 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said at first that I should let Blogg and Martin bring the action for the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I would defend it—I afterwards said I should not defend it unless the prisoner's friends would guarantee the costs in any event, win or lose—I do not remember Mr. Williams saying that that was unreasonable, and he should not do it—he said he would see about it; he would inquire about it.</p>

               <p>—I did not see Mr. Baugham, an attorney—Mr. Williams did not say that if I did not like to defend the honour of my office, he, on the part of the prisoner, would not have anything to do with it, that he did not see why the prisoner should fight my battles—they did refuse to guarantee the costs—I think I gave the prisoner into custody a day or two after that, on Saturday, the 5th—if my costs had been guaranteed I could not say that I should have fought the action; that depended upon circumstances—if Blogg and Martin brought an action against me for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I expected the costs to be paid—I went over to the Continent to reside with my family—I was not at all pressed—the friends who had bills upon me, in consequence of a revolu<lb/>tion in South America, very kindly offered to renew them until the end of the revolution—I had bills to pay, but they were always taken up—the prisoner in his letters to me called my attention to bills to be met and so on—it was an object to gain time—when I went away I left the prisoner just sufficient money to pay postage, perhaps 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or something of that kind; I really can't remember—it was a small sum—it may have been 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was to let me know how the business was going on, and what persons called—I left him to attend to the business—he was to manage and attend to it and let me know what was going forward from time to time—the business is foreign business—it did not consist of renewing bills; but goods sent out to foreign countries—they were to be obtained from a variety of persons, correspondents—he had nothing to do with that—there was no business going on at that time, merely receiving letters, answering them, and writing over to me according to my directions—he was not to open all the letters, only a certain portion, not any foreign letters, merely those he thought of no consequence—he was to open English letters now and then—he had no authority from me to open the letter sent by Blogg and Martin; he ought not to have opened it—he was not to open foreign letters, but certain English letters, according to his own judgment—I left it entirely to himself, either to open them or send them on to me—I do not complain of his opening that letter—I did not say anything to him about that—before I went to Boulogne I was living at Eastburnham Grove—I did not return there; I gave it up when I went to Boulogne—I took my family with me—when my wife returned she did not go back to our house; she went into lodgings—the house was let—the prisoner's salary was 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he commenced at 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and it was increased to 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the salary was paid regularly up to a certain period—on 16th October I remitted to him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for two weeks' salary—I have a memorandum of it in my cheque-book—I re<lb/>mitted it from Boulogne—there was nothing due to him at that time—I had my cheque book with me—I sent him a cheque out of which he was to retain 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was not as much as 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to him for money advanced and for wages—I had been away for ten weeks—I had sent him over various cheques—I do not remember sending him any other cheque for salary except the one for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I think I did—I considered that on 16th October his salary was paid up to that date—the other eight weeks' salary had been paid previously to that—when he wanted money he had nothing to do but to write to me and say so—he did not write to me—I wrote over and asked him if he wished me to send him any money for his salary—he said it was of no consequence, and I sent him this cheque of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I don't think I had sent him any previous to 16th October—I left England on 11th September—up to 16th October I remitted him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I wrote to ask him to let me know if I owed him any money—I sent him over 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay into the bank; he did pay it in—he paid in 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal clerk to Messrs. Blogg and Martin, diamond merchants, in Bucklersbury—I have been in their employment nearly 17 years—I remember the transaction with reference to this 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I first saw the prisoner upon the matter on 24th September, at the office of his employer, Mr. Logan, 1, Lime-street square—I presented the bill to him; it had been returned to us as the drawers, and we paid it—I gave a cheque for it myself—I asked the prisoner how it was that he allowed the bill to be returned; he said the bill had never been presented there—I told him it must have been presented through the bankers whose names were upon it, and likewise by the notary in the evening, as the ticket was attached to it—he still persisted that it had not been presented—I had the bill with me at the time with the notarial ticket attached, and presented it to him—I asked him if Mr. Logan had not, previous to his leaving, given him instruc<lb/>tions that the bill would be presented on the 23d September; and, likewise, whether Mr. Logan had not told him that he had received the whole amount, 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from Blogg and Martin—his answer was that Mr. Logan had told him so previous to leaving—I then asked him how it was when he had only received 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that had been sent in error, that he did not come on at once to Blogg and Martin's to see how it was—he still said that the bill had not been presented; he gave no further reason—the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been sent to him on 23d September, the day before the bill was due—I then told the prisoner that, for Mr. Logan's honour, as there had been a mistake about the bill he had better go to the bankers and explain why it was that the bill had been returned, and that it was then taken up by us—I don't recollect his saying whether he would do so or not—I then said, as he had received the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. all he had to do was to hand me back that 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I had now taken up the bill; in fact I had given 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 23d and 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 24th—the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had sent him by a messenger the previous day—he replied that he could not do that, for he had paid the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the Bank of England,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280018"/>
               <p>but he would give me a cheque for it on the bank—he then took a cheque-book which was either lying before him or at the side of him, and he immediately wrote me a cheque signed, "Logan Brothers, per procuration, Henry Leach"—this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he took the cheque book to do it, as if he was regularly authorised to sign it, and handed it to me—it is for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 24th September—immediately that he gave me that cheque I gave him the 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, which, of course, he was entitled to, handing him back at the same time the receipt which he had given on 23d to our messenger, Richard Watts, for the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I wrote at that moment under the receipt, "Returned the above 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., per procuration of Blogg and Martin. Thomas Stevenson"—this is a copy of it, which was afterwards taken in our office—this is the original—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "1, Lime-street Square, 23d September, 1859. Received of Messrs.

Thomas Stevenson, 24th September, 1859")—that I wrote at the moment of receiving the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—nothing further took place at that interview—I took the cheque to the Bank of England to present it for payment on my road to Bucklersbury—it was not paid; the cashier attached a ticket to it stating that it was incorrectly signed—as near as I can recollect it must have been about 12, or a little after 12, when I called at the bank—I immediately returned to Mr. Logan's office, but did not find the prisoner there—the door was closed, and there was a ticket on the door, "Return at 1 o'clock"—I returned again but did not find him; the same ticket was on the door; that was between 12 and 1 o'clock—I was waiting about half or three-quarters of an hour—I went again just before 1 o'clock and stayed until perhaps a quarter past 1, and the prisoner did not come there—when I went the last time I found him there; he had come in—no, I beg your pardon, he was not there then—I did not see him there again on the Saturday—the ticket was still there, "Return at 1 o'clock"—I did not see him again till the following Monday the 26th—he then came to our office; but I should mention that on the Saturday afternoon after I had been there the last time, which was about a quarter past 1, I came back to Mr. Martin and reported to him what I had done; and later in the afternoon I sent on a messenger twice to Mr. Logan's office, but I did not see the prisoner again at all on that Saturday—he came to our office about the middle of the day on Monday and I saw him—Richard Watts and Charles Cooke were present—Cooke is a clerk in the office—Watts brought the prisoner round to my desk and I said to him—"I suppose you come about the cheque" he said that he had been to the Bank of England and he found that his signature was not authorised at the bank—I then, conformably to instructions I had received from Mr. Martin, told him to send a crossed cheque over to Mr. Logan by that night's post, with a request that he should return it against the cheque which had been dishonoured at the bank; that he promised to do and then left—I retained the cheque in my possession, not having a value for it—it was a verbal message that I sent by Watts on the Saturday—I have seen the letter dated 25th October, written by the prisoner to Mr. Logan—I positively swear that I never had the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the prisoner, and he knows it as well as I do—the only 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I received was by the dishonoured cheque on the Bank of England—I never received it in gold, or money, or in other way, I most positively swear.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you explain why it was, if this receipt was written at the time the cheque was given, that you put instead of "returned the cheque" or anything respecting the cheque, "returned the above 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the mistake that has caused this accusation against me—had I said, "by cheque" upon the receipt, it never could have happened—I considered I was dealing with an honourable man—that refers to the cheque and to that alone, because I attached it simultaneously with receiving the cheque—it is very common not to put "by cheque" when you receive a cheque; a very common practice indeed.</p>

I said I could get change outside; she would not give me the half-sovereign back; and there were three in the shop. Did it want three to pass a half-sovereign? One could have done that. It is a thing of daily occurrence to go in a shop and put money on a glass case; and really bad money is so common you can hardly tell it. I had taken the half-sovereign of a gentleman, I did not know it was bad.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant tun-man at Mr. Clutterbuck's brewery at Stanmore—the prisoner was engine-driver there—on 29th October I was sent into the tun-room—I went about half-past 7 o'clock in the evening—I concealed myself behind some tubs—I remained in that position about a quarter of an hour—I had a view of the yeast box, where the money for the yeast was put—the prisoner then opened the door and halloed three times—he then went to the second tun-room door and opened it and looked round and shut the door close—he then pulled a key out of his right hand trousers pocket and unlocked the drawer in which the money was kept that came for the yeast—he then put his left hand in, and in taking up some money he dropped some into the box again—I heard the money rattle—he then put his hand into his left hand trousers pocket; then pat his left hand into the drawer again, and put the contents into his left hand trousers pocket—I saw the hand passing from the drawer to the pocket—I could not see what was in the hand—it appeared as if he had something in it—he then put his hand a third time into the box, and put it into his left hand trousers pocket again—I then crawled to him on my hands and knees and caught his left hand, and said, "John, don't take it all"—he said, "All what?"—I said, "All the money"—he said it was a lie—I said, "It is true; I saw you"—and I said, "You are no friend of mine or you would not have done it"—we then had a bit of a scuffle; I pushed him away and locked the door and shut him in till Clarke came—the prisoner locked the drawer and put the key in his pocket—when Clarke came I unlocked the door and let him in, and I said to him, "John George has got the key of the drawer in his right hand trousers pocket, and the money is in his left; search him," but he did not—he did not understand the extent of the loss—the prisoner swore and said that he wished his own arm might drop off if he did it; he did not do it—I said to Clarke, "You search him"—Clarke said he did not know what to do—the prisoner said he would be d—d if he had got it, and he went out and said he must go to stop the engine—he went away and was from five to ten minutes gone—he came back and offered to be searched—I told him it was no use to search him then, he had got rid of it—on the Monday following he came to me and said he hoped I would think no more of it—he had no right to have the key of that drawer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am tun-man at the Stanmore brewery—on 29th October I sent the last witness into the tun-room to watch—the prisoner was engine driver at the brewery—the tun-room was my department—the prisoner only went to the tun-room to ask if the steam was wanted faster or slower, and when it was wanted—he had no business to go to the box in which the money which comes for the yeast is put—no one had a key to that box but Mr. Clutterbuck—I went that day and shook the door, and it was opened from inside by the last witness, and he said, "John George has been robbing the yeast box and taking the money out three times—he unlocked the drawer with his light hand, and put his left hand in the drawer three times, and put the contents in his left hand trousers pocket"—George declared that it was a lie—Harrington told him he was no friend to him as he was just come in there, and he might be accused of that which he had been doing—he pointed to George's pocket two or three times and said there was the money in his left hand pocket and the key in his right—George then ran and stopt the engine—he was but a very short time gone—when he came back again he offered to be searched and Harrington said, "It is no use to search you now, you have got rid of what you had"—the prisoner took a small key out of his pocket and some money not connected with the yeast, and declared that he had put nothing out of his pocket while he was gone—he declared that he had not done it—it was my duty to put the money, in the drawer—I had put money in it that day and for nearly a fortnight since it had been opened—when Mr. Clutterbuck came he opened it.</p>

               <p>vat was on a stand—I was working at that vat—I myself tried whether Harrington could see the tun-room from where he was concealed behind a tub and looking over the top of it—the tub was about four feet high I should think, or a little over, and not very great in diameter; there was a very clear view of the tun-room and the box from there—nothing could be more clear—I can't say how it was that the prisoner was not taken for more than three weeks.</p>

On 8th November, I went with Mrs. Dearlove to John Robinson's house—I saw the prisoners; told them that I held a search warrant and produced it—after searching the corners of the room, I asked Jane where her box was—she said, "Up stairs"—I accompanied the mother and daughter up stairs, and asked them both if they had anything in the house which did not belong to them—Jane said, "Nothing;" she pointed out her box to me and gave me the keys—I unlocked it and found a pin cushion, a cloth mantle, a coloured handkerchief, a silver pencil-case, two table mats, a wool mat, a photographic portrait of Mrs. Dearlove, two china crape shawls, three pairs of embroidered sleeves, one d'oyley, six pieces of lace, a piece of embroidery, two diaper napkins, a pink sash, a muslin collar, one book, and one pair of drawers—I asked the mother how it could be possible for these things to be in her house without her knowing something of it, and that I should feel it my duty to search her boxes and look if she had anything that did not belong to her—she said, "No; everything that is there belongs to me," pointing to a large box in the corner of the room; and there was also another box in the room, which she claimed—I searched them both, and found these four towels marked with Mrs. Dearlove's initials, one pillow-case, live pairs of childrens' drawers marked, two pinafores, a night-cap marked, a night-shirt marked, a white frock, an embroidered collar, two pieces of embroidery, a piece of new chintz, three brown holland jackets, a calico chemise marked, six china-plates, a china cup and saucer, a dessert-plate, two table-covers, two pairs of socks marked, a boy's shirt, and a coloured frock, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I showed them separately to Mrs. Dearlove as I found them, and she identified them—on further searching the room I found a counterpane, a pair of gloves, two pieces of crape, a shawl, a pair of Angola socks, and also a number of articles which there was a doubt about at the time—they were shown to Mrs. Dearlove, and she said they were her's—I told Eliza that I should take her in custody for receiving them, knowing them to be stolen—she said that she knew nothing about it; Jane told her that she had them given to her—I took her in custody and then made a further search, and found in a tea-caddy in the room down stairs seven duplicates; among which was one for a sheet and a shirt, pledged for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I obtained them, and Mrs. Dearlove identified them—there was another on August 8th for three shirts, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; one on 19th September for a sheet and table-cover, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; one on 27th September for a black silk handkerchief and a remnant of silk, for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; one on 24th October of a table-cloth for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; one on 25th October of two shirts for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and one on 17th October of a table-cloth for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was advanced altogether—the whole of the articles stolen was valued at 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I keep a lodging-house, and reside at 5, Mexican-terrace, Caledonian-road—on Tuesday, 8th November, the prisoner, Wood, came to me to hire lodgings, and he introduced Clarkson to me, the man who is now in gaol—they took the apartments and both resided there—the second week after that the prisoner Russell called on them—Mr. Wood was not at home—Clarkson went out and spoke to him—they seemed friendly—I did not hear what they said—on Wednesday, 23d November, Russell called again on Wood but did not see him, because he was in custody—he called five times altogether and did not see Wood once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Russell's Defence.</hi> Wood and Clarkson happened to meet me with a friend in the Caledonian-road; I had known Wood some years ago to be a respect<lb/>able man in the city, but when I met him I did not know him; my friend introduced him. We went to a public-house for some refreshment, and there Clarkson told me he had a large shop in Somers-town, and that I was the man to introduce them to certain houses to get goods. I said I could do so if their references were satisfactory; and they said they would pay half cash. I afterwards recognised Wood. We parted on this Sunday night, and they promised to call on me in a few days and let me know how they pro<lb/>gressed. They did not call; I happened to be passing by where they lived, and I called and asked if Mr. Wood was in; Clarkson came out and said he was not in, but he would call at my house; they called there on the following Sunday, and we had a few minutes conversation. I said "I will meet you to-morrow at one o'clock;" I met them about half-past one on the Monday, and we entered into the affair. I was to introduce them, and they were to pay half cash for the goods. We waited at a public-house about two hours, and then we went towards St. John-street-road; Clarkson wanted to go into some house, and I went in with them; he asked for some paper at the bar, and walked directly up stairs as if he knew the house, the landlady and other people behind the bar looking at him full in the face. Why did they not</p>

               <p>stop him if this was a private place? he came down, went right out of the house, and beckoned to the man to follow him; he did so, and one of them said they should be back in a minute; I stood at the bar but they did not come back; I then went into the yard and saw Clarkson standing there; he said, "Oh, he has gone on a little business, we shall see him presently at another place." He took me down to Salter's Hotel; I never knew it before; we went in and called for a chop; Wood came in and whispered to Clarkson for some time; he then left the room, and, according to the evidence of the head waiter, he missed a coat from the rack; Clarkson then offered to treat me to a glass of gin and water, and we went into the smoking room, and, it getting rather late, Clarkson wanted to get rid of me. I went out at the door and went home; afterwards Clarkson went into the passage, and was taken into custody. I told the officer that I had not been into any hotel in London for twelve months.</p>

               <p>more that night after she went up stairs the second time—on Wednesday morning, about 7 o'clock, I saw the eldest girl come down stairs, and about half-past 7 I heard slaps; heavy, loud, sounding slaps, of the same kind I had heard before—I did not hear any screams; the prisoner was upstairs at that time, and the other little girl—I saw her about half-past 8 o'clock come down stairs, she seemed to be in a very great hurry, with her bonnet on and her shawl on her arm; she rushed past our window—I saw her come back again about a quarter to 9—she then ran up stall's about as far as her room door; there is a small passage at the top of the stairs—the stairs are fronting the door—she screamed as soon as she got to the top, by her room door, and then ran down the stairs again—I directly went to my room door, and said, "Mrs. White, what is the matter?"—she said, "Oh! my little Jemmy is gone"—the little boy was called Jemmy—I said, "Why, he is not dead?"—she said, "Yes he is; go and see"—I ran up the the stairs and went as far as her room door, but did not go inside—I could see the child lying on the bed; it appeared to be dead—I did not go near enough to touch it; it had a covering over it—I said to the prisoner, "Yes, so he is;" and I said, "Where have you been?" she said, "I have been to the doctors"—I said, "Is he coming?" and she said, "Yes; but I don't know when"—I then said, "Oh, pray run and fetch somebody;" and we both ran down stairs—Mrs. Offen, who lived nearly opposite to our house, was called, and then the doctor came—I went up stairs with the doctor; I was so frightened that I did not notice what the doctor said, or what the prisoner said—she told me on the Monday, as the child died on the Wednesday, that it had been very loose in its bowels, and made a great deal of dirt—on the Wednesday morning she told me the child had not made her any dirt—she said she had punished it, and she did not think it would make tier any more dirt—I said, "What have you done to it?" and she said, "Last night, when the other children went to bed, I took it up stairs, and heard it its prayers and undressed it, and instead of putting it to bed, I tied it to the bedstead"—I said, "La, sure, sure you never kept it there all night"—and she said, "Yes I did, till 7 o'clock the next morning"—and I said, "Poor little thing, I wonder it had not untied itself and got into bed"—she said, "No, I tied its hands down"—I said, "Why it must be dropping down with sleep, where is he now?"—she said, "He is down stairs with the other children"—that was all that was said then—I heard some slaps on Saturday night—that was the Saturday night before the child died—I had heard them on previous occasions, but I cannot tell the distinct times.</p>

On the morning of 28th September last; I went to 4, Clarence-cottages, Hackney, from information I received about half-past 9—I went up stairs into the bedroom, and I saw a child, between 3 and 4 years old, lying dead on the bed; the prisoner was not in the room then—the child was dressed—there were marks of violence upon, the head—I observed some bruises on the right cheek; two scratches, also a bruise or wound on the left side of the head—while I was examining the child, she came in—I asked her whether she was the mother of the child; she made no reply; I then asked her whether that was her child; she said, "No"—I asked her whether she could account for those bruises on the child's head; she said, "I do not know; I was out all day yesterday, and they were not there when I left home"—I then asked her who had care, of the child during her absence; she said, "The girl;" pointing to Fanny—after that I left the house, and went to the surgeon, Dr. Haycock, and asked him whether he could certify the cause of the child's death; he said he could not until he had made an examination—I went a second time that day to the house, I should say about 11 o'clock—I went with the coroner's officer to make inquiries; I questioned the little girl as to whether the child had received any hurt the day before—I went again the next evening at 6 o'clock, and searched the house; and in a cupboard in the down stairs room, I found these pieces of cord—I produce the foot-rail of the bed—it is the top rail at the foot of the bed—I did not make the little model—the foot-rail crosses the top of the post—that is the position in which it was when I found it—there are some dents on it, and a little <hi rend="italic">fluff,</hi> which I have put</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Hackney—I remember the prisoner bringing the little boy to my surgery in September—I cannot fix the precise day, but it was about a week prior to the child's death; it was at that time suffering from an abscess at the side of the face—the prisoner said it was caused by an injury the child had received when falling on the stairs—I opened the abscess—there were no bruises about the face, except just round the abscess, which would be very likely to be the result of the injury she mentioned—two days afterwards, the prisoner came again with the child; the wound was then healing—the abscess was on the left side just below the cheek-bone—I asked her the first time, whether she was able to procure proper nourishment for the child—she said she was not, as the father of the child was away, and I then relieved her with some trifle to get some nourishment for the child, and it was much better the second time she came—the first time it came, it appeared out of health and generally weak—on Wednesday morning, the 28th, the prisoner came to my surgery about half-past 8 o'clock, and asked me to go immediately, as her child was dying or dead; she did not seem to know which—she was exceedingly excited with grief, fran<lb/>tic, and exceedingly distressed in manner—she went back to her house, and I followed her down the street—when I got to the house, I think 1 found her in the room—J went up into the bedroom, and found the child I had seen the week before, on the bed, with its head on the pillow, partially dressed—it had nothing on but its clothes—it was not covered with any sheet, or anything except its own clothes—it was quite dead—the body was quite warm; it could have been dead but a very short time—its face was clean, and the skin had a whitish appearance, as if it had been recently washed—there was a show of blood at each nostril—on the right side of the face there were numerous brusies, a very large one especially under the eye—the prisoner was behind me, and I turned to her and inquired how those brusies came—she said she did not know, as the child was in bed when she came home the night before, and she had not been disturbed by it all night, and when she awoke in the morning the child was dying, or very ill—she said she had been out all the previous day—the little girl Fanny was in the room at the time—I asked her whether she knew anything about these bruises, and I could get no distinct answer from her—I gave information to the police, and on the following day, the 29th, by direction of the coroner I made an examination of the body—I have here my notes made at the time—the examination was made thirty hours after the supposed time of death, at three o'clock in the afternoon—the body was clean and well nourished—the age of the child</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280049"/>
               <p>was apparently about three years—the scalp was covered with very thin hair at the back part, the scalp was nearly bald, the hair was of unequal lengths at different parts of the head—on the lower portion of the left parietal bone there was a wound, just above the ear, half an inch in length, gaping in the middle, to the extent of quarter of an inch in length; there was a slight ecchymosis around it, and the surface of the wound was glazed as if it had been done some short time, the blood was dry and glazed over it—on the lower portion of the right bone on the corresponding side there was an ecchymosis as large as a sixpence—there was a small cicatrized wound, a wound of old date that had been, healed, in the same position—on the back part of the right ear towards the lower portion there was an abrasion of the cuticle and a slight ecchymosis—there was no corresponding appearance on the left ear—on the back part of the head there were many marks of old bruises of a yellowish tinge—on the face there were many small ecchymosis about the forehead, and nearly the whole surface of the right side of the face was covered with ecchymosis, the largest of which was under the eye—those ecchymosis on the lower portion of the face were in the direction of two curves passing from the chin towards the ear, narrow lines of bruises about half an inch in width—I made a sketch of the face—I particularly examined the state of the wound that was unhealed from the abscess, and the edges of it were still open, and there was a little blood inclined to ooze from it; it was not quite healed, otherwise it was in a healthy state—a bloody fluid, to the amount of about a drachm, exuded from the nostrils on turning the head to one side—under the chin there were extensive ecchymosis and a narrow abrasion, which I afterwards tried the cord with—there was also a large ecchymosis on the front of the throat—there was no distortion of features, the conjunctiva, or whites of both eyes were pale; the jaws very firmly closed so as only to be separated by great violence—the back of the left wrist, and the front of the right were marked by a line of ecchymosis of nearly half an inch in width; that line was continuous when the front of the left wrist was placed over the back of the right—there was no mark on the front of the left wrist or the back of the right, so that the hands must have been tied together; the same cord did not go round each separately—if that mark was made with a cord, the cord must have gone continuously round both hands—on the forearms there were marks of ecchymosis of different colours, and therefore of different date—there was a line of ecchymosis to be traced continuously across the chest, round the outside of both arms, and behind across the spine and shoulders, but most apparent on the right arm and on the chest; this line was not to be traced under either of the arms; if that was made by a cord, it must have gone over both arms and round the chest; the line was not be traced so distinctly behind as in front, only faintly—there were two lines of ecchymosis of older standing, across the loins, and numerous small ecchymosis over both legs and outside both hips—those were the whole of the external appearances—I have seen some portions of rope—I tried different portions of the rope to the different marks on the child, and each portion that fitted was marked accordingly—one rope fitted distinctly the marks round the chin, and another the marks round the hands—I subsequently removed the scalp and opened the head—on raising the scalp there were clots of blood on both the parietal bones, corresponding with the external bruises, and of very recent date—in many portions there were only stains, as if the ecchymosis had taken place some time previously, and the blood been absorbed—on the back part of the head there were several spots of extra<lb/>vasated</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280050"/>
               <p>blood more recent than any of the others—on opening the head an enormous coagulum was found, covering the upper surface of the left hemisphere of the brain, on the right side of the head, a coagulum was also found in the lower portion of that hemisphere of the brain—the effusion of blood on the brain would explain the cause of death—the veins at the base of the brain were very much gorged with blood—the quantity of blood effused amounted to at least half an ounce; the brain and mem<lb/>branes themselves were perfectly healthy—there were slight traces of old disease in the chest, but from which the child had recovered some time previously—there were marks of old adhesion on both sides of the pleura, more particularly the left, but that was old disease—the ecchymosis over the windpipe was found to be of a very superficial character, and there was no constriction or narrowing of the larynx internally—I gathered from that that death was not caused by strangulation, the pressure on the larynx had been but slight, the bruise was only external—the stomach was quite empty, and the small intestines nearly so, the large intestines contained a small quantity of feculent matter, which indicated that the child had had but little food for some time previous to death—the child died from apoplexy; from the effusion of blood on the brain, resulting from the rupture of some small vessels—if a child were to be tied to a bed with its head hanging down, and was left in that position for several hours, the result would probably be apoplexy—there was no external mark that would account for death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On what day did you make the post-mortem exami<lb/>nation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Thursday the 29th—I had not heard at that time that the child had been tied up—I did not find any remains of old inflammation in the membranes of the brain; I found some extravasated blood partially absorbed, under the scalp, but not in the brain; that was from an old bruise of a very trifling character—I did not find within the cavity of the skull corresponding marks to the two wounds on the left and right parietal bones; I did underneath the skin outside the skull—they were both recent injuries—there were old ones and new ones as well—when I saw the child it was quite recently dead; it was quite warm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Considering the state in which you found the child, do you think it possible that it could have remained with its head hanging down from 9 o'clock at night till 7 the next morning and then be alive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I think it is possible—from the evidence detailed as to the way in which the child was tied, it would have power for some hours to keep its head up, when the muscles became so tired that the head fell forward, of course, the fatal symptoms would be apt to ensue—a child tied horizontally would not have the power of keeping its head up for any great length of time—I think if its head was hanging down it would cause death within a few hours, but I cannot speak as to the precise number of hours, perhaps from six to twelve, but I cannot speak positively one way or the other—I think the fact of this being a weakly child would not make any difference—the inference I drew from the marks under the chin and round the head, was that its mouth was tied up by something—I examined the bandage that went round the head, and it would not correspond in the least with the marks round the cheek—the marks round the cheek, under the chin, and over the head were caused by a cord, and not by a bandage; it was a broad bandage—there, was no trace of the bandage having become hard or being rucked up; I examined it and it was perfectly flat—apoplexy from ordinary causes is hardly ever found in children of that age—I never met with such cases, and as a simple</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280051"/>
               <p>disease I know of none—form whatever cause the blood vessels had given way the appearances would be the same—I have no experience of any child suffer<lb/>ing from apoplexy, and I never knew any one that ever saw it—if it had been from an old injury the state of the blood would have been totally different—the blood would have been altered in colour and partially absorbed, but it was of a dark colour and very recent—I do not know that concussion sometimes weakens the blood vessels of the brain—as soon as effusion takes place to any considerable extent it produces insensibility, and loss of power and motion—the child was brought to me about a week before its death by the prisoner for me to attend to it—she also brought it herself a second time—it was then decidedly better, that was two days after the first visit—when she came to me on the Wednesday morning she was frantic with grief—she hurried home, and I followed her within a few yards—she was very anxious for me to come—I found the child on the bed partially dressed, it had on ft night<lb/>gown and a small frock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked if a child could live long if its head were hanging down; would that depend upon the amount of support the head might have had during the time the child was tied up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Entirely; and a little also upon the muscular strength of the child as to how long it would be able to hold its head up, and upon accidental causes which I cannot particularize—there seemed to have been a ligature passing from above the head round under the chin; if that had been supported by the bar it would have enabled the child to live for some time in that position—I did not find any injuries about the head that would make it more disposed to an attack of apoplexy—there were two portions of extravasated blood on the scalp, one within the brain; the latter was the cause of death—I should mention, that on examining the bed, the ping of the bed, to which the rail was attached, were found very much bent—I examined the bed myself after hearing this detailed account at the Police-court, and found the two pins very much bent, as if a heavy weight had been attached to the cross-bar—I have also tried, for the sake of the experiment, what a child of that age would be likely to weigh, and I found it was between thirty and forty pounds—experiments have been tried with the bar, which will bear a great deal more than the weight of the child—I think the child must have had some support to the head during the night to have been alive all those hours—I found a large mark under the chin; if a cord had been passed under the chin, and been attached to the rail above, that would have supported the child—I traced the mark all round the head, the line was not very distinct across the top—my belief is, that the band underneath the chin was put to keep the child quiet—from my examination of the wrists, I formed the opinion that the hands were tied in front of the body, because, when the hands were put in that position, they seemed to have fallen so naturally; the relative position of the hands would have been the same if crossed behind, but the elbows were slightly inflexed; it would depend mainly upon the position in which the arms were put just at the time of dying.</p>

                  </hi> I am porter at Fenton's hotel—the prisoner arrived there on 29th October—he stayed about thirteen days—he gave me a piece of paper folded up—I asked him what it was; he said, "It is my bill," or "The amount of my bill; give it to the <hi rend="italic">governor</hi>"—I gave it to one of the waiters—(<hi rend="italic">Read: "Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went to stay at Mawrigg's hotel in October, and had been there six days when the waiter presented me with my bill, asking me if I would give a cheque for the amount, and not having sufficient cash on me to discharge it, I wrote a cheque for the amount on Beckett and Co. knowing at the same time that they could not get it cashed, because I kept no account at the house; but the reason I did it was this, a person in the City, who is indebted to me upwards of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had promised me the amount in three days' time, and when I was asked, I did not like to say that I had not got the money to pay it, but I thought I should be able to make all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280054"/>
               <p>right when I got my money. The next day I was in the Strand, and hap<lb/>pened to meet my friend; I told him what I had done. He said he was going to Aldershott the next day, to receive some money, and when he got it, he would pay me without fail; when the next day came, I thought if I could be there when he got the money, I could get mine at once; I accord<lb/>ingly went to Aldershott, but before going, I left word at Mawrigg's where I was going, and if there were any letters for me the next day, to forward them to me, and also saying that I expected to be back in one or two days. When I arrived at Aldershott, I found my friend had been and had gone away an hour before I arrived; so I came back to London, and not liking to go back to Mawrigg's, as I had not got the money I expected, I went to Fenton's hotel, in St. James's-street—the third day I was there, I met my friend, when he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I told him that was no use to me; he said it was all that he had, and he had a bill due on 10th November, when I should have the whole amount. On 5th November, Fenton's waiter presented me with my bill, when I wrote him out a cheque on Seward and Co. knowing also when I did it, that they could not get it cashed, as I kept no account at the bank, but as I was going to receive my money in five days, I thought I should be able to make all satisfactory. To prove that there was not the slightest intention to defraud any of the parties, when I had done it I did not leave the hotel, as a person would have done had he meant any wrong; but I was in the hotel three days after, expecting my money next day, when I was fetched by a detective. Had I known it would have turned out so serious a case, I should never have attempted it, as I had not the least intention to defraud any one.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, and have been in practice in London for some years—if a wound is inflicted on the abdomen with a knife, so that the bowels protruded, death would be likely to occur within a few hours; and if the intestines obtruded and were cut, the wound would be fatal within a short time: internal hemorrhage would probably be the cause of death; the perforation of the intestines at that part is of a very dangerous character.</p>

Q.</hi> Might the intestine protrude through the external wound without itself being lacerated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and on the wound being inflicted, the omentum would be likely to protrude as well as the in<lb/>testine; but there is hardly anybody so ignorant as not to know the gut when they see it—the peritoneum has a bright shiny appearance, and sup<lb/>posing the intestine in passing through the wound pushed the peritoneum before it and a portion of the omentum, an unpractised eye might mistake it for the intestine itself—I have operated for hernia, and have had cases in which not only the gut, but the omentum protruded—I have seen the omentum protruded in greater proportion than the gut, and perhaps an un<lb/>practised eye could not detect one from the other—if the intestine is no lacerated, but merely protruded, and is replaced, the person might recover; it would not be so dangerous: even supposing peritonitis sets in; it is not incurable—a person having received such a wound at this might die hours afterwards or days afterwards from aneurism of the heart or apoplexy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a senior clerk in the Post-office—in consequence of some information I made up a letter on 29th October—I put into it a half-sovereign, a two-and-a-half-dollar piece, and twelve penny postage stamps—I put them into the slits of a piece of card, closed the card and money in a plain envelop, which I folded up—I then placed a sheet of paper round the first envelope, and put the whole into a second envelope, which I fastened with adhesive gum—I directed it to "Miss Lever, Mrs. Brown, Lorrimer Academy, Highgate-hill"—I gave the letter to Willis Clare, one of the Inspectors of letter-carriers, with directions to post it at Mr. Burfield's, one of the Strand post-offices—the letter, if posted according to my directions, would have gone by the 11 o'clock collection to the district in Holborn, and have reached there about fifteen minutes past 11 in the ordinary way—I proceeded to the Western Central District Office in Holborn to await the arrival of the 11 o'clock delivery—upon looking over the bag brought from the Strand district I found that letter—upon examining it I found that it was not in the same state in which I had given it to Mr. Clare—the seal had been opened—the adhesive gum seal had been raised and refastened—it is easy to open those by putting the gum over hot water, or by wetting them—I then cut the outer envelope open along the bottom, and took out all the contents—the inner envelope had not been fastened with gum; I merely folded the card in the inner envelope—I found that the half-sovereign had been taken out—upon that I went to Mr. Burfield's shop in the Strand, and there saw the prisoner—he was attending to the post-office duties there—I asked him if he made the 11 o'clock collection; he said he did—I asked him if he had any person to assist him; he said he had not—I then said that a money letter, addressed to Miss Lever, Highgate-hill, had been posted there between 10 and 11 o'clock; that, letter had been opened, and a half-sove<lb/>reign taken from it—I said, "Do you know anything of the half-sovereign?"—he said ho did not remember seeing the letter; he cleared all the letters out of the box, and despatched them himself—I said, "Did you have any person to assist you in the post-office business this morning at all?" he said he had not—I then directed the officer Smee to search him, and he took from the prisoner's pocket 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I then requested the prisoner to show me where he kept the gold, or his money, and he did so—he went to the drawer, and from it he took a small tin box—I examined the contents of it, and found in it 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and a half-sovereign—I examined the</p>

               <p>half-sovereign, and found it to be the one I had inclosed in the letter addressed to Miss Lever—the half-sovereign bore my private mark—I found that mark upon it—the box was taken from a drawer close to the letter-box—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the half sovereign; it has my private mark upon it—I said to the prisoner, taking it into my hand, "This half-sovereign was inclosed in the letter directed to Miss Lever, how do you account for its possession?" he said, "I took a half-sovereign over the counter this morning between 10 and 11 o'clock, for postage stamps"—I said, "Where is that half-sovereign?" he said, "That is it," pointing to the one produced—I said, "No, this half-sovereign was inclosed in the letter addressed to Miss Lever;" he said, "That is the only one I have had; I took it for postage stamps"—it is the money of the Postmaster General—it was about ten minutes past 10 o'clock that I gave the letter to Clare—he is an inspector of letter-carriers—he always assists me in this sort of business—I had acquainted him with the object for which this letter was made up.</p>

I am a labourer at Plaistow—on the afternoon of 16th November, I saw the prisoner at Plaistow-park, coming from the direction of Upton—I afterwards saw him cross to Mr. Waller's house and throw something down and the duck flew to him, more than walked—he directly picked the duck up, placed it under his coat and ran away—there were two other young men with him—they went on first and he followed them directly—I jumped over the fence and ran after him—I called out, "Drop that duck"—he turned round, and owing to it being a strange place I lost sight of them all three—I am sure he is the man.</p>

He said I should not get into any trouble about it. Several times we have had words about the horse, but he would not give the horse up again. On Saturday last we had words, and I threatened to hit him in the eye, because he would not give the horse up. He laughed at me, and said he had got what would clear him.

He asked me to make a receipt out I could not write, and I refused to do so the first night; I came to his wishes the next night; I did not know then whose the horse was. When I knew it was a stolen horse I wished to turn it out. On the Monday night following I assisted in turning it out. I went to his house, and asked him to let me turn it out, and he refused. He went with me to the stable. I did not know the way to the London fields; he showed me the way, and I left the horse on the field; and the Sunday following I was by his house, and I asked him if he had seen anything more of that horse. He said he had got it up in the stable then. I told him I would have nothing more to do with it, as it was a stolen horse. He told me he did not get me into any trouble with the horse. I heard of it being lost several times; I wished to let it go, so that the owner should find it, but he refused. We had great words about it. Before the receipt was made out, he cut some part of the horse's tail. I asked him what it was for, and he said it was because it should not be known. I believe Mr. Prothero found that part of the tail had been cut off.</p>

I often engage his cart;" I said, "Did you engage it on that morning?"—he said, "I did, and when Freeman came to my house to do the job he would not do it"—I said, "What was done with the cart?"—Harvey said, "We both got into the cart and went to market"—I said, "What market?"—he said, "Spitalfields"—I said, "Did you go anywhere else?"—he said, "No, I am quite sure of that"—I afterwards took them to the station—I said they were charged with stealing the nails from the dock—when we were going to the police-court in the morning Freeman said, "If you will make me a witness, or the Magistrate will admit me to bail, I will assist you in recovering the property, and in bringing the parties to justice, as I was only drawn into it"—the Magistrate was spoken to respecting what the prisoner had said, and he refused making him a witness, or admitting him to bail—he said all this voluntarily to me—this was after the remand—he said, "I have taken the property to my stable and unloaded it—it remained there till the afternoon—Harvey came and took the property away to a place in Helithorpe-street, Poplar"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "Harvey has taken it in my cart to Watson's, and disposed of it, and I fetched the cart away"—I may have omitted a little of the conver<lb/>sation: Freeman said in his statement—"While we were waiting for Harvey we went into the Bull and Anchor at the entrance of the Victoria-docks to get something to drink, and while I waited there, Harvey took the cart away and went over the swing bridge at the entrance of the Victoria docks, and in about twenty minutes returned with the cart"—I said, "Did you accompany him in the cart?"—he said, "I did, and got into the cart and rode as far as the East India-docks"—that was after the return—I asked what was in the cart at that time, and he said, "Something resembling gunny bags"—I asked him how many were in, and he said he thought no more than four or five—I said, "Do you think there is seven or eight hundredweight?"—he said, "No, not more than four or five;" that he got out of the cart at the corner of the East India-dock, and went into a coffee shop to have a cup of coffee, and while there, Harvey had taken the cart away, unloaded it, and returned it to the same place—I afterwards appre<lb/>hended Pomfret—he came out of Freeman's house in St. Leonard's-road, Bromley at a quarter to one on Monday morning, 8th or 9th November—I had been there all Saturday and Sunday night waiting for him—I called</p>

I am 17 years old—I reside with my relatives in Plough-road, Rotherhithe—on Sunday, the 30th October, I went to Brighton by an excursion train—I had a third-class ticket—I went with my uncle about 6 o'clock that evening to the station—I saw Mr. French there; he said he would ride with me—I got into a third-class carriage with him—I was alone with him in the carriage—I told him I did not like that carriage, I would sooner go in another one, and he got out to look for another, but he came back and said, "Never mind, this is a nice carriage; we shall be nice and warm here"—when the train started he began talking about love, and saying what a nice place the country was for lovers to make love in—I did not answer him, but he kept on, and shortly afterwards, when we got in the dark, he put his arm round me and tried to kiss me, and put his hand up and down about my knees, with his hand outside my gown—I resisted that, and got up and stood against the window—I said I would get in another carriage—the prisoner did not do anything else to me—he was not long in doing it—he wanted to know if there was any recompense he could make, and would I forgive him—he kept talking, but I made no answer; and when the train came to the Three Bridges, I spoke to the guard and told him what had happened, and insisted on getting into another carriage, and went</p>

               <p>on till I came to New Cross—I there saw the defendant—he had been locked in the carriage—I there made a complaint—he said he was very sorry, and offered me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I would not give him in charge, as he had a wife and a large family—he said, in presence of the guard, that he was very sorry for what he had done—I told him I was a respectable person, and I never gave him any encouragement, nor spoke to him at all—I said to the guard, "Take me out of this and put me in another carriage, this man has been insulting me;" and he took me out and put me in another carriage—when I got home I made a communication to Mrs. Hammerly, my aunt—I told her I did not like to go before the Magistrates—I never went in my life before, and I did not like to go.</p>

I am the brother of the last witness, and also work in Her Majesty's Dockyard, Deptford—in the evening of 17th October, I was in New King-street, with my brother—I saw the prisoners in the alley leading out of New King-street—Scamel came up and tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "Do you owe me a spite"—I said, "No, if I do, I forgive you"—my brother said, "You are a fine man, and you would kill us all"—he then knocked my brother down—when they were down, my brother said, "Patrick, he is eating me"—I tried all I could to extricate him, and I did—I brought him to the lamp and saw that his nose was cut on both sides—I took him to a chemist and got his nose strapped—about an hour afterwards, I was going to my door with him, thinking all was over—the female prisoner was standing at her door—I did not know that she had anything in her hand—she struck my brother and knocked him down, and then I took him to my own house till he was taken to the doctor's the second time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon practising at Deptford—John Ahearn was brought to my surgery at 1 o'clock in the morning of the 18th—I found a large wound on the top of his head, the left side, 3 inches long; a contusion over the brow, and a wound, on the nose, which could arise from a bite.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that a likely way of its being produced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Possibly—I did not see it early afterwards—I was not the first person he was brought to.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler and have kept the Free<lb/>mason's Tavern, nearly opposite the dockyard, Woolwich, for four years and a half—it is a large house—there are two compartments, the hotel side and the bar side—the doors come into the same street, we have officers there and the lodges, persons frequently come there after the last train has started—on Sunday night, 6th November, a little before 11 o'clock, I was about to close the house—the barmaid and the potboy were in the bar—there were sixteen or eighteen Irish men and women in the little parlour—the prisoners were among them—I told them to go out, as it was time to close, and while I was speaking a man deliberately broke a glass on the table—I said "You will have to pay for that"—he said "I did not do it"—I said "You will have to pay for it, and I shall have no nonsense about it"—the whole of the company then rose; jostled him out and jostled me out with him—I found if I remained outside I should have violence—I came in and directed the potboy to close his room—I assisted to close the doors, supposing the house to be empty—I then went to the hotel side and got the gentlemen all out except two friends of mine—I bolted the door and fastened the Bramah latch—I heard a great knocking outside and people hallooing "Let us in, let us in"—I told my waiter to let nobody in—the people could not open those doors and they went round to the hotel and burst the doors in—I tried to resist their further entrance, but about a dozen of them came in—the prisoners were the two first men that entered the house—they caught hold of me, pushed me along the passage, chased the potboy to the end of the passage and forced him against the bar parlour door, which burst open, and he got under the table—I could not find my wife, and I went into the passage again, fighting my way as well as I could—I looked into the bar and saw five or six men beating my barmaid, pulling her hair out and otherwise illtreating her—they attacked me and beat me about the head—I defended my face—I had been very ill during the last week, and I was nearly knocked down by them—they pulled out my hair—my potboy seeing my position attacked some of them with some implement, and they left me and chased him up stairs—I got out of their grasp, and there was not a single soul left in the house but the parties who were hurting us—in about a quarter of an hour, policeman 239 came—we had previously sent three messages to the dockyard for policemen, and they would not come—during that time they were hitting me and the barmaid—I ran before her for protection, and said, "What do you want, do you want drink or money; take anything, so that you leave the house"—the spirits were set on, and the glasses and plates broken, a box of cigars were strewed about the bar, everything was in a state of confusion; and they throttled my wife—the policeman behaved very well; he defended himself against numbers—Linahan deliberately struck me in the passage in the policeman's presence and split my lips—I gave him into the policeman's hands—the others at<lb/>tempted a rescue—the policeman said, "You must come with me directly to the police-court"—My wife was outside without her bonnet looking for the police; at, the time I gave Linahan in custody, Buckley was standing</p>

               <p>laid hold of me: five or six of them—they took me by the hair, threw me down on the floor on my back, and while I was down I was kicked several times—I had a net on my head which was pulled off with a quantity of my hair, which was picked up next morning—I was partly dragged through a window in the bar by my hair by Linahan—he tried to hit me first of all, and when he found he could not do that he caught me by my hair—Mr. De Grey came to protect me, and I saw Buckley strike him in the mouth—I could not identify any one who kicked me, because as fast as I got up I was kicked down again—I had marks of it for a fortnight.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 177). Soon after new years day last I received a description from Mrs. Duggen of a person, and have been look<lb/>ing out for him since then till 1st November—when I took the prisoner about 9 o'clock at night, he was in company with another man in Redcross-street.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280116"/>
               <p>Borough—I went across the road, and asked him what his name was?—he I said, "Anderson"—I asked him where he lived?—he said, "In Tottenham—I court-road"—I said, "You are a long way from home; I have got some knowledge of you, I believe; I want you for something or other, but I cannot call to mind now what it is"—he said, "I am sure you don't know me; you don't want me for anything"—I walked by his side about three quarters of a mile, till we got to Union-street, Borough, and then asked him if he would have the kindness to take off his cap?—he said, "You are taking too much liberty, policeman"—I then took his cap off, and said, "You are Butcher Bill"—I knew that, because he had no hair at the back of his head—I told him I should take him in custody, and whatever answer he made to the charge, I should tell the Magistrate—he said, "Thank you," and went quietly with me to the station—he said, going along, "I do not know anything about that robbery; the person who committed that robbery is still in the Mint"—I had told him that it was for highway robbery—I said, "It is very strange if the person who committed such a daring robbery was still in the Mint, and that you should disappear up to the present night"—he said, "Well, I was in the-public house"—I said, "I mentioned nothing about the public-house"—he said "The prosecutor and prosecutrix were drunk in the public-house, which the potboy can prove"—he went quietly to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi>—I had only been home from Ireland for a week—I had been serving at Clonmel in the militia, which I joined on 5th November, 1857—I was ill with fever, and all my hair came off—I was left behind there in consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How came you to know me by my having no hair? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By seeing you when you were previously convicted—you were tried at the police-court about November, 1858, for stealing a pair of boots; and you declined taking off your cap then—I took it off for you, and you then had no hair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Is it reasonable that I should knock a woman down in the street in the presence of her husband? I was in the public-house at the time; a bottle of whiskey was going to be raffled for; they were talking Irish, and I, having been in Ireland, I spoke Irish also. The prosecutrix went outside; she was intoxicated; she had been turned out of one public-house before; she came back afterwards, and said, "Where is my shawl, where is my scarf?" and then she said to me, "Do you know where my scarf is?" I said, "I do not; you had it when you went out." The bar<lb/>man said, "There is nobody here who has got your shawl; "her husband came in and took her arm, as she was very tipsy, and he was not much better: two days afterwards, I went to her room in Mint-street, and asked what was the meaning of it; she said, "I will lock you up for my shawl;" she went out to get a policeman; and while she was gone, her husband said, "Now, you go away, or else she will lock you up;" I said, "Why should I be locked up, if I am innocent?" I left his place, and got some work in the West India Docks. The reason I went to her room was, that a man told me I was suspected of stealing it by a young woman who found the prosecutrix drunk. Her husband made me go out over the boards in the back yard, and out at the back door.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Count Stock Place, Bridge-road, Battersea—on the evening of 11th October, about 7 o'clock, I was near Mrs. Rippon's house, and saw Watson come out at the gate with something in his right hand like a piece of iron or a screw-driver, but it was rather dark—he came a few steps towards me, and then turned to a man who was under a lamp-post, and said, "Harry, there stands that b—y cat; we are done"—they then went towards the Flamborough Arms—I am certain it was Watson, I knew him before—I cannot swear, but I believe it was Dobinson who was under the lamp—afterwards, about 8 or 9 o'clock, I saw Watson come from the public-house—he crossed the road, and went up the Boling-broke-road—I saw him again next evening as I came from my work—I was standing outside Mrs. Dixie's door, and he said to me, "If I catch you in a dark place or on a bridge, I will throw you over and break your neck"—he had previously lodged in my house—I then lived at 3, Mary's-place, and I once went into his room and saw what he told me was a life-preserver—that is fourteen months ago—I took it from his hand—I saw it again at the police-court; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is either an N or a K upon it, and here are dots at the end of it—I next saw it before the Magistrate at Wandsworth.</p>

               <p>give any information to the police in this case, but next morning I found the door open, and knocked at Mrs. Staple's, next door—it was on the 17th October that I heard there had been a robbery—I think it was a fortnight ago yesterday that I went before the Magistrate—a policeman came to me; that was the first time I had given information to the police about it—the man had not a bundle when I saw him coming out at the gat—he had nothing but this in his hand—it did not look like this; it looked longer—I do not know whether it was a crowbar or a stick—he had no bundle—it appeared like a long piece of iron or a screw-driver—this was not in the dark—I thought it was a screw-driver, because he gene<lb/>rally carries one, being a smith, and I thought he had gone in for the purposes of his trade, and not to break into the house—when he said, "Harry, there stands that b—cat," I did not think anything about a burglary, but I thought it was something that was not quite right—I thought some<lb/>thing was wrong, and I should have told a policeman but I could not see one; this was about 7 in the evening—I could walk from there to my house in five minutes—I did not see a policeman as I walked home; I looked for one, and likewise coming back—I went into a person's house, opposite the Flam borough Arms to leave my things, as I had just come from work—I gene<lb/>rally go into that person's house when I have done my work—she is a car<lb/>penter's wife—I saw no policeman on my way back to her place; it is only one street; there is a public-house there—the clock had just gone 10 when I got home—I looked for a policeman as I went home. A policeman came to me on 17th October, and asked me what I saw, and I told him—Jennings is my name, people have called me other names, but I never said my name was anything else—they have called me Marshall, and Pearce, and White—I did not live with a man named White—Longhurst was my maiden name—my husband died in 1851—it is since his death that I have been called Mrs. White—I cannot say where I was living at that time—I might be coming along the road this morning and be called Mrs. White—I was living in Chelsea and in Battersea—I was not living with a man named White—he lived in the house at each place with other lodgers—he was my lodger at first, and I became his lodger; we shifted our quarters—I have not lived with the prisoner Watson as his wife; he was my lodger at 3, Mary's-place—White was not in the house then, that was after I had been to Chelsea—I do not know what has become of White—I cannot tell when he left—I do not trouble my head about my lodgers leaving me—it was not after he left that Watson came to live with me—on my oath I was not living with Watson as his wife—I know Mrs. Bedford—I cannot say how many different houses I have been living in with Watson—I cannot recollect—it is more than one; it is two—I will not swear it is not three—I did not sleep with him—I was not seen in bed with him by Mrs. Bedford—I know his brother Henry Watson—I do not know what he is—I believe he lived with me when I was called Mrs. White—White was not then living with me as my husband—I cannot say whether he was in the house—White was not with me when Watson was there—Henry Watson did not see his brother in bed with me, after White had left, and if he says so he tells a great falsehood—no one can swear they saw me in bed with him—I swear that the prisoner Watson has never been in bed with me—he slept in the back room when he first lodged with me, and in China Cottage he had the front parlour—I have only once had a conversation with Henry Watson about William Watson, and that was through a letter from my son—I never told Henry Watson that as William had treated me so badly I would get him transported if I possibly</p>

I have the contract in a very low figure, and I want your prices"—I furnished him with a list of prices—next day he came again, and said that if the prices were our lowest they were not quite so cheap as he could get them, but as it was necessary to have a good article, he would give us the order—he gave me his card—this is it; it has on it, "July the 27th"—I wrote that on it—I then asked him for references, and he gave the names of his re<lb/>ferences on the back of the card—one of them I declined to receive, on account of its distance, and he gave another one, Mrs. Scott, near Bethlehem Hospital—I did not go there myself, not till afterwards; I sent a man—I went 2 or 3 days afterwards—I never saw the prisoner after he had the first lot of goods, which he had the next day or thereabouts—after I had the report from my man, I told my man it was not sufficient for him to have a large quantity of goods—I supplied the prisoner with goods before I saw Mrs. Scott—he told me he had a large square of houses erecting at Bow; that he had a number of men there, and they were waiting for the tubing to go on—I was not present at the delivery of any of these goods—the reason for my parting; with the goods were the references he gave me and his own statement that he was an extensive builder and a contractor, and that he had works at Bow, and that he had a number of men waiting to go on with their work and they were waiting for the tubing to go on—he said the work he was doing at Bow was building a square of houses—he did not mention the number, only it was a square of houses—he did not mention any particular part of Bow—he said he had got a wharf at Branch-place, Hoxton—Branch-place wharf, I think he called it—I went down to Branch-place after he had the goods—I did not find him there—I did not see any person representing him—there was no business whatever going on—there was no name—there was no wharf or any appearance of a builder or con<lb/>tractor; nothing whatever—there was no timber-yard—I made inquiries about houses being built at Bow; I did not find any, nor any building going on—I did not see any square of houses in course of being built—I inquired of residents there and sent my man there—I saw the district sur<lb/>veyor there.</p>

Q.</hi> The parish of Bow is large? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not very large—there are 200 or 300 inhabitants—there are upwards of 1,000 houses certainly—if four or five houses are building, we call it a lot of houses—I should not call that a square—if a square were mentioned I should conclude that it was a great many houses—I never heard that word square was used to mean a block of houses—I should call a block of number of houses built together—if houses are at a distance I go to see them—when a house is begun it is the duty of the builder to give notice to the surveyor, and on that notice I should go to see that it was properly begun—I know little of Stratford—it is the adjoining parish—I don't know Chatworth-road, Forest lane.</p>

               <p>about two yards from the kerb, on a chair without a back, and speaking in a loud voice—he commenced about 11 o'clock; at that time, I think there were nearly one hundred persona round him, but the numbers kept increasing till he was removed—at last there were about 250—he continued to speak till he was taken in custody, about a quarter before 12—the passage of the highway was impeded—the carriage-way was completely closed—persons could pass along the footpath by edging themselves through, but the carriage-way was completely blocked up—some persons belonging to tike teetotalers were endeavouring to make a passage, and they called on me to help them—I said the only thing I could do was to request the gentleman to leave off;—he had then been speaking about twenty minutes—I desired him to leave off; he did not, but desired the people to make the foot-way clear—at length, there was such a crowd that I said, "Sir, I must really; take you in custody"—he said, "That is what I want; I will go with you."</p>

Mr. Parry is the incumbent of that parish—I have never seen him preach out of doors—I don't know who made this complaint—I have heard that Mr. Hill sent a petition against it; I have seen it—I do not know how many names were to it—these meetings had been going on for some weeks—that was the second Sunday that I was there—the high road to Deptford is altered, hot this is the high road to Rotherhithe—there was not room, if a carriage bad been passing, for the persons to have gone on to the embankment—there were persons on the embankment.</p>
