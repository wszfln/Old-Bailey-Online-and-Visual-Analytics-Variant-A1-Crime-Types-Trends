We applied to Justice Fielding, and told him what was missing, for him to advertise it. The next day being Saturday, Mr. Fielding sent a letter to Mrs. Weaver. About two or three in the afternoon we went there, and saw the prisoner and most of the plate. Mrs. Weaver being a quaker, would not swear. I swore to what I knew. (The plate, all but the punch-ladle and spoons, were produced in court.) This two handled mug, or rather cup, I know to be her property, having drank out of it often, here is S.

I suspected he did not come honestly by it, so I stopped it, and went to justice Fielding for his advice, he shewed me the advertisement he had put in the paper, and sent two men with me, and we went and took the prisoner in Aldersgate-street, where he told me he lodged; we took him before the justice, and there he owned he hid himself in his mistress's house all night, and took the things away in the morning; this is the plate here produced, all but the spoons that he brought and offered to me to sell.</p>

I missed the things between ten and eleven, we suspected the prisoner, I took him up, and told him I was robbed of five crown pieces, and the other things; he seem'd to lay it very hard upon the other young man. I went with him to seek for the young man, and found him in the prisoner's lodgings, they both lodged together, the prisoner opened a drawer of his, and took some things out, and after that a shift of my wife's was found in his bed, which since he owned he took out there, and put into the bed. He owned in the prison before me, that he took the three pair of cotton stockings, and had made away with them, that they might not appeared an evidence against him. He owned he had had the five crown pieces, and he had changed them, and that I could not have three of them again, for he had changed them to different people.

I went to the prisoner, and told him I heard he had some linnen to sell, he denied it, then I said I could produce a sheet he had given a woman to pawn; then he acknowledged he had given it her to pawn. I asked him how he came by it. first he said his wife had brought it to the Tower to dry, being turned out of her lodgings. I sent a serjeant for his wife, and examined her before her husband's face; she declared she had not a sheet in the world, and had never seen it before then. I put him in prison, and by inquiring, found Mrs. Tanner had lost a sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Tanner. Had you seen the prisoner in your house?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tanner. I never did to my knowledge; my linnen was hanging up in the garret in my own house to dry, and it was very easy to get in at the window, which we have secured since.</p>

            . I am a watchman, this man came to me and inquired after a woman, and described her, by which description I knew it to be the prisoner. I went with him, and found her in a house in King-street. I took her out, then the man of the house came and called after me, and said here is the watch, I'll have nothing to do with it, and put it in my right-hand, saying he had it of the prisoner. I asked the prosecutor to describe the watch which he had lost. He did, and it appeared to be the same.</p>

I went with them into a house, they had two pots of purl. I came out again, and he came out and wanted to use me very rudely. I got from him, and hid myself in a gate-way, and he ran by me, and after he was gone by I picked up this watch, and I gave it to Mr. Barnet, at the same house where I was, to see whether it was advertised or not.</p>

I asked her what she had in her apron, she said nothing belonging to me; I desired her to come back again, that I might see whether she had got any thing or not. I took her back, and put her into my house before me. In two or three minutes time some body came and said the woman had dropt a handkerchief, and produced one, out of which I saw two tea-spoons drop, (producing them) they are my property; the prisoner owned the handkerchief to be her own.</p>

            . I am a silver-smith, and live in the parish of Hanwell, at New Brentford in Middlesex. On the 15th of February last the prisoner came to my shop in man's apparel with this hatchet in her hand, (producing one) and asked me if I bought old silver, and pulled out some pieces of a tankard; the appearance of which gave me some suspicion that she had stole it. I asked her several questions, how she came by it, and the like. She said her father died and left it her. She produced the whole of a silver tankard in pieces. I asked her when her father died, she said about half a year ago, and she was persuaded to cut it to pieces, that she might bring it more safely to London, so she cut it to pieces on the stump of a tree. Upon asking her many questions, I found by her voice she was a woman. I charged her with being a woman, and called in women to search her. I took and opened her coat before, and saw a pair of stays. I asked her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050007"/> name, and her father's name. She said her father's name was Pretherew. The constable came, and she was secured, and proved to be a woman.</p>

Then I took her into the Half-moon tavern; she desired to be searched by women, and it was soon found.</p>

I never saw that handk erchief till I was in at the tavern.

            . I had country lodgings at Mr. Poe's at Islington; there came a journeyman carpenter one morning, and said he had seen the prisoner and Duncomb over night, with a jack going into Old-street; he suspected they had stole it; two or three days after, Duncomb came into the house; Mr. Poe sent for a constable, and took him before justice Welch; he confessed before we went there, and also before the justice, that he and the prisoner had stole that, and what he is now charged with, from out of Mr. Poe's premises, and had sold them to Thralkill. I went to Thralkill and asked him about it; he owned he had bought several things of Duncomb.</p>

               <p>Watts. No; nothing but what Duncomb said.</p>

She slipped her hand to my pocket, and took out my watch, and ran away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all the conversation you had with her ?</p>
               <p>Forsholm. I had no more conversation with her; she ran away into another alley, and I lost sight of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any weapon in her hand?</p>
               <p>Forsholm. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you put in fear?</p>
               <p>Forsholm. I was afraid somebody else might be thereabouts; so I went to the Lion in Piccadilly, and staid there till morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she demand your Watch or any thing besides of you?</p>
               <p>Forsholm. No, she did not; but took it slily away.</p>

             and I were going home from our labour, we were desired to assist in taking the prisoner to the Cage; the prisoner dropt the salt; Arnold took it up, and gave it me, and desired me to take care of it till the morrow. I kept it till the afternoon the next day, when I heard Mrs. Stevens had lost a silver salt and pepper-box; I gave it to her, and she gave me a shilling to drink.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the prisoner disturbing?</p>
               <p>Ewer. He was disturbing his wife, he wanted to get into the house, and she would not let him, and he had broke the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he was in his senses?</p>
               <p>Ewer. I can't tell whether he was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he would have broke his windows if he was in his senses?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you look upon him to be a man out of his senses.</p>
               <p>Stevens. I look upon him to be a madman really, but I had no acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Q. From what do you look upon him to be a madman?</p>
               <p>Stevens. He does not now appear to be in his senses.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you do right in prosecuting a mad man for a felony?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I did not know him to be such before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have been acquainted with him five or six years.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you live when you carried on business?</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live now?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I live at Thisleworth.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. No, we have no children.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means do you live now?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I carry on the gardening business. I purchased a bit of ground for that purpose, and that will maintain me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Stevens. Upon whose evidence was he committed?</p>
               <p>Stevens. It was on my evidence.</p>

            . I keep the Boar and Castle; his wife made complaint of him on the 25th of November, and put him into prison. I took him to my house till the 6th of January last. When he has dined at one o'clock, may be, by four, he has declared he has eat nothing for two or three days. He would catch up case knives and run after the servants. Sometimes I have lost my news-papers, once I found ten in his pockets; and sometimes I have found case knives in his pockets. There was a separation between his wife and him, and an agreement made; she was to allow him six shillings per week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any writing drawn up?</p>
               <p>Alleson. There was; he has often said, while at my house, why did they lay him in that bed, he would lie in his own bed, and all this time he never lay out of his bed, he always lay in one bed; he would fly about, and behave very wild, and at other times he would sit down and cry for two or three hours together.</p>

            . I live at Watford, and have known the prisoner thirty years; I have observed a visible alteration in his behaviour; I bailed him out of New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he put there for?</p>
               <p>Walton. For assaulting his wife in November, he came out there before Christmas, and I carried him to the Boar and Castle; there he was very troublesome, and disturbed the customers, so that I was desired to take him away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take him to be in or out of his senses?</p>
               <p>Walton. I take him not to be in his senses. At that time they did not execute the writings, thinking him not capable to sign.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they executed since?</p>
               <p>Walton. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they executed?</p>
               <p>Walton. I believe it to be about three weeks ago; he was bound to forfeit 200 l. if he ever went near her, and two or three days after he went and broke her windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you related to him?</p>
               <p>Walton. I am his brother-in-law. When I took him to the Boar and Castle, he would hallow out at the window at night, to know what o'clock it was. We have got him into bed, and in about an hour after he would be hallowing again. I believe he has not been in his senses this two or three years. He has been distressed for want of money, through the marriage settlement upon his wife two or three years ago.</p>

               <p>Dagnell. He has answered every question well.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they go safe to town?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pyke. There was no stay, or hindrance of it, as I heard of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual when you send up letters to put in a bill of them?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pyke. It is, but we don't name the franks.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember this letter from your own knowledge, or from his telling you there was such a one?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pyke. His telling me gave me some uneasiness, and upon my recollecting, I remembered particularly there was such a letter in the office, directed to Mr. Greenwollers's.</p>

            . I belong to the Post-Office. I remember the Chester mail did come in on the 16th of December last, containing all the bags.</p>

               <p>Ravenhead. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Chester bag in that mail?</p>
               <p>Ravenhead. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who opened the Chester bag?</p>
               <p>Ravenhead. Mr. Baker did.</p>
               <p>Q. What day does the Chester mail come out from thence to arrive here on the 16th?</p>
               <p>Ravenhead. They are dispatched on the 14th from thence.</p>
               <p>Q. What day is the bill of the Wrexham bag dated?</p>
               <p>Ravenhead. That is dated the 14th.</p>
               <p>Q. to Baker. Do you remember the Chester mail coming to your office on the 16th of December?</p>
               <p>Baker. At this length of time I cannot tell, but if the post-master's bill was produced I could tell. (It is produced, he takes it in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Baker. These are undoubtedly my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the meaning of these Bills?</p>
               <p>Baker. Mrs. Pyke has already declared, this is the account of what letters she sent that day. It appears what number there were, and when they came.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Pyke. Look on that paper, and give an account what it is?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pyke. This is the account of what letters came from Wrexham, on the 14th, my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Baker. These were received on the 16th, here is my own writing, we sign our names to them; they are part printed, and filled up by the postmasters in the country; and on their arrival we sign our names to them. I certainly received these, or I could not have signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the bag came in, was it sealed as usual?</p>
               <p>Baker. To the best of my remembrance it was, we always look at those things then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Potts. I am comptroller of the General Post Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar employed at the Post-Office, about the 16th of December last.</p>
               <p>Potts. He was employed as letter carrier, at that time, about Bloomsbury-square, to carry out for a man that was sick.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any concern with the letters sent to York-street, Covent-Garden?</p>
               <p>Potts. It appears this letter, now in question, was a frank letter. York-street is not in his walk, but it is in the same division; there are four of those letter carriers, and he used to be remarkably assiduous to fetch the frank letters; those<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050015"/> four men take the letters and sort them, and any one may have those frank letters in his custody.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Pain. Was the letter you sent in a frank?</p>
               <p>Pain. It was a frank by Sir Lynch Cotton.</p>
               <p>Potts. I apprehend, when the prisoner thought this was for his purpose, he put it in his pocket, as one of them; fetches the letters for the whole seat, into the letter carrier's office, if there are six or seven carriers. I only prove the general course of the office, to shew that this letter directed to York-street, might come into the hands of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up?</p>
               <p>Potts. He was taken up about a fortnight or three weeks after, and I was with him before justice Fielding; he was there charged with taking this letter. At first he told an odd story, and would not own any thing; Mr. Fielding said to me, as you are his principal officer, may be he will say something to you. I said to the prisoner, have you a mind to say any thing to me, he said, sir, I should be glad to speak with you alone. We went together into a closet; the moment we were in the room, he dropped down on his knees, and with a flood of tears, said he was guilty; for he took the bill out of the letter; I said, is any other letter carrier, in our office, concerned with you in it? he said no, sir, not any body, he had ruined and undone himself; for he, himself, took it out of the letter, and there was nobody but a gentleman's servant, that was out of place, that persuaded him to the commission of the fact. When we came out of the room he repeated the same he had done there.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you before the time of his confession tell him he should have mercy if he would tell the whole?</p>
               <p>Baker. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did you make use of any threats in order thereto.</p>
               <p>Baker. No; not in the least.</p>

I went to justice Fielding, and got a warrant, and went to the house where the prisoner lives; he was not to be found, but there I found a bundle of linen of his. I advertised him, and last Sunday I found him in the Strand, with one of my shirts on his back, and a pair of my stockings on. I took him before Mr. Fielding, he ordered him to the Round-house, and the next morning there again, and from thence to Newgate; there were three pair of my stockings in the bundle which I found; they were at a watchman's in the Meuse.</p>

I asked him how he came by that watch, he said he bought it, and changed the great piece of money to pay for it; but what change he had out of it he could not tell; I asked him where he bought it, he said in a great street beyond, St. Paul's church-yard we went and found it to be Cheapside.</p>

I said it would be very acceptable, he made me a present of half a guinea, and treated us with a glass of rum; and when my brother came home from work, he treated him with a pot of beer, after that I sent down for one more; a little after that I came down stairs, and the landlady ask'd me what I would treat her with, I said any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050018"/> thing that she pleased; we had two pints of hot.

               <p>Q. When was the last time ?</p>

               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. the 24th of February last, at which time the goods mentioned in the indictment were lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me what goods he was packing on the 24th of February?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. He was employed particularly in linnen. Two days before he was pressing the piece of cloth which I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. In the packing of the cloth was there any particular circumstance happened, by which you could know it again?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. By the pattern I took of it, I am sure it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was this woollen cloth packed-up ?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. It was done about half a yard wide, and put into a green canvass.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it any ferril upon it when it was packed up?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. It had, and two numbers, one was the number of the cloth; the mark was Newman Superfine 10,707, 25 yards three quarters; it was put on by the weaver, when it was wove, it was at the head end of the cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that part of the cloth, to which the ferril was annex'd afterwards lost?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. The whole piece of cloth was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the linnen cloth packed?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. In canvas, and a rope; fifteen pieces were together in one bale.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did this man work afterwards with you?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. Three days.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you discharge him?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. I believe the 22d of February.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went away, where were these bales ?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. They were in my warehouse. I saw them there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know where they were?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the bales there on the 23d of February?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. Yes, I saw them about four or five in the evening; on Friday morning, the 24th of February, we were alarmed with fire; after the fright was over, and the fire was got out, I examined the warehouse, to see what I had lost; I missed a piece of cloth, and I found a bale of linnen that was cut open, and two pieces taken out of the bale.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the cloth?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. About 17 l. it was twenty-five yards three quarters; it cost first 15 s. per yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050019"/>Q. What quantity of linnen?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. The two pieces of linnen were worth about 1 l. 15 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing else?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. Only the wrappers which he put the goods in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect any particular person having stolen them?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. The observations that the prisoner had made on it, when he was at work, of a wrinkle, and I missing that piece, made me suspect the very man.</p>
               <p>Q. What grounds had you to think that he had stole them?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. Because he had made a mark, which no man knew besides himself and my man, the other man I know to be a very honest man; I have known him a great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at your house at the time that the fire happened?</p>
               <p>Colethurst. I did not see him.</p>

            . I am journeyman to Mr. Colethurst; I know the prisoner very well, I remember his working with Mr. Colethurst as a packer; he was at work two days before the fire happened, in folding of this woollen cloth into papers for the press, (the woollen cloth produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any observations upon any wrinkles, or marks in the cloth?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Yes, this is it, when he was about it, he said, sir, you see here is a wrinkle, you see I did not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say it was the same cloth?</p>
               <p>Holloway. I am sure it was the same cloth that that he was employed to sold into papers for the press.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mr. Colethurst discharge him?</p>
               <p>Holloway. On the Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time, you are sure, the cloth was in the warehouse?</p>
               <p>Holloway. The cloth and linnen were in the warehouse on the Thursday evening about six or seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time you miss'd this cloth?</p>
               <p>Holloway. When we had got our hurry over, between seven and eight o'clock on the Friday morning, I went into the warehouse, and when I came in, I saw the bale was cut open, and I thought that by moving it, it might have bursted; afterwards looking for the woollen cloth, I found the green buckram that it was put up in, and the cloth gone, and the ferril the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember having any more of that cloth from any other since ?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Yes, a man in court brought a piece home after the Tickets were out.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is the piece of woollen cloth worth?</p>
               <p>Holloway. About 17 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come to you after this?</p>
               <p>Holloway. No, he never came since.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>E. Salter. I am a bookseller, the prisoner came to my house on the 24th of February, about nine o'clock, and brought a bag very heavy; he said let me leave this bag: it was a very cold morning, but he came in a great sweat. I asked him what made him sweat so; in such a cold morning, and he said it was his burden. I told him I would not have my shop fill'd with his goods, he said he would not leave it above two or three hours. I saw him again on Saturday morning, about ten or eleven o'clock; he took the bag and cut it open, and took the cloth out, and cut off about four or five yards, and took it under his arm and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the same cloth?</p>
               <p>E. Salter. I know it to be the same by the two figures of 7. I saw the number when he cut it off and laid it upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any directions what to do with the rest?</p>
               <p>Salter. I asked him for some money, he said you must sell some of this cloth, and you may have some of this linnen cloth to make a pair of sheets. I did not take any then; I said I have no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050020"/> skill in woollen cloth, he said it was worth 7 s. per yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you employ any body to sell any part of this woollen or linnen cloth?</p>
               <p>Salter. I employed my daughter to sell the woollen cloth, but she sold none, for she offer'd it, and she was taken up; he came on Saturday evening, and he borrow'd two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you advance any more money upon the cloth?</p>
               <p>Salter. I advanced 15 s. and 2 s. more on Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any inquiry how he came by this cloth?</p>
               <p>Salter. He said it was his own, and said I might go to any public shop in London, and make any money of it. The cloth was at my house till the prisoner was taken up. He came for some more cloth on the Tuesday morning, and my daughter took him up.</p>

            . I know the prisoner very well; on Friday morning the 24th of February he brought some cloth and some linnen in a canvas bag; he came in a great sweat, which I was greatly surprised at, in such a cold morning, and he desired he might leave it for two or three hours; my mother said she did not choose to be incumbered with it, but he said nothing; she called two or three times, but he made no answer, and ran away and left the goods. I saw him again on the Saturday, and he came and desired she would lend him 15 s. she lent him 15 s. and three half-crowns, and he took and cut the cloth in pieces, and left six yards behind, and took the rest away.</p>

            . I have known him for four or five years; he brought a quantity of cloth some time in February, on a Saturday morning; first he brought a pattern, and offered it to sell; afterwards he brought a quantity of cloth, he said it was 27 yards, and a half, or three quarters of it, (a piece of cloth produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the cloth he brought you to sell?</p>
               <p>Collins. I am pretty sure this is the cloth, I have no reason, but only with regard to the colour, it appears to me to be the very same thing. When he brought the cloth, I laid it by in order to have a coat and breeches made of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to give him for it?</p>
               <p>Collins. We had not agreed about that, he said it was to be 14 s. a yard. I said if it was worse it would serve my turn as well, he told me it was not his, but a friend's that was going into the country, and that he had it to dispose of for him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the cloth continue with you?</p>
               <p>Collins. About five or six days. When I came to be acquainted with the affair, I informed Mr. Colethurst that I had heard he had lost some cloth, and that I had so much cloth of such a colour in my possession. I told him if he would send his man to my house, I would give it him. Mr. Colethurst sent his man, and I shew'd him a pattern of it, and gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cloth that Mr. Colethurst's man had of you, the very same that you had of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Collins. Yes, the very same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Staples. I was present when the prisoner was apprehended, and I was with him before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cloth produced there?</p>
               <p>Staples. It was, and the linnen.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did he give to Mr. Fielding?</p>
               <p>Staples. He said he was going down Basinghall-street, and he saw a bag lie, he said he found it under the wall.</p>

I have known the prisoner about seven years, his wife was servant to me; after his day's work was over, I let him come to see his wife, and when he was out of his time, I let him be in my house; he lived with me four years and a half, I never heard to the contrary but that he was a very just, honest man, and has bore a good character ever since.</p>

            . I am an engraver. About the 1st of last March, the prisoner at the bar applied to me in the name of Sneed, for a copper-plate to be engraved with a promissory note. I cannot remember whether he brought me a written direction, or whether he wrote it in my shop. I engraved him two plates. The direction for the last plate I have here. (Producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the direction for the first?</p>
               <p>Corbould. I cannot tell whether he did not take that away with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the first plate?</p>
               <p>Corbould. I have it here. I shewed it the prisoner before it was quite finished, and he made a great many objections to it. One in particular I remember was, the word on at the beginning of the second line, should have been at the beginning of the first line, and the words I promise were placed, he said, too far from the edge of the plate, and the Britannia he did not like; he wanted me to alter the plate; I said I should have more trouble to alter it than to make a new one. Then that was laid aside, and I engraved a second by his direction.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at this other plate.</p>
               <p>Corbould. This is the second plate. (He delivers it, and the directions for engraving.)</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got a proof from this plate?</p>
               <p>Corbould. Here is one that I had printed off from it. (He delivers that in.)</p>
               <p>A young Lady sworn. The prisoner at the bar delivered me some bills: these are the same. (Producing twelve counterfeit bank notes, sealed up in a cover, for 20l. each.)</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say they were when he delivered them to you.</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. He said they were bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observations on them?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. I said mine were thinner paper; he answered, all bills are not alike.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him about the bank?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to do with them?</p>

               <p>Y. Lady. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he put them in your hands for?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. He put them in my hands to shew he put confidence in me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any charge concerning them?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. He desired me not to shew them to any body; and to sealed them up with his own seal; obliged me oath not to discover them to any body; and I did not till he had discovered them himself</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not to settle something upon you?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. Yes; he was to settle so much upon me and he was to advance it in stock. ( The not delivered in)</p>
               <p>Q. to Corbould. Look at this note, the body of 22</p>
               <p>Corbould. This is printed from the second copperplate of my engraving; all but these words, For to and company of the bank of England; ved the plate, the prisoner asked me if I can't tell him where a printer lived, and I recommended one Farnworth, a man that prints for me.</p>

            . I am a copper-plate printer. I remember the prisoner coming to me about the beginning of last March; he said Mr. Jefferys and Mr. Corbould recommended him to me, because had the trouble of proving it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Jeffreys?</p>
               <p>Farnworth. Jeffreys and Corbould are partners. He said he wanted a few prints done; I said I was in a great hurry, and could not finish my business, being Saturday evening. He said he would pay me considerably, if I would do them then. I printed 28 for him, and Mr. Jeffreys paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present?</p>
               <p>Farnworth. There was only my man that works for me was by. The prisoner staid while they were done, and took away four of them with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you for doing them?</p>
               <p>Farnworth. I was paid two shillings for doing them; he made a second application to me the week following, and came and had forty-eight more printed of the same plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he present when you printed them?</p>
               <p>Farnworth. He was with me all the time, and took them away as they were done.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you for doing them?</p>
               <p>Farnworth. He did; he paid me two shillings for doing them.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon whose paper did you print them?</p>
               <p>Farnworth. I printed them on his own paper, which he brought with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon this note, and the plate, and see whether you can say part of the note was printed off from this plate. (He looks on them.)</p>
               <p>Farnworth. Yes, part of it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Read what words were printed off from this plate?</p>
               <p>Farnworth reads. - I promise to pay to or bearer, Twenty pounds. Here is London also, and the Britannia and No. at the top.</p>

            . I am a copper-plate printer and stationer. The prisoner applied to me about the 4th of March last, with three written directions; one directed for the governor and company of the bank of England: another to the East-India company; and the other I know nothing of, to get them engraved for him. I asked him, if he pleased to have them all on one plate, or separate: he considered a little, and said separate. I asked him if he would have one done first, and the rest afterwards. He considered a second time, and said, I might as well do that for the governor and company of the bank of England first. I got it engraved for him, and shewed him a proof of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this smallest plate.</p>
               <p>Fourdrinier. This is the plate: he said the r in governor must be altered, and made into an s; it was altered according to his directions.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this note No. 13840</p>
               <p>Fourdrinier. To the best of my knowledge this is printed from it, For the governor and company of the bank of England. After he had got it, he paid me for it, and went about his business; and I think about a week after, he came to me and asked me, if I could not print him some from the plate; I told him I could: he brought some paper along with him folded up very curiously; so that I could not see what was in them; I was going to take the papers from him, but he said he must go up stairs with me, and see them worked off himself. I took him up stairs; he would not let me have them out of his hands. I took a spunge and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050024"/> wetted them, and put them on the plate, in order for printing them. After my boy had done two or three of them, I begged to be excused. Having business to do, I went down stairs, and my boy worked them off.</p>

            . I have been acquainted with the prisoner five or six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Balangers. I live in George-yard. About five or six weeks ago as the prisoner and I were coming down Portugal-street, he asked me if I could give him cash for a 20l. bank note. I said I had no cash about me, but I had a relation that could do it. We went to him, and he had not cash; then I said I had a brother on Snow-hill, he has cash. As we were going on, he said the bank note was not about him, but at his brother's; we will go to him; but when we came to his brother's chambers, he nor none of his clerks were there; then we went and drank together, till we thought he might be come in. We went to the chamber again, but no body was there; coming out of the chamber, there happened to be the waiter of the wine cellar on the stairs. He ask'd if his brother was below; he said he was. I said then you may go and ask him for the key. He said he would not, he did not choose it, for he would ask for what he wanted it. About a fort night after that he came to me in my yard and asked me if I had a six stall stable to let I said I had a two stall stable, if that was suit. He said a gentleman of his acquaintance had six saddle horses, and should want such a stable. He asked me when we were together, if I could give him cash for bank bills, saying he had twenty by him for 20 l. each. I said I could not, it is but going to the bank, you may soon get cash there; he said he did not care for that, because he was a bankrupt, and his certificate was not signed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you any of the notes?</p>
               <p>Balanger. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the notes he talked of to be all good notes?</p>
               <p>Balanger. Yes, I did.</p>

            . The prisoner offered himself to me as a clerk, about eight months ago, in consequence of my advertising for one. I hired him as such, and he lived with me about three months in that capacity.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you some way concerned for the young Lady.</p>
               <p>Bliss. I am guardian to her; the prisoner had privately made his addresses to her, without my knowledge or consent; after a time he made me acquainted with it, (but not till I had learn'd it from the servants; and I observed by the Girl's behaviour, that she greatly approved him.) I said to him, if he could make it appear that he could maintain her, and if his character, upon close inquiry would bear. (I at that time had no doubt of his character, as a servant, because he had behaved well.) He mentioned his being of a good<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050025"/> family, and told me though he had been a bankrupt, yet soon should have his certificate signed; and his brother, an eminent attorney, and his friends that lived at Stafford, would settle an equal sum upon her to her fortune, would rein state him in business, and advance him a considerable sum of money. On these declarations I consented. He had got her consent, what remained was my care to see she did not imprudently throw herself away. Many meetings we had, to treat of this pretended settlement; he applied to his own attorney for a draught of the settlement. It was agreed that 500l. should be settled in trust for her separate use.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he say that was to be raised?</p>
               <p>Bliss. He said his brother and friends would advance him a thousand pounds, and out of that money it was to be raised. The affair of the bank notes came to my knowledge by mere accident. I believe it was on the 22d of March, I was sitting in my parlour, with my wife, by the fire-side; the prisoner and the girl in the same room, which being small, though they whispered, I could perceive Vaughan was very urgent to have something returned, which he said he would call for early next morning. I then thought it something trifling, and not worth particular notice. As soon as he went away, I studied her face, and could perceive much dissatisfaction. I asked her what was the matter; I perceived a tear break out; she would not tell me what the matter in dispute was. This induced me to resolve he should not see her till I found out what he wanted of her. When he came the next morning I took him into the parlour, and said you have given the young lady great uneasiness last night, I desire to know what you demanded of her; he hesitated some time, and said he did not demand any thing. I said this is a matter brought near a conclusion, there shall be nothing a secret till after you are married; tell me candidly what past between you. He still refused upon my second asking. Then I said I in part knew it from her; and said, may be, she has the value of ten or twelve pounds, you might give her to buy a bauble. He said more than that, it was near 300l. in bills, and it was that which he demanded of her again, and for very good reasons, which he could not then tell me; till his certificate was signed, it was not proper any body should know he had got so much, and his brother was to advance it to him when he had got that signed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what sort of bills they were?</p>
               <p>Bliss. To the best of my knowledge he did not say what sort, but I understood they were bank bills. I asked him for what intent he left them with her; he said, as I had of late suspected him, he designed to give her a proof of his affection and truth, I said you have demanded them in such a manner, that it must be construed as an abatement of your affection towards her. He still solicited farther. I told him I must ask advice first, as things had gone so far. I desired he would not see her till then, and after that he might call upon me again, and I never saw him till I saw him before the justice. I had no notion at that time that he had imposed on the girl, by giving her any thing that was false.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the number of bills?</p>
               <p>Bliss. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. In the common course of negotiating business, is the expression bills, when they mean bank notes?</p>
               <p>Bliss. No, it is not, but I believe they are equally und erstood by bank bills or bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person owes you money, and was to say he would pay you in bills, should you think it to be bank bills?</p>
               <p>Bliss. I believe bank notes are as commonly called bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you about bank bills?</p>
               <p>Bliss. No.</p>
               <p>Q. From the general purport of the discourse with him, could you understand he was to purchase any of this fortune with these bills?</p>
               <p>Bliss. No, he said she might go and take the stock, or to that effect. He equivocated much.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any time of marriage appointed?</p>
               <p>Bliss. The marriage was fixed for the Tuesday in Easter-week.</p>
               <p>Q. to the young Lady. How many notes did the prisoner leave with you?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. There were twelve of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you count them?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you read any part of them?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what account did he put them in your hands?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. On the account of my saying I thought he had no value for me; and he put them into my hand to shew me that he had.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050026"/>Q. Had there been any dispute between you?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. Not much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what they were?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. I don't remember that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take them to be?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. I took them for bank bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation on them then?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. Yes, I told him they were thicker than my bank bills were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say bills?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. I said my bank notes were thinner than them, and he made answer all notes were not alike.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you had any conversation about any settlement upon you?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. He said he was to settle 250 l. on me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the value of the notes?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. I think I said they were 20 l. each, to which he noded his head, and that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to settle on you?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. He was to settle 500 l. on me, and this was to make up mine 500l.</p>
               <p>Q. What was yours?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. Mine was 250l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that was to make up yours 500l.</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. No, he did not, he insisted on my not telling any body of these bills, and said they were not to be meddled with on any consideration in the world, and he was to go to the bank and transfer it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the 500l. to be raised on his part?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner asking for these notes afterwards?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. I do, he begged the favour of having them again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he call them?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. He said bills.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. It was, I believe, about the 22d.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver them?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he demand them after that?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after that?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. No</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Council. Then these were left with you to be returned to him again, were they not?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. I do not know any thing about that, I was to keep them till after our marriage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand these to be any part of the value he was to settle upon you?</p>
               <p>Y. Lady. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Spensley. Was you at the apprehending the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Spensley. I met him in the custody of my brother constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing that the prisoner did then?</p>
               <p>Spensley. I saw some paper in his mouth, and saw him spit some of it out, and his countenance changed at the time.</p>
               <p>Council. There were fifteen found upon the prisoner, twenty in his room, and these twelve Miss produced, and one we suppose he destroyed in his mouth, come just to the number that were printed.</p>
               <p>Spensley. My brother constable said to me, I am glad you are come, for he has swallowed two bits of paper.</p>

               <p>Council for prisoner. If you were to be charged with a capital offence, would not your countenance change, supposing you innocent.</p>
               <p>Spensley. I suppose it would.</p>
               <p>M. Sabberton. He takes the note in question in hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the number of this note.</p>
               <p>Sabberton. We have never a number so high as this. This is not a bank note, but there is some resemblance to be sure.</p>
               <p>The Jury look at the plates and the papers found, &amp;c.</p>

I ordered the foreman to examine his bag of chips, that he carried away when he went from work; thinking he might waste his time in spliting up slabs, I found his chips consisted chiefly in slabs, and such sort, for which I reprov'd him. The foreman in searching to the bottom of his bag said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050027"/> here is something more in it and turn'd it out, and it prov'd to be iron-bolts and nails, and such like useful iron.</p>

               <p>Batson. It is valued in the indictment at 7 s. they were worth to us above 24 s. (produced in court, and deposed to) He confess'd they were our property before we went before the justice, and before the justice; and that he took it out of our iron warehouse.</p>

I put my hand into his apron, and found it to be yellow brass. I made him come back along with me into the foundery, and got a thing and emptied it into from out of his apron and pockets. We took him before a justice, he told him he could not deny it, when charg'd with stealing it, and said he was very sorry for it. (It was Mr. Alexander's property.)</p>

            's, a peruke maker in Blossom's inn-yard, in a post-chaise with one Mr. Tindal. I was then shaving; he appeared to me to be just come to town. Mr. Richford went out of his shop to welcome Mr. Tindal to town; he took the prisoner to be Mr. Tindal's friend: after I had been shav'd, I went into the kitchen, (I lodg'd there) where was Mr. Tindal and the prisoner at the bar. Mr. Tindal soon went out, the prisoner staid there relating to Mr. Richford their travel on the road; after that he said to the maid, pray shew me my lodging, which she did; about a quarter of an hour after he return'd to the kitchen, and made no stay but went out of the house. I saw his things unpack'd; some linen and wearing apparel. On Sunday the 5th, while I was at breakfast in the kitchen, I saw Mr. Tindal and he go out together: I saw no more of him till as breakfast the day after about nine o'clock, he had been out all night. After he had made some apologies for his staying out, he went to his room, I went to mine; the maid was making my bed. She said the captain, meaning the prisoner, has taken a pen out of your inkstand. She had hardly spoke these words before he return'd with the pen in his hand, and said Mr. Nowell, I hope you'll excuse the freedom I have taken in taking your pen out of your room; he perceiving some knit breeches pieces lying on the table, ask'd me if I dealt that way. I said I bought them for friends in the country; he ask'd me if he might have a piece, I told him he might, he chose out three of them, and ask'd me the price, I said eight shillings each; he desir'd me to put them aside for him. He took out some silver from his pocket, and said he had not cash enough; but I have a note upon my agent if you can give me cash for it. I told him I could not conveniently: he said I should have receiv'd this money on Saturday: but I did not choose my agent should know of my being here, least the lieutenant colonel should know of it. He ask'd, who it was best to send it by, I said a porter if it was one that he knew; he said I am a stranger in town. Then I said you had better employ a ticket porter; he shew'd me the note (produc'd in court) this is it. Pray, sir, said he, are not you going to that part of the town. I said I believ'd I might in the afternoon; then sir, said he, I should be oblig'd to you, if you'll please to take it and receive the money for me. I said I would, and took the note with me; but whether I call'd that afternoon or the next day I am not certain. When I came to my lodging, Mr. Richford told me he had receiv'd a letter from the captain, desiring to know whether I had receiv'd the money for the note, if I had to bring it him to the Five Bells tavern, near the New Church in the Strand, where I went and paid it to the prisoner, deducting twenty-four shillings for the breeches pieces; having receiv'd it of

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Richford. I live in Lawrence-lane by Guild-Hall, I suppose the prisoner asked him if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050030"/> could lodge at the same house; he had a room at my house and stay'd there about four or five days; in that time I found his hours would not agree with the custom of my house. I desired to be excused his lying there; I should take it as a favour if he would withdraw.</p>
               <p>Q. While he was at your house did you receive a letter from him?</p>
               <p>Richford. I receiv'd a letter from him, setting forth he should not come home that night; and, he in it, desir'd I'd tell my lodger, he expected he would send the two pieces: (which I apprehended to be the knit breeches pieces) he mentioned nothing of money in it. I remember his saying Mr. Nowell had forty pounds of his.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Richford, when the prisoner was at our house; he went by the name of the Captain. I was once making Mr. Nowell's bed, and the captain came into the room and borrow'd his pen and ink; he ask'd where the gentleman was that belong'd to that room; I said, I believed, he was in the shop. Mr. Nowell came up, and they stood talking together a good while. I look'd into the room again, and saw the prisoner holding a piece of paper, as if he was going to give it Mr. Nowell, but I did not see him deliver it. I remember his coming in and asking my master if he had seen Mr. Nowell; and, I think, my master said he had not seen him since morning; the captain said he had given him a no te, and he must go and see for him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was ask'd if he had any thing to say in his defence? He said he had nothing to say.</p>

I took it up; as to picking his pocket, I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050031"/> meddled with it; after that I went into the room, and found a penny on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Who was in the room with you when you went to sleep?</p>

About 9 o'clock at night, on the 9th of March, I was on my duty, and saw three men come quick out of a warehouse, the prisoner was the last of them; he had a hard knob of sugar under each arm, he dropped them, and ran away. I could not take him, so I came back and took up the sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods were in that warehouse?</p>
               <p>Chinner. There was sugar, and of the very same fort which the prisoner dropped.</p>

            , when I went into the warehouse, I saw a large cloth by a hogshead of sugar that had the top taken off; there was a quarter of a hundred and sixteen pounds of sugar on the cloth, which they had not time to take away. I knowing the prisoner, went and inquired for him of the officers at the Tower, and they delivered him to me, and I carried him before my Lord-mayor; there he was examined, he denied it at first; but at last wanted to turn evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own he took the sugar?</p>
               <p>Chinner. He told us who were there, and did take it, but we cannot find them; his wife came to me since to go to him to the counter, and then he wanted to be admitted an evidence, and desired me to lessen the weight of the sugar upon his trial, and said he could make up the value of a guinea, if I would do that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man that dropped the sugar, for it was dark at that time?</p>
               <p>Chinner. I had my lanthorn in my hand, and he came out side-ways to me; and I knowing him well before, am very certain he is the man.</p>

            . I am a watchman: mr. Chinner called me, and said he had a warehouse broke open. I went with him to the warehouse, we found the staple of the door drawn out, the door open, and a cloth lying on the floor with a good deal of sugar in it; he shewed me the two pieces that he said he picked up; we found an old hat in the hogshead of sugar.

               <p>Q. How came you to be so particular as to know it was the 9th of March?</p>
               <p>Bannister. His wife came the next morning, and told me he was in trouble; so I remember it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Chinner. When was the prisoner taken up?</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to be so particular as to half an hour after 7.</p>
               <p>Bannister. Because they were going to have a bit of victuals for supper, and they desired me to go for a pot of beer; he was in bed when I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he sup?</p>
               <p>Bannister. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he well or ill?</p>
               <p>Bannister. He was very well.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to go to bed so soon?</p>
               <p>Bannister. He gave no reason for that.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go to bed?</p>
               <p>Bannister. I believe he went to bed about a quarter of an hour before I came away; his wife told me she was going to washing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you eat your supper?</p>
               <p>Bannister. In that room.</p>

               <p>Mallop.

We went into Swan-alley and found the prisoner, there he gave me charge of her. I asked her what she had done with the six guineas; she said she had made use of one. I asked her where were the rest; she took out some money in a paper from her breast, and delivered it to me; when it was opened there were a guinea and a half of it.

On Monday the 27th of February, I was attacked by a man in a soldier's dress, who presented a horse pistol to me, and said if I mov'd I was a dead man. - Your money - and he swore a second time if, I spoke I was a dead man. I spoke only one word, which was nothing: I put my hand in my pocket and took hold of the chain of my watch, he said I must have your watch, upon seeing the chain. I was going to deliver it, he took it himself before I drew it out, he pushed me with the other hand at the same time, and said go along.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050033"/>Q. Was you put in fear ?</p>
               <p>Dunier. This put me in foar indeed. I was going to give him my money also, but he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person that took the watch?</p>
               <p>Dunier. I did not see his face so as to know it. As I was going away, I saw two men and told them I had been robbed of my watch; but they gave me no assistance at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distance from the place where you was robb'd?</p>
               <p>Dunier. About twenty paces distance.</p>
               <p>Q. What sized man was it that took your watch?</p>
               <p>Dunier. He was a tall man in soldiers cloaths. I went next morning to justice Fielding, and told him I had been robb'd of my watch, and the name and number, about 8 o'clock over night, by a tall soldier about thirty-five years of age. The justice told me if he heard any thing of it he'd let me know. The next day I received a card from him to come to him directly, and that the watch was found. I was robb'd on the Monday, and he sent for me the Wednesday after. I went, he sent for the prisoner; but before the prisoner came he shew'd me a pocket-pistol: it was the same size of that which was presented to me; after that the justice sent for the pawnbroker, who brought my watch, the chain was gone; there was in the watch a little paper that I cut myself: the watch I well knew, having had it above seven years; the prisoner was afterwards produc'd, he is of the same size; but I will not swear to the man, only seeing his face as it were like lightening, and it was dark; the pawnbroker said he had the watch of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to that?</p>
               <p>Dunier. He said he bought it of a Jew in the high road.</p>

            . (He produced a silver watch).</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at this watch, do you know it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my property, the same I lost that night.</p>
               <p>Humphrys. On Tuesday the 28th of February last, the prisoner at the bar brought this watch to my shop, and ask'd me to lend him a guinea and a half upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed then?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. He was in soldiers-cloaths. I ask'd him whose it was? he said it was his own. I said I could not lend him any money upon it, till he could bring somebody to make it appear it was his own; he went away and came again, and brought another man to his character, who said he believed it to be the prisoner's own watch; I said that would not do.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you stopped the watch at his first coming?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. I had. He told me where he lodged. I went to inquire about him but could not find his lodging; he came again, and upon seeing me he went to go away. I took hold of the skirt of his coat and pulled him into my back parlour, and told him he must go before a justice of the peace, to make it appear it was his own property, before he and I parted.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. This was betwixt five and six in the afternoon. When we were in St. Martin's-lane, he wanted to go and have some beer; I said when we were got a little farther he should have beer enough. Presently he got away from me, I took hold of him again, and said he should not go till we had been before the justice. I took him before justice Fielding; there Mr. Fielding's clerk told me Mr. Dunier had been there the night before, and said he had been robbed of such a watch; the prisoner was committed that night, and the next day carried before Mr. Fielding again: then Mr. Fielding ordered a man to go with me to the prisoner's lodging which we did, and there we found a horse pistol loaded. I was sent for to Mr. Fielding's the next day at one o'clock, there was the prosecutor; I shewed him the watch, he said it was his: Mr. Fielding sent for the prisoner, but I was not by when he was examined. I went away and was ordered to come again at three o'clock. (The horse pistol produced in court) The prisoner said the night I took him, he bought the watch of a Jew in Holbourn, before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before he brought the watch to you?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. No; I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he is the man that brought the watch to you on the 28th of February?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Was there any body along with the man that robbed you?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050034"/>Prosecutor. No, he was alone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>This watch I bought of a jew in Oxford Road, and that is what I told the pawnbroker. He was a tall swarthy black man, with an old red coat on, much like a jew, if he was not one. I first bought a pair of sleeve buttons of him for a penny: he seeing me have some money, asked me if I would buy a watch; I asked him what he would have for it, he said three guineas and a half for it; I bid him two guineas, and at last we agreed for two guineas and a half. There was nothing to it but a bit of packthread and a key. As to this pistol, that is the property of serjeant Davis, he gave it me to clean for him, he has been dead about six weeks, so I kept it, knowing hi s wife had no occasion for it.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner about a year and half; I belong to the same regiment as he does, the second regiment. Last Monday was five weeks I was in company with him, at Mr. Spicer's, at the Two Brewers, near St. Giles's Church, a public-house, from a little after five in the afternoon, till ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you be particular as to the day?</p>
               <p>Lord. I was going to inlist a young man from out of the country that day.</p>
               <p>Q. During this time from five to ten, was the prisoner with you the whole time?</p>
               <p>Lord. I can't say he was with me the whole time, he was out twice, but not longer than a quarter of an hour at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you doing all that time?</p>
               <p>Lord. We were drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other person in your company?</p>
               <p>Lord. There were only he, I, and another man, who came out of Hertfordshire. We parted all at the door; I don't know where he went?</p>
               <p>Q. What might the prisoner spend?</p>
               <p>Lord. I spent about 18 d. and the prisoner the same.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Hertfordshire man spend?</p>

            . I live in New Brook-street, near Bloomsbury-Square, near the watch-house. I was going up Tyburn-Road last Monday was five five weeks; the prisoner was buying a pair of buttons of a jew, in a dark red cloak; they asked me to change a six-pence, I did, the jew asked him if he would buy a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout was this?</p>
               <p>Myers. This was just before you come to Oxford-market. The jew asked three guineas and a half for the watch; they could not agree, the jew came to three guineas, the soldier bid him two and a half, they agreed for that.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was that?</p>
               <p>Myers. I believe this was about ten o'clock in the morning, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Myers. I never was acquainted with him; I was going of a message.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Myers. I never saw him before nor since till now?</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find him out?</p>
               <p>Myers. Because he described me to his wife, what sort of a man I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How describe you?</p>
               <p>Myers. He said there was a lame person by, so she found me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there no other lame persons besides you in that part of the town?</p>
               <p>Myers. I don't think there is a man with such a foot as mine, and to go with a stick as I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to find you?</p>
               <p>Myers. I work about Holbourn, and she was coming by, and ask'd me if I did not go up Tyburn-Road such a day; I said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Myers. I go of messages in Holbourn and Southampton-street, and clean shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the watch?</p>
               <p>Myers. No, but I saw it had a key and a bit of packthread to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it?</p>
               <p>Myers. It was a white watch.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not pick up a paper that dropt out of the watch when I was buying it.</p>
               <p>Myers. Here is a piece of paper, (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no acquaintance with the prisoner before this?</p>
               <p>Myers. I had not till I was subpoened to come here.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050035"/>Q. Who brought the subpoena ?</p>
               <p>Myers. His wife did.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at this paper do you know it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was such a one in my watch when it was taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Myers. Had you not this paper from the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Myers. No, I had not, I picked it up just before you come to Oxford-market; it lay on the flag-stones just by a door.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. There were two papers in my watch, one of them my own cutting and this.</p>
               <p>Q. Which lay uppermost?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This lay uppermost.</p>
               <p>Q. to Myers. How came you to preserve this paper for five weeks together?</p>
               <p>Myers. I put it in my pocket with the six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Where has it been since?</p>
               <p>Myers. I have had it in my pocket ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the prisoner since?</p>
               <p>Myers. I have since I was subpoened.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he know that you had that bit of paper?</p>
               <p>Myers. I told him there was something that fell out of the watch at the time; he said it does not signify, it was good for nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any instruction from him to preserve this paper till to-day?</p>
               <p>Myers. No, I had not.</p>

               <p>Q. How old do you think he may be?</p>
               <p>Franklin. I imagine he may be about thirty years of age.

            . I was along with the two prisoners at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. When ?</p>
               <p>Butcher. I can't say how long it is ago, it may be three quarters of a year ago; we have been in confinement, on the other side the water, between six and seven months, and it was some time before we were in confinement. There were four of us, the two prisoners and Mrs. Ingram, and myself. We went into a shop in the Cloysters; we asked to look at a gown, but did not intend to buy any.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your intention in going in?</p>
               <p>Butcher. We went in in order, if we could have an opportunity to take any thing out of the shop, to take it. This we had agreed upon before, Mrs. Ingram took a scarlet duffil cardinal, and she carried it home into St. Thomas's, on the other side the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the prisoners see it taken?</p>
               <p>Butcher. Miller knew it was taken, when we came out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with it afterwards?</p>
               <p>Butcher. I pawn'd it for 8 s. in Joyner's-street, in a court. I can't tell the pawnbroker's name; the constable went and got it by my describing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you taken up for this fact?</p>
               <p>Butcher. No, I was taken up on another fact, on the other side the water, and on my confession, the justice sent to the prosecutor, and let him know of it. (The cardinal produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this cardinal, (she looks at it.)</p>
               <p>Butcher. I can't swear to it, it was like this.</p>
               <p>Q. to Nicklen. Do you know this cardinal?</p>
               <p>Nicklen. I know it is like our make, but one may be like another. This Butcher said before the justice, she pawn'd it the very day they stole it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know it to be your property?</p>
               <p>Nicklen. It was cut out in a particular manner, we never sell them till they are quilted up. When I was before justice Clark on the 17th of September last, I saw the two prisoners at the bar, and the evidence; she there gave an account of a great many things which she said they had stole, which I believe to be ours.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 26th of February, a little after 2 in the morning, I was doing my duty, the beadle and I were going by the lower end of York-street, St. James's Square, we saw Parsly with a basket on his shoulder; it appeared to me to be full. Dannald had three legs of mutton, two of them were in an apron over his shoulder, the other on his right arm; they went up the street by us, I saw the legs of mutton had not been chopped; I began to feel on them, he let them fall on the ground; the other watchman laid hold of Parsly, we took them both to the watchouse, and wanted them to give an account to the constable how they came by this meat. When the constable examined the basket which Parsly had, there was a breast of veal, a shoulder of mutton, and part of another shoulder.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever lend her any of these things?</p>
               <p>Owen. I only lent her one apron; she took two of my aprons besides that; she quitted her lodgings, when I missed the things, and I happened to meet her in the street about a week afterwards; she had my gown and one apron on at the time. At first she denied the gown to be mine; but at last she owned it was mine. I charged a constable with her, and found the other things afterwards in St. Gyles's; I lodged in Holbourn, and found her in St. Gyles's.</p>

            . I am constable. The prosecutrix came to my house, and desired me to go with her to take the prisoner in custody for robbing her of her cloaths. She said there were some woman had detained her till she found a constable. I went with her to a house, where were many women; they asked me what business I had there, and where was my warrant. I had nothing but my pocket-staff. They w anted me to let the prisoner run away. The prisoner delivered all the things to me but the shift which was on her back. I turned my back, and she pulled it off, and delivered it to me; the prisoner picked out the things from amongst others of her own, and said to the prosecutrix, these are your things. ( Produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing at all of them; I was coming along Chancery-lane, and met an old woman; she asked me where I came from, I said three miles from Shrewsbury; she said she came from Worcestershire; she bid me call where she lived, and drink a dish of tea; I went there, and drank a dish of tea; she asked me to come and lodge there; I told her I paid 12 d a week where I was, and worked plain work; I proposed to go there on the Saturday, but I did not go. I never lodged in that house in my life; that is, the house where she says I lodged.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Did the prisoner and you lodge in one house together?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I am sure she lodged with me; it was at the house of an elderly woman, an acquaintance of mine; she did once live with my father in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. What country?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I came out of Shropshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner in the country?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, I know nothing at all of her; I came to London for a service; I got a place; but at present am out of place, and so I was when I lost my things.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you lived in London?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I lived with Mr. Dent in Cary-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did the prisoner give of herself, when you lodged together?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. She said she came from Shrewsbury, but I had not much conversation with her, being backwards and forwards to my relations to get a place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been about two months in London.</p>
