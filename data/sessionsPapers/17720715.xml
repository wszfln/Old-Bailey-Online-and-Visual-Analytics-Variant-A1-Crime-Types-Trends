On the 6th of June, about seven or eight in the evening, the two prisoners came into my house; they came through the tap room into the parlour; they called for a pint of beer and sat down, and staid till the other company were gone. The silver mug stood behind them; my wife moved it a-cross the room; the prisoners sat down by it; then they laid their heads together and whispered; I did not see my wife move the mug, but I saw it after it was removed; after some time Wallis went away; then George gave my wife a shilling; there was some squabble about the shilling; while they were disputing about the shilling, there was an alarm that the mug was gone. I suspect that the dispute about the shilling was an artifice, to give the other man time to get off. I stopt George; he told me the other man had got the mug, and confessed, that they were both concerned in it, and he gave me a direction where to find the other man; I went to a court according to his direction, I met Wallis there; I took him before the Justice; in the way, he took the mug out of the lining of his coat, and gave it me; (produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. from Wallis. Was not I in liquor?</p>
               <p>Pye. I did not perceive they were either of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150004"/> them in liquor; after Wallis gave me the mug, he said, George put in his pocket.</p>

I saw my bureau was broke open; I said, I am ruined! I am ruined! he said, no you are not, I will deliver up all I have taken from you; I held my hat, and he took the money and two rings out of his pocket; I locked the money up directly. I looked at it and counted it next morning; I found two rings next day, which were dropped near the bureau; when he returned it to me, there were 13 guineas in a bag; there was 19 l. 14 s. in silver, seven guineas and a half guinea, and a 36 s. piece; that money was loose.

            ; he asked me what they wanted: I told him they had a gold watch, and a pinchbeck one with a gold dial plate, to sell; they had shewed me the watches. Lyons desired me to take them that had the watches into a public house; I took them into the Crown in Camomile Street. Devine had the gold watch, and Gore the other; they went into the house. Lyons desired me to keep the other out of doors, which I did, he asked me which had the gold watch about him; I shewed him. After he had looked over the gold watch, then Gore produced the pinchbeck watch; I sat in one box, they in another; Lyons offered six guineas for them both: they said no, they would have five guineas for the gold one, and a guinea and a half for the pinchbeck; he said, he would give them no more than six guineas; he put the watches in his pocket, and said, if they would go home with him, he would give them the money. He gave me sixpence to pay for two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150008"/> pints of beer, and bid me stay till they came back; I staid a quarter of an hour, but they did not come back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them before?</p>

               <p>Meyers. Yes; I sat under the window and looked at him; he was opposite me.</p>
               <p>Q. from Dempsey. Did I say any thing to you?</p>
               <p>Meyers. Yes; he said, shew me to ever a one, and we will satisfy you?</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by ever a one?</p>
               <p>Meyers. Ever a man that can buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. from Devine. Did you see a watch upon me?</p>
               <p>Meyers. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did I take it from?</p>
               <p>Meyers. Out of his watch pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was the gold one, white enamelled, or gold dial plate?</p>
               <p>Meyers. I did not take notice of that, it was a plain case.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Glover. Was yours a plain watch?</p>

               <p>Gore. No; only John Devine and I; we had pistols each; Dempsey and Devine ran round the chaise, and Devine jumped in at the other window; I was on the left hand side of the chaise.</p>

            ; I opened the other door. Devine took from the gentleman 15 s. a handkerchief, a gold watch and a paper painted snuff box; then we desired the post boy to drive off, and we came straight to town.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the post chaise going into the country?</p>
               <p>Gore. No, coming to town; we came straight to town through the fields. The next night we sold the watch to one Lyons, a Jew, in Sweet Apple Court I think; it is in Bishopsgate street. We spoke to this man; he was going through the street, and he met Lyons. We went to a street on the other side Bishopsgate street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any words pass between the gentleman and you, when you robbed him?</p>
               <p>Gore. Yes; I asked the gentleman if he had any more money: he said, no, he had been paying money in the country, and had no more; then I said we would search him; he pulled down the flap of his breeches, and said, Search gentlemen where you please. We just put a hand on the flap, and said it was no matter; we supposed he had no more.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you get for this watch?</p>
               <p>Gore. Five guineas; Lyons gave us five guineas for it; we sold him a pinchbeck watch with a gold dial plate at the same time, for which he gave us a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. from Dempsey. Did you ever see me speak to that man.</p>
               <p>Gore. Yes; Devine had the watch, Dempsey was in company, and stood at the door whilst Devine and I went into the house; he went afterwards with us to Lyons's lodging, and stood at the door; Lyons's whore went out to change a 20 l. note, as she said, and Dempster followed her.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Glover. You did not mention any conversation that passed at the time you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Mr. Glover. No; I confined myself merely to the fact, that I might not lead the accomplice; I have never yet mentioned the conversation; it was nearly the same as the accomplice has related; one of them did ask for my pocket book, which I gave him; I told him it contained nothing but old letters; one opened it; said he, Sir, will you tell us where we may send it to you to-morrow morning; I said that was unnecessary, for it contained nothing but old letters, upon which he returned it to me.</p>

I had put a guinea's worth of half pence into the till, at eleven o'clock over night; I found the drawer locked in the morning; as soon as I opened it I missed the money; I immediately charged the prisoner with having taken it; I told her if she would return the money she might go about her business; she denied it, and was angry at my suspecting her; then I threatened to send for a constable, and did send for one; we opened the drawer where she kept her things, and there we found 121 halfpence, tied up in her own handkerchief; the constable found a key upon the prisoner's bunch, which opened the look of the till in the bar; then she confessed she took the halfpence that morning, but said she did not take them for want.</p>

            . I attend Mr. Sherwood's office; on the 20th of June I went with a search warrant to where the prisoner lives, and there I found this pork, in an earthen pan in the prisoner's apartments; (producing three pieces of pork.)</p>

I was at work at the back of Mr. Youins's house that night; I saw him turn the prisoner out about eleven o'clock at night; I saw him again about a quarter after three; he came to us, as we had a fire, to warm himself; he was shaking with cold; he said he had lain in the boat all night; he staid about seven minutes; then he jumped over the ditch and left us; he had something in his trowsers pocket that appeared to be very heavy. I told Mr. Youins when he got up, that the prisoner had been on board an India man, as I supposed, and got loaded.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever been in company with him before?</p>
               <p>Hay. No; he always used to look at me, and give me halfpence when he met me; he pulled down my breeches and then his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you frightened at this?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes, I was a little. He set me in an elbow chair; he set me down and kissed me a little; then he made me lay down with my face on the chair, and so he came behind me; he put his c - k into my b - e.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you submit to it quietly, or make any resistance?</p>
               <p>Hay. I submitted to it quietly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he keep it in your b - e?</p>
               <p>Hay. About five minutes I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he quite in?</p>
               <p>Hay. A little.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in at all?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing come from him?</p>
               <p>Hay. Some wet stuff that was white; I wiped it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe to the jury how far it was in your body?</p>
               <p>Hay. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you wipe the wet off with?</p>
               <p>Hay. My shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was in you?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes.</p>

               <p>Hay. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do after this?</p>
               <p>Hay. He set me down in the elbow chair, kissed me a little, and gave me some halfpence, about a groat, and told me not to tell any body.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay?</p>
               <p>Hay. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to do any thing more to you?</p>
               <p>Hay. No, not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the house besides?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to cry out?</p>
               <p>Hay. I was ashamed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had ever any body served you in this manner before?</p>
               <p>Hay. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your uncle, or any body, when you came home?</p>
               <p>Hay. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you go again?</p>
               <p>Hay. He desired me to come next day; I went; he unbuttoned my breeches again, and then his own.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go next day?</p>
               <p>Hay. About eleven o'clock; he made me rub his c - k up and down till some white stuff came again.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he put his - into your b - e, it was stiff and hard, was it?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes.</p>

               <p>Hay. About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You quietly submitted to all that?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes; he gave me the buckle and some halfpence then, and desired me to come again next day; I went next day about eleven o'clock, he told me to come at eleven; he unbuttoned his breeches again, and mine too; he did the same again that time as he did the last day.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you discover this?</p>
               <p>Hay. I was taken very ill after this; I was ill a week; I had a pain in my thighs and legs that I could not stand. About a fortnight ago, after I was well, he came to the shop one day, and looked on the show glasses; he did not speak to me, I was serving a customer; he bespoke a shirt buckle of my uncle; it was to be sent home<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150013"/> to him; my uncle ordered me to go with the buckle; I told him he had better go, and perhaps he might get the captain's business.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went so willingly two days together after the first offence was committed, how came you to make the objection to go now?</p>
               <p>Hay. I was afraid he would serve me the same thing again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to object to go now and not before?</p>
               <p>Hay. He told me not to tell of it, and I was ashamed; the reason was because I was so ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think you had been doing a wrong thing?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes; as soon as he left the shop I told Mr. Rapley of it; he is a jeweller in Tottenham-court-road; directly after I had spoke to my uncle.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it the captain came to look at the shew glass?</p>
               <p>Hay. About twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Hay. I was ashamed to tell my uncle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there before dinner?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your uncle the whole story, how he had served you these three times?</p>
               <p>Hay. I told him what he had done to me the first time, but not the three last times.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell it now, when you kept it a secret so long.</p>
               <p>Hay. I thought I would tell of it all the while, but I was ashamed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think you had been doing a wrong thing with him.</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to go of your own accord the second and third times?</p>

               <p>Hay. The whole of it.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you find any wet come from him while in your b - e? You must remember you are on your oath, and the prisoner's life is at stake on what you are saying, therefore don't say any thing that is not strictly true; where did you wipe the wet from?</p>

               <p>Q. Can you account for it, why he was not taken up for a whole week after your telling this story?</p>
               <p>Hay. I do not understand it?</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you told Mr. Rapley the same story as now?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes; my uncle was backwards, and as soon he came into the shop, he told my uncle what a sad affair had happened?</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you told Mr. Rapley, did you go to his shop, or tell him at your uncle's shop?</p>
               <p>Hay. In my un cle's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the captain been gone at that time?</p>

               <p>Hay. I was quite ashamed of it when I was with him?</p>
               <p>Q. But when you went the second time?</p>
               <p>Hay. I went for the buckles, he ordered me to come for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the mistress of the house the second time?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up stairs?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes, and then he locked the room door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask the mistress of the house if he was at home?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150015"/>Hay. Yes; she said he was, and I went up: he told me to come up stairs to him.</p>

               <p>Hay. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever meet him before?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes; in St. Martin's-lane and he gave me 2 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that ever you saw him before the Tuesday you went to his house?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes.</p>

            . I am this lad's uncle; he has lived with me about half a year; he lived formerly with his grandfather opposite where the prisoner lodged.</p>
               <p>Q. How has the boy behaved himself since he lived with you?</p>
               <p>Mercer. Very well; he has been a good boy.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character for veracity?</p>
               <p>Mercer. Very good.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not a lying boy is he?</p>
               <p>Mercer. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not caught him in lies?</p>
               <p>Mercer. No; when I came in with Mr. Rapley, I saw the boy behind the counter; Mr. Jones was looking into the shew-glass; I told the boy, there was his friend Mr. Jones; I asked him why he did not speak to him; he said he did not like it, and made several evasions, he was ashamed and such as that, which I thought was the boy's bashfulness; the captain afterwards came in, looked at the shirt buckles, and bespoke one; I was to send it home: after which, the boy said he hoped I would carry it home myself; I asked him, why? his reply was, that perhaps I should get some more of the captain's business by so doing. I went out of the shop backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Mercer. I believe about a fortnight ago; when I came back, Mr. Rapley said, the boy had been ill used, he believed there had been an attempt to commit buggery upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. If this discovery was made a fortnight ago, how came you to stay so long before you took the captain up?</p>
               <p>Mercer. The next day Mr. Brest called upon me; I thought it proper to communicate it to him sooner than any body else, I did not tell it to him, because I did not know the story; I rather chose the boy might tell it another person, then me, as I thought he might be ashamed, and not tell me the truth. I told the gentleman, he said he was going further and would call again, and desired me to bid the boy tell him all the truth. He came, and the boy did; then he told my father (the boy's grandfather) of it; after that we went to one of the justice's of the peace.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was the application to the magistrate after this discovery?</p>
               <p>Mercer. Two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. What justice was the application made to?</p>
               <p>Mercer. Justice Mercer.</p>
               <p>Q. The captain was not taken up till last Tuesday I believe.</p>
               <p>Mercer. No, Mr. Mercer desired we might consider minutely on it, and not do any thing rashly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the captain was apprehended?</p>
               <p>Mercer. No; I was at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not discover any awkwardness in the boy's gate?</p>
               <p>Mercer. Yes, he walked lamish.</p>
               <p>Q. What immediately?</p>
               <p>Mercer. No; I believe about a week, the Sunday after.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a general pain all over his limbs.</p>
               <p>Mercer. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He complained of a pain in his feet, thighs and legs?</p>
               <p>Mercer. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy had a good education?</p>
               <p>Mercer. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can he read and write?</p>
               <p>Mercer. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a sensible boy?</p>
               <p>Mercer. Yes, rather so than otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he told this story pretty much the same to all of you?</p>
               <p>Mercer. Yes he has; he has told it to me, Mr. Brest and Mr. Rapley.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose his linen was washed before this discovery?</p>
               <p>Mercer. Yes, a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard that any blood was found on his shirt?</p>
               <p>Mercer. No; I never heard any thing of it?</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the boy's story here; did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150016"/> he tell the story the same to you as he has done here?</p>
               <p>Mercer. As near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell the story to you, that the captain was in his body?</p>
               <p>Mercer. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that he wiped some wet off?</p>
               <p>Mercer. He did not tell that to me, I heard it from others that he told it; I rather chose he should tell the story to other people.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say you never observed any aukwardness in his gate till the pains in his legs; and when he went these days to the captain, you did not observe any thing of it?</p>
               <p>Mercer. No.</p>

               <p>- Rapley. I was in the shop when Capt. Jones bespoke a shirt buckle.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Mr. Mercer went backwards after the captain was gone?</p>
               <p>Rapley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop?</p>
               <p>Rapley. The boy and me; the boy expressed a wish; (I believe that was his word;) "I wish my uncle would not let me carry the buckle home." I asked him, why? he would not answer me; I repeated the question several times; he said then, he was ashamed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he did tell you?</p>
               <p>Rapley. It was two or three minutes before I got any thing from him, then he said the captain hurt him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cry or any thing?</p>
               <p>Rapley. No, he turned his head from me; I asked him how he hurt him; he still persisted he was ashamed; I insisted on knowing how he hurt him, otherwise I would inform his uncle; he then, after my further persisting in knowing it, said he would tell me, if I would promise not to tell his uncle, but still evaded it; I then shifted on it that I would tell his uncle, and get him to hear the story from him; he then told me, that after meeting the captain in St. Martin's-lane, he went home with him, took him on his knee, unbottoned his breeches, and unbuttoned his own, and hurt him that way: I asked him how; he then said, with his c - k: I asked him, where; he persisted he was ashamed; I then called it by the vulgar name of a - e; he said he hurt him there, by shoving against him; I asked if it was there, he said, yes. I asked him if he had ever been there after that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about any wet?</p>
               <p>Rapley. I did not question him as to that, neither did he mention that to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he shoved him, or how he laid him down?</p>
               <p>Rapley. He did not tell me of laying him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how long he stayed with the captain the first time?</p>
               <p>Rapley. He said he was there some time, that the captain locked the door as soon as he got in; and he had been there two or three times besides. I asked him if he ever served him so again; he said he always took his breeches down, likewise his own, but no further.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been frequent in the boy's company?</p>
               <p>Rapley. Yes; by seeing him at his uncle's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he is a boy of veracity or used to tell lies?</p>
               <p>Rapley. I never knew him any other then to tell truth.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When he gave you this account, he said only that he had shoved against him?</p>
               <p>Rapley. And hurt him by shoving.</p>
               <p>Q. He said nothing of his penetrating his body?</p>
               <p>Rapley. I did not ask him, nor he did not tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard nothing of this story of the wet?</p>
               <p>Rapley. I have heard it but not at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you hear that first?</p>
               <p>Rapley. After having informed the uncle, he set a friend, Mr. Brest, to enquire more particularly of the boy. The uncle coming into the shop, at the time I had heard from the boy what I have related, prevented my further enquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. From his account, by what you told the uncle, you thought it an attempt only?</p>
               <p>Rapley. Yes.</p>

            . I am a book-keeper to Mr. Prater, at Charing Cross; I have known the boy from his cradle.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a boy of veracity?</p>
               <p>Brest. I know he used to tell the truth if he had committed any little fault in the family, if asked to tell the truth afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You was desired by the uncle to examine him respecting this charge of Capt. Jones. I believe; when was that?</p>
               <p>Brest. Last Tuesday was se'ennight I examined the boy, at his uncle's.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell the story particularly.</p>
               <p>Brest. I had business with Mr. Robinson, in Parliament-street; I called on Mr. Mercer to ask him how he did; he told me a terrible accident had happened, and gave me a little item of it; he said the party was Capt. Jones, who appeared in the character of Punch at the Masquerade. I told him I was going farther, and would call again; he said in the intermediate time, he would speak to the boy, and order him to tell me nothing but the truth. I called again on my return, and took the boy into the parlour; we were by ourselves. I asked him if he knew there was a God; he told me, yes. (I know the family is a religious one, and the boy is obliged to go with them to church every Sunday, and is afterwards kept at home to read his catechism and the like.) I asked him, if he knew the consequence of telling a lie? he told me, yes; I said do you know what you are going to say? he said, yes; he was going to say nothing but the truth. I said if you call God to witness to an action that you are going to tell against Mr. Jones, it is either truth or a lie; the consequence of it will be, you will terminate either his fate or your happiness, and be particular. I told him as he began his story again, that bad people went to hell, and good people to heaven. I mentioned these things by way of caution to him, that he might utter nothing but truth. He then told me Capt. Jones met him in St. Martin's-lane, and told him to go home with him, that he had a buckle to mend; that he went; Capt. Jones locked the door as he went in. Capt. Jones pulled down his breeches and his own; that he took him on his knee, (to the best of my knowledge;) put his hand on his c - k, and took the boy's hands and put them on his own, and rubbed it till some wet stuff came; that he then, on the wet stuff coming from him, kissed him; that he turned the boy; I believe the boy told me the intermediate time of that was about ten minutes; he turned him on his face in an elbow chair; he then put his c - k to his a - e hole, that was the language of the boy; that he there pushed, and made it hurt him; that he got off presently, and that there was wet, which he wiped off with the tail of his shirt. I asked him if the captain's - was in his body; his answer was, he found it hurt him. I asked him particularly at that time, whether he found it in him; he said it hurt him exceedingly, that he could not walk, and he believed it was; I then interrogated him very minutely, respecting its being in him; he said it was, and hurt him, and that he wanted to strike him, or push him away, or to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he said positively it was in him, did he?</p>
               <p>Brest. Yes; and he said the wet was at his a - e hole, and he wiped it off with the tail of his shirt. I cannot remember whether he said he himself put his breeches up, or whether the prisoner did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how long he was there at that time.</p>
               <p>Brest. Half an hour to the best of my knowledge; that then the prisoner gave him four pence, I think, and a halfpenny; that the prisoner desired him not to tell any body, but bid him come again in the morning. The boy told me to the best of my knowledge, that he went next morning; however that he went twice more; that each time he robbed him, as he had the first time he went, and that the white stuff fell upon the carpet, but nothing more.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When the boy told you this story, he said he had pushed at him in the elbow chair, was that his expression?</p>
               <p>Brest. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he said nothing more till he was asked several times about it, did he give you an answer?</p>
               <p>Brest. Yes; with the greatest case without any emotion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he answer in the negative the first time?</p>
               <p>Brest. When I asked him any question, I told him he must consider the consequence of telling this story, as it might be made public.</p>
               <p>Q. At the first did he deny that the captain had entered him?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150018"/>Brest. No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did you put the question to him, whether he had been in his body, before he said he had?</p>
               <p>Brest. I cannot be certain as to that; I said if you are sure the captain did not put it in your b - e say so, if he did you must know, tell me whether he did or not; the boy said he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was told by you, that the chief matter turned upon it, whether he entered his body or not?</p>
               <p>Brest. I said a man's life depended upon it if he spoke true; he said, will he be hanged? I said yes, if what he said was true; he said well, he had told the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. But it was some considerable time before he said this?</p>
               <p>Brest. It was not more than three minutes. I was in a hurry, and desired the boy to be quick and explicit.</p>
               <p>Q. When he told you this, did you believe him.</p>
               <p>Brest. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you applied to a magistrate?</p>
               <p>Brest. I did not apply to any; his friends I believe did; the grandfather knew of it; I cautioned him to take advice. I took him to a particular friend of mine, a gentleman of fortune, who knew Captain Jones by same; he said every body, guilty of that crime, ought to be brought to justice; they took the advice of justice Mercer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is justice Mercer here?</p>
               <p>Brest. No. Mr. Bishop was present at the time, I believe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bishop. I know nothing of it, but what I heard from justice Mercer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have some witnesses to prove my attachment to women, and my landlady can prove the boy was never a minute in my lodgings.</p>

               <p>Dobson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He says he was three times at the lodgings.</p>
               <p>Dobson. I do not remember that; I remember his coming once, I believe twice, but I will not be positive; when he came in the first time, I hardly knew him at first; I said to him, Frank, is it you? he said he came about a buckle, or some such thing; I said go up.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what time of day it was?</p>
               <p>Dobson. No. He went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming down again.</p>
               <p>Dobson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the house for some time after he was up stairs?</p>
               <p>Dobson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise, or crying out, or any noise of feet, as if there was struggling.</p>
               <p>Dobson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Captain's apartments?</p>
               <p>Dobson. He had a dining room and a bed-chamber; the dining room is over the shop, and the bedchamber over the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been any noise or struggle should you have heard it?</p>
               <p>Dobson. I think I must have heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. What shop do you keep?</p>
               <p>Dobson. A china shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a carpet in the dining room?</p>
               <p>Dobson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it go all over the room?</p>
               <p>Dobson. Almost, it does not go under the chairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion of the captain of any thing of this kind?</p>
               <p>Dobson. No; I should not have thought it of him; my maid servants complained a little of him. The people that came after him were people of character.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your opinion of him?</p>
               <p>Edwards. That he is quite a different kind of a man; he bears an extreme good character, and is very fond of the women in general.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think him capable of committing such a crime as is a ledged against him?</p>
               <p>Edwards. No; I think not.</p>

            . I have known him a great many Years; I was born close to the house, where he was. His father lived in St. Martin's Lane. I am an engraver; I have done a good deal of Business for him, with regard to publications. I could never have thought this of him. I engraved the plates for A Treatise on Scaiting, and a book of Fire-works. I never heard his character impeached, and should never have suspected any thing of this sort. I was amazed when I heard it this morning.</p>

               <p>Q. You have been on terms of intimacy with him?</p>
               <p>Hope. I was formerly much so seventeen years ago, when he was very young, about fifteen or sixteen; I understood he was addicted to women; I remember once it was said he was clapped or poxed, and I believe it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever reason to suspect him capable of the crime alledged against him.</p>
               <p>Hope. I had quite a different opinion of him; I remember a good many years ago, there was a girl had a difference with her friends, and he wanted to seduce her, and I advised him to keep to common women; he struck me on that occasion several times I remember.</p>

            . On Tuesday the 9th of June, I went with Mr. Bond and Mr. Taylor into St. Giles's, to apprehend a man accused of a footpad robbery; we had been searching there about half an hour, and as we were coming away, I saw the prisoner with another young fellow, I don't know his name. I said to Mr. Bond, there is Astrop; Mr. Bond said, you must take him, for last night he went to pawn a watch and got off. As soon as he saw us come towards him, he run off; we pursued him, and took him in a court in Denmark-street, St. Giles's; when we came up to him, I put my hand in his coat pocket and found a hammer. ( Produces the hammer.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is such a hammer as he hit me with.</p>
               <p>Heley. At that time I did not particularly search him, but held his hand till I got him down to the Bear in Bow-street; when he came into the parlour, I saw the chain of a watch hang out; this is the watch (producing it;) he said it was his own; that he bought it at Gains-borough in Lincolnshire; accordingly the watch was advertised, and the prosecutor came and owned it; that is all I know of the matter.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my watch.</p>

               <p>I was coming from my father's house, the corner of New Round Court in the Strand, on Tuesday morning about eight o'clock; going up the Hay Market, I met two or three friends I had not seen sometime; they asked me to drink a glass of something with them; I went into an alehouse, and they asked about my going abroad, because they heard my father speak of it; I told them I was a going; I said I owed a little money and was going to settle it before I went. A shortish man, like a coachman, came into the company, and asked, if any body would buy a watch; I said, let me look at it. He asked a guinea and a half; I bid him 30 s. he said he was in distress; it was more than he could pawn it for, and he took it. As I was going past St. Giles's, three men run after me, and said, if I did not stop; they would knock me down; they took me to the Bear in Bow-street, and took the watch and other things from me. If I was the person, it is remarkable none of the three people know me; it is very improbable that I should strike a man with such a hammer. While I was in New Prison a man came and shook hands with me, and asked if I was not the man that bought a watch at St. Giles's; I said I was; he said he was sorry for me, knowing the justness of my cause, and if he could do any thing for me he would; he could not attend here, because, I believe, he was going out of town; he appeared before Sir

            . I am a constable of St. James's, Clerkenwell; I was in company with the prosecutor; he was speaking of having been robbed; I asked him to describe the man; he did. The prisoner was carried up to Mr. Wilmot's; he desired to be admitted an evidence; he impeached three men; when they were carried to Bridewell to him, he did not know either of them. He went to a ruinated place, and he took this cutlass and pistol from under some bricks; (producing a cutlass and pistol.) The pistol was discharged at Justice Wilmot's door. The place where he took them from is between Field Lane and Plough Court, where some old houses are pulling down; he said the pistol was his own, the cutlass his companion's.</p>

             pawned these buckles at Mr. Masters's.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Gore. To the best of my knowledge about this day three weeks; it was the morning after the robbery was committed. Dempsey and I got them in the Back Road between Islington and Hollaway.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Paradise Row?</p>
               <p>Gore. I believe the lower end of that road is Paradise Row.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you take them from?</p>
               <p>Gore. This man seems like the person, I can't be certain as to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it?</p>
               <p>Gore. About a quarter after ten.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you take?</p>
               <p>Gore. Eighteen-pence in silver, his shoe buckles, knee buckles, cane and pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Gore. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else concerned?</p>
               <p>Gore. No, only Dempsey and me; Dempsey sold the buckles for 3 s. At the time of the robbery, Dempsey desired this man to take off his clothes, he said they would fit him, I said no, it is a sin to strip a man.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Do you remember that?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. And what do you think of it now?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am certain the prisoner is the man that offered to take my coat off.</p>
               <p>Q. After what you have heard?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes, I am sure of it.</p>

            . I am a watchman; going up Plough Court, on the 9th of June; between nine and ten in the evening. I heard a noise; the prisoner said, here is Hurle the watchman; the prosecutor said the prisoner had robbed him of seven guineas; I was going on duty; the prisoner and prosecutor were together; I said, Sir, can you make your assertion good? he said, yes; then I took them both to the watch house, and before the Justice; next day she produced the money in the watch house; she put her hand in her pocket, and laid six guineas on the table; he insisted she had another guinea; then with some hesitation she pulled it out of her bosom; she said very little; I believe she was very much in liquor.</p>

Hurle is not a watchman; he said he would take us to a public house, and instead of that took me to the watchhouse; the man took away my cloak from me; they said I should have it again, and then the prosecutor said he would give me a guinea for my cloak.</p>

            . On the 1st of July I had been at Shaklewell; coming home about eleven o'clock at night, I met a fellow near Kingsland Turnpike, in the high road; Rogers is the person to the best of my knowledge; he came up to me, and asked me where I was going; I said for London; I told him where I lived; he said he was going too. He and I crossed the field to go towards <placeName id="t17720715-44-crimeloc224">Hoxton</placeName>

               <p>Q. What was you knocked down with?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. His fist.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were all round you, what happened then?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. They took my watch, my shoe buckles and neckcloth. After I was down one of them said, shall we cut his throat?</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. That I cannot be positive. I said don't use me ill, for I will be still, and not make any noise, and I lay sometime.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take the things from you while you was down?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. Yes, I was there about a quarter of an hour, and they went away and I went away too.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear particularly to either of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. I am of opinion that Rogers was the person that knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear he was in that company?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to either of the other three?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you robbed by children, such as the prisoners appear to be, or men?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. By children according to the appearance of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect whether they had their own hair or wigs?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. I cannot, it was dark and over cast.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your watch?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. A silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any particular mark on it?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. Yes,

            . I attend at Justice Wilmot's office; the prosecutor came and laid an information against these lads; I know them all very well; he brought James Fox with him to the office, who told who had the property that belonged to the prosecutor, and described the boys; we went after them directly; this was the 2d of July, the day after the robbery. About eleven o'clock as we came through Spittle-square, we saw Cole, and he made an attempt to run; Fox said he had the watch about him; he ran about 200 yards, and then dropt the watch; I put my stick to it, and said there is the watch; I saw it picked up; it was brought to me as I stopped him. I took him about fifteen yards from the watch. (The watch produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) When we brought Cole to the office, Fryer was there; he was taken before we got up, by one in court. Then Fryer offered to be an evidence, and said he would go and saw us where we might take Rogers. He went with me and another man, to Shoreditch and Tower Hill, and we could see nothing of him; we came back down by the Keys, and then to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150031"/> Bishopsgate-street, there we saw Rogers drinking at a pump; that was between twelve and one o'clock; we brought him to the office with the shoes and buckles on his feet. (The shoes and buckles produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) I took Assent yesterday week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found on him?</p>

I was at Justice Wilmot's Office when the information was given; I went with Chapman and took Rogers with the shoes and buckles on his feet; I asked him how he came by them; he seemed in a flurry, stood back, and asked, why I asked him; I said, why you robbed a man of them in a field last night or this morning; he did not say whether he did or not for some time, but asked if there was any evidence against him; I told him there was one Fryer; then he said he did take them from the man's feet in the field; we took him to the office and the evidence was there.

The prisoner was recommended to me as a sober woman, to nurse me in my lying-in; she was hired for a fortnight; after the fortnight, as I could not go out, she came to go of some errands for me; she came to light my fire; she borrowed the flat iron of me for her mother, and she pawned it for 6 d. after breakfast I asked her to wash me some things; she said she would, and I said I would give her some tea and three-pence; instead of washing them she took a book and went to reading.

About six in the evening I was going out with some work, and missed my shoes; I then turned about, and missed my ban box; I called out Betty; but there was no answer; in the ban box there was a child's laced cap, a white cloth apron, a woman's laced cap, and 14 d. in money. My shoes I left by the fire with the buckles in them; they were pinchbeck buckles; my hat and cloak were taken out of a hat box; I saw them when I left her in the kitchen, about four o'clock the same day. My gown was in the cradle, that was gone, and the few rags thrown out; the silk and cotton handkerchief I gave her to wask; she left all the things I gave her to wash, except the silk and cotton handkerchief; there were some in the tub and some on the floor. When I found my things were missing, I went to her mother's lodgings, and her mother said, O Polly, I did not think my child would have used you so. I enquired after, but could hear nothing of her, till last Thursday my brother came and told me he saw her in the Back Lane; near Rosemary Lane; I went to the place and saw her sitting at the door; I took no notice till I got a constable to take her, then I said Betty how could you serve me so; she said it was cruel, but she would make any recompense; she said the things were wore out and destroyed, but the hat she had lost. On Tuesday I went to Hicks's Hall, and afterwards called on her, and asked her if she had any of my things; she said she had nothing to bring forth, but wanted me to come to some terms, and gave this raper to my mother; I can't read it ( producing it.)</p>

On Friday the 26th of June, between three and four in the afternoon, I came out of a parlour next the street, to go into the kitchen to rinse my hands; the door was not shut: on turning my head about I saw the street door wide open; I ran into the street, frightened; I saw a man slip off the pavement; I cried out, I had been robbed! a neighbour said, if I had, that was the man; I pursued him, and cried, stop thief! on going about twenty or thirty yards from the door, he dropped the things mentioned in the indictment from under his arm, in the kennel, wrapped up in a green gown; I was within a yard of it when he dropped it; the lad is in court that took up the bundle. The prisoner was stopped about five yards from where he dropped the bundle.</p>

A person having a suspicion he was familiar with his wife, came and stood opposite the door, to watch where he went in the evening, and saw him take a large ham under his coat, which he carried to Falcon Court, Fleet Street; he came to me that evening after he had discovered it; I was gone to bed; he came again in the morning, and acquainted me with it. I went to my Lord Mayor to get a warrant to search his lodgings; and there found the ham cut almost to pieces, which by the mark appeared to be ours; the woman of the house being alarmed, went down stairs and brought up the ham, and acknowledged it was brought there the night before. The woman of the house is Mrs. Mitchel.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live with you?</p>
               <p>Fox. About a month.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to give him?</p>
               <p>Fox. 30 l. that year, 40 l. the next, and 50 l. the next. It was his uncle's character that induced me to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the bit of a ham in his lodgings?</p>
               <p>Fox. Yes; he confessed before my Lord Mayor the taking the two hams; the whole one was produced by the woman that kept the lodging house; that had our mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not at the same time tell you he meant to charge himself as debtor for the hams?</p>
               <p>Fox. First he denied he had any, but when he found I was in possession of the ham, he confessed he took them, and begged for mercy.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Fox in Fleet-Street. On the 20th of June I went with the beadle of White Friars, to examine the lodgings, and Bishop found a ham by the bedside, and the woman hearing the noise above, brought the other ham up, and said, Spouers sold it her the night before for 8 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property was the ham?</p>
               <p>Ovens. I believe my master's; it had his mark, and I believe it is by the tie; it is marked with an iron.</p>
               <p>- Bishop. I had a search warrant brought me the 20th of June; I went into the woman's room, and found a ham cut to pieces, and the woman of the house brought up the other ham, and said she was to buy it.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you swear to?</p>
               <p>Dixon. To tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say your catechism?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What will be the consequence if you don't tell the truth?</p>
               <p>Dixon. I shall go to Hell.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a mistress.</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes. My master had not a bed for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150037"/> me, so I lay at the foot of his bed; my mistress has a nurse child, and a child of her own that lay in the same bed. He beat his wife and turned her out of doors last Wednesday was week at night; she took the nurse child with her, and left her own child at home; we got our suppers, and then he swore if I did not come to bed he would murder me, so I went as usual to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Dixon. About ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie at the bottom of the bed?</p>
               <p>Dixon. There were two chairs at the foot of the bed, and the cradle bed upon them; he was in bed before me: I went to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. When he told you to go to bed or he would murder you, did he mean to go to bed as usual?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes; whilst I was asleep he came to the foot of the bed to me; I waked and found him upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes; I don't know how to pronounce it; his private parts were in mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hurt you?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes, a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been hurt so before?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know they were his private parts?</p>
               <p>Dixon. By what I had heard people say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it hard or soft what you felt?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Hard; I was afraid to make any noise, because he used to use his wife so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure his private parts were in yours?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were they in?</p>
               <p>Dixon. But a little way I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing besides something hard?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lie still?</p>
               <p>Dixon. When I stirred he got off, and pretended he was asleep; I got up to give the little child some drink, and he went up to the head of the bed, and said, he had only been down in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perceive any thing after he got off you?</p>
               <p>Dixon. I was sore two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing left behind when he got off?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Not that I know of; I went to bed again, but I could not go to sleep; when I lay still he was coming again, but finding me awake he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come again?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body lodge in the house with you?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes. I told my mistress next day.</p>
               <p>Q. You can't say how far he was in your body, whether an inch, or two inches, or more?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No, I can't.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark on your shift?</p>
               <p>Dixon. I did not look; Mrs. Atkins said there was some blood on it, I did not see it; the next day my mistress begged me to go and lie with him, for the sake of the child, for she said I could hang him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any attempt that night?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mistress lie there the second night?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you told your mistress?</p>
               <p>Dixon. I don't know, I believe he did, because my mistress told several people she could hang him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your father of it?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No; I was afraid he would lick me.</p>

               <p>Q. She said nothing of this affair then?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No: but told me, her master had given her warning to come away on Saturday, and I told her to come away on Friday. She went to her mistress, and she persuaded her to go home again, because she was afraid of the child; that was the Thursday night.</p>

               <p>It is true I am a poor man, and could not raise the price of a second bed. I took in a nurse child; my wife could not do without a girl; Mr. Dixon offered me his daughter. I wanted to take some money of the father of the nurse child, in Cornhill; my wife was with this girl at Hackney; I desired her to come to town to get this money; she came under pretence of getting it; she said he was not at home, whereas there was but 3 s. due on the balance; I went the next day, and when I found it out I was very angry with her. After she was gone, we went to supper and to bed in the usual way; it being hot I might throw my legs down to the foot of the bed, that is all I know; she went to her father and never told me of it.</p>

             to buy a watch; he said he could not; we asked him if he could help us to one that could; we went a little further and met the prisoner; he brought us into a public house; we shewed him the watch; he said he would give no more than five guineas for the gold, and one guinea for the metal one which I had, six guineas in all, he put them in his pocket, and said go home with me, I will pay you the money, and bid the former witness wait till we came back, and he gave him 6 d. we went to Lyons's, in Sweet Apple Court, he then locked at the watches, and said he would give but six guineas; he took out a 20 l. note, as told us, and gave it to his wife to get it changed; Dempsey watched her, and she went into a Jews place, and got it changed, and came back, and then we asked him to drink, and sent out for half a pint of rum.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. What time of day did you come to my house?</p>
               <p>Gore. After seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What money was it you received?</p>
               <p>Gore. Six guineas all but the half pint of rum; there was five guineas and a half in gold, and the change of the half guinea.</p>
               <p>- Heley. After Gore had surrendered himself to me, he told me, he had sold two watches on the 9th of June, to a Jew, in Sweet Apple Court, Bishopsgate Street; I asked him if he knew the name; he said, yes, it was one Lyons; accordingly Mr. Bond, I and Mr. Taylor, went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150042"/> next morning, between three and four o'clock, to the house of Lyon; the evidence Gore knocked at the door; I stood about ten yards from the door; the window was opened by Lyon, and he said, I am coming; accordingly the door was opened, and Mr. Bond and I jumped in, and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bond gave the evidence the watch in his hand, and rushed in, and cried, take this! take this! it is no watch to be bought. What Gore says is false; It is a matter made up by Sir John Fielding's men; they instructed Gore to tell this story; he never knew any thing of me. I don't live in Sweet Apple Court, but in St. Dunstan's Alley.</p>
