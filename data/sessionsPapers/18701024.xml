                  </hi>. I live at 27, Tanley Hill, Wandsworth—in June last I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> with reference to a business at Eagle Wharf, Wandsworth, in consequence of which I saw the prisoner at Eagle Wharf, on 21st June—he referred me to the books, as showing that he was doing a very good business there—Mr. Burt was present at the time, on my behalf—we met again on the following day—he showed us the plant and the stock—he said half of the wharf was leasehold sod half of it he represented as freehold—we called for the title deeds—he said he had none, that he had taken possession of it about four years ago, and that it had been held so previously by different parties, who had never paid any rent for it, and that no rent had been paid for it as long as the oldest man in Wandaworth could recollect, there had been no owner for it—he said the adjoining premises were held in a similar way—they were held by other persons—he said they paid no rent for theirs, and that he took possession of it in the same way—he said he had no liabilities what<lb/>ever, and he distinctly stated that Mr. Crossley, his late partner, had been settled with—this is the inventory which the prisoner gave me, made out and signed by him—(<hi rend="italic">This was an inventory of the stock, plant of property connected with the coal business at this wharf, amounting to</hi> 1360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—That was written out by the prisoner—I did not see him write it; it is signed by him—I know his signature—this is the deed of partnership which I entered into subsequently—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—I paid the prisoner 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before that was made out—after the inventory was signed, on the completion of the deed, I paid a further sum of 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 16th July, making 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., according to agree<lb/>ment—the prisoner said the waggon was at Smith's, the carriage builder;</p>

               <p>it was having the name painted on, and he would pay waggon hire while it was being done; it was such a small job, that Smith's, who were doing a large business, could not pay attention to such a small job as that—I made inquiries, and spoke to the prisoner; he promised to take me where the van was—he said there was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due on the van, and it would not he delivered till that was paid—I have never found any van—the 170 ton of coals turned out to be only about thirty tons—the money in the bank was 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—if I had known all these things, and also that the land was not freehold, I would not have paid the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you in the coal business before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I had not been in any business before—after hearing from Mr. Bennett, I thought I would go into the coal business—I was favourably impressed by what I saw, and decided to go into it—on the first occasion I saw the prisoner he referred me to the books; he showed us the old boob—Mr. Burt looked into the matter for me as a friend—we both of us looked it the books—Mr. Burt went over them previously, before I went there—Mr. Burt saw him before I did—when I first saw him Mr. Burt was with me—we had a look at the books again, the day-book principally—I saw the amount sold—we saw all the stock and plant that was there, and were satis<lb/>fied with it, together with Mr. Bennett's statement—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—this describes how the land lies—he said the wharf was leasehold—I believe it is let at a very low rent, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other piece he said was freehold—it was called freehold in a letter from Mr. Bennett's agent—I believe he made use of the word freehold—he said it was his own—he led me to understand it was freehold—I can't be certain that he did or did not say so—it is described in the deed as "land in possession"—when I asked him for the title-deeds he said he had none, nobody had any, nobody had any right to it, only as possessors—that was the only title he pretended to show that he had—he said the next wharf was held in the same way, that nobody could make out a title, and nobody held possession against any other person—I did not find out that that was the case with regard to this or any other piece of land—I found that he was paying rent for it—I found that the next piece of land was owned, and had been paid for—when he said he had no liabi<lb/>lities he was speaking of the partnership, not his own private affairs—I was not asking him about his own private affairs at all—he told me he had paid Mr. Crossley out—he did not tell me how—I knew that he and Mr. Croaley had been in partnership—I paid the 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Fry—I was quite aware of that—Mr. Fry had negotiated with Mr. Bennett previously—Mr. Bennett told me that Mr. Fry had joined him, that he wanted a working partner, he found that Mr. Fry and he would not suit one another as partners, that Mr. Fry would not pay that attention to the business he should require, and he would sooner give him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to withdraw than keep him as a partner, and he paid him the 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get rid of him—that was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addition to what Mr. Fry had paid to get in—I have my banker's book here—the 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not paid into the bank—it was paid on 16th July—I paid it to Mr. Bennett—he paid 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the bank on 18th July, on the partnership account; that was two days after I had paid him the 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—what was paid in afterwards was paid in by myself, out of the proceeds—we drew cheques in the joint names—it was necessary to have both signatures—I had 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the bank for my private account, by cheque, which he and I signed—I don't know when this inventory was prepared, it was handed to me when the deed was signed, a copy of that portion where the signature is</p>

               <p>under—a copy of the portion on the other side was shown to me before—I have not got it, I think my solicitor has, it was sent me in a letter by Mr. Bennett's agent, Mr. Sharp—it was after I had the inventory that I went over the wharf, and looked over the things mentioned in it—I found them all correct, except the waggon and the coals—170 tons is the quantity of coals mentioned in the inventory—it was prepared at the time Mr. Bennett was negotiating with me—it was given me as an inventory of what there was there at that time—I looked at the coals and said the quantity seemed small, and Mr. Bennett said, in answer, as the stock of coals decreased, the amount of outstanding accounts increased, and the amount at the bank would increase—I am not a judge as regards quantity—I could not tell how many tons there were there—I now there was not thirty tons, by the balance that has been made up since—we have since purchased so many tons, and sold so many, and the balance of the stock shows what quantity there was on the wharf at that time—since 4th July I have attended there every day—I did not solicit orders, Mr. Bennett did that—I attended to the business at the wharf—I was there July and August—I got very dissatisfied with the business—there were very few customers and very great complaints—my books are all here—Mr. Bennett reminded me that this was the very worst time of year for selling coals—I told him the business was not so flourishing as I expected, instead of selling 200 tons a week we were selling about twenty—one horse was sold, the other was let on hire—we got 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the one we sold—the money has not been paid by the buyer, a balance is owing—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid—Mr. Bennett let the other horse on hire previous to my coming there—I have not found any things on the wharf that are not mentioned in the inventory—there were some bricks there, not mentioned in it—they were then building the wall up, and putting up a pair of gates, on the piece of land of which he said he had possession—a portion of the wall has been finished, not completed altogether—the gates are up—he gave me a list of the outstanding accounts when I came up on 4th July—it was a separate list—I think I have a copy of it—I found a great many of them had been paid to him—I found that out from the parties themselves—I have not found that any' debts due to the firm were by mistake put into that account—this is the list—9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is represented as the amount—there are not half of those debts due—I have not heard of a Mr. Hayes who is not entered there—the Metropolitan Bank have paid nothing—Major de Rubini's name is down, but I can't hear anything of him—I was always there, and know every penny that has been paid in to our account—I got dissatisfied, and consulted Mr. Lewis, and then had the prisoner arrested on a warrant—he was taken that night, locked up all night, brought before the Lord Mayor, and has been in prison ever since—I have not been carrying on the business since—it was discontinued there and then—there was no coal to be sold—some of the accounts that were owing have been paid in; that is all that has been done—Mr. Bennett was to produce capital, 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to pay for stock, and he did not do it—there are no coals at the wharf now, nothing is done there—the stock was all disposed of previously—the plant is lying there now—the one horse is in a field—the barges and other things mentioned in the inventory are there—Mrs. Palmer has still got the piece of land; she has not taken possession of it—I have got the use of it—nobody attempts to disturb me—Mrs. Palmer applied for her rent—I referred her to Mr. Bennett—I have never been sued for the rent—Mr. Bennett is liable for it—there</p>

               <p>was some little coal in the barges on 24th June—the coal altogether in the barges and the stock that was there then was about thirty tons—I can't tell you what was in the barges and what on the wharf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Phillips &amp; Hill, iron merchants, Birmingham—as a friend of Mr. Phillips I saw the prisoner about this matter, before the partnership was commenced, on or about 21st June—I first saw Mr. Sharp, and after one or two interviews, we got to the prisoner—I made various inquiries, and asked to see the books—I was shown them—I looked round the place generally, and saw the principal items in the inventory, and was, on the whole, satisfied with the representa<lb/>tions that had been made—it looked like a <hi rend="italic">bonâ fide</hi> business—the first point upon which I had occasion to question Mr. Bennett was as to the ad<lb/>joining piece of land, which was represented as a very valuable asset—I asked whether it was leasehold or freehold, and to see the title-deeds—he said he had none—he explained that he held it under a possessory-right, and that he had held it so four years; it was no man's land, he held it under possession, and had not been disturbed for four years, and he also instanced the adjoining wharf, in the occupation of Mr. Ralph, a boat-builder—he said that was held in the same way—he further pointed to houses nearly opposite, which he said were so held, and the tenants had not paid any rent, and he felt so secure in his title, that he had refused an offer of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that piece of land; he further said that Mr. Ralph, his next door neighbour, also felt so secure in his holding, that he had directed expensive buildings upon it for the purposes of his trade—he also mentioned that he had offered the tenants of the premises nearly opposite small sums to go out, in order that he might enter into possession—those were the points of conversation, all tending to show that it was his absolute property, by possession—he was asked on another occasion, when Mr. Phillips was there, whether he had paid any rent, and he said he had never paid anything for it, neither had anyone else, that was the memory of the oldest inhabitant of Wandsworth, they never had any purchaser, they had lain for some years as a mere field, there was a sort of fence between his land and the next, and he had simply removed it—he said he had no liabilities—I presumed that to apply to himself, as he had no partner at the time, unless Mr. Fry was held a partner—it was mentioned previously that Mr. Crossley had been out—I wished to get at Mr. Crossley; but I was informed he had left Lon<lb/>don or gone into Some business; at all events he could not be found—</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Brompton—I am an accountant, and have an office in the Strand—I formerly carried on business as a coal merchant with my brother, at this wharf; that was about three years ago—we did a very good business there—there are two strips of land running up from the river—one is a wharf—I had the piece of land, at that time, from a person named Shaw, and he had no power to grant a lease—I did not pay him any rent for it—Shaw was in possession of it, and he was our manager—I did not pay any rent because he would not grant me a lease—I never knew any rent paid for it—I have known the prisoner eight or nine years—I never knew anything against his character—I have always found him perfectly straightforward.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Crpss-examined. Q.</hi> You occupied this wharf as a coal merchant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Eagle Wharf—I was told there was no title to any of the property about there—the piece we had was adjoining Ralph's—Ralph was not there at that time; Hawkins was there then—I understood that that was called Eagle Wharf—the piece we occupied is the piece which appears on this paper, white—a person named Hawkins had the next piece—I think it was twenty-two years ago—Shaw was in possession then—I don't know where he is now—I should think it was twenty-five years ago when I first went there—we remained there three years, and then removed to the wharf Basin—we left the wharf because we could not get any lease for it—I gave the coal business up ultimately, and became an accountant—Shaw was our manager while we were at the wharf—he lived in the house feeing the wharf.</p>

                  </hi>. I know this piece of land perfectly well—I was in possession of it sixteen years ago, and had it about two years—I used to put sand on it and no one interfered with me, and after that I took pos<lb/>session of it—I never paid any rent—I left the wharf because the City put a fine on us for sand, and I could not afford to pay it—the next piece of land to me was also used as a wharf at the time I had my sand there—a man named Phipps had that wharf—he did a large business—I used to do work for him.</p>

I am a boat-builder—I know this plot of ground which Mrs. Palmer claims—I occupied it about a year and a half ago, or two years—I had it for about five or six years—I put timber on it—I never paid any rent for it to anybody—no one ever asked me—Mrs. Palmer never claimed any—I went to Mr. Neale, who lived in the house facing the ground, and asked him if he would allow me to put my timber on that wharf, as it was doing nothing at the time, and he said I could put what I liked on it—I left it because some one sent me a notice to leave, and I went to my solicitor, and he said "Do you want the wharf particularly,"and I said "No" and he said, "Well you had better give it up"—I took Possession of it more than anything to keep the boys from coming alongside my shop, to prevent them from breaking the windows and so forth—I gave it up to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the <hi rend="italic">E</hi> division—on or about the 28th July last, I and Carter, another detective, received information of a robbery from Messrs. Leet &amp; Edwards, some bran fittings had been lost—in consequence of information I apprehended two men, named Eley and Floyd, who had formerly been in Leet &amp; Edwards' empty, and they were charged with breaking and entering the warehouse, and stealing the property—from information I went on the 29th, to the premises of the defendant Gale, at 69, Cow Gross, Smithfield, he carries on the business of a dealer in second-hand machinery, and old brass and metal—we saw Gale and had a conversation with him, he afterwards produced the stolen property—we took him into custody, and were bound over as wit<lb/>nesses to appear against him at the Middlesex Sessions—Floyd and Eley were also committed for trial—I gave evidence before the Magistrate of the finding the articles and of the conversation—the Middlesex Sessions commenced on Monday, 15th August—it is the custom there to fix a special day for the trial of bail prisoners—we went there on the Monday, to give evidence before the Grand Jury—about 1 o'clock, Carter and I went into the Fox and Horns public house to have lunch, it is a house close to the Sessions House, kept by Mr. Lambert—after we had finished lunch, Miss Lambert made a' communication to me, and pointed oat the prisoner Stewart, who was in the opposite bar to us—I looked to<lb/>wards him, he held up his finger, and I went to him with Carter—he said "Holloa, how are you, what will you have"—I said "I have not the pleasure of knowing you, sir"—he said "Oh, never mind, have a drop of brandy, and I will tell you who I am; you know me"—we each had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy—he said "You have Gale in custody, have you not"—I said "Yes"—he said "He is a particular friend of mine, I have known him for a long time; I am told that all the evidence rests upon you two (that was Carter and me, who were standing together) any amount of money in reason you can have, if you will but get him off"—I said "We don't want any money"—we had just then drank up the brandy and were about to go out, and he said "Look here, here is my card,"he gave me his card and said "Go home, think it over, and meet me to<lb/>morrow evening, at 7 o'clock, at the Clock House, Leather Lane"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the card he gave me, "F. Stewart, iron-merchant, 48, Southampton Street, St. John Street, Clerkenwell. Smith's shops cleared on the shortest notice"—I said "Well, I won't promise you that we will meet you there, he said "I will wait from 7 till half-past, to see if you come"—we then went</p>

               <p>back to the Sessions, and when we returned to the Station, about 4 o'clock, we saw Inspector Shenton, and communicated to him what had taken place, and consulted him—we afterwards saw Superintendent Thomson in the evening—we received certain directions from him, in consequence of which we went on Tuesday evening, to the Clock House, Leather as appointed—the bill was found by the Grand Jury that day—Sergeant Kerley accompanied us to the Clock House, he was standing a little distance off—Stewart came to the Clock House just about the same time we did; I think we went into the public-house first, he came in just afterwards—he said "Good evening, my friend Gale is not a hundred yards off, would you like to see him"—I said "Well, I have no objection"—he said "We won't stop here, go to the Yorkshire Grey public-house (that is at the corner of King's Road and Gray's Inn Road) end I will meet you there in half-an-hour"—about 9.30 that same evening we went there; we went into the coffee-room, and the two prisoners came in to<lb/>gether directly—Stewart said "Good evening, here is my friend Gale, I want you to do what you can for him, I know you can get him off if you like"—I said "I can't say anything about that"—Gale said it was a very bad job, he had got a large family, he hoped we would do what we could—Stewart said "To show you I am genuine, I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now, and I will give you 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to<lb/>morrow, and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after the case is settled; I wont give it you in here, come outside, there is somebody sitting over the other side, I don't know who they are"—Gale was sitting close to us at this time, he could hear what was said—we all four went out into the Gray's Inn Road—there is a dead wall there—Stewart then handed a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—Gale was standing just facing him—we were all four standing together, looking at each other—Stewart said "If you come down to my place to-morrow I will bund you—, no, I will not do that; if you don't come to my place to-morrow I will come down to the Sessions House, about 12 or 1 o'clock, and I will give you the other 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then, and the other 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after the case is settled, malting altogether 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said I could not promise whether I would go to his house—I said "I don't think we shall come there"—he said "Then I will come to the Sessions"—I said "You shall see someone there"—we afterwards went to the Red Lion, and had some lemonade, and parted—as soon as I came out of the public-house, Sergeant Kerley had been standing outside, watching us, and I handed the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to him—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>—I wrote my name on it, and Kerley and Carter also wrote theirs—we reported what had occurred to Superintendent Thomson, and received further instructions—next day, Wednesday, we were at the Sessions House till 2 o'clock, and saw no one—in going home we had to cross Farringdon Street; a man came up and made a communication to us, in consequence of which we went to the Farringdon Street Railway Station, at 7 o'clock that evening, and saw Gale there—he said "I am very sorry we could not meet you this morning, being very busy; you must not stop here, I will meet you up at the Yorkshire Grey in half-an-hour or so"—we saw Sergeant Kerley, and we went to the Yorkshire Grey, and saw Gale there—said he was very sorry, he had been very busy "and another thing,"he said "I am rather short of cash; I lent some money out a short time ago, but I have two bills, one for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., twelve months after date; you can have that if you like"—he shewed it to me, and I fancy there was a little more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, I think—I told him I would not take that—lie then</p>

               <p>said "Meet me to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock here, or a little after, I will see Stewart, I know he has been very busy, he is clearing some iron away from the House of Correction"—he said he would bring the remainder of the money, that was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Kerley was still outside—on our return to the station we reported what had occurred to the superintendent—about 9.30 next morning, Thursday, by instructions, we met Gale at the Yorkshire Grey—he said "My friend Stewart is not coming up yet, can you wait half-an-hour?"—I said "We hare got some business to attend to"—he said "I won't be long; you might come part of the way, come down as far as Hatton Garden, to the Globe public-house"—we waited outside the Globe till he came—he said "Come inside"—we went inside, and he there gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and five sovereigns—he said "I have not seen Stewart; but if you will meet me to-night, at 8.30, I shall see him in the meantime, and will see you to-night at the Yorkshire Grey—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I handed it to Kerley, with the five sovereigns, as soon as we came out<lb/>side the public-house—we again made a communication to the superintend<lb/>dent, and a warrant was applied for, before Sir Thomas Henry, to arrest the prisoners—that same night I and Carter went to the Yorkshire Grey, and saw Gale—he said Stewart was not come yet, he knew he had been very busy, he had hardly had time to get home and clean himself, "we will walk down that way, and I will go down to his house"—we went to Northampton Street, and Gale went to a house which he said was Stewart's—we remained at the top of the street; he came back and said "He is not in, he will be in in a few minutes"—whilst he was speaking Sergeant Kerley came up and took him into custody—he was taken to the station—Stewart was after wards brought there—he was going to say something—the superintendent said "Wait a moment, allow me to say that anything you say will be given in evidence against you"—Stewart then said he should not have done it if it had not been for Gale persuading him to do so, and Gale said "Shut up, don't say nothing here"—at the Police Court I gave evidence against the prisoner—Mr. Lewis, senior, defended Stewart—Stewart was about to say something, and Mr. Lewis told him to be quiet—he said "No, I will not; all the officer has stated is quite correct, and I don't want to tell any falsehood"—Mr. Lewis kept persuading him to hold his noise, and not to say any more, and Sir Thomas Henry said "As your solicitor advises you not to say anything, we will not take it down"—at the trial of Gale, Eley and Floyd, Gale was acquitted—I gave evidence against him at the trial as to what I knew of it.</p>

               <p>shall have nothing to do with it, we don't want any money"—I met him again, from instructions I received from my superior officer—Superinten<lb/>dent Thomson ordered us to go and see him—he did not tell us to lead him on—we were instructed to take money if it was offered—we did not hold oat any prospect that we would alter our evidence—we took refresh<lb/>ments with them—they paid for it on two or three occasions, and I paid for it sometimes—twice, I think, I paid for what they had—that was not to induce them to believe I would do anything wrong—I never told them that I would alter or suppress my evidence—I don't know that we said anything to induce them to believe so; they might infer it from what we said, very likely; still we did not say anything—I had four interviews with them altogether, I believe—I did not tell them that I had reported the matter to Superintendent Thomson.</p>

On Tuesday evening, 16th August, in consequence of instructions from Superintendent Thomson I went to the Clock House Tavern, Leather Lane, and saw Chamberlain, Carter, and Stewart, there—I was not near enough to hear the conversation—I was in plain clothes—I saw them in conversation, and afterwards saw them separate—the two officers went to the Yorkshire Grey, I followed and saw them in conversation with Gale and Stewart in the parlour—they all four went out together into the Gray's Inn Road—I then saw Stewart take a pocket-book from his pocket, take a piece of paper from it and hand it to Chamberlain; I was not near enough to see what it was; after some little conversation they separated, and Chamberlain then gave me the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that has been produced, I wrote my name on it—next day I went to the Sessions House—about 7 in the evening I went to the Farringdon Street Station and saw Gale there—he spoke to the two officers, and they separated—I afterwards went to the Yorkshire Grey and there saw Gale and the two officers in conversation—next morning I went to the Globe in Hatton Garden, and saw the two officers and Gale go into the public-home together, I did not see what took place, the officers afterwards gave me this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and five sovereigns—I went to the Yorkshire Grey on the Thurs<lb/>day when the warrant had been obtained, and saw Gale and the officers then—Gale went to Northampton Street, Islington, he knocked at a door and returned a few minutes afterwards—I went up to him and told him I was a detective officer from Bow Street, and I held a warrant for his apprehend<lb/>sion under Sir Thomas Henry, and I said "I will read it to you"—he said "No, don't do that"—I said "It is for conspiracy and bribery, bribing two officers"—he said "It is quite right" and I think he said "I am very sorry, but I should not have done it if it had not been for my friends; it was the wish of my friends that it should be done, I had rather the case stood on its own merits, and I think I should have got off"—I took him to the station, and returned to Northampton Street about 11 o'clock, I saw Stewart there in the street—I asked him if his name was Stewart—he said "Yet, Thomas Stewart"—I told him I was a detective officer and had a warrant for his apprehension, under Sir Thomas Henry, for conspiracy and bribing two officers—he said "I never done anything of the kind"—I took him to the station and he was charged; the charge was read over to him by Superintendent Thomson, and he said "What I have done was at the wish of Gale that it should be done—Gale said "Its no good saying anything now, it is done."</p>

I am a foreign railway contractor, and carry on business at 85, Gracechurch Street—I have known the prisoner about twelve months—it may be fifteen or eighteen—I knew him first in Paris as a commission agent—he had an office at 54, Rue Taitbout—he was not carrying on business as a banker, that I am aware of—I should think not—I met him casually at a refreshment place in Lombard Street, in August last—I remember having a conversation with Mr. Cresswell about him—I saw the prisoner both before and after that conversation—when I saw him the first time he said he was doing very well, and had an office at 29, Rue Taitbout, and he gave me a card with his address, and said he was doing a large business; he said he had arranged with the French government, and was contracting for them—I saw Mr. Cresswell three or four days after that, and then I saw Arthur again—he said that I had treated him very badly, and that I had ruined him from what I had said to Cresswell—he said I had stopped a transaction by which he would have made a considerable sum of money—he said it was a transaction for the purchase of some rifles, and that I had stopped the purchase—I told him that I had been asked a question, and had answered it—I met him again, I think, at Charing Cross—I said it was a very nasty business, and that I understood that Lousada had been arrested—he said he believed it was so—I said "Well, it is a very nasty business, they have subpoenaed me in the matter, and I would have nothing to do with it"—he went into a long statement about Cress<lb/>well having sold rifles; but I did not understand it, and could not repeat it—I saw him again at the Cannon Street Station; but nothing of importance</p>

               <p>passed—I said "They tell me that the bills were sent to Paris to be accepted"—he said "Nothing of the kind, I went over to Paris and accepted them there"—he said "You told Cresswell that I had ten francs from you and I had not paid it"—that was true—when I saw Cresswell he made certain inquiries of me, and I answered him—some bills were shown to me by Cresswell, signed M. Arthur &amp; Co."—the conversation I had with the prisoner afterwards had reference to my interview with Cresswell.</p>

On 13th September, I took the Count De Lousada into custody, on a warrant, at 17, St. Swithin's Lane, it the office of Mr. Dumas, on the second floor—I afterwards took the prisoner into custody at the Cannon Street Hotel, about 8.30 in the evening—he was pointed out to me—I went up to him, and said "Mr. Thomas Arthur, I believe"—he said "That is my name, sir"—I said "I have seen a gentleman, a friend of yours, this afternoon, the Count de Louaada"—I had one of the Count's cards in my pocket, and as I did not perhaps speak the name quite familiarly, I said "This gentleman"—he took the card and said "Yes, I know the Count very well"—I said "You have lately had some business transactions with him respecting some fire-arms"—he said "I have, pray who are you, and what is your business"—I said "I am a police officer; I hold a warrant for your arrest, consider yourself in custody, charged on a warrant for conspiring and receiving different sums of money of Mr. Forrest, and one amount, I understand, is a cheque for 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the prisoner then said "You have made a very great mistake, my name is not Thomas Arthur at all; Thomas Arthur is now in Paris; if you go then you will find him"—I said "What nonsense, you have acknowledged your<lb/>self to be Thomas Arthur; you say you know the Count, and have had business transactions with him respecting fire-arms very recently; you will have to accompany me to the police-station"—he then said "The Count wrote to me when I was in Paris respecting a contract for some fire-arms, but at that time I did not know but what it was a business transaction—respecting the 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, he said "I never had one farthing of the 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque; the cheque was stopped, it was never cashed"—he was searched at the station, and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash was found upon him, a watch and chain, I think not gold, a blank cheque on the Bank of England, four or five French bills, and a quantity of papers and memorandums in a pocket-book, which were given up to the prisoner when he was discharged, at the Mansion House—I had not time to read them.</p>

               <p>arrow-root, and things of that description were served out to Brindley daily—on Friday, 30th September, Mary Ann Gorman was about to leave the Asylum—I do not know whether she was not in health—her luggage was sent down to the store-room, with a pass from the matron—I had to give another past for the luggage to go to the porter—I did so, and it was taken to the porter about 2 o'clock, on the Sunday afternoon—on the Saturday morning in consequence of information, that luggage was fetched back to the Store Yard—I sent for Mary Ann Gorman, and it was opened in a police sergeants presence—I took from the hamper, packages of sago, rice, sugar, arrow root, and split peas, wrapped in pieces of linen and calico, such as the patients' clothing is made of—there was no key to the box, the sergeant uncorded it, and we found four cotton print dresses, a pair of stays, three pocket handkerchiefs, petticoats, towels, a small looking-glass, and two parcels, one of which was a brown paper bag, such as used in the Asylum, con<lb/>taining 5 or 6 lbs. of tea; the other was an apron tied up, with from twelve to sixteen yards of tape and filleting, which is material used in the Asylm—it contained about 5 lbs. of tea, and 2 lbs. of soap—before opening the parcels, I spoke to her and inquired of her what she said—I sent for Brindlej, who came, and I then said "Gorman says you gave her the parcel, Mrs. Brindley," referring to the brown paper parcel—she said "I did nothing of the kind, how dare you say so?"—Gorman said that she did, and Brindley said "I had possession of the parcel to take care of for you till you went home, if that is what you mean"—Brindley said that it was given to her to take care of by Eliza Ann Gorman, who was there at the time—I said "What of this parcel," the white paper one—she said ", My sister also gave me that"—Brindley said that she bought it in London, and gave it to her siter to take home to her mother—I keep the key of the principal store, and see the whole of the provisions weighed out, and they are <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> from the slides to the stores—the tea and soap are of precisely the same character as that used in the Asylum, and the articles of clothing are marked.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S/. I was called to the deceased on 22nd Decem<lb/>ber, and found her suffering from swelling of the neck—there was a very large blister on her chin, extending on to her neck—it was 3 in. long, and there were several smaller ones round it—she was very much depressed and ill, and said that there had been some foul play—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—her death arose from erysipelas on a bad constitution—I was led to suppose that mustard had been put on her neck which set up so much irritation that it tended to produce the erysipelas—if there were marks of violence on her throat they were obliterated by the blisters—I was of the same opinion when I gave evidence before the Coroner.</p>

I am a tailor, residing at 51, Alma Street, Hoxton—about 11 o'clock, on the night of the 10th August, I heard a noise in my bed room, on the ground floor—I went and caught hold of Willis there—we wrestled together in the passage—I called for help and he threw me down—I got up, and the door being open he pitched me out into the street—I again caught him by the tail of his coat, which he slipped off and ran away—I followed, but gave up the chase and returned to my house—I found articles of dress in the room where I had seized him first—a watch also, which I value at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I identified as my own—a jemmy dropped out of his coat—the back garden door was open that night, and I was sitting in the back kitchen having my supper—no chain was on it—if they had come in that way I must have heard them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Crosf-examined.

I am a manufacturer of mineral waten, Nassau Street, Portland Street—Antrim was in my service, and had been for thirty years—his duty was to take out goods, deliver them to customers, return at end of the day, and give an account of what he had sold—Chuter was also in my service—Antrim was principal man, having charge of the van, and Chuter always went with him—it was their duty to call on a customer named Mills—on the 4th of October, I sent them to Mr. Mills—they took with them in the morning twenty-four dozen of goods, including lemouade, soda water, seltzer and that sort of thing—it was Antrim's duty to deliver them to Mr. Mills, and he had no right to keep back any—I received a communication that same day from Mr. Mills, and had others on previous occasions—I called in Antrim, and said "I am sorry to accuse you of robbing Mr. Mills"—he said "Me, sir, no! I deny it altogether,"—I said "You know me well enough not to state such, unless I was certain of the fact; a trap has been laid for you, and you have been discovered"—I told him I had been to Mr. Mills and counted the goods—I told him the exact deficiency, which was one dozen of ginger beer, half-a-dozen lemonade, and half-a-dozen of seltzer water—he said "I have committed myself"—I said "I must see Mr. Mills on the subject"—Mr. Mills called the same evening and saw Antrim, and I left them together—I returned soon after, and Chuter was called in—Antrim some time after, said "If I am on my trial I must say nothing"—I said to Chuter, "What do you know of this disgraceful affair?"—he said it was true, and he what sorry—I said "Did you know of the deficiency at Mr. Mills', on the 4th October, he said "Yes"—I said to Antrim, in the presence of Chuter, "If you have robbed Mr. Mills of two dozen of goods out of twenty-four, how many goods would you take out of ninety-six dozen," and the reply was, "Two or three dozen"—ninety-six dozen is the largest quantity delivered at one time during the present season.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a box-maker, of 6, Camomile Street—on the 29th November I had a workshop in Green Dragon Yard, Half Moon Street, Bishopsgate—the prisoner had a workshop opposite my place at that time—I had in my care the hind part of a waggonette, the springs and axletree, worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. one wheel the party it belonged to had taken away—I missed these portions of the waggonette about the 29th September, I don't know the date exactly—the fore part of the waggonette was left behind—I spoke to the prisoner about the loss, being an intimate friend and in the line, and I employed him to take the fore part of the waggonette to prevent any further robbery, which he did—that was three days after I missed it—he said "It is a great shame; who has done it?" and he seemed to take an interest in trying to find it—two days after I went with him and the officer to the Cattle Market, to see if the things had been offered fer sale there—in consequence of information from the police, on the night of the 21st July, I went next morning to the prisoner's place in Talbot Court, Grace-church Street, where he had removed to, with the officer, Mr. Lye, and Mr. Sheppard, the owner of the waggonette; we there saw the things produced, they are the same I lost the previous November—the prisoner was not there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is this all you charge the prisoner with stealing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there are other things which he has taken away, a great crowbar which I have in my counting-house at the present time—I charge him with</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 921). On 21st July I went to 6, Talbot Court, Gracechurch Street, and searched a workshop there, occupied by the prisoner—I found these springs and axles, and the brass cape were given to me by Mr. Lye—I told the prisoner that I had found the springs at his place which had been taken from Mr. Honniball's premises, and asked if he wished to account for them—he said "Yes, I bought them of Charley Lye, of Half Moon Street"—he afterwards said "Well, sir, to tell you the truth, I bought them in Willow Walk"—I asked from whom—he said he did not know—he then said to me "For God's sake, sir, don't be too hard upon me"—on 20th September, two months afterwards, I apprehended the prisoner at Hollo way, coming out of the prison—ho then said he had bought them at the cattle market.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of the Great Eastern Railway Company's Police—I hate been seventeen years in the police altogether—I am better known on the main line than on the Blackwall line—Treadgold was one of the Company's servants, employed as a ticket collector at Fenchurch Street—it would be his duty to collect the tickets at the exit barrier of the Blackwall line—he was not entitled to pass any persons without a ticket or the production of a season ticket—about the middle of July last, my attention was called to matters that were going on upon the line, connected with these tickets, and I gave instructions to Melhuish, and subsequently to Carter and Richardson—I received communications from them daily when they were employed—I also went down the line myself; Saturday, 16th July, was the first day—I went to Stepney that day, and followed Parsonage from his house in York Street, Stepney, to the Stepney Station—he did not take a ticket—he did not go up to the booking office at all, not within two yards—he passed up the staircase on to the platform, on the up-side, got into the train and went to London, Melhuish with him—he had to pass a barrier to get up to the platform at Stepney—he passed that barrier without a ticket—Rutterford was the man employed there, he passed him and got into the train—at Feuchurch Street he alighted from the train, and passed out of the barrier where Treadgold was—there is a double barrier, with a man at each side: he passed on Treadgold's side, with his hand in his pocket, never giving up a ticket; there was a little motion with the head, nodding to Treadgold, and he passed on—I am certain that he did not produce any ticket, or even take his hands from his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187010240071"/>
               <p>pockets; I was within a yard-and-a-half of him, he was the last passenger that passed out; I watched him very narrowly, my attention had been called to him personally; having, passed through the barrier, he passed out of the station in the ordinary way—on Monday, 18th July, I again followed Parsonage from his house at Stepney, he passed through the Stepney Station—he took no ticket, and passed the barrier where Rutterford was, without one—when he got to the barrier at Fenchurch Street, Treadgold was th'ere; he passed on Treadgold's side—he did not give up any ticket—he never took his hands from his jacket pocket—he had a short jacket on—I am quite certain he did not produce any ticket on that occcasion; they nodded to each other in the same way as they did on the Saturday, and then he passed out—shortly after I saw Melhuish and Parson<lb/>age talking in the station yard, Melhuish had come up with Parsonage from Stepney—Melhuish took a ticket at Stepney, and gave it up to Treadgold—Melhuish and Parsonage remained in conversation in the station yard, I walked some little distance away as I did not want Parsonage to see me, and shortly after Treadgold came down the staircase from where he was collecting the tickets and joined them, that was two or three minutes after I had seen Parsonage pass the barrier—they then went into Austin's public-house, which is directly opposite the door-way where they came out—they were in there seven or eight minutes; they came out together, and had a little conversation—Parsonage and Melhuish walked away, and Treadgold went up the staircase—about three or four minutes afterwards Melhuish joined me in Fenchurch Street, and made a communication to me—those are the only two occasions upon which I have personally been through the barrier after Parsonage, when Treadgold has been there—I saw Melhuish every time he went up and down the line, and on each occasion, directly he had finished his journey, he made a communication to me, and handed tickets to me which he and I endorsed—this first-class ticket, dated 6th August, No. 6040, from Fenchurch Street to Shadwell, I got from Melhuish on that day—I went to the Fenchurch Street Station with him, and within a quarter-of-an-hour afterwards I met him at another point, and he gave me this ticket—this ticket would not carry to Blackwall, not further than Shadwell—I was present at the trial last Sessions—I heard the prisoner give evidence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187010240072"/>
               <p>others were at first charged with felony—I told all of them, on 17th August, that they would be charged; I told Treadgold and Rutterford so—they were not charged before the Lord Mayor, but proceedings were going on, opinions were taken—no proceedings were taken against them until after the trial of Parsonage; it was an understood thing that they would be prosecuted—the other five were taken into custody, and charged with feloniously stealing tickets—I did not know that these men had committed a felony; we only had one case against them, against the others there were many—I think it was the day after I took the Averys into custody that I told Treadgold he would be charged—that would be on the 16th—no one told me to take him, I did it upon my own responsibility—the Company acted against my advice; I can't be answerable for the directors—I did not take the prisoner into custody on 17th, because I had not received direction! from the Company—I had not received directions to take the other five—I don't want directions to take a man for felony; the case against them was very different—I knew that they were also charged at the Mansion House with conspiracy to defraud the Company—I knew that this man was guilty of that—I did not take him into custody then because I had not a warrant—I applied for one when I was instructed to do so—I don't know the date—I have the warrant in my pocket—it was since the last trial—I say that Treadgold violated his duty on 16th and 18th July, at the exit barrier of the Blackwall line, in passing Parsonage without a ticket—Parsonage was the only one passing at that time—he took the precaution to wait till all the passengers had gone off the platform—there are not a number of persons coming there to meet friends who go by train; they cannot get up on the departure side—this was on the departure side—I am quite positive that the prisoner passed Parsonage without a ticket—he did not take bis hands from his pockets.</p>

I am a civil engineer, but am oat of business now, and reside at Hornchurch, in Essex—I have for some time had business transac<lb/>tion with the prisoner, in some of which I made a profit, and in some a loss—I received this prospectus (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from himself, on the first occasion of entering his office, on 15th October, 1868; but for nearly two years, up to May last, his business was not in connection with this prospectus—I asked the prisoner in July if I could purchase 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Turkish 1869 Stock, upon the terms of this prospectus, which I had kept—(there was to be a double drawing on that stock, which was to come off in September, which I was not aware of, and the dividends were payable on 1st October) he said of course I could—I asked him what collateral security he wished for—he said, "1700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

That the borrower shall have the option of declining or accepting any new shares to which (if created) he would be entitled, in virtue of the stock and shares aforesaid; but the borrower must and hereby agrees to hold the lender free from all liability, risk, pay<lb/>ments, and expense which may attend or be consequent upon the accept<lb/>ance thereof.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before you went to the office of Taylor &amp; Co., had you speculated at all on the Stock Exchange? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I had invested as I accumulated a little money—from October 1868, to May, 1870, I had a good number of dealings with Taylor <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> Co., but those were investments also; I had no speculative business—I used not to pay and receive differences—he has paid differences to me—I have bought and sold stocks, and drawn a cheque for the difference, but not as a speculative transaction—I sell one stock and buy another, and if there has been a little difference I have paid or received it, but not time bargains—I have always advanced my own money to buy the stocks—I have sold bonds, and received the money from Taylor &amp; Co, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and some<lb/>times double that amount—they have always paid me the difference, and their cheque has always been honoured—from October to May, 1870, I had made money, thanks to myself, and no one else—Taylor <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> Co. simply fol<lb/>lowed my instructions to buy or sell—I made 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. during that time, more or less—when I purchased these Turkish Bonds the price was 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and between the 14th and 24th July, they had fallen to 49 1/2, which alarmed me to this extent that I thought it was time to average, to "hedge" my bets—a week or ten days before I wrote the letter asking for the numbers, these stocks hod recovered themselves, so that taking the two loans I believe I could have sold out, and paid Taylor &amp; Co. all their charges and had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to receive—I may have seen Mr. Taylor at the office a score of times—he was not present when the agreement was made—I have never done business with anyone but Mr. Tripp—I read this agreement over carefully before I entered into it—as to the fourth and fifth clauses Mr. Tripp pointed out to me that when the term was a fixed term, six or twelve months, it was usual to put a pen through those clauses, and I said "Put a pen through them."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you wish that the agreement should be for six months certain, and that neither borrower nor lender should have power to close it before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187010240080"/>
               <p>that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of course—I thought it was for six months certain, and the other one was for twelve months certain, always supposing that they really bought the stock—from October 15, 1868, up to the end of May, 1870, Taylor &amp; Co. had given me every satisfaction in the business they had done for me, in consequence of which I introduced my relations, and they have no reason to complain, that I am aware of—they had actual trans<lb/>actions with Taylor &amp; Co.—I did not introduce Mr. Dearden to them for the purpose of speculation—I looked upon him as a friend of mine; we look upon persons as friends until we find that we have made a mistake—he had dealings with Taylor &amp; Co., but you must not take my introduction to that firm in connection with what they did afterwards—I believe they lost by him, much to my regret, but I do not know how much—Mr. Dearden did not behave honourably, and I cut his connection in consequence—I know that up to the first settlement they lost about 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by him—I know nothing about any subsequent dealings—I never heard that they had lost thousands—I always received sold notes similar to these on all those transactions, but the words "or loan" were omitted, it was the same printed form—the bonds which were drawn would be paid off at <hi rend="italic">par</hi>, on 1st October—the announcement that there would be a drawing in September was made long before I bought in July—I had not consulted anyone when I wrote the letter of 6th September—I wrote the draft of it in the City, and intended to have posted it then, but I thought I would give them a chance of sending me the numbers by the next morning's post—I had not then con<lb/>sulted Lewis &amp; Lewis; I simply knew them by reputation—in the first agreement I buy 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Turkish Stocks, worth 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in order to do that I deposited with Mr. Tripp 1700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Turkish Stock, the greater part of which cost me 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 54 1/4 <hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say whether the value in the market was as low as 33, but the value of that 1700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock would be seventeen times the market price—out of that 1700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had beforehand deposited 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believed that Taylor &amp; Co. would advance me hard cash the difference between the two, in order to purchase the stock.</p>

We are sorry to say that in consequence of very heavy losses lately sustained, we have been obliged to ask indulgence from our larger creditors, and we have not a doubt that an honourable arrangement might have been carried out, but for the proceedings which Mr. Gandee has thought proper to adopt. Irrespective of the consequences to our creditors and to ourselves, which must ensue if bankruptcy cannot be avoided, for, in that case, we have no hesitation in saying that there will not be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound for the creditors, our solicitor informs us that Mr. Gandee has laid himself open to be brought up at any moment before the Old Bailey for wilful and corrupt perjury, that has been committed without any excuse, and for which he has subjected himself also to an action for damage, to an amount far beyond any claim he can have upon our estate. Had Mr. Gandee acted wisely, and left the matter to have been arranged between ourselves and his stock-broker, Mr. Lloyd, the grave consequences which will now ensue would have been avoided, and you and all our other creditors, we believe, would have been paid in full. As it is, Mr. Gandee has taken it out of our power to comply with your letter of the 5th inst., and has left us no alternative but to seek the protection of the Bankruptcy Court, or allow him to have a fraudulent preference over our other creditors. <hi rend="smallCaps">RICHARD TAYLOR</hi> &amp; Co.")</p>

I can give no reason why the money was paid out from Clement's Lane, and brought back again for the Haymarket business—I heard from the prisoner that there was on attachment at the suit of Gandee, on the same day that the attachment was made—I should not like to say whether that was in May—on July 22nd, 1870, we paid Gandee 525<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to settle it, that was cash; money in the safe—I do not know from Mr. Taylor whether the prisoner had anything to do with that—this is the private ledger showing a certain amount paid to the prisoner, it also shows that Mr. Taylor drew in 1870, up to August 27th, 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he has not received any commission since 1867; he is debited on October 15th, 1867, with half-commission, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;.—here is Mr. Taylor's capital account, balance carried down to his credit, August 7th, 1866, of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—from that period to 1870, there is no addition to it, no other entry—that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is placed to his credit, but it is in 1866, and I know nothing about it—this ia Mr. Taylor's drawing account, he drew from August 20th, 1866, to April 12th, 1867, 488<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and from August 7th to Novem<lb/>ber 14th, 1867, in the cash capital account, 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is put to his debit—he has taken it from the capital account and put it to the drawing account—here is from August 7th, 435<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and from April 15th to August 31st, 1867, 327<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; from September 2nd to September 30th, 174<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and from October 1st to 26th, 1867, 189<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in November he draws 126<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and in December, 144<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in January, 184<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; February, 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; March, 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; April, 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; May, 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; June, 113<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; July, 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; August, 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; August again, 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; September, 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; October, 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and from October, 1868, to November, 1869, 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is the whole from the commencement—the prisoner's account goes back for a similar period, to June 19th, 1866—it shows 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. every year—I only go from what the book says—these drawings represent actual cheques—Mr. Tripp sometimes drew cash; but I do not recollect giving Mr. Taylor cash—I have not seen Mr. Taylor since I told him that Mr. Tripp was taken in custody—I do not know where he is—in the general ledger I find, on 25th July, "Sold to Mr. Parry 5000 Turkish 1869, 2550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—anything we agreed to do we put in the book.</p>

Turkish Stock, say at 44, with the name of the jobber—if we sell we give a contract, even in time bargains—a sold note or a bought note only represents that we are responsible for that amount—you may take that in any denomi<lb/>nation, we cannot help that, so that between the purchase and the delivery, we can buy it backwards and forwards over and over again; but on the day of settlement we must have it ready—if the client cannot pay for it we carry it on, if he wishes; if not he has to pay the difference, and if he is a gainer he has to receive the difference.</p>

Consols, and we always give the name of the jobber; the pos<lb/>session is an actual one, and if the customer lets us know he cannot pay, it goes on—he has the option of carrying it on or closing the matter by selling it—there is always a real transfer of the stock—if any broker were to do other<lb/>wise he would be expelled—the prisoner was not a member of the house—the jobber makes the price to the broker—a jobber may sell what he has not got, and buy it afterwards.</p>

               <p>comes, he may be in a position to take them up, and he may not, I hand him a bought note or a sold note—there are a great many respectable men outside the Stock Exchange, who are dealers in shares; they give a different contract, "sold to," and they dare not charge commission; they sell the actual stock, but we never know when a man sells anything whether he has got it or not—there are many members of the Stock Exchange who are not broken, they must not act as brokers and dealers—the members are not brokers; the jobber is a person who the broker goes to, and his customers are simply brokers; he has no communication with the public at all—the brokers bring the business to him, and he acts as middle man—when I ask the price, he docs not know whether I wish to buy or to sell—a broker must be a member of the Stock Exchange, and nobody gets into the Stock Ex<lb/>change but a member—all brokers need not be members—a great many dealers are not members; they would be if they could, but it is difficult to get in—members who are uot broken are jobbers—a jobber and a dealer is the same, but "jobber" is the term we use—if a jobber were to sell to me, he would not give me a sold note, he simply enters it in his book—they only have sold notes for their clients in the country—the dealers have no sold notes—the broker buys from the dealer—there are a great number outside, who have nothing to do with the laws of the Stock Exchange—they deal in mining shares—they may deal in stocks if they like—there is a mining exchange—dealers outside, if they sell stock to a client, give a note, "Sold to So &amp; So"—it is not necessary that they should transfer bodily; but by the contract they must find the stock by the time it is required.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Blandford Mews—my wife's name is Caroline—my son, James Taylor, is now undergoing penal servitude in Pentonville Prison—on Tuesday evening, 2nd or 3rd of August, the defeant called at my place—he said "I want to speak to you on the quiet"—I took him into the room, we were alone—he said "I have got a letter from Jem," that is my son—I said "A letter, what is it about?"—he said "Why, be wants some money"—I said "I can't read the letter, I have not got my glasses, you read it"—I said "My son can't read nor write"—he then produced a letter and read part of it to me—he said "He wants 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I could not afford it, but I would take him to Dean Street—I walked down to Dean Street with him, and there saw Elizabeth Watson and my wife—Elizabeth Watson had been living with my son as his wife—the prisoner handed the letter to her and she read it—I said "What are you going to do with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "Why, we can keep him like a gentleman"—he said he would take anything in to the prison; he could get anything in that he fancied, tobacco, or anything like that—I said "I had no money," and Elizabeth Watson said "We have no money by us, but we will pawn some<lb/>thing on Friday"—he asked for a bit of paper and a pen, and said we were to send the money to a post-office—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is what he wrote (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Mr. W. Colville, Post-office, St. James's Road, Hollo way, to be called for")—he told me he was a warder and had got forty under his charge, and could take them anything in—he said he was a bricklayer by trade, and my son was out on the works as a bricklayer's labourer—I then walked with him to the Regent Circus, after we had had a pot of ale in our room—Elizabeth Watson gave him a shilling to pay his <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> fare—he said he was a stranger about there—I said I was going that way and I would put him into the right way, and I put him into a <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> at the top of the Caledonian Read—he was dressed in plain clothes—I was not there when the money was sent, and I never saw the prisoner after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of John and Charlotte Taylor, and am now a convict in Pentonville Prison—Marshall was the warder in charge of me—I was working in some building operations with other pri<lb/>soners, and he had charge of us—before I was convicted I was living with Elizabeth Watson as my wife—I can neither read nor write—I know nothing of this letter, or of any letters—I never authorized anyone to write it—I never authorized the prisoner to apply to my father or mother or Watson, for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or any other sum, or any money—he never supplied me with tobacco or any other articles—tobacco is a thing I never use—he never supplied me with anything else—he never brought 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into the prison for me, or any sum of money—I did not believe he ever did such a thing—I never authorized anyone in the prison to apply for money or write any letter; I did not know they had done it.</p>

Q.</hi> You do know that things are supplied to prisoners through the warders, don't you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I never knew such a thing was done—I swear I never knew that the officers did do it, and I never heard of it—I know a man named Thompson by being on the works with him—I did not give my address to Marshall at all—I gave my address to Thomp<lb/>son, on the works; it is a frequent thing—I have been in prison once before—I had twelve months then—there was nothing before that—my term now is seven years—I was convicted on the 28th February, and I was out six months before.</p>

I am clerk to the governor of Pentonville Prison—I know the prisoner's writing—I have seen his explanation—I saw him write that—to the best of my belief this memorandum, and also the letter signed Colville, are in the prisoner's handwriting—this pencil letter was not written by him, it is a different kind of writing altogether—to the best of my belief the letter signed "James Taylor" is in the hand<lb/>writing of prisoner of the name of Thompson—I will not speak positively as to that—(<hi rend="italic">Letters read:</hi> "2nd August, '70.

Report in the Penton<lb/>ville Prison, 21st September, 1870, against assistant-warder Marshall, for attempting to obtain money from the sister of a convict, for the alleged purpose of supplying him with tobacco"—the explanation is "Sir,—I beg to say I don't know any prisoner related to the persons who accuse me of attempting to obtain money from them, and I beg to say I have not at-tempted to obtain money on behalf of any prisoner, or supplied him with tobacco, or other things prohibited by the rules of the service").</p>

Q.</hi> What I understand you to say is, that these papers are written by Marshall to the best of your belief? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I have the same belief of Thompson's writing—as far as I know Marshall was a well conducted man—he came from Chatham, and had been there about two months—his salary was 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but there was an allowance for lodging—there was no extra payment for employment on the works—the prisoner's wife has called at the office since his confinement, respecting his salary—I don't know whether it was for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was due to him—I don't know that money has been refused to her and her children while he has been in prison—I have not heard so—I heard that she applied for money—I did not hear the had been refused—I have been at the prison about twelve years—nothing is supplied to the prisoners by the warders from outside—it has been done, but it is against the rules; it would be a gross breach of rules—we have not, to my knowledge, had a governor there who has had convicts into his private apartments; there have been rumours—I was the late governor's chief clerk—it is the first time I heard that he has had convicts into his private rooms—I don't believe they ever were—I heard that a convict married the daughter of the governor—I know nothing about his visiting her in the governor's apartments—the governor himself had three months for embezzlement.</p>

               <p>before I was examined at the Police Court, the prisoner came to my house at 33, Murray Street, Kingsland Road—he told me he came from Penton<lb/>ville Prison, and he had got a note from my brother, Charles Whiting—he said my brother had written the letter, and wanted a sovereign to find him in tobacco and other necessaries that were needed, and I told him it did not lay in my power to give it him—I saw the note—I can't read—I told the prisoner I could not read, and he said he would read it for me, and he did so—it was about my brother wanting the sovereign—we were in a little wash-house at this time—the man was a stranger to me, and he said he wanted to speak to me privately, and I did not like to take him up stairs—after he had read the letter be put it in the fire—he said he did not wish anybody to know that he had been—I told him I could not afford to give him a sovereign, as my husband had been very ill, and I could not give him anything—when I said I could not give him anything, he said "Then I must be at the loss"—he told me my brother was on the works—the prisoner had his arm in a sling, and wore plain clothes—he said he had met with an accident, and was off duty.</p>

I am a ship's steward, and live at 9, Russell Terrace, Oakley Square—about 1.30 on the night of the 18th September, I was going home—I went out about 8.30—I left the lower sash of my window closed and the upper part was open about two inches—I closed the street door before I went out, and went up the area steps—when I came back I unlocked the street door and went into the passage, and lit a candle—I took the key of the room-door from under the mat, and unlocked the door and walked in—I went to the mantelpiece and placed my candle on it, and com<lb/>menced to undress myself—I turned round to my left and saw the prisoner standing there—I said "What do you want here, who are you?"—he said "want some money"—I said "That you shall very soon have"—I turned towards the window and found the lower sash was half up—I tapped at the window and called "Police!" and at the same time stamped with my foot for my brother, who was sleeping in the room below—the prisoner tried to get out of the window, and I pulled him away—a great tussel ensued—he pushed and pulled me about considerably, and tore my clothes to pieces, and hurt my shoulder—he got me down on the floor and got away from me—he was going towards the door when he was stopped by one of the lodgers until my brother arrived—my brother caught hold of him and asked him what he was doing there, and he turned round and referred to me, and said that I had brought him there—he said he had got two respectable witnesses outside, and he would get them if we would let him go—in a few minutes a policeman came and took him, and I went to the police-station—I had never seen the prisoner before—the window opens on to a small balcony in front of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I pleaded guilty last week to this charge of burglary—I know Markham and Gill—on Sunday, 7th August, before this burglary took place, I met Markham, about 12 o'clock, in Eyre Street, Brick Lane—he went with me to my house, 30, Lisbon Street, Cambridge Heath Road, Mile End—I told him I had some work in hand; but I was standing still for want of a pound to get my diamond out of pawn (I am a fancy toy maker)—I asked him if he thought he could lend me one; he paid he would see if he could—at 1 o'clock we went out down to the beer-shop kept by a man named Gayton—he stopped there till 3 o'clock, when the house closed—he came down there again in the evening—he said he would see if he could lend me one on Monday; that was the next day—he came again to the beer-shop on Monday, Gill with him—we stopped there a good part of the day, Gill, Hambleton, Markham, and myself—we were at Gayton's on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday—I can't say what time he came on the Monday, I had been to the Arcade in the morn<lb/>ing, and when I came back he had been waiting all the morning—Markham said if I met him at 7.45, outside the Red Lion public-house, on Tuesday evening, facing the Britannia Theatre, in Hozton, he would lend me the pound—I met him there on the Tuesday evening; Hambleton was with me, and Gill was with Markham—he then made some excuse; he told me that if I met him at 3.45, at the same place, on Wednesday evening, he would let me have it—I was with him about a quarter of an hour on the Tuesday evening—I met Markham and Gill on the Wednesday evening—Hambleton was with me—we did not go in the Red Lion, we went into several others—he did not give me the money then—Markham and Gill went away to get a pattern of some silk, to show a lodger of his, he said—they were gone about an hour—they came back together—they called us out of the public-house, and we went to the prosecutor's house—as we went along Markham told me that he occupied the house and rented it, that he had two lodgers, one was a tailor and the other was a glove dyer—before that he asked Hambleton if he would carry a bag full of things from his house to his friend's house, and be offered him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for his trouble, and Hambleton agreed to it—when we got to the prosecutor's house Markham told Hambleton that he did not want him to carry them then, as a lodger and her sister were in the front room; he said he did not want them to see the things come out in the bag—he told us to wait at the corner of the street, but not to go into the public-house opposite—we waited some time, and Markham and Gill came out for some beer—Markham had a jug in his hand—as they passed they told us to wait there a little time longer—they came shortly after, and asked us into the house—as they came along with the beer they said "Come on," and me and Markham, Gill and Hambleton went into the passage together—Markhara told Hambleton he would find the bag behind the door, and to take it—Markham then handed me a screw<lb/>driver and a chisel; he told me to open the third drawer of the chest, as he wanted to get a cash-box out—I was in the passage; the room-door was open, and the chest stood in front of it—I said "No, Markham, I did not come here for that purpose, I will have nothing at all to do with it"—he told me to put the screw<lb/>driver and chisel in my pocket, and he said "I will come up and do it myself, you have got no steel in you"—Gill came up stairs shortly after that, whistling</p>

               <p>a tune called "Cliquot"—he asked me if I bad done it; I said "No, and I don't intend to do it"—he then went into the room, came out again, and went down stairs—a short time after that the prosecutor came up—I was standing in the passage—he collared me, and we had a struggle—Markham opened the door, and pushed me and the prosecutor into the street, and we both fell—when we got up the prosecutor handed me over to Markham, and he said to me "Slip your ooat and run away," and I did run stray—my hat was left in the passage—I was brought back shortly after-wards, and Markham and Gill said I was not the man—my hat was there in the passage—someone said "There is his hat," and Markham owned it—I don't know exactly what he said, he picked it up, and said it was his—I was taken to the House of Detention—Gill came to see me while I was there—I asked him what he meant by getting me into this scrape—he said "Never mind, we will get you off, we will come and swear you were not the party; but you had better subpœna us up, as it will save all sus<lb/>picion"—he said he could keep me while I was in prison, and that I should have a good Counsellor, and he would pay for it.</p>

               <p>evidence could not be heard against these two first—in point of fact I pleaded guilty, and I did nothing—after I had suffered two years' imprisonment—I did not like my imprisonment—I don't suppose you would like it—I know it is the longest sentence of imprisonment I could have, unless I got penal servitude—Hambleton was with me in Mr. Wheeler's house—he was ac<lb/>quitted by the Jury—I don't remember what his Counsel said—he was acquitted, but he was most decidedly as guilty as I was—I pleaded guilty because five witnesses proved they saw me come out of the house and brought back—I make kaleidoscopes—that is what I use the diamond for, to cut the glass; it is a circular board for cutting circles—I work in my own back room—I did not sell my things there—I sold them at all the warehouses round London very nearly, and I can prove it—I have had con<lb/>versations with the inspector of police in the prison, twice, I believe—I gave him this information—my Counsel advised me to plead guilty—I told you circumstances were against me—I pleaded guilty by the advice of my Counsel—I told my Counsel I was innocent, and still he insisted on my pleading guilty—that was the Counsel who is prosecuting this case—I never took anything from the house, or moved anything.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">HENRY CAMPBELL</hi>. I was tried and acquitted the other day upon this charge, in the name of Hambleton—on Sunday, 7th August, I went into a public-house to have a pint of half-and-half, and saw Markham and Gill in company with Willis—Willis told Markham I was a friend of his—we stopped there sometimes, and met again on Monday at the same house—on Tuesday Willis asked me to accompany him to the Red Lion to meet Markham, who had promised to lend him a sovereign to get a diamond circle out of pawn—we went there about 7.45, and saw Markham and Gill—we had something to drink—Markham went away and returned—he said to Willis "I can't let you have it to-night, but if you will be down here to-morrow night I will be sure to let you have it"—we had four glasses of port wine, which Markham paid for, and a quartern of gin at another place—on Wednesday night I went with Willis to the Red Lion, about 9 o'clock, and saw the prisoners—Markham asked if I would carry some things for him from his house to Gill's, and he would give me a half-crown for my trouble—I said "Yes"—he took me and Willis round to the prosecutor's house, and told us to stand at the corner of the street; that a lodger of his had a sister in the front parlour, and he did not want them to see the things come out of the place—he told us to stop at the corner of the street, but on no con<lb/>sideration to go into the public-house—after some time he came and took us into the house, and told me there was a bag behind the door, with some things in it, and he handed Willis a chisel and screw-driver, and told him to open a drawer, and he would find a cash-box—Willis said "No, Mark<lb/>ham, I want none of this for me," and he handed them back to Markham—Markham told him to put them in his pocket, and he would come up and do it himself—shortly after Gill came up whistling "Cliquot"—he did not say anything—the prosecutor came up shortly afterwards, and had a tussle with Willis—I believe Markham opened the door—he told me to run out into the street, or else I should not have quitted the premises—he shoved me, Willis, and the prosecutor out into the street, and told me to run—I was stopped, and brought back again—Markham said I was not the man; it</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly in the Metropolitan Police, and and now frequently employed as a detective by the Mint—on 17th September, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I went, with nine officers, to 4, Orchard Terrace, Battereea—the street-door, which was shut, was forced open by Miller—he at once entered, and proceeded up stairs, to a sort of ante room, on the middle landing, the door of which was opened and immediately closed—it was forced open by Miller, and we found the four prisoners in the room; Sarah Taylor, who was standing close to a table, seized this pair of iron clams, in which was this mould, with two half-crowns in it—it was so hot I could not hold it—after some trouble I got it from her hand; but not till she broke it—on the table was this file, with white metal in its teeth, and a galvanic battery rod, with the screw detatched, and near it also a paper band corresponding in size to the mould, with plaster sticking to it—they all resisted, except Mattock, who stood still and seemed confounded—this ladle, containing white metal, nearly fluid, was on the grate, and on a trivet, hanging on the grate, was a double plaster of Pahs mould for making half-crowns, which Copeland seized, and she and Miller had a struggle—it had not been used; it was hot, and put there to dry—I found several finger-stalls for holding the hot moulds, and Inspector Aspenshaw handed me two good half-crowns, from which the mould appears to have been made—this black bag, containing two galvanic battery jars and a porous pot, were near the table—the pot is used for immersing coins in the solution—I also found this board, which is used for drying the coins; placing them on a flat sur<lb/>face causes them to be discoloured; but by placing them on these nails, a very small portion touches the flat surface; I also found plaster of Paris, emery powder, white sand, and all the implements necessary for making coating, and colouring coin—as we went in a cab Copeland said "I hope you won't hurt this young woman (Mattock), she knows nothing about it; I cannot say so of myself"—Alfred Taylor said "I" or "We were going out, when we used up all the metal".</p>

On 23rd September, at 5.30 in the evening, I was on duty at Nunhead Cemetery, and saw the prisoner with a sack oil his back—I followed him three-quarters of a mile to Oliver Road, Peckhara, where I stopped him, and said "What have you got?"—he said "A sheep"—I said "Where did you get it from!"—he said there had been an accident at Bromley, and it had been run over by a waggon and killed, and he gave 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I said his statement did not satisfy me, and I should take him to the station—he said "Very well"—I found in the sack the hind quarters of a sheep, wrapped up in a skin, and tied round with rope; this is the skin.</p>

When the men ran away they separated one from the other—I followed one of them, I began to follow directly—I daresay he was about the length of this Court from me—I could not say exactly, perhaps thirty or forty yards—I did not lose sight of Stedeu before he went into the house—I gained on him—he went through a wooden door into the garden—I did not see him go into the house—he was about twenty yards from me when he went into the garden—there were two or three turnings before he got to the house, and he got round them before I did—I caught sight of him before he took another turn—he was not running, it was a fast walk—I waited outside the house till the policeman came up—I called out "Police," as I followed him, loud enough for him to hear, he did not run or take any notice—this is my chain.</p>
