               <p>THough this Sessions was very considerable both for the numerousness of the Offenders, and heinousness of several of their Crimes, yet none rais'd so much noise and discourse as that impudent Villany of Sadler &amp; his Accomplices stealing the Mace, and other Ensignes of State, from the house of the Right Honourable the Lord High Chancellor of England.</p>
               <p>For which they were on Wednesday the 7th instant brought to tryal, and put upon a London-Jury (where they were taken with most part of the things stolen) but after a long discussion of the matter, the prudence of the Court (which delights to do Justa Juste) thought fit to refer them to a Tryal upon Indictments in Middlesex, which were ordered to be drawn up against them; and whereof we shall by and by in course, give the Reader a satisfactory Account.</p>

The same Wednesday morning two of the Prisoners S. and J. came to a house in Knight rider street, where they had lain three weeks by the name of Clarke and Trueman, had been gone a week or thereabouts; and upon inquiry, finding the Room not lett, told the people they were come to lie there again: J. brought in a bundle under his coat, and that night only he lay there, but had a fire, and next day brought down a small quantity of silver Lace, as he said, to burn at the Kitchin-fire; and borrowing a hammer to beat it in his Chamber, lock'd his door and continued beating about three hours: Next morning his Companion came, bringing their other Crony, and that night they all three lay together: On the Friday they all went forth, but carried away the Key of the Closet: Their Landladies daughter going up to clean the Room, observes a great many Spangles of Gold, and about six small Pearls, which prompted her curiosity (having before some suspitions) with a Knife to open the Closet-door, where under a cloath she met with the Coronet on the top of the Mace, and part of the body of it; the sight whereof strangely surprized her, and made her call up her Mother, telling her, they had got the King's Crown: She is no less amazed, but desires a Neighbour to inquire what News there was abroad at the Coffee-house; there he is told of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16770307005"/>my Lord Chancellor's being robb'd; and then concluding this must be his Mace, honestly gives information; whereupon several of my Lords servants, with Officers, plant themselves over the way. That night none of the three Prisoners came there, but a woman to enquire for them (who since pretends to be Sadler's wife) she presently is secured, so likewise was Johnson, who came next morning; and soon after Sadler coming also thither, spying a Croud about the door, strikes down a Lane towards the Waterside, where he is pursued, and after some small resistance, taken. The Closet is search'd and besides most part of the Mace, some of the Purse, and several other pieces of Plate found: And upon search before Sir W. T. in Sadler's Almanack was found a Note where
