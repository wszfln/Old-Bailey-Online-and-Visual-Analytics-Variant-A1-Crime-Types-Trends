I am a postman in the General Post Office, and live at 17, Hemstal Place, St. John's Wood—on September 13th, about 2.15 p.m., I was about to clear out the pillar box in Copthall Avenue—I had not opened the box—the prisoner came up and said he had dropped a half-sovereign into the box amongst some letters he had posted—I opened the box—a man dressed as a painter came up on my right side and said, "I am sorry, postman, I have put some paint on your keys; I will wipe it off"—the keys were hanging in the keyhole—the prisoner was still saying he had dropped a half-sovereign into the box—the painter took the keys out to wipe the paint off, and I noticed him take a small cardboard box from his pocket—he was pressing the key on a ball of wax or some substance in the box—I was still clearing the box—when he produced the box the prisoner said, "It must be down in the corner there"—there was no half-sovereign there—I had no reason for noticing the painter—the keys were smeared with a paint-brush—the man had a paint can in his left hand and a brush in his right, and he smeared the keys as the door was swinging open—first of all I thought it was an accident, then I began to get suspicious when the prisoner was still <hi rend="italic">carrying on</hi> about the half-sovereign—the painter then put the keys back into the keyhole—I said, "There is no half-sovereign in here"—the prisoner pulled thirteen or fourteen sovereigns from his pocket and said, "I am very sorry, postman, I have got it here; take this sixpence"—I refused the sixpence, and the prisoner then walked away in the direction of the painter—I closed the box and gave my bags into the charge of a man who keeps a stall close by—I called a constable, and we followed the two men—we met them in Drapers' Gardens—the prisoner turned round when <hi rend="italic">he see</hi> us coming and walked towards us—the painter ran away in the opposite direction, and got away—I caught hold of the prisoner's arm and said, "Half a minute"—he said, "I have not touched your keys," and ran away—I ran after him shouting out, "Hold him, hold him"—he ran into a doorway in the Stock Exchange, and was stopped by Mr. Simmons on the first floor—I saw the prisoner put his hand into his inside pocket and throw something into a basement—I did not pick it up, but a con<lb/>stable brought it into Moor Lane Station—this is it—it is a small box like the one the painter had—it contains a piece of wax and the impression of a post-office key on it.</p>

               <p>took them out of the door—the impression on this wax represents the part of the key which opens the lock—the painter did not take the wax out of its box—I do not say this is an impression of this key—when the painter put the paint on the keys it aroused my suspicions—I did not say anything to him, because I thought I would let him take an impression of the key, and if I had called to him then no doubt he would have run away—I went on collecting the letters—the painter went away first—he went away quietly—the prisoner remained behind—the painter had gone about ten yards before the prisoner left the box, and then he followed in the same direction—I lost sight of them then—the prisoner returned to me when the constable was walking with me—the painter was in sight then—when the prisoner got up to me the painter ran away—I had the keys in my hand when the prisoner came back to me, as the painter had put them back into the lock, and after I had emptied the box I took them out of the keyhole—the prisoner had not touched the keys—he was dressed as he is now.</p>

I am a postman in the Northern District, and live at 18, Sedon Street, Cannon bury—on September 11th I was making a collection in my district about 1.55 p.m.—the pillar-box is in the Upper Street, Islington—it is known as St. Mary's Church pillar-box—when I got to the box I saw the prisoner standing up against the church—I have no doubt that he is the man—he was counting some gold coins in his left hand—he came up to me and asked me if I collected that box—I said, "Yes"—I understood him at first to say that he had posted a letter containing half a sovereign—then I understood him to say that he had posted some letters with half a sovereign between them by accident—he offered me 6d., which I refused—he wanted me to look for the half-sovereign—I told him I could not give it to him even if I found it—I looked into the box—I saw no half-sovereign there—while I was looking into the box my bunch of keys was hanging in the keyhole—a man who had the appearance of a painter came up on my left side—he said something which I did not hear—he had an apron and a cap on, and I saw something in his hand which I took to be a paint-pot—the door was then open and the keys were hanging in the lock—I did not see if he did anything to the keys—I told the prisoner there was no half-sovereign in the box, and he again pressed me to take 6d. which I did—then he stood a little way off the box counting his gold again—he said he had found the half-sovereign in between the gold—he then went away—on September 22nd I went to the Guildhall Police Court, where I picked out the prisoner from eight or nine others as being the map I had seen on September 11th or 12th—I am not certain which day it was.</p>

I live at-2, Cleve Road, West Hampstead, and am managing director to Dore and Sons, Ltd.—I went with the police to the prisoner's shop at 71, Old Street—I saw the prisoner—I think the police asked him if he had any of our stuff—at first he said no—I saw a box there when the place was searched—the police asked him to open it, which he did—I saw the clothes in it—I identified the stuff as ours—the cloth is specially manufactured for us—nobody had any right to sell it to the prisoner—he would come to fetch cloth to make into coats for us—it would be ready cut up, and he would bring the coats to be tried on, and also when they were finally finished—Popkins was never employed to take cloth to the prisoner—I identify the whole of this cloth as our property, and it is all supplied solely to us and not supplied to any other firm.</p>

Until I was taken into custody I was employed by Dore and Sons for about two years, first as a trimmer and then as under-cutter—I received 35s. a week—when I wanted cloth for the purpose of cutting out, I filled in a form for the amount I required, which would be sent to my father, who was the manager, or to Mr. Townley, to sign—it was <hi rend="italic">then</hi> sent by a messenger to the place where the cloth was kept, when the amount would be returned to me; when the orders came back, signed by my father, I would insert additional amounts, and so get more cloth—from time to time I obtained pieces of cloth in that way—I first resorted to dishonest practices at the prisoner's suggestion—he asked me if I could get him a length of cloth for a pair of trousers—we were in the basement at Dora's, when he said that, about the middle of last June—the prisoner was in the basement waiting for his work—he said that for 2 1/2 yards of cloth he would give me 4s.—the real value would be about 13s.—I should say that the prisoner knows the value of cloth—I refused to get it time after time—the suggestion as to how I should get the cloth came from the prisoner—he knew very well that I should have to send for it, and that</p>

I am a painter's labourer—the deceased was my step daughter—she was married to the prisoner on December 10th, 1901—she was twenty one years old—they did not live happily together—I saw her on September 1st, at 8.10 p.m., at Notting Hill Grate post-office with the prisoner—she had a black eye—I asked them to go home and try to make things up and be happy together—I kissed her and wished them good-night—I afterwards saw my daughter's body at the mortuary.</p>

               <p>he was married—on one occasion he came down in the night and stood by my bed with a knife, and asked me to forgive him for threatening to.

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Farrow and Co., jobmasters, Adam and Eve Mews, Kensington—the prisoner has been in our employment for three years as chaff-cutter—he gave us every satis<lb/>faction—he was a most sober and steady man—on September 1st, about midday, he gave me notice to leave that night, as he had trouble with his wife at home, and he thought of leaving her altogether that night—he finished his work, and, as far as I know, he remained at work during the rest of the day—I last saw him about 7 p.m., when I paid him 4s. 2d., which was for one day's work—he may have gone out during the day without my knowing it—I have never seen this knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) before I saw it at the police-court—the prisoner was always very strange in his behaviour—he gave us the impression that he was not quite right in his mind—part of his duty was to take out forage with a van, and, on account of our not thinking him quite responsible, we sent a second man with him—we regarded him as a most temperate man—I never saw him the worse for liquor—he was a most hard-working man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have often seen knives like this among our own men—it is a Swedish knife—our men mostly carry knives, sometimes for eating their food with, and when cutting chaff they have to have a knife to cut the string which binds the trusses—a strong knife like this would be just the thing for it—on September 1st the prisoner looked very worried when he came to work—he seemed to mumble in his speech—he did not seem quite in his mind for that day—I was very surprised when he gave notice—he always seemed to be clean—he always wore working clothes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer at Brixton Prison—I have made a report as to my opinion of the prisoner's state of mind. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the prisoner was received at the prison on September</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th, and had been under close observation since; that the witness had had interviews with him, and had received reports about him and also read the depositions in the case; that while the prisoner was in the prison he was rational; that the witness had not detected any insane delusions; that the prisoner was below the average in intelligence and was of weak mind, but not actually insane; that he had had several seizures while in prison, which seemed to be genuine epileptic fits; that he was dull and stupid after them, but showed no signs of violence, and lay as though helpless; that he had, like most epileptics, a violent temper when roused, and had less self-control than most ordinary men; that the witness had formed the opinion that although the prisoner was of weak mind and an epileptic he had not been insane whilst under his care; that the evidence did not show that he was insane on September</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd, so as not to know the nature and quality of his acts; and that he was fit to plead and stand his trial.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Being an epileptic would make him excitable—threats of personal violence would affect an epileptic more than an ordinary person—fright is sometimes alleged to bring on epileptic fits—epilepsy frequently leads to defective memory; it is very likely true when the prisoner says he does not know what he did with the knife—epileptics are sometimes seized with sudden impulses quite apart from epileptic fits, but it is not common, and in certain cases it has happened that they have used dangerous violence to other people without any malevolent intentions—cases of epilepsy vary very much—the actual cause of it is not known—if the prisoner was frightened by the violence of his wife it is possible, considering his condition, that he was more frightened than an ordinary person would have been; he might believe he was acting in self-defence when a person of perfectly balanced mind would not have thought so—a long continued course of cruelty would make him more likely to apprehend danger—I have heard of Dr. Ebbing, he is a German—in cases of epilepsy the subject may sometimes be liable to sexual passions—I do not know if Dr. Ebbing says in his book that "In many epileptics the sexual feeling is very intense"—if the prisoner was laughed at by his wife it would be likely to irritate him.</p>

               <p>and then in my right arm—the doctor examined me and I was sent to the hospital—I do not know the prisoner—I had only been in the ship three days with him—we both joined the ship in this country—it was a Swedish knife that he used.</p>

had suffered penal servitude, and had said that he was going to kill you—I showed Gough the cheque on the Saturday and gave him a description of Willis and Bartlett—he knew Bartlett—I have found money to make a book—I know the landlord of the Duke of Einburgh at Putney—I have borrowed money of him and cashed dozens of cheques with him—he did not cash a worthless one signed by Viscount Destri—a gentleman of the Drive, Putney, did not threaten me with criminal proceedings—you were always calling on me; I cannot specify dates—I had several appointments with you—I wrote letters to you—I had clothes from Westoby's about the end of August or the beginning of September—I was always at the King's Head about 8 o'clock—I have had furniture on hire twice—I was in arrear in payment through your going to my landlord—the furniture was removed once—it was all found except two articles—you signed a declaration of your own, at Collins' of Bridge Road—I did sign it—the furniture was only there three days—you pawned it at Bosh's on my instructions, I did not; you did all the talking—I had the money except what I paid you, 5s. or 6s.—I never knew myself otherwise than desperately hard up—I told you Lord Haldon had left word about the cheque a second time, and that it would b., put into the hands of the police, and I went to Hampton Wick and Waterloo—you asked me if I owed money, and I said that I said to the tradesman, "You will wait for your account, I will get the cheque stopped, it will be no good to you"—my wife answered the door, and I saw the stranger at the door about five or six minutes—I said, "Are you Mr. Thomas?"—he said, "No, I-am not Mr. Thomas; I have come from Mr. Bartlett"—I was too pleased to-get the £12 10s. cheque, I did not think about anything else—he said I had-no right to hold both the cheque and the bill—I had the cheque in my hand—he was to call in two hours for the bill and declaration—he did not come back—I first discovered that the bill was a forgery when I went to Lord Haldon on the 21st—on the 25th I had an appointment with you—four days afterwards I went to see Mrs. Daniell—I said, "I believe you know what I am come about, I am Mr. Charteris; I do not like being fooled about, I want my £20"—I had been waiting for you to get my money—I had the note with me; she said she would meet me—I said, "What is the good of doing that; I must have the money or I shall place the matter in the hands of the police"—I asked for the bill to be met—I demanded £20—the cheque for £3 10s. is not made payable to me—my name is Bell Charteris, not Bell.</p>

               <p>evening he did not say he would do anything, but it Jed me to infer that he had it, and said that what he had been told was true—after he came home from South Africa, and before I went to Worthing, he came home and said he did not believe I was happy with him, and said, "If I believed you would leave me I would have your life," and he went into the kitchen and brought back a knife—when I said that I had a good mind to telegraph to town he pulled a brush out of his pocket and said, "You are not half enough"—he came out of the public house, he having kept me some time waiting, and afterwards we went on the beach—he asked me on the Sunday if it was true about the sailor and what I knew about him, and I told him—I slept with the prisoner on the Tuesday night—I knew he was going up to London the next morning—I walked with him at Worthing; he had no money; he said he must take my ring, and he did so—on the way back he asked what I meant to do—I said that if I had work I meant to keep the house on and stop at home and mind the child—that was all the conversation on the Tuesday—we then went home and had tea and sat indoors till bed time—he asked me if I liked the sailor—I said "Yes"—he said, "Better than me?"—I said, "Not if you had been all right"—he asked me if I meant to leave him and live with the sailor—I said "No," and he went off and said, "I am done"; then he jumped up and said, "What are you doing?" Don't be frightened, I shall never hurt you"—he also said, "I believed you"—I saw a razor before he got into bed again—all that was said about the sailor on the Tuesday night, was before I went to sleep—he returned to town at 10 o'clock on the Wednes<lb/>day morning—he said, "I shall take Maggie with me"—I said,."No, it is too early"—I did not want him to take her, I wanted her to stay with me—he said, "What! can't a father take his own child?" and I let her go with him—I went and saw him off at the station, and parted with him on friendly terms; we kissed and said good-bye—I and my sister went up to town by a later train, and on the way we passed the Palmerston public-house, Fulham, and I saw the prisoner there with Mrs. Nye and Frewin—I went in and spoke to him, and Mrs. Nye said something, and he turned round and said some<lb/>thing, and about that time a constable came in and arrested him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was passionately fond of the child—before ho went to South Africa he was very fond of her—he paid her very great attention—when he was in South Africa he wrote affectionate letters to me and I wrote back—I could understand them, but they were strange letters; there was no reason for them—when he came back we resumed cohabitation—I knew a man before him, but he died four years ago—I had been parted from him fourteen years, not by a law suit, but I would not live with him; I went away from him—I had four children by him—after that I lived with another man before the prisoner—the prisoner is not a man who looks on the dark side of things; any night I have seen him dancing from one public-house to another; he was very bright, and not likely to look on the dark side of things before he went to South Africa; when he came back he was not fond of work, but he had been doing some work; he had only been home two months—I was to stay at home and not to do any work—I mentioned at the inquest that on the day he came to Worthing he went into a public-house</p>

               <p>and had some drink—I do not know whether I said that before the Magis<lb/>trate—when he came to Worthing on the Monday he did not sleep very well, I believe he laid awake when I was asleep; he told me he had not any sleep—I don't think he said that he had pains in his head, but he had in his body and limbs—when he had the razor in his hand he said, "I can never trust you again; I have found another way of breaking your heart so that you shall never hold up your head again"—he jumped out of bed, and I jumped out too—that was not the night he had the razor in his hand, but on Monday night—I did not make that statement at the inquest, I was not asked the question—the inquest was on Saturday the 13th—the matter had been talked over—I had not seen Mrs. Helmes or any of the witnesses—I went home with Mrs. Nye after the inquest, and no one else—we went to my home, and we met at the Magistrate's court—I said before the Magis<lb/>trate that when I was discussing the question with him about the sailor, I said, "No, it never came to that," and he said. "I should be satisfied when I saw you with your throat cut"—that was on Tuesday night—I was not afraid, but I did not like him to <hi rend="italic">say</hi> it—we parted fairly well—he said he had made up his mind to take the child when he got up in the morning—I knew that certain statements had been made about the sailor, and I told him they were not true, that I had been familiar with him, but that there had been nothing improper between us—I told him that I did like the sailor, but not better than him if he had been all right—I said that it was a friendly arrangement and the matter was over, and he believed me—we had made it up—that was the impression on my mind when he kissed me and parted on friendly terms—he told me not to be late, and made me promise that I would come straight indoors—he asked me what time, and I said about six—he was greatly excited when he went out on the Tuesday night—that was not the night when he had his hand in his pocket with the razor, but the next night—he did not have the razor that night—at the time he went away he never made any threat against the child, he was passionately fond of her; it was, I believe, the one thing he thought about—he wrote to say that he was in hospital run down in health—he made no other allusion to his health.</p>

                  </hi> (33 <hi rend="italic">P.</hi>) On September 10th, a little before 7 o'clock, I was called to 40, Waterford Road—I went up to the first floor with Clark, who opened the door with a key, and I saw the child lying on the bed on her back on the left side of the bed—these two letters and a photograph (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) were on the child—I kept them—I sent for a doctor and then went and found the prisoner in the Palmerston—I asked him if his name was Williams—he said, "Yes, I know what you want me for, for killing my little girl. I did it, God bless her; I will hang like a man for it"—going to the station he said, "I am glad she is dead, she cannot be brought up as a prostitute now"—I heard what he said when charged at the station—it was taken down—I was in charge in the cell for some time—he said, "I wanted to tell you something; I laid her on the bed and said, "We will have a game. I put a handerchief over her eyes and cut her throat with a razor"—he handed me a razor at the station, and said, "This is what I did it with; I did it because her mother is nothing more than a prostitute."</p>

I have killed my beautiful little girl to save her from prostitution."—I told him I was a police officer, and he would be charged with wilfully murdering his daughter Margaret by cutting her throat with a razor at 40, Waterford Road—I cautioned him in the usual manner—he then said, "I know you put it down in writing. I did kill my lovely daughter to save her from becoming a prostitute. It is not many men who would have had the heart to do it, but I bleeding well did it, and now I shall hang for it. I did it to save my old woman from putting her in bed with other men. God blind me, she was my child, and I loved her, and I will walk like a man to the scaffold. I loved every hair of her head. Is my old woman outside?"—he afterwards pointed to the pieces of paper, and said, "I found them in my wife's possession, and that is what all the disturbance was about"—those two pieces of paper were the addresses of Mr. Honeyman and Mr. George—when the charge was read he said, "Wait a minute, you want to scratch "Annie 'out"—the child was described on the charge sheet as "Margaret Annie"—he seemed</p>

                  </hi>. I am a window cleaner of 22, Penton Street, Penton<lb/>ville—at 12.5 a.m. on Sunday, October 5th, I was standing outside the Eagle public house, Farringdon Road, with my wife, my brother William Tarr, Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, and a man named Gray—we were saying good night to each other—I saw Jeveno, and I think I saw Vecchione, but I am not positive about him—there was a man there very like him—there were several Italians there, and they crossed the road towards us,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190210200054"/>
               <p>and one of the men, who is not under arrest, accosted the females—we told him to get away, and he used insulting language in very broken English, but you could understand what it was—he pulled out a knife when we told him to go away—me and my brother tried to take it from him as he became very threatening with it—while we were struggling I got a stab on my head—I am not positive whether it was done by the man who got away or Vecchione—I think I have made a great mistake about Vecchione—Jeveno stabbed me behind the ear—I saw a knife in his hand—when I had received the two stabs my wife got hold of me—I said, "I am stabbed"—two Italians ran away, one is not in custody and the other I mistook for Vecchione—I gave chase with my brother, who got in front of me—he caught hold of the two Italians, but they got away from him and ran into Great Bath Street, about 200 or 300 yards away—they went into a house and closed the door—I blew my police whistle—a constable came and burst the door open—I went in with him—we found three men in a bedroom on the top floor, they were just about to get into bed—Vecchione was one of them—Jeveno was not there; I saw him at the police court on Monday morning and identified him from about twenty others.</p>

Geen's, and asked him if he did not think he was cruelly treating me in receiving all that money and not paying it to me—I asked him what he had done with the money, and he said he had used it in establishing his own business and outgoings—I asked him what he had done with George's Lady Day cheque, and he said that part of it was in the amount he sent me and part had gone in his business—I then asked what he had done with George's Midsummer cheque, and he made the same reply—I asked him about the builder's account, and what authority he had to employ a builder—he said he was going to pay it himself, but he had not the money—up to the time I got that account from my solicitor I had no knowledge whatever that he had collected £136 of mine—Mr. Bryer was tenant of 7 and 8, Elliott Bank—he left in June, 1901—I asked Gooddall several times for Mr. Bryer's last quarter's rent, and he said it had not been paid, that there were things left in the houses, and he was waiting till they were sold to help pay the rent—I had no knowledge until August last that Gooddall had already received £40 from Mrs. Bryer for his last quarter's rent—I wrote to Gooddall for Mr. Bryer's address so that I could write to him for the rent, and I received this letter: "August 9th, Dear Sir, I am sorry to say my business affairs have got into such a desperate condition that I have been com<lb/>pelled to employ a well-known firm of solicitors, Messrs. Stanley Evans and Co., and they are writing you on Monday with a proposition for pay<lb/>ment of every penny that is owing to you. I must keep going somehow; If I do, all will end well; if I do not, it means utter failure for me and a heavy loss to you, which I want to avoid. The only thing I have never told you is that Mr. Bryer's rent has been paid, and I am arranging for payment to you"—I have never received a penny of the £136, that in addition to the money I lent him makes £460.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not recollect dates very well—I am not a very good scholar—I had a conversation with Gooddall two or three weeks before he sent me the accounts on July 2nd—up to that time I had not received any of the Lady Day rents—this is my receipt "April 21st. Received on accounts of rents. £25 4s. 1d. weekly and quarterly"—it does not say that they were the Lady Day rents, and I say it does not refer to the Lady Day rents—I first met Gooddall in 1899—I did not know he was a clerk to a firm of house agents—I understood he was doing business on his own account—he consulted me about starting business in Gower Place,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190210200065"/>
               <p>and asked me if I would advance him money for the purpose—he took the premises himself—I had nothing to do with it—he said that he and a Mr. Dunn were going into partnership, and he asked me to assist him, and it was then that I advanced him £100, and I received a joint bill of Gooddall and Dunn for £165 and a charge upon their household goods as security—the interest of £65 was for three years, and was. Gooddall's own proposal—I have not had any of it yet—I cannot remember having deducted the first six months' interest—the business in Gower Place was started in February, 1900, and Dunn dissolved partnership in November, 1900, and I gave up the bill in exchange for the charge on the reversionary interest under the will in which Gooddall was interested, which was to cover every-thing, and I made up the loan to £330—I cannot recollect whether I only paid him £30 or not—I cannot say whether the reversionary interest is a substantial one or not—if there was only £30 paid over there would be some money that he owed me on account of rents which he lad collected, and that would be deducted from the loan—at the time I took the reversionary interest in January, 1901, I thought there must be more money collected than that paid over to me and part of the consideration for that charge of £330 was rent collected by him and not at that time handed over—the next transaction was in November, 1901, when he topic a. Mr. Clark into partnership—he did not consult me about the partnership—he told me that Mr. Clark had paid him £175 for a half-share of the business, and he paid me back £100, not on account of back rents, but on account of money I had lent him to get himself along—I received this document as security for the £125 (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "12th February,. 1902. In consideration of your having this day advanced me the sum of £125, £100 cash and £25 interest, upon a bill or promissory note. I hereby transfer to you absolutely and entirely my present interest in the half-share of my business")—I received that document after the partner Clark had left him—I do not recollect advancing him £25 only and the balance of £75 going to wipe away the back rents—I only held that document as security—I had nothing what-ever to do with Gooddall's business—I know nothing about this com<lb/>mission note for £40 (<hi rend="italic">Produced)—I</hi> never had it in my possession as a security—I do not know that Gooddall during the three years he has been doing my business has made a number of small payments to various people for me: he had no business to do so—he did not suggest to me that I should transfer the management of the property to Messrs. Geen—he said it was beyond his management, and I said if he could not manage it someone else must and I should transfer the management of my property to Messrs Geen and told him to let me have a complete account of all his dealings with the property, and then I got the account of August 2nd showing £136 due to me for rents—so far as my solicitor has gone through it, it is correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Until I was at the police-court no one ever suggested that I was a partner in Gooddall's business—before any expenditure was permitted on my property, Gooddall always Had to consult me' first—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the agreement signed by Gooddall, under which he manages the property, and stating that all questions of repairs are to be first sub<lb/>mitted</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Hollingshurst and Co., chemical manure merchants, 127, Fenchurch Street—on May 30th, 1902, after negotiation with the prisoner, I purchased from him 400 tons of basic slag at 35s. a ton—Dr. Dyer was the analyst agreed upon in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190210200072"/>
               <p>contract—I subsequently purchased other shipments, the qualities guaran<lb/>teed being 38 to 40 per cent, and 80 per cent, of fineness, at 35s. a ton for first quality, and 26 to 30 per cent, of phosphate of lime at 24s. second quality—I produce the memoranda of sale from A. J. Forest, of 208, Rue de Haerne, Brussels, and the invoices, contract, and other documents relating to those purchases—I believed that I was buying basic slag of the quality described, and I had a guarantee also of the specified quantity—basic slag is a waste product which has recently been so chemically treated as to become a valuable fertiliser and a valuable merchantable article, accord<lb/>ing to the amount of phosphate of lime brought into it—it is now recog<lb/>nised as a first-class fertiliser, and has taken the place of phosphate of lime—it is produced in England as well as on the Continent—I found in Belgium a cheaper seller—Middlesbrough and the North-Eastern districts turn out hundreds of thousands of tons—they all work on the Thomas Gilchrist process, by which lime absorbs the phosphoric acids and forms a phosphate of lime, the average being 38 to 40 per cent, of phosphate of lime in that which is sold in this country—I sold the first consignment of 400 tons and another 150 tons to the Drogheda Chemical Manure Company on the same guarantee as I had received in the documents produced—in my contracts connected with Ireland there was an arbitration clause, but not in other contracts—550 tons were shipped by the <hi rend="italic">Paradox</hi>, the captain's name being William Brown—accompanying the invoice was always a bill of exchange for three-quarters of the value payable at sight—this is one cheque—it is payable to the order of Jacob, and Co. for £660—the shipment by <hi rend="italic">Eliza H.</hi> was 200 tons, in respect of which I paid this cheque of £262 10s.—those cheques are endorsed Jacobs and Co.—on the analysis of Dr. Dyer I paid the balance, £87 10s., making £350—I produce Dr. Dyer's analysis of July 21st, 1902—by <hi rend="italic">the Germania</hi>, on June 4th, 1902, was shipped 150 to 200 tons, part of 2,000 tons purchased, of basic slag on the same terms on June 18th—on August 4th, 1902, the defendant sold me another 1,000 tons, which I did not get—I produce the invoice of 230 tons by the <hi rend="italic">Germania.</hi> value £402 10s.—that is all first quality—I received this bill of exchange for £301 17s. 6d., drawn by the prisoner, and payable to W. Jacobs and Co., Antwerp—I paid that, and the balance on the analysis of Dr. Dyer—I sold the cargo by the <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi> to Boyd and Co., Limited, of Limerick, and the cargo of the <hi rend="italic">Eliza H.</hi> to Dixon and Cardus, of Southampton—400 of the 1,000 tons was shipped by the <hi rend="italic">Mary Sophie</hi>—these were guaranteed at 38 to 45 per cent, of phosphate of lime, and in respect of which I paid on bills of exchange at sight, dated August 25th, 1902, £262 10s., to the order of Jacobs and Co., to the Anglo-Austrian Bank in London—this cheque for £525 represents the two sales—altogether I have paid £1,937 10s. to the prisoner to the order of Jacobs and Co. for basic slag of the qualities guaranteed—with regard to that I sold to the Drogheda Company, they intimated that in consequence of the analysis they had made of the cargo it was not what was represented, and that we must take it away—they repudiated it—they called upon us to perform our contract, and to supply basic slag as contracted for—they claimed £1,400, and have issued a writ against me in the High Court, so that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190210200073"/>
               <p>my loss is considerably more than £1,937—I have estimated it at about £4,000 to £5,000, since some of the buyers have behaved very well—the Limerick and Drogheda people have emphatically repudiated the consignments—I went to Ireland and got the buyers together, saw the basic slag sent there, and took a sample from the bulk—I afterwards sent it to Dr. Dyer, labelling the bottle—I took it from the bags as they came out of the steamers—very few of the bags were marked as to whether they were 26 to 28 or 38 to 45 per cent, strength respectively—the cargo was in the warehouse at Drogheda ex <hi rend="italic">Paradox</hi>—I opened about a dozen sacks at random, filled a bottle, and afterwards handed it to Dr. Dyer in London—I afterwards had a sample drawn from the cargo ex <hi rend="italic">Marie Sophie</hi> at Dublin, and from the other consignments, and handed them to Dr. Dyer—I went to Antwerp before the negotiations, arid again' when this affair had opened up, in order to investigate the matter—I authorised official samplers, Cornelson and Co., to take samples of the cargo on the <hi rend="italic">Mark Sophie</hi> at Antwerp—I submitted those samples to Dr. Dyer—I received samples from the <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi>, kept them for the time being, and when this question arose sent them to Dr. Dyer—by the contract we were obliged to accept the sample of the official weigher appointed by Forest, but we directed a special sampler, who had no <hi rend="italic">locus</hi> under the contract—there was no suspicion at that time—the cargo on the <hi rend="italic">Eliza H</hi> was sampled by another firm—the official samplers under the contract were Nieberding and Keefer, appointed by the Chamber of Commerce or some public authority—they were acting for all concerned—Forest' applied for two payments which we refused—I sent this telegram to Forest I "Request you to come" to London, together with firm who sampled cargoes, and give us proper explanation"—he came over with. Jacobs—they attended at my office on September 20th very late in the' afternoon—I said it was a very serious matter, as to which there 'were a good many parti<lb/>culars to be gone into and analyses from cargoes, and I suggested Monday would be more convenient, as I wanted time to get all the papers together, and there were a good many of them—he came on the Monday"with Jacobs about noon—I had drawn out full particulars of each cargo,' the shipping analyses upon which we had parted with our money, and 'the actual test of each cargo as delivered, and pointed out the enormous differ<lb/>rence in each case—I took him through them seriatim, arid asked him what explanation he had to give—Jacobs acted as interpreter—he is a Belgian, but speaks English—all the bills of exchange were drawn by Forest, and made payable to Jacobs—Forest looked very uncomfortable, but could give no explanation—I told him the whole thing was a swindle from beginning to end; and I pointed out the seriousness of the position he had placed me in, and that I intended to expose the whole thing—I also told Jacobs the position I considered he stood in, that at any rate he was seriously compromised—in the mean time I consulted my solicitors', who got a warrant against Forest—I saw Jacobs the first day Forest was brought up at the Mansion House, and once since in Antwerp, but not here.</p>

               <p>was kept—a detective was in my office on the 22nd—Forest was arrested when he left the office—he has been in custody ever since—we first wrote to Forest asking for prices—I went to see Forest in May or June, and tried to find him at his office, but did not—he came to me at my hotel, where we discussed matters in previous correspondence—we asked for an arbitra<lb/>tion clause in the contract, which he refused—we agreed to the appoint<lb/>ment of official weighers and samplers at Ghent or Antwerp—one sample would be sent to me and one to Dr. Dyer—we also received certificates of the weights—we paid three-quarters against bills of lading, and the remain<lb/>ing 25 per cent, against Dr. Dyer's analysis—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Paradox</hi> cargo landed, and took samples after it was landed—I paid two visits to Drogheda—I went there after this affair opened up—I wrote the letter of July 8th to Forest complaining of the bags not having been branded, and that the quality was not according to contract, and asking for explanation, as the vessel would be on demurrage—there was considerable correspondence, but the complaints in the first instance were with regard to the bags—the basic slag when discharged from the ship was warehoused in a properly brick-built structure—we sent Giani and Muller to check the sampling of the cargo at Antwerp ex <hi rend="italic">Eliza H</hi>, and as to the <hi rend="italic">Marie Sophie</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi>, our representatives. Cornelsons, took samples and reported to us—we retained those—the samples drawn by the official samplers were sent to Dr. Dyer—we were not allowed to take samples in the <hi rend="italic">Paradox</hi> independently—samples were drawn and sent to us—we kept the samples sent to us in the office, and rested on the official samples Leing analysed till the question arose as to the quality not being according to contract—in July Mr. Brooks, the buyer for Dixon and Cardus, called at my office, but he was not present at my interview with Forest—Jacobs was there—we employed brokers to charter two or three ships—I did not consider Jacobs' business large—he was introduced to me by Forest—Jacobs was also present on September 20th and on September 22nd, when the warrant was obtained upon which Forest was arrested—I saw Nieberding and Keefer two or three weeks ago—I have taken no civil proceedings against Forest—we have put a stop on moneys, if any, which Nieberding and Keefer may hold belonging to Forest, but not upon any money he may have in any bank in Belgium, and not upon moneys belonging to Jacobs.</p>

I have a laboratory at 17, Great Tower Street—I am agricultural analyst for the districts of Bedford, Cornwall, Essex, Hants, Herts, Leicester, Richmond, and West Suffolk, and I am official analyst to the London Corn Trade Association, and Doctor of Science of the London University—I have had twenty-five years' experience in analysing agri<lb/>cultural manure—I have analysed a number of samples relating to this matter, and have issued the certificate produced of the results of my analyses—the efficacy of basic slag as a manure depends upon the fineness to which it is ground, and the percentage of phosphate of lime in it—the standard recognised of fine meal, as in this case was guaranteed, is 80 per cent.—sample Nos. 1231 and 1232 of the cargo of 150 tons ex <hi rend="italic">Paradox</hi> was delivered to me on July 4th from Messrs. Jacobs and Co., of Antwerp, on account of A. J. Forest—I found them to contain in round numbers</p>

               <p>22 and 41 per cent, of phosphate of lime and 80 and 81 per cent, of fine meal respectively—the first was poor stuff as a fertiliser, the second was slag of first-rate quality—the next samples, Nos. 1521 and 1522, I received from the Drogheda Chemical Manure Company on August 25th of cargo ex <hi rend="italic">Paradox</hi> on July 10th, sent by Edward Mullen, a sworn sampler at Drogheda—these were similar samples, but of coarse feature—they con<lb/>tained in round numbers, one 16 1/2 per cent, of phosphate and 72 per cent. of fine meal, the other 3 1/2 per cent, of phosphate and 71 per cent, of fine meal—that is not a merchantable fertiliser—the average percentage in a merchantable fertiliser is 38 to 45, and in a lower quality 30 to 35, but if it goes much below 25 it would be very difficult to dispose of when shipped, and anything like 16 would be practically unsaleable, and would not pay for the cost of transport—3 1/2 per cent, is absolute rubbish, and not worth moving—another sample, No. 1597, of cargo ex <hi rend="italic">Paradox</hi>, contained 14 per cent, of phosphate and only 60 per cent, of fine meal—that was unmerchant<lb/>able—No. 1513, cargo ex <hi rend="italic">Marie Sophie</hi>, received on August 25th from Nieberding and Keefer, by Forest's request, contained 41 per cent, of phosphate and 80 per cent, of fine meal, or basic slag of the best quality—Mr. Hollingshurst subsequently handed me sample No. 1598, drawn at Antwerp and sealed by the Bureau de Control, and that cargo contained 15 and 14 8 per cent, of phosphate, as against the 41, and only 75 per cent, of fine meal, as against the 80—I have further samples handed to me by Messrs. Hollingshurst, described as having been drawn in Dublin from consignment ex <hi rend="italic">Marie Sophie</hi>, which contained 18 per cent, of phosphate and 73 of fine meal—I cannot reconcile the samples sent by the prisoner's agents with those taken on behalf of the merchants, the former being so low as to be perfectly worthless, and which would only fetch a few shillings a ton—take, for instance, the sample No. 1489, received on August 18th from Nieberding and Keefer by order of Forest, and marked ex <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi>, taken from 130 tons;' it contained 41 per cent, of phosphate of lime and 80 per cent of fine meal; No. 1599, received on September 6th, marked ex <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi>, from 130 tons drawn for Cornelson on August 13th at Antwerp, and sealed by the Bureau de Control, Antwerp, contained 17 1/2 per cent, of phosphate and 17 and a fraction of fine meal; and No. 1274, from 200 tons of cargo ex <hi rend="italic">Eliza H.</hi>, received from Nieberding and Keefer on account of Forest, contained 41 per cent of phosphate and 80 per cent, of fine meal; whereas No. 1625, handed to me by Messrs. Hollingshurst, and marked "2,000 bags basic slag, ex <hi rend="italic">Eliza H.</hi>, Giani and Muller, Anvers, July 8th, sold G. M. Co.," contained 4 1/2 per cent. of phosphate and 27 per cent, of fine meal—that was labelled "Slag, best quality"—that is the worst sample of the bulk, and was practically un<lb/>merchantable—the proportion of phosphate of lime combined with fine<lb/>ness of grinding gives basic slag its manurial efficacy, but when the per<lb/>centage dwindles down the cost of handling is so great that the value diminishes in a rapid ratio—the effect of the richer quality would, of course, be' more lasting, but some of this poorer material would be quite useless considering the cost of transporting it.</p>

               <p>nothing to do with the quality, you can only get at the quality by analysis—the basic slag of 14 and 15 per cent would possess fertilising power, and might be used with some advantage on a farm within a few yards of its production, but would not defray the cost of carriage—basic slag is used especially on land exhausted by cultivation and sometimes almost destitute of life—I produce an analysed sample of basic slag ex <hi rend="italic">Nellie</hi>, purchased by De Pass and Co., which I sent to Mr. Jacobs, and which contained 41 per cent, of phosphate of lime and 80 per cent of fine meal—that is the best quality.</p>

Hollingshurst, and purporting to have been drawn from the bulk of the cargo ex <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi> on September 14th, 1902, contains 19 10 of phosphate of lime—that is of the minimum value—ordinary slag is sold containing 20 to 25 per cent, of phosphate—what is known as the Thomas phosphate contains 38 to 42 per cent, of phosphate—that is a merchantable quantity—I received from the Drogheda Company, from cargo ex <hi rend="italic">Paradox</hi>, samples A, B, and C—A showed 15 28, B 14 62, and C 4 47—the latter is practi<lb/>cally worthless.</p>

He asked me if I remembered meeting him in Piccadilly when I was walking with Mr. Cave I said,' Yes.' Sperrin said that Brownjohn had written to Mr. Cave demanding money for the letter he saw on my table. I asked him if he was certain, and he said Yes, it is to be sent to Knightsbridge Post Office in his own name.' He said he supposed Brownjohn would call for it. I said I should see what I. could do. I obtained permission to leave the barracks and went to the post-office to see if there was a letter, and if there was, to sign for it in my own name.

                  </hi>. I am Coroner for the County of Middle<lb/>sex—on July 8th I held an inquest on the body of Elizabeth Burden at Willesden—amongst the witnesses called was the prisoner—he was duly sworn, and I took down what he said—I have my note here: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "I reside at 288, Chapter Road, Willesden. I am Dr. Edward William Hoff<lb/>meister, Doctor of Medicine, Member of College of Surgeons. I am a registered medical practitioner. I have a partner, Dr. Dobie, who is registered and qualified. There is a doorplate with our names, as described by Mr. Burden. He asked me to see his wife. I found her suffering from inflammation of the bowels. I ordered a nurse, prescribed for her, and ordered poultices. I thought her very ill on July 2nd, the day I saw her. She gradually got worse. On Friday, July 4th, the friends, not husband, wished consultation. I agreed. I went to Dr. Bardsley and gave him my card, Dr. Hoffmeister. He refused to come or meet me. He said I was not registered or qualified. I said to him, and now swear, 'I am both.' He looked up Medical Directory. My name is not there.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190210200089"/>
               <p>That does not prove I am not qualified and registered. I have practised for some time in Willesden. The patient had inflammation of the bowels. (Recalled after Dr. Bardsley's evidence to Jurymen); I swear I am qualified and registered. I don't know why Dr. Bardsley would not meet me: I was quite willing for consultation, and I withdrew from case for benefit of Mrs. Burden"—we allow professional witnesses a special fee for attending at an inquest—the prisoner applied for and received £1 1s. for the evidence he gave on that occasion—I reminded him good-humouredly that I should bear the cost if he was an unqualified man, and asked him if he would swear that he was a qualified man, and he answered "Yes"—the Court had not risen then—I gave him the £1 1s., and he signed, "Edward William Hoffmeister," and this is the receipt.</p>

I am the husband of the deceased—some two or three months before last July she called my attention to a growth which existed in her left groin—I felt it quite often—it was intermittent, as it could be displaced by my own manipulations—otherwise my wife was in very good health—about June 27th or 28th it would be possible to find the growth occasionally, and at the end of that month, by means of manipu-lation, I caused it to disappear—on July 2nd, as far as could be seen my wife was particularly well and bright—I left the house about 8.30 a.m. and returned about 6.30 p.m., in consequence of a message—I found my wife in bed—she said she was in great pain and pointed to her abdomen—she said she could not account for that particular pain—I said we must at once send for someone—I did not examine her myself then, but went off at once to the prisoner's house at 286, Chapter Road—there was a plate on the gate and another on the door—these are the ones (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—at the time I went into the house I believed the prisoner to be a properly-qualified man, as those letters indicated—I saw the prisoner, and told him of my wife's condition—I said she had a lump on her left groin—I did not say that it disappeared from time to time—within a few minutes he came to my house and saw my wife, who was in bed—he examined her with his hands by feeling her stomach and bowels—my wife had her nightdress on—I take it that the prisoner placed his hands over her night-dress—there was no examination while I was there with his hands under her nightdress—I did not say anything as to how I had treated the lump—I remained in the room two or three minutes—the prisoner remained much longer—I think my wife's mother was there the whole time—when the prisoner came out of the room I saw him—he said he had diagnosed the complaint as inflammation of the bowels—I referred to the growth on the groin, and said, "Has it anything to do with that?"—he said that that was simply the swelling of the glands, a thing which was peculiar to men and women especially when they were fatigued or had mental anxiety, and he attributed the inflammation to a chill which my wife had taken, in going to meet her children in the rain the day previous—the prisoner did not tell me what treatment he proposed—that was about 7.30 p.m.—he left then and returned about 10 p.m. and saw my wife—I am not quite sure if I was present then—he left, and came again about twelve, and remained till one o'clock—he brought a medicine chest with him, and gave my wife</p>

               <p>some medicines—when he left he said that in consequence of the medicines he had administered he thought my wife might have an increase of pain during the night, and that if he was wanted he instructed me how to call him—I was with my wife the whole night from then—after the prisoner left she seemed very much better there was less pain, and she spoke of being able to get up by Sunday—about 2.30 a.m. there was a serious change—she had intense pain, and was most restless, and insisted upon getting up and walking about with my assistance—then was a very strong desire to evacuate the bowels, unsuccessful in every attempt—there was much straining on her part to do it, and inability—that lasted for some considerable time, and I then went to the prisoner's house—I called him through the speaking-tube, and he followed me home in about ten minutes—that was about 3 a.m.—I explained my wife's condition to him—we went into her room—he had a medicine chest—he asked for some water and he administered some medicine from the chest mixed with the water—my wife immediately vomited the medicine—further doses were administered with the same result—that vomit was succeeded later on by the vomit which we see in bilious cases, and subsequent to that there was vomiting of foecal matter—I have no recollection of seeing the prisoner examining the vomit—he left then—between 5 and 6 a.m. and almost immediately after the prisoner left, my wife became very restless again, and insisted upon getting out of bed and trying to relieve the bowels—we got her back to bed, and the pain became more intense than before—her body was twisted in agony—she was unconscious, and called out, "Take me out of the water, take me out of the water! Oh, I am so cold, take me out of the water"—her condition was so serious I felt I could not leave her to fetch the prisoner, so I sent my son—he came very quickly and administered more medicine from the same chest—she again vomited, then quieted down as before, and the prisoner left again—about 9.30 a.m. he came again—we did not then talk about what he was, but in the early morning when we had an opportunity of conversing then he spoke of his qualifications—I wondered why a gentleman of hid qualifications should be settling down in Willesden Green—he then told me he was a consulting physician to a hospital in the City, he was a Master of Surgery and D.C.L., as well as a degree with reference to a sanitary institute—at the nine o'clock interview he spoke of a partner, and said he was sending him to do the hospital work in order to enable him to give my wife more attention—I took his partner to be Dr. Dobie, having seen that name on his door-plate—between 2 and 3 a.m., he had said a fully-trained nurse should be obtained, and it was eventually decided he should procure one, and at his nine o'clock visit he told me he had wired for the nurse, and that she would be in attendance at 10.30—between 9 and 9.30 my wife was much quieter, with less pain, but vomiting occasionally—the prisoner came again about 10.30 with the nurse—they came into the room, and the prisoner indicated that in consideration of my wife's serious condition it would be absolutely necessary for everyone to be excluded from the sick-room, including myself—I acted upon those instructions, and I did not go into the room till about 10 a.m. next morning</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190210200091"/>
               <p>—about 5.30 p.m. on Thursday, the 3rd, I saw the prisoner—I think I said, "Why is there this foecal matter?" and the prisoner said he had now discovered that my wife was suffering from gall stone, that there was a possibility of a stone passing from the bladder into the bowel, and would be causing an obstruction and the offensive vomit—he said every<lb/>thing was being done that medical skill possibly could do, and that she was in a very satisfactory condition—he said he should like to call in his partner, and asked if I should object—I said, "Bring in your partner by all means, and any other medical man, if it is necessary"—I was leaving the house on the morning of the 4th and the nurse called me back and said, "You can just peep round the door, if you like, to do so"—I did so, and saw my wife lying in bed—she seemed quite calm, but when she caught sight of me she became excited, and I went to her—I left the house, and did not return till about 4 p.m.—I went straight into my wife's room—the nurse was being relieved, but a sister was in the room—my wife appeared to be in great agony, and vomiting—the same offensive odour was there—the nurse returned, and the prisoner came about 5 or 5.30—I saw him, and he said everything was satisfactory—he said the bowels had been relieved in a satisfactory manner, a thing which he had been trying to bring about for some considerable time, and that my wife's condition was very much more favourable than at any other time, that there had been a change in the vomit, and that he had, through his extra efforts, during the day, secured some of the vomit, which he had taken away and given to his partner; that his partner was so much surprised at it that they had decided to send it to the Royal <hi rend="italic">College</hi> of Surgeons or some society for analysis—he then suggested that I should see it before he sent it away, and asked me to meet him at his house about eight o'clock that night—he said my wife was certainly better, and others in the house were given to understand the same thing—I went to the prisoner's house about 8 p.m. with two members of my wife's family—I saw the prisoner—he produced a bottle of the vomit—he described it in technical terms, and said it was so vile in its character that if it was taken it would poison a dozen people—up to that time I had had absolute confidence in the prisoner—there had been a discussion as to calling in other medical advice, and my friends had accompanied me in order to broach the subject to the prisoner—he readily agreed that some other medical man should be called in, and my brother-in-law's doctor was suggested, that is Dr. Bardsley—the arrangement was that the prisoner should go himself to Dr. Bardsley and bring him to the house—I returned to my house and saw the nurse—I did not see my wife then—the nurse gave me a note and asked me to take or send it to the prisoner—I handed it to the prisoner—he read it and said, "Tell nurse I will be there in ten minutes"—I returned home, and in about ten minutes I was followed by the prisoner—he went into the sick-room, and remained there five or ten minutes—he came out and said to me that in consequence of the change which had taken place he did not feel justified in waiting for Dr. Bardsley, and asked me to take his card and go to Dr. Bardsley and ask him to come down and meet him there—I went to Dr. Bardsley and gave him the prisoner's message and card—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190210200092"/>
               <p>Dr. Bardsley did not return with me—on my return I saw the prisoner and told him Dr. Bardsley would not come, the reason being that Dr. Bardsley had heard that the prisoner was not a qualified man, and could only come if the prisoner would give up the case or otherwise wait upon Dr. Bardsley himself and assure him he was on the Medical Register—the prisoner said he would wait on Dr. Bardsley himself, and he left the house saying he would be back in twenty minutes—he returned in a short time and said in consequence of his having practised in South Africa Dr. Bardsley would not recognise him—I said, "But surely you pointed out to Dr. Bardsley that you are on the English Register?"—he said, "Yes; but notwithstanding that he will not recognise me, and in order that the patient should have attendance I will retire from the case"—he did not say any more except to request me to pay the nurse and meet his account when he sent it in—he then left, taking the things which belonged to him—within a short time Dr. Bardsley arrived, and a short time after his arrival my wife died—I should think it would be about ten o'clock, but the time is uncertain.</p>

I am physician to St. Mary's Hospital and lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence there—I have read the depositions in this case very carefully—I have been present during the examination of Mr. Burden—this is my report: (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the cause of death was evidently strangulated hernia followed by rupture of the intestine owing to the strangulation not being relieved; that the bowel had become strangulated on the afternoon of July</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd, and was allowed to remain in that condition until death took place about fifty-three hours afterwards; that if the strangulation had been recognised within twenty-four or thirty-six hours of its occurrence, as it undoubtedly could have been by anyone possessing ordinary medical skill and knowledge, and then treated according to the recognised method for so common an occurrence, the life would almost certainly have been saved; that the methods of treatment of strangu<lb/>lated hernia are first to attempt to push back the strangulated gut by pressure, and if at the end of half-an-hour such pressure should prove unsuccessful in the reduction of the strangulation, to perform the operation of dividing the tissues which have strangulated the gut; that this operation if per<lb/>formed within twenty-four hours of the strangulation is a safe one, and is always followed by relief of the strangulation and of its accompanying distressing symptoms; that the signs and symptoms of strangulated hernia were extremely well marked in the deceased's case, and could not have escaped easy recognition by any qualified medical man; that they were</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> A lump in the groin is not an indication of inflammation of the bowel—it only occurs in one condition and that is hernia—the eyes should be employed in an examination of this kind, and the hand should be employed to push the lump back into its position—a desire to be relieved accompanied by straining, and that followed by the three characters of vomit, are not indications of inflammation of the bowels—strangulated hernia is the most common obstruction of the bowels which is met with—manipulation is the only treatment anyone knowing the condition of things would undertake.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been surveyor to the Walthamstow District Council three years—they employ a number of labourers and horses and carts also contractors to do carting work, selected by the road fore<lb/>man, who in this case was Foster—the road foreman supplies the contractor with sheets similar to these produced, which contain columns for places where anything is carted from, time of departure, sender's signature, the place where the material is to be taken, the time of arrival, the receiver's signature, and a description of the materials carted, and at the top a blank to put in the name of the owner of the cart, and a space opposite the words "Carman's name"—the sheet is headed "Cartage Sheet," and is the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190210200107"/>
               <p>property of the Council—the sheet should be filled up by the contractor's carman—in many cases, where practicable, they are initialled by the Council's gangers or district sweepers on the roads—men are allotted to each district—when filled up the sheet should go to the time keeper, who is a witness—in No. 1 (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) "8 1/2 hours" is put in by the road foreman, Foster, and these are his initials—he allocates the work to the different parts—the figures and the letters in blue are placed there by the time<lb/>keeper, who relies on the certificate of the road foreman—in practice, the sheets usually come back to the road foreman before they pass to the timekeeper—the twenty sheets produced are initialled"J. F." by Foster, which indicates that he certifies that work as having been done—the number of hours are stated on each sheet by Foster—I know his writing—that is not in accordance with the practice, which is for the carman to fill it in—the body of the document should be in the carman's writing—they should reach the road foreman at the end of the day—he should hand them to the time-keeper, George Basham, who issues tickets like these produced, having a filled-up counterfoil in the book—if the time-keeper received a sheet certified by Foster it would be his duty to make out a ticket, or the ticket may apply to two or three sheets—the custom is to include all the work done by one contractor, in one ticket—the contractor's account, which he sends in later, should be in accordance with the counterfoiled tickets—there was a counterfoil and a ticket in respect of all this work—the Council have from time to time hired a team from Furbank—that was so in May and June—Foster engaged him—all the men on the roads were under Foster—he was furnished with a vehicle to go about the districts and supervise what was going on—he had charge of all the gangs of men working, and inspected the sweepers' work, and got information from the gangers, to whom he would refer for the hours, and not to the con<lb/>tractors' men—he would be guided by the initials of the ganger or other official of the Council, on the sheets—these sheets Nos. I to 20 are not filled up in the ordinary way—No. 11<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi> is except that it is not signed by the road foreman—that is not disputed—the other sheets produced which are not disputed have the initials of the gangers—the disputed sheets are not filled up in detail—two of the undisputed sheets produced are filled up by carmen in detail—Foster left the service of the Council on Saturday. June 28th, having given a month's notice—shortly, afterwards my atten<lb/>tion was directed to some of these sheets—I noticed that the sheets were wholly in the handwriting of the road foreman, Foster, and that they appeared to have been disfigured—there are dirty marks upon them, which show that they are not <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>, but that they are purposely dis<lb/>figured—11a, which is genuine, shows that it has been folded up and placed in the carman's pocket, and does not correspond with those pro<lb/>duced and Nos. 7 to 20, which are initialled only by the road foreman, who has also put the number of hours in each case and there is matter on each sheet which appears to be in Foster's disguised writing—take, for instance, in No. 5, of May 7th, there is "Five loads scavenging "'on the right of the sheet—I say the same person has written it, but in a disguised writing—that is picking up the material scraped and collected by the</p>

The contractors may make out their bills from the time tickets; I did not tell them to do that, it was not my business—from twelve to twenty contractors are employed—the sheets were checked by the road foreman and handed to the time-keeper—the system now is not the same—the road foreman has in practice entered the names of the con<lb/>tractor and the carman—gangers are expected to initial where it is possible or get someone to do it for them if they cannot write, but the majority of the men can write—the system is still the same with regard to that—Furbank has been a working man—he now has a number of carts, and does other than the Council's work—he may take his entries from the time tickets if he accepts them as accurate—I believe the evidence is that Furbank made up his accounts from the time-tickets—in these bona-fide sheets the road fore<lb/>man's signature is not put except at the commencement of the day—it should have his initials—that is an irregularity—Foster's writing is well-known—I have said before to-day that some of Foster's writing was dis<lb/>guised—I am not sure that I said so before the Magistrate—you will find it on the disputed sheets—the rest of his writing is natural—the road foreman ought not' to fill up the sheets in the morning, but merely head them to indicate where he wanted the work done—the total number of hours are entered by the road foreman later in the day—this one refers to carting sand, the number of loads is put on, but every load is clearly indicated, and there are the signatures of the sender and the receiver, and the hour it is sent off and the hour it arrives—that is filled up and properly explained by the road foreman—I do not think Foster was asked to explain the sheets.</p>

I live at 15, Mayfield Road, Walthamstow, and am a ganger of the Forest District—looking at the sheet for May 16th, Fur<lb/>bank's carman Battershill did not do that work—the Council's own men were picking up in that district that day—I know the land of the Law Lands Company—I never knew of a shoot there—I have been employed there a year and eight months—referring to sheet for May 7th, Goodrich Road is out of my district, but I know the other work was not done by Battershill, nor was the work on the sheet for May 9th, nor, except as to Pretoria Avenue, on May 22nd—the Council's own men were engaged on those days on those roads.</p>

"I meant to do it," or, "I meant to take it," and with that he raised this bottle (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) to his mouth, which I snatched away—I thought he was going to drink the contents of the bottle—he then went and sat down in the arm chair, and I hid the bottle and glass—soon afterwards I told him I was going out, and we both went out together, but parted at the door—I afterwards took the bottle and the glass to the police.</p>

On September 19th I went to 22, Love Lane, Stockwell, in consequence of letters I received—I saw Mrs. Frost—she gave the name of Eleanor Greener—I told her that I heard that a child had been ill treated there in the garret—she asked me into the kitchen and produced four children, and gave me their ages, one was eleven—she said, "I do keep Edith in the garret sometimes when she stays away from school; I do not lock the door, and she always has plenty of food: she can come down stairs"—I was satisfied with the appearance of the girl and went away—on October 10th I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) and went there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190210200125"/>
               <p>between twelve and one in the day—I said, "Mrs. Greener, I understand your daughter Edith is dead and that you did not produce her to me on September 19th when I came"—she said, "I told you a lie, but I will tell the truth now; I am not married to Mr. Greener, we are only living to<lb/>gether; it was Kate I showed you instead of Edith, Edith came out of the Norwood school about sixteen months ago; I have not had a doctor to her; she was not ill, only in a consumption; she was all right up to September, when she became queer one Sunday, and on Monday I took her down-stairs to the kitchen and nursed her; she got worse about one o'clock, and I sent my husband for Dr. Hook, but she died before he got here; I showed her to Mrs. Ball, and she watched her; she was not neglected, and she had the same food as we had"—at that moment Greener came in, and I said, "Mr. Greener, I want to see you about your daughter Edith"—he showed her to me—the bed and bedding where she slept were filthily dirty and covered with vermin, and mice were on the sheets—I called his attention to that, and he said, "I know the house is buggy"—he said, "The child has been consumptive from birth; the mother died from consumption; I did not call in a doctor because I knew it was no use; I took the child out of the Norwood school sixteen or seventeen months ago, and she was fed the same as the other children; it is true we are not married; I am only living with Mrs. Frost; she was consumptive, and all the children are so more or less; I am sorry you were not allowed to see the child when you called"—I made a note at the time and have got it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When she said "I did tell you a lie," she added, "I did not do it wilfully"—I did not say"I have come about a case of neglect"; I said, "I have come to see your daughter Edith"—I was in uniform—I have had a great deal of experience in these houses, and find vermin in a great many instances—that arises from want of cleanliness—I expected to see Edith a girl of about 7 1/2—I' never saw her alive—in some cases I expect to find the poor, ignorant about diseases—Frost appeared very sorry on the second occasion—I have seen the other children and have nothing to complain of about any of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fully qualified medical man, of 124, London Road, Clapham—I attended Mrs. Frost in her confinement last May twelve months, and was attending her previous to the death of this child—I have been told that I saw this child three or four years ago, but not recently till October—I attended Mrs. Frost in September, but she did not call my attention to this child, I did not know that it was in existence—on October 6th, Greener called on me and I followed him immediately and saw the child dead—I made a post mortem exami<lb/>nation two days afterwards, it weighed 12 lbs. 10 ozs.; the standard weight of a child of that age is 2 stone 30 lb—it was emaciated, there was a total absence of fat—the cause of death was general emaciation, and it would have required medical attendance for two months before—that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190210200126"/>
               <p>would be apparent to the father and mother and every body I did not see the child's bed, but I heard it described at the inquest, and the child's sleeping in that condition would be likely to injure its health—its hair was dirty and verminous, there were flea bites on its body—care and soap and water would have kept its head and body free.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is not an uncommon thing to find vermin; many houses have them before people go: into them, and it is sometimes very difficult to remove them; they get into the woodwork and boards of the house—I do not recollect the weight given by the nurse when the child left the school—I heard that the child had gained only 4lbs. between the ages of 5 and 6 1/2, and that she was suffering from catarrh and rickets, and from birth from tuberculosis—4 lbs. is not much to gain in sixteen months; that would show a diseased condition—when she left the hospital she showed signs of emaciation—a child suffering from tuberculosis from birth, would be like a living skeleton from the commencement—I should have given it Valentine's jam, and cream, and fresh air, and meat juice to give it any opportunity of improving—I might have saved the child if I had been called in—I said before the Magistrate, "I do not think her life could have been saved, but it might have been prolonged if those nourishing foods had been given her, and she might have been put on cod-liver oil—poor people in their position are very ignorant of disease, and when organic disease is put before them they take it as helpless, that nothing more can be done—I discovered a quantity of undigested food in the stomach which must have been administered about two hours before death—I also found fluid in the stomach, it did not appear to be Bovril, it was more like broth—there was a certain quantity of nourishing food besides the solids, and the mucous membrane was healthy—that I think would indicate that the child had been regularly fed with nutritious food, otherwise she would have been in a more unhealthy condition undoubtedly—I cannot say what age she would have looked when alive—I do not think there was anything wrong in the treatment of the other children—there was very marked evidences of catarrh—she would present the appearance to an unskilled eye of a half-starved child—according to Weldon's diary, the normal weight when it left the Norwood school' should be 3 stone 11 lbs., therefore its weight then was nearly 50 per cent, below the normal weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> That would also be from dirt, and irregular feeding and unkindness—when the child left the infirmary, discharged from the Norwood school, the nurse said that she weighed 1 stone 7 lbs, and she was a year and four months younger then than when I made the post mortem, and it weighed 12 lbs. 10 ozs.—a child in that condition of health would require special care; any ordinary person could see that—flea-bites and nits would add to the suffering of a delicate child, and also being shut up in a garret—I could have alleviated its sufferings—I ordered for Mrs. Frost, bovril and boiled fish—she did not say that she had not the means to get it—she was able to pay for the medicines and for her medical attend<lb/>ance—she did not complain that she had no money to have the child or herself attended to.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 71, Gauden Road, Clapham, and am the prisoner's wife—I have two children—my husband has been a clerk in Somerset House for eleven years—on September 6th I had been out with the children and returned home between 5 and 6 o'clock—I undressed them to put them to bed and took them into the kitchen—I left them for a little time, and when I returned I found my husband trying to strangle the boy, who is 3 1/2 years old—he was an ideal husband and a good father—he was in an Asylum for six months in 1900.</p>
