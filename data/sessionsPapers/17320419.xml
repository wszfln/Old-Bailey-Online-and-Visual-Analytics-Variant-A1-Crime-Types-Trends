It was a Moon-light Night, the Moon was at full, and very little clouded, so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173204190003"/> that I could see them clearly. The Prisoner, who was one of them, came up to me, and said, Stand and deliver, or you are a dead Man. I told him I had no Money, when presently another of them came behind me and knock'd me down. I cry'd out, and they repeated their Blows, so that I received 2 contused Wounds, and thought they had fractur'd my Skull. Then one of them took my Hat, and another my Wig, and the Prisoner examin'd all my Pockets, but he could not well get his Hand to the bottom of my Breeches Pocket, because in the Posture I lay my Knees were bent under me, so that I lost no Money; it was in a bye Place. I made a groaning Noise, and at last somebody open'd a Window, upon which they beat me again and made off. I got up, the two others escaped, but the Prisoner was not out of my Sight before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I ask you before the Justice if it was I that bid you stand? and you said No.</p>
               <p>Wiseman. I remember no such Question.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I ask you if I took your Hat and Wig? and you said No.</p>

            , Exciseman. About Ten at Night as I was going on my Duty in Ratcliffe-Highway, about 40 Yards from Virginia-street, I heard a cry of stop Thief, and saw 3 Men running different ways, and one of them who was the Prisoner coming towards me on the shady side of the way, I seiz'd him suddenly. He ask'd me what I meant by it? I told him, if he was not the Man, he might easily vindicate himself. The Prosecutor soon came up, very bloody, and charged him with the Robbery.</p>
               <p>Justice Phillips. When the Prisoner was brought before me, he deny'd the Robbery stifly. I ask'd him what Business he had near Virginia-street? He said he had been to see one Will Fleming at the Hercules-Pillar's, which lies anquitt contrary way, and had been shut up this Twelve month. Somebody that stood by me, said, that the Prisoner was the Man who was made an Evidence last Sessions, and gave the Parsons the Name of Smallcoal men*. This Instrument was found in his Pocket, one part of it is a Saw that will cut an Iron-bar, another is a Sharp Knife, and a third a Tool that they call a Mobock. He was so impudent, that when I order'd his Hat to be taken off, he threatned to swear a Robbery against me. The Prosecutor had two contused Wounds in his Head.</p>
               <p> *See the Sessions Paper, Number 3. pag. 89. </p>
               <p>Prisoner. That Instrument is for no use in the World, but to cut Cock-spurs with; 'tis a Cock-fighting Tool.</p>

               <p>Court. Are you certain as to the Time?</p>
               <p>Parker. Yes: For I was in Smithfield with my Sheep at 3 o'Clock, and I thought to get to Uxbridge that Night. I am a Sales-man; I live at Ailsbury, and come to Smith-field Mondays and Fridays. I have returned Thousands of Pounds in Smithfield. I never was pick'd up by such Cattle in my Life. I am sure it happen'd a bad Accident Thing for me; for I work hard, and have a great Family.</p>
               <p>Wentland. I never saw this Man in my Life, till he and 3 more Men with him, charged me with the Fact; and then he offer'd to make it up for 5 Guineas.</p>
               <p>Parker. They Arrested me in a false Action for 30 l. to hinder my coming to Prosecute, as this Man knows.</p>

            , Coach-man. I was drinking at the George Ale-house in Holbourn, where the Prosecutor came in betwixt 6 and 7 in the Morning, and said he had lost his Money the Night before. I asked him, where? And he said, he could not tell, but he believed it was at the Barley-Mow. Mr. Burkitt and I went over the Way with him to the Unicorn Brew-House, and there he saw a Woman with a Pail of Beer in her Hand, and he said, he believed it was she that had got his Money. From thence he crossed the Way again to the Barley-Mow, near the End of Red Lion-Street, and asked, if he had not been there over Night? Yes, says the Man of the House, I believe you was, and that you came afterwards, and made a great Noise.</p>

Ye Bitch you, says I, you're mistaken in your Man; I'm not for your Turn. I had hardly spoke, when another Woman took hold of me, and cry'd, Hip! when immediately the Prisoner came up, with a Stick in his Hand, and holding it over me, God damn your Blood, says he, if you offer to resist, or speak a Word, I'll knock you down. With that the 2d Woman began to rifle me, and took 2 Half-Guineas out of my Pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. O you wicked Man! how can you swear so falsly? I am above 60 Years of Age, and never did an ill Thing in my Life.</p>
               <p>Saxon. I swear nothing but the Truth: He stood over me with a Stick all the while the Woman was searching my Pockets. At last I thought I might as well lose my Life as my Money, and seeing a little Light at a Distance, I called Watch! Watch! Upon which, the Prisoner and the 2 Women endeavour'd to make off, but the Watch coming up, they were all taken and carried to the Watch-house. I know not how it came about, but the Watchmen let him go. I happen'd to see him again next Day, by the Waterside: He presently took Boat, and I took another, but he got among the Ships, and so I lost Sight of him at that Time. About a Fortnight after, as I was drinking at an Alehouse, a Man came and told me that the Prisoner was at the Compter-Gate ; upon which I got a Constable, and seized him a second Time, and so he was committed to the Compter. But some how or other he found Means<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173204190008"/> to get out again; whether by precuring common Bail, or by what other Means I know not. But a Fortnight ago, I heard where his Lodging was, and took him a third Time.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you ask this Witness any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I overtook my Wife and another Woman with the Prosecutor in Leadenball-street, and he ask'd her to do so and so - but I don't know what it was; they had been at the Pewter Pot together, but -</p>
               <p>Court. You are not now to go upon your Defence, you shall have Opportunity for that when the other Witnesses against you have given their Evidence; but if you have any Questions to ask this Witness, you may now propose them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray my Lord, ask him if I offer'd to strike him?</p>
               <p>Saxon. Yes; you threatned to knock me down if I made any Resistance.</p>

A Fortnight ago, as I sat in the Warehouse, the Prosecutor and 2 Men came in between 10 and 11 at Night, and desir'd some Assistance to search for the Prisoner, who they had heard was some where in the Neighbourhood. I sent 2 Watchmen, and they went and brought him in. He staid in the Watch-house all Night, and next Morning he was carried before the Justice, and charged with the Robbery. He said, If Saxon swears this against me I shall be a dead Man; but I will make away with myself before I'll be hang'd.</p>

My Lord, I'll tell you the whole Truth as I hope to be saved ; I had been at Chelsea, and coming home between 9 and 10 at Night, in Leadenball street, I saw a Watchman with the Prosecutor and my Wife, and another Woman. I had got a great Cold, and was coughing as I came towards them. My Wife knew my Cough, and said, Here's my Husband. What's the Matter? says I, Why, says she, this Man charges me with picking his Pocket of 2 Half-Guineas. Upon that, as soon as ever the Prosecutor sees me, he catches hold of my Arm, and says, I charge you too. And so we all were taken to the Watch-house, and there the Constable ask'd him who it was that pick'd his Pocket? and he said, it was that other Woman. And then says the Constable, Why do you charge this Man and his Wife? I can't swear nothing against them, says he. Why then, says the Constable, they may go about their Business. With all my Heart, says he; and so we were discharged. The Prosecutor met me afterwards, as I was going on Board an India-man, and followed me a little Way, but then he turned back again. After that he met my Wife and the other Woman, and took them before Sir

She was in the Compter six Weeks, and when I went to see her there, he heard of it, and had me taken up. I am sixty Years of Age and better, and if any Man will say that I have committed the least Crime in all my Life, I desire to dye; and if I have ever committed any Crime, may I never be received into the Kingdom of Heaven.

               <p>Daniel Perry. I went out to work about 6 in the Morning, and left Edward Favin in the House. About 9 I came home for some Tools, I met with a Man at my Gate, and stood talking with him for some time. When I went to open the Gate it was made fast within side; but the back Door was open, and so I got in, and found my House had been broke. I got some Neighbours to my Assistance, and we went in search after the Rogues from one Place to another, till we came to Grass-Farm-Wood, about 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, and there they were taken with several of the Goods upon them. Upon Phillips we found a pair of Buckskin Breeches, a pair of Stockings, a Shirt, a Hat, and a Wig that belong'd to

               <p>Phillips. I found the Goods in a Ditch.</p>
               <p>Edward Favin. I lodged at Daniel Perry's; he left me in the House when he went to work, and I staid but a few Minutes behind, and then I lock'd the Doors fast, and left the Key at his Daughter's in the Neighbourhood, where it us'd to be left. About 9 I heard that the House was broke open, and so I came home, and found that a Pane of Glass had been taken down, and the middle Part of the Window-Frame pull'd out, and so they got into the House. The Lock of my Chest was broke, and all my Cloaths taken away. We pursued the Prisoner up and down for 4 or 5 Miles, and at last took them in Grass-Farm-Wood, with Part of the Goods upon them.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they say how they came by them?</p>
               <p>Favin. I heard Hurst confess before the Justice, that he got into the House first, and then let in Phillips.</p>

She told me, That as she was sitting upon the Vault something had forc'd from her. I went immediately for a Midwife, who came in half a Quarter of an Hour and examin'd her, and said, there had been a Child. We got her to Bed, and then took a Candle and look'd down the Vault, where I saw the Leg of a Child, or something like a Leg; for in the Surprize I was in, I hardly knew what was what.</p>

We were forc'd to cut off her Cloaths; for she was so bad that we had not Time to undress her to put her to Bed. I ask'd her how this Disaster happen'd? She could hardly speak then; but after some time, she said, As I hope to be saved I had no Notice of my Labour, but thought it was only the Cholick when I went to the Vault, and while I sat there I had but oe Pain ; a forcing Pain that brought down the Child from me, and I was in such Disorder and Surprize, that I could not stir my self if it had been to have saved my Life.</p>

Did she tell you that she had a Child? Midwife. Yes; and I asked her whose Child it was? and she said her Husband's. Court. Was this before or after you had examined her? Midwife. It was after; for she was swooning away and dying, and not able to speak before. Court. Do you think it was likely the Child should come from her in such a Manner? Midwife. Yes; I took the Child up and wash'd it. Court. Did you see any Marks or Bruises? Midwife. No; it was clear. Court. And full grown? Midwife. Yes.</p>

She said he had lodged and boarded there for 2 Years, and had paid her but for 6 Weeks; but tho' he was poor, she believ'd he was honest. Sometime after, Mrs. Collier told me she intended to buy a Parcel of Tea, and desired me to go with her, and give her my Judgment of it. While we were talking the Prisoner came in. I ask'd Mrs. Collier if she could spare Money enough to buy so much Tea as she spoke of? Yes, Madam, says she, I have receiv'd 6l. of my Dividend. You shan't want Money, says the Prisoner, I'll lend you 5 l. You lend me 5 l. says she, You may as well pretend to lend me 50 l. By God, Madam, but I will, says he, and I'll be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173204190011"/> damn'd if I don't. Wednesday the 16th of Feb. was the Day agreed on to buy the Tea. Before I went out I saw that every thing was in Order; my Desk stood in a sore Room on the Ground-floor, and I had a large Box, I believe it weigh'd about 80lb. in my Bed-Chamber. In my Desk I had 16 Guineas, a Spanish Piece of 36s. and a half Broad-piece of 12 s. 6 d. a Pocket-Book that gave an Account of Mr. Huxley's Mortgage, a Reading-glass, 2 Wills of mine (one was a Duplicate) and a Paper on which was a Memorandum of the Numbers and Value of 3 Bank Notes. In the Box were a Silver Coffee-pot, Mr. Huxley's Mortgage, all the Writings of my Family and Hereditary Estate, and there 3 Bank Notes. I lock'd my Desk and my Box, took the Keys in my Pocket, and went out with Mrs. Collier about Noon. The Prisoner, the Maid, my Daughter, and an old infirm Gentlewoman were left at home. I return'd between 4 and 5, and was surpriz'd to see my Child look very much disorder'd and frighted. I ask'd her what was the Matter? and she told me I had been robb'd, my Box of Writings carried away, and my 'Scrutore broke open. How could this be? says I, You may be sure, Madam, says the Prisoner, that they got in at the Window. I went to the Window to look. 'Tis impossible, says I, that any Body could get over these Palisades, and a cross this wide Airey into the Parlour. For God's Sake, Madam, says the Prisoner, don't spend your Time in considering which Way your Goods were lost, but how you may get them again. Had you any Bank Notes in your Box? I told him I had Three. Then, says he, lose no Time, but let's go immediately to the Bank and give Notice. I look'd in my 'Scrutore for the Memorandum of those Bills, but that Paper was gone too. We went to Mr. Crouch at the Bank, who took the Numbers of the 2 Notes that were in my Name, which I remember'd, but the Number of the other, which was payable to Mr. Walde, I had forgot. I gave Bond for the former 2 Notes. In going to the Bank I met my Son John, and desired him to wait for me without. As I found I should stay a pretty while in the Bank, I sent the Prisoner out to desire my Son not to go without me, but bid him not tell my Son what had happen'd. The Prisoner, went and returned to me again. When I had done my Business at the Bank, we came out together, and my Son went home with us. I was too much disordered to sleep that Night, and so I chose to sit up. The Prisoner was very officions in offering his Service to set up with me, and told me he did not doubt but I would hear of my Writings again. And all this while I did not suspect him in the least. I desired him to go with me next Morning to my Friend Mr. Ashton, an Attorney in Surry street, to ask his Advice. As we went out ('twas 5 a Clock) I could not forbear looking at the Palisades. Lord, Madam, says he, 'tis an easy Matter for a Man to get over here ; and with that he laid his Hands upon the Rails, and made an Offer to jump, but came away without getting over. As we were going along he said to me, Never fear, Madam, for by God I'll help you to your Writings again. When we came into Lincolns-Inn-Fields, I could not restain from Tears. He ask'd me why I cry'd? I told him I had no Money left. Don't be so concern'd, Madam, says he, for I shall receive some Money next Week, and I'll lend you 30 or 40 l. if you want it. Then it was that I began to suspect him, for I knew he was very poor. When I had consulted with Mr. Ashton, my Suspicion encreas'd, but I thought I must play cunning to get my Box of Writings, which were of far more Value to me than the Money and Notes that I had lost, and therefore I was afraid to take him up. I desired him to draw up an Advertisement for the News-Papers: He wrote one, but did not like it when it was done, because Mrs. Collier's Name was in it, which, he said, it would not be proper to mention, and so he drew up another. He told me, however, there was no need of advertising it at all; for, says he, If you will but follow Discipline ( those were his Words) I'll find your Box again. He went out with my Son under pretence of looking after the Writings, and at Night when he came home, he said he had been abroad upon the hunt, and there were People in the World, and they talk'd about the Box, but they were upon very high Terms, they talk'd of 200l. You talk of People, says I, and they, and they! for God's Sake who are they? Nay, says he, there must be no naming of Names, but if you would get your Box again you must follow Discipline. I was very much provok'd, and thought of taking out a Warrant; but on Saturday Morning I receiv'd this Letter by the Petty-Post, which (by comparing the Hand with these Advertisements which I saw him write) I believe was written by him.</p>

She appear'd much concern'd. The Prisoner came in, and said to me, Madam, don't be uneasy, I have got a Letter here, says I, that was sent me Yesterday ; pray, Madam, read it, says he, which I did, but I read two Words wrong on purpose to see if he would take Notice of it, for Merchantilin, I read Merchandizing, and Principle for Precipice; he took no Notice of the first, but said the second was wrong, the Word should be Precipice ; Madam, says he, which is as much as to say, they stood in great Danger, for its a dangerous thing to help People to stolen Goods, and those that deal that way have been very cautious in it ever since

               <p>S. Calf. I came home one Night about 10 from Dr. Harris's, and as soon as the Prisoner saw me, he said, Lord, Madam, I'm frighted out of my Wits, how came you to leave your Bureau unlock'd ? How came you to know it was unlok'd ? says I. Why, Madam, says he, I happen'd to go into your Room, tho' I can't think what Business I had there; nor I neither, says I, except you went on purpose to see whether it was lock'd or no. This was two Weeks before I was robb'd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did you lock the Coffee-Pot in that Box? S. Calfe. It was always put there when not in use. Prisoner. Have you not charged your Sons with the Robbery, and in particular your younger Son? Did you not say to me at the Bank, take Notice of this Villain, 'tis he that has robb'd me?</p>
               <p>S. Calfe. No, I only bid you tell him that I would speak with him. Prisoner. Will you swear that you never charged them both, or at least one of them with this Fact? And that you did not say that no Body else could make use of the Writings?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did you never say that your Son had robb'd you of a Pair of Snuffers, a Ring, and a Piece of Money? S. Calf. My Son was a little too saucy and refractory, and I only said I thought it was strange how the Ring should be gone. Prisoner. Have you not told me you was afraid your Son would rob you, and cut your Throat? And have you not desired me to sit up with you to prevent it?</p>
               <p>S. Calfe. My Son is but a Boy of 19; he is indeed, as I said, apt to be pretty saucy, and had behaved himself one Night in a manner that did not become him; upon which I told him I would bear his Insolence no longer, and so desired the Prisoner to turn him out of Doors.

            . About Noon my Mamma and Mrs. Collier went out together, Mrs. Collier had Orders for her Maid to go out at Two, which the Maid did, and soon after a Man came to the Door, and told me, my Mamma was Sick at the Fountain Tavern, and desir'd me to come to her immediately. I ask'd the Prisoner what I had best to do? He said, he would have me go by all means, and if my Mamma was not there, I could but come back again. So I went about half an Hour past Two, and left none but the Prisoner and an old Gentlewoman at Home. My Mamma was not at the Tavern, and so I return'd Home at Hour past Three. Mrs. Collier's Maid let me in (she came Home while I was out) and I found my Mamma's Apartment in a dismal Condition, the Windows were open, and the Curtains drawn; the Desk was broke open, and the Chips of it lay about the Floor. The Prisoner was below in the Kitchen, I call'd him up, and shew'd him what had happen'd ; he said he could not imagine how it could be done, and he not hear any thing of it, for he had been in the two Pair of Stairs Room all the time. I was very much frighted, and desir'd him to go with me to see if any Thieves were about the House. We look'd in every Room, but could see no Body, and then I pray'd him to stay with me ( for I was still afraid to be left alone) till my Mamma came home. He said, that soon after I was gone out, two Men like Sailors knock'd at the Door, and ask'd for my Mamma, and that he told them my Mamma was not within. A little before my Mamma went out, I saw the Prisoner using a Hammer to knock up a Brass Nail to hang the Brush on in the Parlour, and then he took the Hammer away with him; and when my Mamma's Box was found in the Cock-lost, that Hammer was lying upon it. My Mamma came Home between Four and Five.</p>

I waited an Hour in the Bank-Yard, when the Prisoner came, and said my Mother would not have me go without her, that she had been robb'd of her Writings, among which was a Mortgage-Deed of Mr. Huxley's, and some Bank Notes, on which Account my Mother was now at the Bank.</p>

               <p>Bryan Ambler. On Saturday Night about 9 a Clock, as I was in a back Room behind my Shop, I heard a noise, and coming forward, I saw my Boy struggling with Scott (the least of the Prisoners) and he told me that Scott had held him, while another ran away with the Hat.</p>

            . While I was behind the Counter, Scott came into the Shop, and ask'd, what was a Clock? and Whitesides was behind him. Scott clapp'd his Hand on the Flap of the Counter, and held it down, that I should not lift it up to come out, and at the same time Whitesides snatch'd a Hat off the Counter, and ran away with it, and Scott went after him, but I stopt Scott before he had got to the next Door, and got him into the Shop again; I think Whitesides is the other Person, but I cannot swear positively to him.</p>

               <p>Richard Trigtoe. In the first Place, I live at the Prince's Bagnio in Bolton-street, in Long-Acre, and on Easter-Monday, about 11 at Night, I went into Drury-Lane for a Coach. I stood opposite to <placeName id="t17320419-40-crimeloc200">Holsford-Alley</placeName>

Won't you go and see my Lodgings? says she. Why I don't care it I do, says I; for tho' she was a Stranger to me, I did not know what Business she might have with me, and so I went with her 5 or 6 Yards down the Alley, into a House, and up one pair of Stairs, and there she wanted me to treat her with a Dram. I told her I did not care for drinking; but she said I might give her one, however, for she could drink if I could not. I told her, I was not so d isposed. I staid 30 Minutes with her, and discoursed about one thing and another, and then I found I was got into a lewd, disorderly House, and therefore I did not care to tarry any longer; and so, just as I was about to go, she catches hold of my Chain, pulls my Watch out of my Breeches, and puts it into her own Pocket. I demanded my Watch again, but says she, I wish I may be damn'd to Eternity if you ever have it, except you give me a Guinea. I reason'd the Case with her, and told her, the Watch was none of her Right, and therefore I would have it again. But it signify'd nothing, for she would not give it me. And so as I was going down-stairs she call'd several Men Names, Jack! Tom! Dick! but I got out of Doors, and she follow'd. I turn'd to the Right and she to the Left. I took an Opportunity and seiz'd her at the End of Wild-street. She cry'd out Murder! Fire ! Watch! The Watchmen came and quieted the Broil, and took us away, but I never got my Watch again.</p>

            , Constable. Between 11 and 12, the Prisoner and Prosecutor were brought to me by 2 Watchmen: He charged her with forcibly pulling a Watch out of his Pocket, and saying, She would not deliver it without a Guinea. He was sober, but she seem'd to be a little fuddled.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Prosecutor met me in Colstons-Court, and said, Will you go with me my Dear? No, says I, I am going to Bed. But at last we agreed, and he carried me into House in the Court, Number 18. When we came up-stairs, he told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173204190017"/> me, he had lost his Watch; he treated me with a Dram, and when he was going, he said, Now, my Dear, good Night. But as I lighted him down, he charged me with taking his Watch.</p>

               <p>Mr. Matthews. On Friday the 13th of August last, in the Afternoon, I was driving with my Wife in a one Horse Chaise from London to Finchly ; as I passed by Highgate Church I looked at the Dial, and observ'd it wanted a Quarter of 7. There are 2 Ways down the Hill from <placeName id="t17320419-43-crimeloc213">Highgate</placeName>

They were both on Foot, and I thought it a little odd for one of them to be in the Horse-way; but as it was a publick Road, and there being 2 or 3 Women and a Boy just by, I was the less apprehensive of being attack'd. I drove forward, the black Man was soon at my Horse's head, and took hold of the right Rein, and cry'd, Stop! Stop! At first I thought something about the Horse was out of Order, but I was soon undeceived The Man in the fair Wig jumpt from the Causeway, and (like an Arrow out of a Bow) was instantly at the left Side of my Horse; he took hold of the left Rein, when the black Man clapping a Pistol to my Belly, swore and cursed, and bid me deliver my Money immediately, or I was a dead Man. I gave him 2 Guineas, and 19 s. 6 d: in Silver. In taking out my Money he saw the Chain of my Watch, which he pluck'd out, and held it up to look at it. Then he search'd my Fob, and my right and left Pocket (for a Purse I suppose) holding the Pistol hard against my Belly all the while; his Hand that held it shaking, as if he had been convulsed. I did not at all like the Situation I was in. My Eye was fix'd on the Pistol, and the Fear I was in, left it should accidentally go off, prevented me from taking particular Notice of those who robb'd me, and except I could be as certain that the Prisoner was one of them, as I am that I am now speaking, I would by no means swear it.</p>
               <p>Court. What did the Man in the fair Wig do?</p>
               <p>Mr. Matthews. Nothing but hold the Reins; nor did he say any thing, but only desir'd the other not to frighten the Gentlewoman. The black Man swore and cursed all the while, and because my Horse did not stand still, he bid the other cut the Reins, and repeated it 2 or 3 times. I tender'd him my Keys, and some Farthings, but whether he took any of the Farthings I can't say. Then he bid me drive on, and at parting said, Your Servant ! and I drove forward. A Gentleman on Horseback overtook me soon after; I told him what had happened; he said, He was sorry for it, but he did not seem inclin'd to pursue them, but rid away. Next Morning, I heard that (the Day before) 2 Men had been at the Dirt-House, where they eat and drank, and having no Money to pay their Reckoning, left a Case of Surgeons Instruments in pawn, and said, They would call in a little time and redeem them. I desired the People of the House to send me Word if they came again, but they did not come. As I was walking out the same Day. I heard that the 2 Men that robb'd me had been at Highgate. I went to the Two Wrestlers (a publick House) at Highgate to make enquiry.

The Boy was very positive that they were the Men. I went to Mr. Blackerby's and Mr. Chalk's, but neither of 'em were at Home. I knew no other Gentlemen in the Commission of the Peace who liv'd at Highgate, but being inform'd that Mr. Gough, a Justice of Peace, was at the Flask, I went thither with the Boy at Ten at Night. I desir'd the Justice to examine the Boy strictly about the Nature of an Oath, and I caution'd the Boy my self to be very careful how he swore, for that the Life of the Person he accused might depend upon his Evidence. From the Justice they went to search for the 2 Men, but could not find them. A Person who was in Company to'd me that he knew one of 'em, His Name, says he, is

Theobalds, says I, Why, he knows me, he has seen me often, sure he would never venture to rob a Man that he knew. When I consider'd this, I confess it stagger'd me a little, but I thought he might possibly not know me before he made the Attack, tho' he might before he left me; but when he had once begun, it was too late for him to retract. I said to the Person who told me this, Take the Boy with you, and drink a Mug of Ale with the Prisoner, and if the Boy, after being a considerable time in his Company, continues still positive that he is the Man, send me Word. He went with the Boy next Morning (being Sunday) and sent me Word that they had been with the Prisoner, at the Elephant and Castle, in Fleet-Lane, and that the Boy was positive that he was one of the Men; I went the same Day to see the Prisoner. He was then in the Fleet Prison. Mr. Ewell the Keeper, brought him into the Warden's Room, and the Boy was with us. I spoke to the Prisoner, and he said, It was very hard that he should be charged with robbing me, for as he was an Attorney of the Common-Pleas, he might be struck off the Rolls upon such a Report. I told him, I did not charge him, and if he was an innocent Man, there was no doubt but his Reputation would be clear'd. That I had been robb'd by 2 Men, was certain; but that I was in such a surprise when it was done, that I could not take upon me to say that he was one of them ; but that one of them was very like him. I call'd the Boy aside, and ask'd him, if he was still certain that the Prisoner was one of the Men; the Boy then did say, that the Prisoner was prodigious like one of the Men, but that he could not be very positive; upon which the Prisoner was discharg'd. Next Day (or on Tuesday, I forget which) in my way to Finchly, I stopp'd at the two Wrestlers, to speak with Mr. King, he told me, he wonder'd the Boy was not positive to the Prisoner when he saw him in the Warden's Room, for he had been positive ever since. Prisoner. Mr. Matthews has known me several Years, he has taken hundreds of Pounds of my Money, and - Mr. Matthews. Not hundreds of Shillings. Prisoner. And it's very unaccountable to imagine, that I would ever attempt to rob a Man that knew me so well.

            . On the 13th of August, about 7 in the Evening, coming along the Causeway with 2 Women, I saw 2 Men stop a Chaise; one was a tall Man in a dark blue Grey-Coat, with a light Wig and light Stockings, he stood on the left Side of the Horse. The other was a short Man, in a dark Wig or dark Hair, and in a Coat of the same Colour as his Companion; they went away towards a Wood, and the short Man had a Pistol and a Watch in his Hand.

            . On the 13th of August, in the Evening, as I was coming from Finchly, towards Highgate, 2 Men past me a little below (that is, from hence, a little below Highgate. ) The Prisoner was one of those Men. They went forward, and I met a young Man of my Acquaintance, who was going into Yorkshire. I stood talking with him, and while we were in Discourse, I saw the same two Men go up to a Chaise, and saw the Chaise stop. The Chaise was then, I believe, about 300 Yards distant from where I stood; the 2 Men were about half a quarter of an Hour in going to it, after they past us. We did not think any thing of a Robbery, for if I had, we should have gone after them. I saw no other Man but those two in the Road betwixt the Chaise and us. I have known the Prisoner some Years.</p>

When he came back, he told me, that he and a Girl had seen two Men rob a Chaise at the Bottom of the Hill. That the shortest of the two had a Pistol, and took away the Gentleman's Watch, and then one of them bid the Chaise drive on. That they both came up the Bank; the tallest came to him, and the other went towards the Wood. The tallest bid him not say any thing: He asked the tallest for something to drink. The tallest called to the shortest who was going over the Gate, and asked him if he had any Halfpence. The shortest said, Come along; the tallest told him - Court. Told who?

The tall Man (says he) held the Horse, while the short Man, with a Pistol in one Hand, took away the Gentleman's Watch, and held it up by the Chain thus, to look at it. And as soon as they had left the Chaise, the tall Man came up to me, and bid me say nothing. I asked him for something to drink; he said, he had no Half-pence, and called to the other Man, and asked him, if he had any.

               <p>Prisoner. On Saturday I had a Habeas Corpus for Mr. Morgan, and went with it to his House at the Taylors Arms at Highgate, and sat publickly at the Door all the Afternoon. On Sunday Morning I was call'd out of my Bed, to go to Mr. Jones's at the Elephant and Castle in Fleet-Lane; I was detain'd a Prisoner till Five in the Afternoon, and then might have been discharged, because Mr. Matthews could not swear to me, but I chose to lie a Mouth longer to shew my Innocence. I afterwards brought an Affidavit of a Conspiracy against me, by the 2 Men that took me up, and when it was read before Mr. Justice Fortescue, he granted me an Order to hold them to Bail, and this was the Occasion of my being taken up a 2d time. I shall prove where I was when the Robbery was committed.</p>

               <p>Court. What Cloaths had he then? Stevens. Black. Court.

            . I keep the Bunch of Grapes in Fleet-Lane, it is a sort of a Publick-House; the Prisoner was my Lodger. On Friday the 13th of August, the Prisoner lay a-Bed till 11 a Clock, and when he came down he asked if Atron Polack, the Jew, had been there. At one a Clock Mr. Polack came in, and was to have gone to Highgate with the Prisoner. But a Woman called Blackaway, and he came again about 3, and staid till between 10 and 11 at Night. Mr. Fletcher came in at 3, and staid till 5. At 6 Mr Gale and Mr. Curtis came in, and staid till 11. We supp'd together. We had Bacon and Greens for Supper; and the Prisoner was not out of my Company (except when I went to draw Drink) from 11 in the Morning till 12 at Night. I know 'twas on a Friday, because the Prisoner was taken up on the Sunday following: For on Sunday a Man came from Mr. Jones's, and said 2 Gentlemen wanted the Prisoner to fill up some Writings. The Prisoner went, and as soon as he came back, he said he had been taken up for the Highway. He was carried before Justice Billevs, and then committed to the Fleet Prison.</p>

On Friday the 13th of August, about Two in the Afternoon, as I was going from Highgate, a Woman at the Dirt-House call'd to me, and said, that 2 Men had been drinking there, and were going away without paying. I told the Men if they had no Money, they ought to pledge something, and with that one of them pull'd out a Case of Surgeon's Instruments, and left it in pawn, and he said they were going to receive some Money, and would return and redeem them. One of them was in an Iron Grey (Second Mourning) Coat, with white Stockings and a dark Wig; and the other in an Iron Grey Coat, with dark Stockings, and a light Wig.</p>
               <p>Mr. Matthews. Hearing that 2 such Men had been at the Dirt House, I desired this Witness to go with me to the Prisoner in the Fleet, to see if he was one of them. The Witness said he was not.</p>

            . I have known him 16 or 18 Months, I am an Attorney in the Court of Common-Pleas, and live in the City. The Prisoner and I have often assisted one another in our way of Business. About 3 Months ago, at his Request, I attended him to Mr. Justice Fortescue's, to obtain an Order to hold Jones and Ramsey (the 2 Persons who took him up) to Bail, and upon reading his Affidavit, an Order was granted to bind 'em in 40l. each.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My obtaining that Order was the Occasion of this Prosecution; for when I was taken before Mr. Blackerby, Ramsey said, This you have brought on your self, if you had been quiet, nothing of this had happen'd. My Lord, I am told that the Girl who was on the Causey when the Robbery was committed, is now waiting without.</p>
               <p>Court. You ought to have called all your Witnesses before the Court had begun to charge the Jury. However, let her come in. [ Eter

            . As the Boy and I were going along the Causeway, we saw 2 Men rob a Chaise that was coming down from Highgate; one was a tall Man, and the other a short Man: They were both in grey Coats, and light Wigs. Court. Are you sure they both had light Wigs? Millan. Yes; to the best of my Remembrance; and one of them said to the Gentleman, Damn you, give me your Watch. But I did not see the Watch taken. Court. How near was you to the Chaise? Millan. It was in the Road over against me. Court. Had either of the Men a Pistol? Millan. Yes, the tall Man. Court. Are you sure it was the tall Man? Millan. Yes, and he held it to the Gentleman's Head. Court. To his Head? consider. Millan. I am sure he held it to his Head. When they left the Chaise, they both came up the Bank, and the tall Man bid the Boy not speak, and the Boy made no Answer.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the Boy say Nothing? Millan. No. Then the tall Man said to the short Man, Have you no Half-pence? and the short Man said, No, damn you, come along. And so they both went over the Gate into the Wood. Court. Did the tall Man say nothing to the Boy about coming again, and giving him some Half-pence? Millan. No, not a Word. Court. Did you tell Mr. Matthews what you knew of this Robbery? Millan. I have never seen Mr. Matthews since Court. Did not you know where to find him? Millan. Yes, I knew he was at Mr. Lee's, at Finchley. Court. When, did you see the Prisoner since the Robbery? Millan. He subpoened me last Wednesday.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173204190024"/> Court. Who did you see upon the Causeway besides the Boy? Millan. There was Mr. Perry, and Mrs. Taylor, and an Irishwoman before us, and we run after them. I was frighted, and desired the Woman not to leave me. Court. If you was frighted, how could you take particular Notice of the Robbery? Millan. The Robbery was done first, and I was frighted afterwards, for fear they should take away my Cloaths. Prisoner. What colour'd Stockings had the 2 Men? Millan. One of them had grey Stockings. Court. Are you sure of that? Millan. Yes. Prisoner. Did you see Mr. Odell thereabouts? Millan. No, I did not see him that Day. Court. Is the Prisoner one of the Men that robb'd Mr. Matthews? Millan. I cant't swear that. So the Jury after staying out above an Hour, <rs id="t17320419-43-verdict214" type="verdictDescription">
