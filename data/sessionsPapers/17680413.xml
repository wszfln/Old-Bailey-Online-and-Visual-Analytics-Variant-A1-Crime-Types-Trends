On the Wednesday night before, I lent him 2 s. he saying he had no money; and on the Thursday morning a hatter brought a hat home for me, and the prisoner lent me 3 s.</p>

            . On the 12th of March the prisoner had some linen to wash for me, she did not bring them according to time; I desired her to go about her business, but she said before I go I will make your bed; my watch was hanging by my bed-side; soon after she was gone I missed it; after that, on Monday the 14th, I was informed it was pawned at the bottom of Benjamin-street; there I went and found it.</p>

               <p>Eastland. I believe she did once pawn my watch before; she was always wanting money, and I made her believe I had none, and then she did pawn it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she tell you whose watch it was?</p>

            . I keep a chandler's shop in Kingsland road; Mr. Kingscole brought a bill to me, I looked over my books, and found I had paid the money; the prisoner had brought several parcels of brimstone in, and I had paid him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last parcel you had of him?</p>
               <p>Cox. That was in January 1764, I had an order from Mr. Kingscole's house, to go to the prisoner to order the brimstone in October 1764; then after that, from time to time, I have received brimstone of the prisoner, and the reason it was found out, there was one bill against me that I had paid the prisoner.</p>
               <p>This did not amount to a felony, the prisoner ought to account to his masters for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did no body come by all the time?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. No; when in that lane, he insisted upon lying with me again; I had not strength left to struggle as before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you coment?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get you down, or did you lie down?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. Then he put his legs between mine, and put me down as before; after that he got up, and helped me up in his arms; he asked me then if I would forgive him; I said no, I would not; he asked me if I would kiss him; I said no, I would not kiss him nor forgive him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to that?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. He said then he could not help it; he turned down the lane, and I came home; I found our house full of people; I could not tell my mistress directly, but I told her as soon as the company was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening was that?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. That was I believe after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mistress ask you where you had been at your coming home?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. She did, and what was the occasion of my staying so long; I told her I could not find the house, because I was ashamed to tell what had happened then, but I told her as soon as the company was gone, which was before ten o'clock; then she and I went to the prisoner's master's house; we saw the master and mistress, they said he was gone to bed; I went for a warrant the next morning to Sir

               <p>Q. When did your master know of it?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. He knew of it the night it was done, my mistress told him.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you met the prisoner in the street?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. About half an hour after seven o'clock, but I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be out of your master's house?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. It might be three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never been with beer to that house before?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. No, I never had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not desire the prisoner to shew you the lane?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. No, I did not, the house I was going to was in a little passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the way is that passage?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. It is on the same side the way the lane is on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go by yourself with the beer?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go willingly down the lane?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. No, he laid hold round my waist, and turned me towards the lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you and he intimate before?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. I never had any thing to say to him in my life, I knew him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to make some noise?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. I did, and he clapped his hand before my mouth directly, and kept it so till half way down the lane; it is a little bye-lane, it was a good distance down the lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his hand on your mouth when he declared he would lie with you?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. No, it was not.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176804130017"/>Q. Why did you not call out then?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. If I had, no body could hear me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you converse together before he tripped up your heels?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. A good while, for I refused, and would not let him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the conversation not hold near a quarter of an hour?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. No, It did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not a person come by, upon which you both started up?</p>
               <p>M. Brackish. No, no body came by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any resistance while you were going to the other lane?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. I did; I did not know what to do, he cursed and swore enough to fright me out of my wits; he told me if I called out, people would hear me; it was by his persuasion I did not call out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it between the first and second time?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. It might be a quarter of an hour or more.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell your mistress of this?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. When the people were gone away, one Mr. Banks, a customer, was the last in the house; going out he attempted to kiss me, I would not let him; my mistress said to me, what makes you look so scornful; then after he was gone I told her of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not made declaration, that you should not have told it to your master or mistress, had they not taxed you with staying out so long?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. No, I never did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not declared you would not have prosecuted, had it not been for your master and mistress?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been to see the prisoner since he was in confinement?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. I went to him yesterday morning in prison.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. He sent for me, and that he wanted to speak to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go with you?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there people in the room with him?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. There were.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon your oath tell what passed between you and him.</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. He said to me, will you swear my life away; and said if I would take what money he offered me I should have it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he offer you?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. He offered me five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the money in his hand?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. No, he said it should be put into a person's hand for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else said?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. He said he would have me if I would have him, and he would use me well; as to having him, I said I never will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you was afraid of marrying him, on the account of having sworn against him?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not at that time say, you never intended to hurt a hair of his head, and hoped you should not?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. No, I never did; he said he hoped I would not take his life away; I told him I would not spare him an inch, if I knew it.</p>

            . I am master to the young woman; I first heard of her being ill used by the prisoner at almost ten o'clock that night; she confessed, as soon as the house was clear, what had happened; I had sent her to Mrs. Bevan's with beer, between seven and eight I believe in the evening; I believe she might be out half an hour or three quarters; when she came back, we asked her where she had been so long; she made some little slow answer, I think she said she could not readily find the place; as soon as the company was all gone out of the house but me and my wife, while I went into the cellar she fell a crying, and told my wife what had happened; when I came up I was informed of it, she then gave us the same account as she has now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say he had twice lain with her?</p>
               <p>Roberts. She did, that he threw her down in both the lanes, and lay with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any houses in the lanes?</p>
               <p>Roberts. No, there are not, and in the night-time there are very few people go through them; the prisoner lives next door to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the girl lived with you?</p>
               <p>Roberts. A little above half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, during the time she has lived with you, have you perceived any thing loose in her behaviour, have you any reason to suspect she would suffer people to lie with her?</p>
               <p>Roberts. No, I never had a suspicion of her, I look upon her to be a sober honest girl as any is; I never believed she would condescend to any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to believe this man at the bar used any familiarity with her, so as to kiss her?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176804130018"/>Roberts. No, I never had any reason to believe it in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he used to come to your house often?</p>
               <p>Roberts. He has come once or twice a day sometimes; I never saw nothing between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any quarrel between you and him?</p>
               <p>Roberts. No, I never had any quarrel with him or his master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you advise the girl to prosecute?</p>
               <p>Roberts. It was her own doing; she went in the morning of her own will for the warrant, I did not discourage her in doing it; she was willing and desirous to prosecute him; if she had not of her own accord, I should have advised her to do it; I should not have been willing to have put up with them things in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you threaten her if she did not prosecute?</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Hammersmith; I was sent for to the Justice, the day following the act, to look at this young girl; I searched her, I did not see any particular act of violence; there was some little laceration, and some hemorrhage, that might be from coition, this I believe proceeded from the laceration; I believe he had entered the vagina; I believe from the straitness of the passage, and the violence that had been used, the hemorrhage might ensue.</p>
               <p>Q. Could these appearances be on a woman that had been lain with before?</p>
               <p>Harvest. They might; we could not expect to see any great marks of violence upon a person of her age.</p>
               <p>Q. May not the hymen be broke of a woman that has not been lain with?</p>
               <p>Harvest. I believe it may, and often has been, by a great many circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing that had been broke, could you discover whether it had been lately, or of any time standing before?</p>
               <p>Harvest. I believe that could not be discovered, the passage was very small; I really believe she had not been lain with by any man before; I was desired to examine the prisoner before the Justice, he had got the lues upon him to a high degree.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the girl any appearance of it?</p>
               <p>Harvest. No, she had not; I believe he has had the disease upon him a considerable time; I have some reason to think, by taking medicines, in some measure the violence was taken off, it was quite a pox; he had had a gonorrhoea before, but that was entirely stopt, it was only the external virus that he complained of; some time a man may have a lues upon him, and not communicate the disease; it might, or it might not.</p>

               <p>Daniel. I have; he has given the just account, as to the prisoner and the girl; the girl made some little complaint after that, and did not walk so well as usual; I gave her some medicine, by way of prevention, but there was no appearance that the distemper had communicated.</p>

               <p>Cumerford. I cannot tell indeed; the master came in the way, and she got out of the way when he was coming; we had not two words at a time; the girl was not willing to be seen speaking to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not ask her how much money she would take?</p>
               <p>Cumerford. I did not think about making it up, I did not ask her any such thing; and another thing was, I had no money.</p>
               <p>Q. to Breckinshaw. What conversation passed between you and this witness, in regard to this affair?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. I never saw this man till he came to our house the day of the election, he was drinking there; I was not very well, and could not go down into the cellar to draw any beer all the day, I sat in the kitchen with my cloak on; this man was in the parlour, he asked where Sheridan was, that was all that past.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. Yes, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to him, you did not desire to hurt a hair of the prisoner's head?</p>
               <p>M. Brickinshaw. No, I did not; I went into the room where he was but once all the time he was there.</p>

               <p>Q. What is Mr. Cole?</p>
               <p>Holloway. He is a gardener.</p>

               <p>Holloway. This was at the same time Mr. Wallis lost his plants.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Because Mr. Wallis came down, and saw them fresh planted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Mr. Cole direct the prisoner where to get them?</p>

               <p>Q. What day of the week did he bring them ho?</p>
               <p>Holloway.

            , sen. They came at two different times; this boy, Holloway, has been a thief, he used to rob my house; I have catched him stealing eggs, and knives, and things; he has swore I have beat him when I have never touched him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many plants might there be in the first parcel from Low Layton?</p>
               <p>Cole, sen. I believe there were about two or three thousand of them in all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The cause of my going away was, my master would not give me more wages; last Monday se'nnight, at night, Mr. Wallis came to me in the garden, and said, Morris, come and take part of a pot of beer; we went into the alehouse together; he said he had a favour to ask of me, he wanted six or seven holes of cucumber-plants; I said, if my master has any to spare he must go to him; I think, said I, it is strange you should come to collogue with me; I went down in the ground to work; He came, and wanted me to go and drink with him again, I did not know his intent; I said I must stay and water, I said I would come; he went away; when he was gone, a gentleman said, go along, Morris, there is a man in the road wants you; I owed a little money, I thought it was the man that I owed it to; I went off into the country a little way, for fear of being taken for a debt.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you go to the prisoner as he has mentioned?</p>
               <p>Wallis. I did, and spake to him as he has said; the officer was not with me the first time to take him, I went out for the officer; I was not out two minutes before the prisoner was run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there the master of the public-house?</p>
               <p>Wallis. The master of the public-house abused me for bringing the officer, and went to the window, and hallooed out, Morris, make off.</p>
               <p>Valentine Ludford. I keep a public-house in Virginia-street; the prosecutor was at my house on Easter Monday, he asked Morris about some cucumber-plants; they staid about half an hour, then Morris went to his work, the garden in close to my house; the prosecutor came again in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call to Morris to bid him go off?</p>
               <p>Ludford. What should I for?</p>
               <p>Court. Answer the question.</p>
               <p>Ludford. I did not give him an account of any body being after him.</p>
               <p>Court. Answer the question, yes or no.</p>
               <p>Ludford. I did not; I was informed he was indebted to a baker, and he is a poor fellow with hardly a shirt to his back, and it was better to get out of the way till he was more able to pay.</p>

            , Esq; When I was in Germany, that unfortunate man at the bar did attend me the greatest part of the two last campaigns; he had before attended the Duke of Richmond, where he was put, by his Grace's care and goodness, under the tuition of another person, to learn to be a draughtsman; and when his Grace left Germany, he put him under my care, he was then about sixteen or seventeen years old; he was generally in my house and family, I employed him as a <rs id="t17680413-39-deflabel219" type="occupation">draughtsman</rs>

                        targets="t17680413-39-defend352 t17680413-39-deflabel219"/>, to take sketches of the camps, more particularly those in which I was concerned, that was the connection I had with him; he has applied to me since on different occasions, and I have lately got him to be a draughtsman in the Tower; he was backwards and forwards in my house in common.</p>
               <p>Court. Please to inform the court and jury of the particular circumstances of the fire and the robbery.</p>
               <p>Gen. Conway. As near as I can recollect it was as follows: I had received notes of Mr. Larpent, to the amount of 1200 l. and upwards; there was one of 500 l. and seven notes of 100 l. each, and, I think, a 20 l. and a 10 l. note; I put them in a drawer in a till in my library; part I had disposed of, 300 l. and the 20 l. and the 10 l. notes; and of that money there remained the 500 l. note, and four single hundreds, and I believe there might be another note, but I cannot be very accurate as to the description of that; I had noted the money I took of that sum, so that I knew precisely the sum I had left; there was a 25 l. note I put there afterwards; I saw these notes the morning preceding the fire, or the morning before that, I am not quite certain.</p>

            , who attended me that night, can gave an account of that, it was impossible for the flame to communicate to these papers; the next morning, between five and six, I was alarmed with an account of the house being on fire, I looked at my watch when I came down; we found smoke issuing through the door of the library, and I heard the crackling of flames; I did not open the door at that time, being cautious not to let air in, which might increase it; I called to the servants, to know if they had ordered engines to extinguish the fire; they said they had, but it was same time before the fire engines came; when they came, they were applied to the room, and when they had had some effect upon the fire, the door was opened; I called to the firemen, if they could, to bring out such a table in which I had put the notes; they brought the table out, it smoaked very much, and was partly on fire; upon examining it, I found the drawer where I left my money, and the drawer contiguous to it, were both standing a small matter open; I examined the table, and opened the drawer where the money was, and examined if the papers were safe; I found they were all safe in appearance, only something wet with the engines that had been playing in the room; I took the papers up with a good deal of case, and put them into my pocket, because there were people standing round at that time; I thought by that means I was secure of the notes I had left, but when I examined my pocket soon after, I found the notes were gone from among the papers; then first it was that I had any strong idea that I had been robbed; this is all that occurs to me about the fire and the robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. Please to describe the manner of the fire taking effect on the different parts of the room.</p>
               <p>Gen. Conway. It was the opinion of every body almost that saw the room, that it was set on fire on purpose, and at two different places; to be sure the appearance of the room was very strongly so; but, for my own part, it seemed to me to be so atrocious an offence, that I could not conceive it had been set on fire on purpose; when I was convinced of the robbery, then I could not quite doubt of the other; the table stood on the left side of the fire place, as you look from the fire; there was a book-case on the contrary side, and at a considerable distance; the book-case and the table were the only things that were absolutely on fire; the book case was burnt down to the floor below, and the fire had heated the boards above immediately over the book case; the pictures were destroyed, and the book case with the books in it were damaged; the curtains were so singed as to fall almost to pieces; the cieling was so parched, that part of the plaster had fallen down, and disevered the laths: notwithstanding the natural appearance was, that it should be some of my own family that was concerned in this robbery, yet I had so much confidence in my servants, as I had had most of them a great while with me, who behaved who remarkable justice, I could not suspect them, therefore I turned my thoughts to consider who could have access to the house in such a manner as to be guilty of this thing; when I heard of the bank note, my thoughts was to trace it by means of that, and the first thing that struck me was the description of the person; I did not know the number of the note, but I thought a note of that magnitude might easily be traced, and I enquired into that; Mr. Larpent had received three notes they did allow at the Exchequer, and he traced out two of them, and the third must be that I had; I sent to the Bank to stop that note, and I heard, to my great surprize, that that note had been brought to the Bank the morning of the fire for payment; I thought of tracing the person that brought it; I enquired what sort of a person it was; the description I had answering in a good degree to the prisoner at the bar, it came into my mind, for that and some other things, that it must be he that was the person, (though I could hardly believe it;) Mr. Campe brought the note and shewed it me, he left it in my hands; it occurred to me, the description being something like the person of the prisoner, to compare some of his writing with the writing on the note; (the 500 l. bank-note produced;) though it appeared like a disguised hand, I thought I saw certain strokes in this of a peculiar kind, that, joined to a description of the person corroborated my suspicion; but it is not a similitude that I should chuse to swear to, but it was a great inducement to make me prosecute my enquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you now look upon it to be the prisoner's hand writing?</p>
               <p>Gen. Conway. I will not swear to such a thing as that, I believe it to be his; I thought it proper to communicate my suspicion to the Duke of Richmond; accordingly we proposed the clerks of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176804130027"/> the Bank should come in, under pretence of business, that they might see Mr. Sampson, to know if they knew his person; the two gentlemen at the Bank, Mr. Lambert said he should know the man that brought the note among a thousand, he had taken such particular notice of him; Mr. Campe, the other, said he thought he should know him if he saw him; the Duke of Richmond and myself were with Mr. Sampson, and the two gentlemen came into the room; I had desired them, if they were not sure of his person, they should not make a signal; (our intention was, if they were not sure of the person, Mr. Sampson should not know he was there for that purpose;) but when the gentlemen came into the room, and we gave them some opportunity, by continuing our discourse to the prisoner, they made the signal; (we had agreed they were to make a certain signal if they knew him to be the man;) then I charged the prisoner with it; at first he denied the fact, but not long he soon confessed it, and then gave a full account of the transaction from the beginning to the end.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect what he said upon that occasion?</p>
               <p>Gen. Conway. He confessed he was in my house the night before the robbery was committed; that he had meditated this thing for some days before; he said, when he pretended to leave my house, instead of leaving it, he went up into a room that was vacant, where my house-keeper, who had left me some little time before, had lain; that he lay concealed there till two in the morning, and pulled off his shoes to avoid making a noise, he came down stairs; that he found the remains of a fire in the hall next to this library; that he lighted his candle, which he brought in his pocket for that purpose, and he owned he left it burning among the papers after he had taken the notes; I went out of the room a little while, so far he mentioned before me; he at first said he took them in another manner out of the table, but afterwards he confessed he had done it in the manner I have now mentioned; and that he said an hour, or an hour and a half, to see whether the fire took effect or not; that he went from thence, and went to bed for two hours; then he dressed himself, and came back to my house about eight in the morning, near about the time the fire was subdued; I remember I had seen him there, and I really thought of sending him to make enquiry concerning these notes; he came to me that same day, and asked me if I wanted him; I told him then I did not, the business I wanted him for I had employed another person to do; he described the other notes to be in a cupboard, I think, or some place in his own room, where they were found; Mr. Wilkinson was sent with a constable to his lodgings in Pimlico; he brought the notes back to the Duke of Richmond's, they were never in my possession since; there were eight 50 l. notes, making 400 l. and three single 100 l. and a 25 l. he mentioned having changed this note of 500 l. for a 100 l. note and eight 50 l. notes; he was taken into custody and committed.</p>

               <p>Gen. Conway. I was; there he confessed the robbery only, not the setting fire to the place, he said the fire might be accidental; I asked him by what accident he supposed it could be; he said he might have left the candle on the table; I told him that could not well be, because the candlestick must have appeared; he said the candle might melt down, I said the candlestick could not; then he owned he brought it without a candlestick; I learned afterwards that he piled the papers round the candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he set it upright, or laid it down?</p>
               <p>Gen. Conway. He first said he leaned it against the ink-stand; I told him that was too low, that was not above an inch and a half high, then I went out of the room.</p>

               <p>Lambert. The General challenged him as the person that had robbed him; he denied it at first, but immediately after he confessed every thing, that he took the notes out of a drawer of a table in the library, and that he came to the Bank first with a 100 l. note for cash, and then he came about noon with this 500 l. note; and that he had 100 l. in cash, and the rest in notes, and he had disposed of some of the money, pretty near 200 l. I believe he said he brought a candle from home, and lighted it at the hall fire; and after he had taken the notes, he put the candle on the table, and piled the papers about it, and waited about an hour about the house; then he went home and lay down, and about eight o'clock he came back-again.</p>

            . I am a surgeon and apothecary, and live with Mr. Breeches in Tooley-street; my master saw the child before I did; it was some time after the contraction of the disease that I saw her, she had the foul disease; there was a running matter, the parts were rather inflamed, but no laceration.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that any body had entered her body?</p>
               <p>Hoare. I think the disease was given by a man, whose private parts were small; I take it a man might enter her.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not an infected man communicate the disease, without entering her?</p>
               <p>Hoare. I think he might.</p>
               <p>The child was examined, but not upon oath, who said she carried a pot down into the cellar, the prisoner there took her and set her on a box and kissed her, and put his private parts to her's, but did not put it into her.</p>

On the 6th of February the three prisoners and evidence came into our shop after it was shut up; they wanted to see some handkerchiefs, the handkerchiefs were at the bottom of the counter on the inside; I took other cloth off, and as I was stooping with my head in the counter, I think they then took a piece of cotton, which I missed after they were gone; they bought nothing.</p>

I believe she is eighty-seven years of age, her memory is much impaired; my Lady said she had no yellow gown; to convince her she had, I called to the prisoner to bring my Lady's sattin gown; she came to the door, and put her head in, and said there was no such thing, or my Lady had no such thing; at night my Lady and I had a few more arguments about it; going to bed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176804130037"/> I said to the prisoner, I never was more surprized than when you said my Lady had no such gown; her answer was, my Lady knows what she has done with it, she gave it me last August was twelve months; I said, I believe you mistake the time, Mrs. Watts, I wonder I never saw you wear it; she said my Lady did not give it her to wear, she gave it her for her children, and she sent it to them; the next day my Lady told me again she had no such gown; I then endeavoured in my mind to give over trying to convince her; she came into my chamber, and said, you will be obstinate, I am come to tell you you are mistaken; I could not bear it; I clapped hold of her hand, and said, my dear Lady, do not be deceived by that wretch, believe me she deceives you, I am your friend; she said what would you have me to do; I said, let me call her, and confront her before you; I called her; I then repeated to her the conversation she and I had had the night before; she acknowledged she had said to me my Lady had given her the gown; I asked her where was my Lady's brown damask gown; she said it was gone to the mantua-maker's to be let out; I asked my Lady if she had given orders for it to be sent there; my Lady said she had no such gown; I seized the prisoner by the shoulder, and said, art thou not a vile wretch, down on your knees this minute; I desired her to deliver up the keys, she gave me them; I bid her confess what she had done with the things, or I would charge a constable with her; she went on her knees, and confessed she had been very vile, but all my Lady's things should be returned; then my Lady bid her go out of the house, she went immediately away; on the Sunday after we opened the press where my Lady's clothes were, and missed fourteen gowns; then it was concluded to search for the prisoner, and take her up; she was taken, and brought to the house on Monday about noon; she brought papers, on which were set down every gown that I had missed; she confessed she had stolen them at different times out of my Lady's house, and said they were in pawn, and gave Mr. Spinnage the pawnbrokers duplicates, to go to the different pawnbrokers for them; there was one I was a little doubtful of; she told me, if I went to such a drawer in my Lady's house, there was the stomacher that belonged to it, which would convince me it was my Lady's gown; the stomacher was sent for to Mr. Spinnage's, then it appeared to be my Lady's; Mrs. Crawley, my Lady's daughter, asked the prisoner if what she was charged with was truth; she answered, all I had said was truth, and I gave the same account as now.</p>
