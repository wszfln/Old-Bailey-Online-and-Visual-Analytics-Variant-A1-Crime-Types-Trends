             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a Police-officer belonging to Worship-street; I was in company with Harper, about half past six on Sunday evening, the 17th of last month, in Petticoat-lane; I saw the prisoner, he had in his hand a basket, I asked him what he had there; he said, he would let me know presently what it was; he then opened the basket, took out a cask, and staved it; he beat the head in against a post, and the anniseed flew over me; I then secured him and took him to the watch-house; I asked him, whose servant he was, and he would not own to that, he told me where he lodged; I went there, I learned there that he worked at a distiller's in Goswell-street, and then, from the marks on the cask, I found out Mr. Gordon, and he came to the office on Monday and saw the cask.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The prisoner told you he would shew what it was, and took it out of the basket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He staved the cask that the liquor might run out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any permit with it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know he was liable to be seized as a smuggler? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he destroyed the evidence of the liquor as far as he could, by suffering the liquor to run into the street? - A. Yes; and then he ran away.</p>
               <p>Harper produced the cask which was deposed to by Mr. Gordon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You frequently send out casks that are not returned? - A. Yes; we lose a great many, we never sell any.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other partners than those you have named? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>

             sworn. - I am constable of St. Martin's: On Friday the 8th of November, about eight in the morning, in consequence of information, I apprehended Emery, at No. 7, Angel-court, she was up; I asked her, where is the woman's money; there was a whole parcel of women there in confusion, and she said, let me go up into my own room, I went up; I then said, where is the woman's money; says she, here it is; she then went to something like a half chest of drawers, and she took the money out of the bottom drawer but one; she gave me five guineas, a half-guinea, and a crown piece; but says she, I was drunk, and I know nothing at all about it; I then took her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those the words? - A. I think they were.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cole. The money was in a work-bag, they did not take it out while I was there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fowler's defence. Mrs. Cole and I had been drinking together in the evening at a public-house; afterwards Sally Emery came home, she had been drinking wine with a gentleman, and was very tipsey; Mrs. Cole came up and asked me if I would have some porter;

               <p>Prisoner Emery's defence. I had been with a gentleman in the city, and got two half-guineas from him; I had been drinking some wine, and was very much intoxicated; I had some porter, and got change, and I put the other half-guinea and some silver into the corner of my pocket handkerchief and tied it up; after I came home I missed it, I told Lettice Fowler of it, and she said, Mrs. Cole must have it; and then Mrs. Cole began to abuse us both, and she and this young woman went to sight; Mrs. Cole, tore her veil off her bonnet, and her gown was tore to pieces; she had a white dress on; after that I went to bed, and in the morning, when I went to put my things to rights, I opened the shutters, and the first thing I saw was this crown piece and two guineas; there were no men in the house; there is no woman in the house that cohabits with any man but herself; I went and asked my landlady what was best to be done, and upon her advice I took the money and put it altogether in a drawer, and when the man came for me, I took it out and gave it him, but as to her being robbed, it was no such thing; this young woman did take up the broom, when she threw the patten at her, but there was no other violence used to her.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Cole) Did you go to any public-house with Fowler? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you drank any thing that night? - A. No; only the porter up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at any public-house that night with two men? - A. No such thing; my husband is at Wandsworth, he belongs to the City Militia; I sent him a letter, but he has not got liberty to come up; I saw him at Bow-street, he got liberty to go to Bow-street to see how it was going forward.</p>

My Lord, I expected the benefit of Counsel, I am very inadequate myself, I never was in a court before; all I can say, my Lord, is, I met a Mr. Barry, and I submitted that very question to my Counsel last night, whether until I could find out this Mr. Barry, it would not be necessary for me to put off the trial; he sent word this morning for it to go on; Mr. Barry was an old shipmate of mine, he was a lieutenant on board the Crescent frigate in the last war, I met him about four in the evening; I told him my situation was not the most pleasant; he desired me to meet him, and we made an appointment to meet at Garraway's coffee-house, where I never was, but once in my life before that, some year ago; I went there precisely at six, I stopped in the coffee-room from six till very near seven; I never knew it was a sale-room, but not seeing my friend, and seeing all these gentlemen leaving the coffee-room, I waited till the best part went up, and then I went up, thinking my friend might be there; in going up the stairs, at the bottom of the stairs, there was this coat; I took the coat up in my hand, went through the whole room, where I suppose there were one hundred persons, but saw nothing of my friend; I had the coat in my hand holding it up to the light to look at it, when that gentleman came up; I told him how I had got it, and that I was bringing it down with an intention to give it to the waiter; I have no more to add my Lord, I must submit to the Court.</p>

               <p>Mr. Rodwell. He was in the act of putting the coat on when I came up to him.</p>

               <p>Q. What were his words? - A. B - t your eyes, give me your money directly, or I will blow your brains out; I said, do not be in a hurry, and I immediately drew my purse and gave it into his hand; he then said, d-n you, your pocket-book, and your watch; I answered, that I had neither, be repeated that two or three times; he said to my son, who was in the carriage, look another way, or d-n you, I will blow your brains out; don't look at me, look another way; he then looked up to the coachman and said, look another way, you b - y rascal, b - t your eyes, or I will blow your brains out, if you do not look another way, and upon turning his head, upon that occasion, gave me an opportunity of seeing all the bottom part of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he to the chaise? - A. Close to the window; at half after three o'clock in the day, or nearly about that hour; the handkerchief fell down in consequence of the position in which he put his head, when he looked at the coachman, then he rode away a full gallop; I handed him some half-pence and silver, and walnuts; I said, I suppose you will not think of taking such things; upon which he snatched at them, and some of them fell, and also a watch, and he took that, but that was not my property; he took from me a purse, containing two guineas, and eight shillings; in consequence of a recent attack near the same spot, I attended at Bow-street, to identify three men, and upon that occasion I saw the prisoner, and know him to be the person that had robbed me upon the 31st of December; I have not the least doubt upon earth; I am confident that that is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This robbery was on the 31st of December last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Almost twelve months ago? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040009"/>Q.Had the person who robbed you a round hat or a slapped hat? - A. A round hat, and that pretty low over his face.</p>
               <p>Q. About half after three in December, it begins to be duskish? - A. It did not happen to be so that day, for it was a very great frost, and snow upon the ground, and there was sufficient light to distinguish his features.</p>
               <p>Q. There has been no property found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went to Bow-street with a full persuasion that you might find some persons there who had robbed you? - A. I had had a note to say that some persons were taken up who answered the description I had given.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the prisoner from December till October? - A. I rather think I did see him on the 12th of October.</p>
               <p>- ARABIN sworn. - I was with my father in his carriage, on the 31st of December last, when this transaction took place; I was awaked by the stopping of the carriage, and a voice, exclaiming, b - st your eyes, I will blow your brains out; I almost instantly saw a man on horseback at the carriage-window; he demanded our money in the same menacing tone; I saw my father give him his money; he at the same time demanded mine, and swore he would blow my brains out, if I did not; I fixed my eye and my attention particularly upon the prisoner, so much so that he frequently b - d my eyes that he would blow my brains out if I did not turn my head another way; during the whole of the time I observed him, and I have no doubt that the prisoner at the bar is the man who robbed the carriage; I did not lose any money myself. He had a hat on not quite so low as his eye-brows; and he had a handkerchief, such as ostlers usually wear, a kind of a snuff-colour, tied over his chin, but it was so loosely tied, that from the motion of the horse, and his own agitation, it continually dropped off; I had then an opportunity of seeing the whole of his face, which was very strongly imprinted upon my recollection; I have no doubt in my own mind in the least, that the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were alarmed out of your sleep by this robbery? - A. I was napping.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were alarmed? - A. I cannot say I was alarmed, for I am used to these kind of things upon that road.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no more opportunity of observing the man than your father? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen the person of the prisoner until you came to Bow-street, at least not till September? - A. Not till September.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. (Counsel for Smith.)</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Smith bought three yards of white, and three of black lace? - A. Yes; and she paid likewise for a remnant that was purchased between the two; she paid two pounds, two shillings, and sixpence, altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by purchasing it between them? - A. Mrs. Jane said she would have it, and Mrs. Smith paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it she did say? - A. She said she would have it; they were both looking at it.</p>
               <p>Q. They were looking over a great quantity of lace? - A. Yes; when a person asks for lace, we always shew them a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mrs. Smith agree with you about the price of it? - A. She paid for it, but Mrs. Jane agreed for the price; I said nine shillings and sixpence, and Jane said she would give it, and the others did not object to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Mrs. Jane for the money? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mrs. Smith had paid you, you turned your attention to the other? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But you saw Mrs. Smith do nothing but bargain for the lace, and pay for the lace? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mrs. Smith at your shop before? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not told half a dozen people that you never saw her in your shop before? - A. I do not know that I have ever been asked the question.</p>
               <p>Q. There are many friends of your master and mistress who have heard you? - A. I never did say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you never said so? - A. Yes, I will.</p>

               <p>Q. Saturday night is a busy night? - A. Yes, we are in general.</p>
               <p>Q. How many fellow shopmen have you? - A. Men and boys, there were nine.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Had he accounted to you, on the 31st of October, for any sum of money that he had received of Mrs. Vaughan? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if he had received any money of Mrs. Vaughan, he had not brought it to account to you? - A. No. About five o'clock the same afternoon, I saw the prisoner at a public-house in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that was it that he had gone from your house? - A. He went away about noon upon business to an inn in Friday-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return to you again before five o'clock? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Vaughan a customer of your's? - A. Yes, in Gloucester-place, Portman-square; I went to the Red-lion public-house, in consequence of information from a neighbour; I saw the prisoner there in the tap-room, with a man who went with him from our house at noon; I told the prisoner, that he was intoxicated, and desired him to go home; the other man was sitting in the tap-room, talking to a soldier; he came to me and begged my pardon for staying so long; then each of them took hold of a truck of goods that stood loaded at the door, and began to draw it towards home; I saw them through the window go out towards home; I went home almost immediately, and when I got to my own door, I found the truck there, and the other man with it; the prisoner was not there; I apprehended that he had absconded; I got home, I think, about half past five, as near as I can recollect; I then ran down a street, which I thought it was very likely the prisoner would take; but I did not find him; I came home again, and then went to Westminster, to a man that recommended him to us, and about an hour after that, I found him at a public-house, in Crown-street, Westminster; I asked him why he had staid out all day, and I asked him where the money was, which he had produced at the public-house in Oxford-street, he made no answer; I observed a watch chain hanging from his pocket; I asked him where he had bought that watch; I desired him to come home, and give up his accounts, and from his general conduct, I perceived I was not likely to get any account from him, either as to the watch, the money, or his accounts, and therefore, I immediately charged the watch with him; he was then taken to St. Margaret's watch-house, he then muttered something about, that he was coming home; he was searched, and some Bank notes taken from him, and a watch, apparently quite a new one; he there gave no account how he came by the Bank notes; I think the constable of the night asked him about them, but still he gave no account; I gave charge of him upon suspicion of embezzling property of my father's; I saw no more of him till the next evening, when I saw him at Queen-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what the prisoner said taken down in writting? - A. I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to say, that the clerk was not sitting there, taking down the examination? - A. The magistrate himself took it down; but I do not believe that what was said by the prisoner was taken down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended that it ought not to be received in evidence, but was over-ruled by the Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040015"/>Mr. Knapp. Q. What account did the prisoner give before the Magistrate? - A. He said, the whole of the property that was found upon him, was the property of my father, and that the money also was the property of my father, and finally begged for mercy; he said, he had bought the watch on the night of the 31st of October, subsequent to my seeing him at the public-house in Oxford-street, with my father's money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account where he had received any money? - A. No, not that I recollect at the watch-house; I saw three two pound notes, and three one pound notes, with some silver, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are not in partnership with your father? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner hired by you or your father? - A. My father.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as tell us for what purpose was he hired? - A. To carry a large basket, and deliver goods out to different customers at the West end of the town, and attend occasionally in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Were you present at the hiring? - A. I cannot take upon myself to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to say, that this man was in the habit of any thing more that carrying out goods? - A. I do.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that without a particular direction, he received money from the customers? - A. It depended on the will of the customers, when they chose to pay.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you took him into custody, he was about returning home? - A. He muttered something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did he make out his accounts? - A. He ought to have made them up every day.</p>
               <p>Q. In the evening, after his day's business was over? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But upon this occasion you took him in custody, so that he could not return home that evening? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you happen to know what the watch cost, from any thing that passed from him? - A. He said five pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner produce any thing from his pocket, upon the tap-room table? - A. Yes; two two pound notes, a one pound note, and a five pound note, tore a good deal; he pulled them out, with an observation to the man that was with him, that he would never go home any more; that he would go to sea that evening; that he would give him, the other man, that was with him, twenty pounds to take the truck home, and then he produced the notes; and hearing that he lived with a cheesemonger near me, and hearing him make use of the name of Emerson, I went to Mr. Emerson, and informed him of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How much was the money that might have been produced? - A. I cannot say; there was one note that he had in his hand, that I did not see.</p>

               <p>Q. He does not sell by small articles? - A. He does not sell by retail at all: On the 28th of Novamber, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I observed him coming up the court towards the accompting-house door, where they enter into the warehouse; at that time he was much intoxicated, and as he had been once so before, I paid him his wages for the whole week, and desired him to depart from Mr. Maxwell's warehouse, but he did not immediately go away; about half an hour afterwards I observed him upon the first floor, leaning upon the counter; I did not say any thing then, but went up stairs to the other story, in the warehouse, where I remained some time, perhaps half an hour, looking over some rhubarbs, with

            , one of the porters; Collins went down, and I was called down by Collins, between three and four o'clock, they had carried the prisoner down to the foot of the stairs upon the ground floor; they shewed me several articles mentioned in the indictment, under his clothes, (repeats them); I saw part of them taken from him, but some had been taken from him before I came down; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040019"/>were the same kind of articles that were in Mr. Maxwell's warehouse.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. But you have sent out samples by retail? - A. No; Mr. Maxwell does not deal with druggists, but sends packages to the West-Indies.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not take servants without a character into your house? - A. It has not been customary.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been with you two months, and because he got drunk the second time, you discharged him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear to any of those articles? - A. No; I examined the nutmegs, and found about a pound missing.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of Mr. Maxwell's porters: On the 28th of November last, about eleven o'clock, the prisoner was rather intoxicated, he was putting up some jars, I told him I thought he was intoxicated; between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw some nutmegs fall out of his pocket, and that led me to suspect him; they were in a paper, forty-six in number, weighing six ounces; I found five phials of essence of peppermint about his body, with some lint between his waistcoat and his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep peppermint and lint in the warehouse? - A. Yes; there was a bottle of essence of peppermint in his breeches, and I cannot say what besides; I think there were some other things round his body, his pockets were completely full; all the things in this box were found about his person, (producing them); here are three bottles of magnesia that have got a figure of three upon them, in my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of the rest, do you believe them to be your master's property? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. These are quack medicines - now will you venture to swear that they are worth one farthing? - A. They cost money.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bottles had you marked with a figure of three? - A. A great many.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sold a great many with that mark upon them? - A. Mr. Maxwell has; they were made up but the week before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your master here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, whether he has sold any or not, he is not here to say? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The young man cannot swear to the marks on the bottles.</p>

             sworn. - I am a baker: I was going into Mr. Anderson's house about half past three o'clock, on Saturday last, I saw the prisoner at the bar taking some canvas over the half door; I gave the alarm, and he was pursued and taken; I did not join in the pursuit; there was another man with him, the prisoner had a jacket on, I think it was a kind of fustian. I saw him again on Monday at the Mansion-house, he was at the bar; to the best of my knowledge he was the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are sure this is the man you saw at the Mansion-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But you will not be positive he is the man that you saw in Throgmorton-street? - A. He is to the best of my knowledge, but I did not take much notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had he the same dress on at the Mansion-house that he had on at the prosecutor's door? - A. It was a kind of a green fustian, or velveteen; it was like mine. (The witness had on a drab coloured great coat).</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How far were you from your master's house when you first saw him? - A. About two hundred yards. (The constable produced the property, which was deposed to by Mr. Anderson).</p>

             sworn. - I am a tallowchandler: On Tuesday evening, about six o'clock, the prisoner at the bar brought a haver sack full of tallow to my shop, No. 17, Gray's-inn-lane, in order to sell it; I told him, we did not buy tallow; I asked him who it belonged to; he said, it belonged to himself; I asked him, what business he was, besides a soldier; he said none; I then asked him, how he came by that tallow; he said, it was his; I then observed to him, that none but a tallowchandler had a right to have such a thing in his possession; I saw it had been split up, after it had been marked, for a tallow-chandler's use, and it was English tallow; if it had been foreign tallow, I should not have had that suspicion; he then said, it did not belong to him, but to a comrade that was quartered with him; he then wished to take it away, but I retained it; he made a great deal of resistance; I told him, he should not take it away till he brought his comrade, or let me send for him; then he said, he would go for his comrade, and I sent my man with him; he said his quarters were in Covent-garden; then he attempted to snatch the bag away by force, he got away from me by force; I sent for a constable, he then went out of the shop in a hasty manner, and proceeded to the corner of Liquorpond-street; I turned back into my own shop and got assistance; he was pursued and brought back to my shop, and then he was taken to Hatton-garden; at the office he said, that his quarters were at the Belvidere, at Islington, and after the examination, I went to Mr. Collier's, knowing that his house joined the Belvidere, and there we learned that he had lost some tallow.</p>

            ; I am in trust for the merchants and am responsible in certain cases, but I am not responsible in this case; between nine and ten, on Sunday evening, I received information that some iron had been taken out of my lighters; I got the assistance of Mr. Gottey, and other officers of the Marine Police-office, and I went with them, and the man that gave me the information, Mr. Williams, proceed to Paul's wharf; Mr. Williams pointed me out the barge of Mr. Jackson, where the iron was; she was twice or three times her length from my barge; she was loaded with coals, iron, and other goods; I went on board the large first; I went aft with a pistol in my hand; I found the two prisoners at the bar and three more persons on board; North, who is admitted an evidence, was one; there was one man, that was acquitted, Plumridge, who knocked down two or three gentlemen that were with me; we asked them where the iron was, which they had stole out of my lighter; one man jumped over-board, his name is Tridnall; the men at the bar were very quiet; I stood over them with my pistol, and swore if they were not quiet I would brow their brains out; and they certainly were very quiet; we secured Plum<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040027"/>ridge with cords, we tied him to the boat's bottom, and North was along with these two men; I had guard over the three; then we began to rummage; we asked them where the iron was, and they would not inform us, we were obliged to seek for it; we found it concealed under the bed place where the bed laid.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a place where goods are usually deposited? - A. No, I never heard that they were; I never saw iron deposited in such a place.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a lighterman? - A. I served my time to the water.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find? - A.Eleven bars of iron; I did not weight them, but as far as I can guess they are between six and seven hundred weight; I sent for Mr. Jackson, to where they were, and asked him if he would give up the iron, and he said, no he was sorry for his men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You found North there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your going in you went in with your pistol? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.These men were very quiet? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN GOTTEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am in the employ of the Marine Police-office; I went with Mr. Hobbs, on board a lighter, where we found the two prisoners; as soon as we came to the barge, Hobbs and I went on board; we walked over the goods to the after part of her, to the place they call the cabin; I think there was a man of the name of Plumridge standing, or lying upon the floor, covered with bedclothes; they afterwards turned out to be the two prisoners, the man that was discharged, and North who turned King's evidence; I asked Plumridge, where the iron was that was stolen, and brought on board there; I took hold of him, and told him. I must secure him till I found the iron; Mr. Hobbs looked under the batches and said, there is some of the iron, I know it to be my property; Mr. Hobbs then sent for Mr. Jackson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what the cargo consisted of? - A. There were coals and salt; Mr. Hobbs asked Jackson, in my hearing, if he had any iron stowed under the cabin floor, down that skuttle, pointing to the place where we found the iron; Mr. Jackson said, there was none there to his knowledge, if there was any it was unknown to him, they did not make any part of his cargo; then we secured them, and they were taken to the Marine Police-office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. These men were lying down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were, perhaps, as much undrest as workmen usually are? - A. I believe they were.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the same iron that you had taken from the barge? - A. The same.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I have been a wharfinger and iron broker fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the iron now produced of the same species as that on board this gentleman's barge? - A. Exactly, it is a very particular sort; it is what is termed in this country Russia tire iron, to distinguish it from common bars; I had never seen another sample of this sort of iron in the port of London before; I have no doubt in the world that it is Mr. Hobbs's, besides this; there were nine lighters loaded with iron in Paul's wharf; there was not room to stow the ninth, and that was stowed in a dock a few yards off, but there were no other lighters that contained similar iron to this of Mr. Hobbs's, and there was none of that kind landed at that time; there is but one other iron broker besides myself, and I think it is impossible that any of that sort of iron could have come to London without my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You use pewter and solder to tin your copper vessels? - A. We use no solder, only pewter.</p>

               <p>Q. Before the pewter is in a proper state to tin your vessels, there is some labour required upon it? - A. He only melts it at the time he wants to use it, but he had made use of the pewter which he wanted the day before.</p>
               <p>THOMAS-LONG SHEENE sworn. - I have lost a considerable quantity of pewter; in consequence of my son's information, I went down stairs and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040030"/>asked the prisoner what he had got; he said, he had got nothing but a pair of snuffers, which he had in his hand; he said, he had nothing in his pocket; I searched him, and in his pocket, I found two pounds of pewter, and a pound and a half of solder; I then sent for a constable, took him before the Alderman, and he was committed; he has been with me five years, I took him out of charity and cloathed him, and gave him one shilling every Saturday night to keep him honest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did he not tell you, that he had taken that for the purpose of tinning your own vessels? - A. I do not recollect that he said any such thing; he had not business to put it in his pocket, nor had he any use for it at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they not obliged to make use of some preparation before they can use it? - A. None whatever, except to melt it; it must be melted every time it is used.</p>

I got some sal ammoniac and pewter, to tin a dozen of sauce-pans, which I tinned that day, I put it away to make covers for the sauce-pans; next day my fellow-apprentice insisted upon having the sal ammoniac; I said, he should not, and I put it in my breeches pocket, and my master happened to see me, and when he came up and asked me what I had got, I pulled it out immediately.</p>

               <p>Mr. Collins produced the bundle.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Alder. This is the property I left at Mrs. Isherwood's, for the washerwoman to bring to me; I can swear to the petticoat; the other things I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked up the bundle in the street; I saw the man that ran; but he was not a bit like me; I ran after him, but he got into some place, and I could not find him; I was coming back, and they charged me with it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What time of day was this? - A.Between seven and eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q.There was a great light in your yard? - A. Yes, there was a light at the coach-office.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had meant to steal the key, you know it would have been much better to have locked you in, and then you could not have pursued him? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, before the Magistrate, that you saw him drop it? - A. Yes, I did.</p>

I had been to her box before, but did not look over the articles. I told her I was sure she had nothing of mine, as I had always found her very honest; on the Sunday afternoon I searched her box, with a constable; he brought the keys, and opened the box; I examined, and found in a pillow-case, the two articles in the indictment; I had never delivered that to her; I had given her warning some time before, and her time was nearly expired; it was a piece of a shirt that is of no value, but has my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hovell. Q. When did you first communicate your suspicions to her? - A. I stated it to her on the Friday that I was robbed; but I did not suspect her, I had a high opinion of her honesty.</p>
               <p>Q. She opened the box very readily? - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. The box was opened, and you might have seen the contents? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Sunday the search was made? - A. Yes; she sent to have her things; she was then in prison; I thought it then a justice due to myself to examine particularly.</p>
               <p>Q.What might you have said to her, in order to induce a confession? - A. The confession had nothing to do with these articles.</p>

               <p>Q. The other parts you have not brought here? - A. No; they were made up into other things, and there were reasons why I thought it was not proper to bring them. I am sure they formed the remainder of the sheet.</p>

               <p>Q. Who supplies the India Company with lead? - A. Mr. Poynder.</p>
               <p>Q. So that it must belong either to Mr. Poynder or the Company? - A. Yes; there were three men at top, ready to throw the lead off, and there were two men at the bottom; then the three men at the top threw down three large loads of lead, it was cuttings; and then they all came down into the yard, to where the lead lay, five of them; the prisoner was one of them; then two of them went to the watch-box belonging to the bricklayer's labourer, and took out two large parcels more of lead; each man had his load of lead, all the five; I followed the prisoner, and all five walked out of the yard, into Cutler-street, and from there to Houndsditch, strait down Houndsditch to Bishopsgate-street; three of them turned to the right, and two to the left; the prisoner turned to the right; I followed them till they arrived in Steward-street, at Mrs. Spencer's; the first man that came up to the door is not here; the prisoner came up in a minute; I saw Mrs. Spencer in the parlour; a little girl opened the door; it was then getting duskish: the first man that went in he went directly right across the shop, into a passage; there was a light in the parlour, and the front of the parlour is all glass; Mrs. Spencer came out of the parlour with the candle, and followed him; I then turned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040034"/>round and saw the prisoner I sles crossing the street to come up to the door, and Parker at his heels; I stepped off the step of the door directly, and let Isles up; the same girl opened the door, and let Isles in; I saw him go into the same passage with his load; my partner then went for a constable; I never left the door till the constable came, which was in about six minutes; we rang at the bell directly, the girl opened the door, and I saw Mrs. Spencer in the shop; I said to her, here are two men come in here loaded with lead; she said, no man had come in there that night; I told her I was very sure there was, for I had followed them from the Company's warehouses, and never lost sight of them till they entered the house; she still insisted that no man had come in; I told her I was sure there had; I told her she must give me the candle, I had no doubt but I should find either the man or the lead; then she gave me the candle; I proceeded into the yard instantly, I found there was no lead in the yard, nor no men; it is a very small paved yard; there was a sort of a hovel which I supposed this man might have gone into, I went up there, and there was a pair of stair-cases; but I found nobody; I came down again, and took the candle in my hand; I looked round and saw a large hole in the wall; I applied the candle into the hole, where I saw the lead in the cellar through the hole; I said to Mrs. Spencer, here is the property that the men have brought; I dare say I shall find the men in the cellar; she said, I was welcome to go into the cellar; upon that I turned to the right, where this lead was, in a coal-hole; the quantity was about five hundred weight, as near as I can guess; it was sheet-lead, quite new the greater part of it; there were some pieces which were not new; it was marked "No. 1, Party-wall," with a chalk-mark; from the folds, the double, and the size of it, I suspected that to be the lead; Parker then wrote my name upon it with a knife: then we went into the cellar, and hunted about, but could not find any body; there was a hole that went into the passage, that we suppose they could get out at; we then went into the shop, and found some more lead, with the chalk-mark; I left Parker and the constable, I went for one of the elders, Mr. Ware; I returned in about five or six minutes to Mrs. Spencer's; I went down with Mr. Ware into the cellar to see this lead, Mrs. Spencer went down with us; I opened the lead, and shewed Mr. Ware the mark"No. 1, Party-wall;" Mr. Ware and I and Parker went for the plumber, leaving the constable in the house; the foreman, Foster, came with us; and Mrs. Spencer went down with us into the cellar; he opened the lead, and said it had the marks that came from the shop upon it; he said, he had not the least doubt it was the property of the East-India Company; Mr. Ware told me to put a mark upon this lead; I took a knife out of my pocket and marked the lead with a W, every lot that was there, which amounted to twenty-eight, in the presence of Mrs. Spencer; when Mr. Foster said he had not the least doubt that they were the same marks, and if it was left till day-light he should be better able to tell the marks a great deal; there were eight pieces in the shop, I marked them with the same mark as those in the cellar, a W. There were some sheet-lead and some cuttings in the cellar and in the shop both; then, as we did not take the lead away, Mrs. Spencer gave her word and honour that nothing should be deficient till Monday morning; this was on the Saturday evening; then we went away, constable and all. I returned again on the Monday about eleven o'clock, with Mr. Ware, Mr. Foster, and Mr. Parker; Mrs. Spencer was at home; we went down into the cellar, and Mrs. Spencer went with us; we found the lead had been hauled about, and not one piece upon another, it was quite altered from the state in which we had left it; they were strewed about; the piece that we observed, on the Saturday night, to have "No. 1, Party-wall," was entirely rubbed out, nor a bit to be seen; the W's were all standing; Parker had wrote my name upon one piece, and that I found in the cellar; then we went into the shop, and the pieces that were marked "No. 1, Party-wall," had been rubbed out, and chalked planner; then Ray and Armstrong came, and took the lead away. Isles was not taken till the 21st, about eight or nine days after.</p>

               <p>Q. He did not return to his work the next day? - A.No; then we took the lead to Worship-street; Armstrong and Foster and I then took a piece of lead to the building; the plumber thought it would match; the piece did not match there, but there was one place where it did match a little.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. (Counsel for Isles.)</p>
               <p>Q. One of the bits of lead did match? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it appeared to you that some of that lead was cut that had been affixed to the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. It was the end of a gutter, was it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. (Counsel for Spencer.)</p>
               <p>Q. This shop was, or has been a plumber's shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.It had been shut up for a considerable time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Spencer's husband had carried on the business of a plumber there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that there was a glass partition between the shop and parlour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself; is there any thing more between the shop and the parlour, than four square<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040035"/>of glass, with a large nob in the middle of each? - A. Yes; the whole front is glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself, because I understand the fact is not so; is there more glass than in the parlour door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The shop window was shut up? - A. Yes, and the glass door outside.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the house had been uninhabited for some time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The windows were very dirty? - A. It was dirty, but I could see every thing clear.</p>
               <p>Q. When you knocked at the door, the child opened the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She called her mother, did she not? - A. No, Mrs. Spencer met me coming out of the passage into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.And she told you that you were welcome to search? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She was not taken up, but voluntarily attended the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She attended three times? - A. She did, and was afterwards dismissed upon her finding bail; she surrendered to take her trial.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an assistant elder to the India Company's warehouse: On Saturday, the 12th of October, Muffett came for me, and I went to Mrs. Spencer's house, and found a great deal of lead, five or six hundred weight, I suppose, or more; I saw Mrs. Spencer; I said, Mrs. Spencer, this is a very unlucky affair for you; your house has been shut up a great while, and I should not have thought of such a business being carried on; the Company are robbed very much in these articles, and I am very sorry you should bring yourself into this predicament, to buy this lead; she said, she had a family, her husband was in trouble, and she bought it to help maintain her family; she said she had not bought any that night, nor had any been there; nor was there any people there; I said, that being the case, it would be much to your honour not to disturb this lead till Monday, as it began to be eight o'clock at night; then I returned on Monday, Mrs. Spencer was at home, but I found the lead in a very different situation to what I had seen it on the Saturday night; there was a piece of lead with something chalked upon it, which was rubbed off when I came to see it again on Monday.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the Police-officers belonging to Worship-street: I apprehended the prisoner on the 21st of October, in a house in Rose-lane, in the parish of Christ Church, Spitalfields; I saw the prisoner through the keyhole of the door, and I opened the door by force, and took hold of him; I had Ray and Mason with me; I told him I wanted him for stealing the lead from the India warehouses, which had been carried to Mrs. Spencer's; he said he had carried it there, but he was not paid for it; I went on the Monday to Mrs. Spencer's, and she told me we might take what lead we liked, and we took nine pieces; she came to the Magistrate's, and two gentlemen passed their words for her appearance, and she appeared again on Thursday; the lead is in Court.</p>
               <p>Muffett. This is the same kind of lead that is upon the India Company's warehouses.</p>
               <p>Isles's defence. I am innocent of the charge that is laid against me, and therefore I shall leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Isles called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Spencer put in a written defence, as follows:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, I do assure you that I am perfectly innocent with respect to receiving this lead; I never have, at any time, bought any lead that I had the least reason to think was stolen; it is the custom of our trade to buy and fell both lead and glass supposing it honestly come by, giving a fair valuation for it; but the lead in question I knew nothing of till these men, and the beadle, came to ask for it; nor did I see the man that was charged with stealing it till my third appearance before the Magistrate, I then knew him in consequence of having known his master that he was apprenticed to, a Mr. Wildman, a very respectable plumber in Whitechapel, I have known both Mr. and Mrs. Wildman some years; I hope your Lordship, and the gentlemen of the Jury, will take into consideration the whole of my conduct upon this very trying occasion, that you and they will have the goodness to reslect that my conduct was very different from that of a guilty person; that if I had known that I had either bought or received any lead that had been stolen, I should not have suffered them to look wherever they pleased, which was really the case. I beg leave to inform the Court, that in all this affair there has been no warrant, that I went before the Magistrate voluntarily, and that whatever I did was free from any compulsion. My Lord, I have been all my life in the place I now reside in, and the adjoining parish, I have a large family of ten children, and we have been under some embarrasments lately through unforeseen misfortunes; at the time this affair happened, I was in a great deal of trouble, my husband was in confinement for debt. I will not any longer take up the attention of the Court, I have stated plain facts, and I submit my case to the consideration and clemency of this honourable Court; I should not have troubled the Court with a written defence, but that never having been in such a presence before, I should find myself unequal to the task of speaking, I thought I should not be so well able to speak. Clementina Sophia Spencer.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a dustman: On the 14th of July, I was in my master's yard, in Scotland-yard, adjoining to Wood's-wharf; about five o'clock in the morning I heard some watermen crying, stop thief, I immediately jumped over the pales belonging to my master's yard, and ran by the water-men; I immediately saw three men run away from a boat loaded with goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe their persons? - A. I followed them till such time as Orrell was caught; I I saw Mackaway after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the other person? - A. I think the next person, the third, was rather stouter in the face, and rather a darker complexion than the prisoner; I cannot positively swear to the man, it is a long time ago.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far were you from the person that you suppose to be of a darker complexion? - A. About five yards, and sometimes three.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HATTON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a private in the guards; about five o'clock on Sunday morning, the 14th of July, I heard a cry of stop thief; my comrade, Harris, and I saw three men come running up a street from the water-side, I believe it was Hungerford-street; I did not know the name of the street, and a man running after them; the man said, those are the three men, soldiers why do not you stop them; Orrell, and Mackaway, crossed the street, and ran up the court, and a third man took up another court, and both the courts led into Round-court; I was so nigh to Orrell and Mackaway, that the prisoner could not get in between them and me; then he turned back into the Strand, and I looked strait at him as he turned back.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round and tell us if you know the man? - A. I have no doubt that that is the man that I saw running; I have no doubt at all about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. This man has only been taken up a few days? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The transaction you have been speaking of was in July last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever been walking along Piccadilly since? - A. No; I have been in Piccadilly but once since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard of a reward of forty pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a part of the eighty pounds reward in the former case? - A. I had something for my trouble in taking Orrell.</p>
               <p>Q. And if this man should be convicted you will get something more? - A. I expect to be paid for my loss of time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect a part of the reward? - A. Yes; if there is a reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know there is a reward? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a private soldier; I was with Hatton on Sunday morning, the 14th of July; I heard a cry of stop thief; I saw three men coming up the street from the river, Tyler was following them, and calling out, stop thief; they ran across the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040039"/>street, up towards New-street, Covent-garden; I did not know them before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you upon the other trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Orrell one of them? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, was he one? - A. Yes; he was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a part of the reward upon the other trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you recollect how much you received upon that occasion? - A.Four pounds ten shillings, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not often receive so large a sum as that? - A. Not without I earn it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a very considerable sum for a man in your station in life to receive? - A. I have received more at times.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined before, upon the trial of the other men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect saying then, that you did not see the face of any one person more than a minute? - A. I saw it more thatn two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many minutes sight do you think you had of the third man? - A. I went two hundred and fifty yards side by side with the prisoner, as near as I can recollect; he was not running then, he was walking.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take him? - A. I called to Tyler, and said, this is the man, and he took a spring directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a view of his face more than two or three minutes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was five months ago? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not think you may very likely mistake the person of a man that you had seen but once, and that five months ago? - A. To be sure one man may be like another; but I am positively certain he is the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you been often in Piccadilly since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. At what time was it that you saw his face for two minutes, was it while you were going these two hundred and fifty yards by his side? - A. Yes; and the time that he passed me in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a view of his face the whole of that two hundred and fifty yards? - A. Yes; I took a good look of him.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BECKET sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Orrell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mackaway? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know the prisoner before the 13th of July? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know him now? - A. Yes; I have no doubt but he is the man; on Saturday, the 13th of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, he came to me and Orrell at the Waterman's-arm, Bank-side, Southwark; Mackaway brought him to the Waterman's arms; Mackaway then said, he would go out and fetch the things; I did not know what things they were; then we all went out together, then Orrell asked me, whether I could borrow a fail; then Orrell and I rowed from Mason's-stairs, Bank-side, which leads from the Waterman's-arms, and went over the water; what became of Mackaway and the stranger I do not know, they went out; Orrell and I took the boat and rowed over to the Surry-side of Blacksriars-Bridge; then we walked from thence to the Waterman's-arms, at Masons-stairs, and we found the stranger sitting there.</p>

               <p>Q. Who do you mean by the stranger? - A. The prisoner at the bar; Mackaway then came in, in a few minutes with a basket; we stopped there till about five o'clock, and one of them said, that we should go; then we all of us went to one Wells's in the Upper ground, as you cross the road to Blacksriars-bridge, and go towards the shot manufactory; we stopped there till it was near seven o'clock, and then me and Orrell went to the waterside to see how the tide was, to see whether it was stood; the prisoner and Mackaway stood upon the steps, the wind blew hard; I went back and told them it was not stood, and the prisoner said, he was positively sure it was stood, and insisted upon going; then one of them, I cannot say which it was, gave me a basket, and told me to put it in a dry place, and I put it in the boat's foreships under the head, the basket was sewed up quite close; one of them, I cannot tell which, asked me how long it would take to row to Richmond; I said, it would take two hours, or two hours and a half; the prisoner said it would be three hours and longer; then we all four went up to Chelsea; we set off about four or five minutes after seven o'clock at night, and stopped at the Magpye-and-stump at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Peacock). Is this one of the persons that came to your house? - A. Yes; he was the last that came up.</p>
               <p>Becket. We got there about eight o'clock; Mackaway, Orrell, and the prisoner at the bar went in first, and I stopped to hawl the boat up, and they called out at the window to me to get some onions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you returned to them? - A.In about ten minutes; when I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040040"/>in they had got some bread and cheese and beer upon the table, I gave them the onions; we stopped there as nigh as I can guess an hour, or an hour and twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any particular discourse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the reckoning? - A. Orrell borrowed a shilling of me towards it; the reckoning I believe came to two shillings and eightpence, the money was put upon the table; it was two shillings and eightpence, or somewhere thereabouts; I do not know who paid the rest; then we all went away together, about twenty minutes or half an hour after nine; then we went up the river, and landed where there was a green grass-plat, and it appeared to me as if there was a church in it; the prisoner was the man who shewed me where to land; when we got there, one of them asked me for the basket that I had put at the head of the boat; I gave it to one of them, and they took it up the grass-plat; they all three went up the grassplat, and took something out of the basket, and then brought the basket back, and threw it into the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that? - A. As near as I can tell, about twelve o'clock, it was just at high water.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to be three hours going from Chelsea to Twickenham? - A. The wind blew very hard, and beyond Richmond the tide was very dead, sometimes it runs no farther than Kew; in about twenty minutes, or half an hour, Orrell came back with two pieces of woollen cloth, he threw them into the boat, and said something, I do not know what, and then he went back again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Who came next? - A. I cannot say; they went backwards and forwards two or three times a-piece; the prisoner at the bar brought some white parcels, and put them into the boat, they were parcels of Irish cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mackaway bring any thing? - A. Yes; they all brought something every time.</p>
               <p>Q.About what time was the last time that they came? - A. They might be gone about an hour, or it might be more; they stood upon the grass, and I heard them say, shall we have any more; what answer was made to it I cannot say; then they came into the boat, and we rowed towards London, and just below Kew-bridge, the prisoner went ashore to get some sacks; one of them said there were some sacks hanging over a barge's side above the bridge; and the prisoner got ashore below the bridge, and returned without any sacks; then we rowed down till we came below the Red-house, and one of them observed that there were some sacks hanging out at a miller's place, and they wanted me to put them ashore; I told them they must walk through the water if they did, for I could not get near it for a hill that runs out; then we came towards Westminster-bridge, and just before we got about to Lambeth, Mackaway and Orrell took the skulls; before that, the prisoner and I had been rowing; before we got to Westminster-bridge, there were some people ashore on the Westminster side of the river, below the bridge; one of them asked me who they were; I told them I believed they were the Police-officers; I then observed Orrell and Mackaway to have pistols in their breeches, I did not observe the prisoner to have any; I desired them to put me ashore, and, after great persuasion, they put me ashore at the uppermost side of Wood's wharf; as I was getting out of the boat, one of them said, how frightened you are; I then left them all three in the boat, and went up the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you were taken up? - A. I was not taken up at all, I went to Bow-street and delivered myself up.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. Six or seven days after.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you were admitted a witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you first came into their company? - A. About four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. And what time was it when they put you on shore? - A. About five o'clock the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Having been in his company all those hours, speak fairly, and honestly if you can, whether the prisoner is the man? - A. I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had a doubt of him? - A. Yes; the first time I thought he was a swarthier man, but when I came to see him a second time, I was sure he was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long have you been out of prison? - A. I cannot take upon me to say, I was never in prison but that time; I have been out ever since Mackaway and Orrell were cast.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the first man that got out of the boat, and away you ran as hard as you could run? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard a cry of stop thief? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that could not mean you, and therefore you did not look back? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.You tell my Friend you had a doubt - now I ask you if you did not positively say he was not the man? - A. I said he was a swarthier man, and a rounder face, rather a fatter face.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you this, and recollect there is such a thing as the pillory, for people that can be convicted of it, and transportation into the bargain; now, where not your words these, that is not the man, it was a man of a fuller face, and a swarthier complexion? - A. I might say so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040041"/>Q. Do not you know you said so? - A. Yes; I have no doubt but those are the words.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it; are you not sure of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my learned Friend, that you were thirteen hours in company with the man, and therefore you knew the person, and you could not therefore possibly be mistaken? - A. I was not so positive of him at the first sight.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sitting facing of him a part of the time? - A. A very trifling time.</p>
               <p>Q. You were with him at different public-houses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was light by three o'clock in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, having said he was not the man, because he was a swarthier man, how long was it before he was brought up again? - A. Three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not brought up, not having been suffered to be washed or shaved for those three days, that he might have the appearance of a man of a swarthier complexion? - A. He had a blacker beard than he had on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not his face dirty from not having been allowed water? - A. On Saturday I was sure he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Wednesday, when you said he was not the man, was your examination on oath then taken? - A.There was no examination at all then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you then taken away by the officers, and the examination put off for three days? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you had conversations with some of the people about that office? - A. I never had any conversation, only when I was up there.</p>
               <p>Q. But you were up there, you know, on the Wednesday and Saturday? - A. I was not there half an hour on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not dine with them on one of those days? - A. I did not dine with any of the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor drink with any of them? - A. Not with the officers; I drank with the soldiers that were witnesses with me.</p>
               <p>Q. On Wednesday you were told the other man was taken? - A.They told me there was a man there.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you know before you went, that you were to find the man who had been concerned in the robbery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And though you had been so told, you said that was not the man, for the man had a swarthier complexion, and a fuller countenance? - A. Those were the words.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In what way was the person, you supposed to be the prisoner, dressed? - A. A sort of a reddish snuff-coloured coat, and pearl buttons; he had a long beard on that day, when he went to Twickenham, and boots with clean tops.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Peacock.) Do you recollect how the prisoner was dressed that night? - A. I think he had a brown coat and pearl buttons, and new boots.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You told me, you had heard that the other persons had had a part of the reward? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had you not a share of that reward? - A. I had my expences; I had it at the Recorder's office, Carpmeal received it for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had you not a share of the reward; and did you not attend to receive a share of the reward? - A. I had only a two pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that that was your share of the reward? - A. I did not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not apply for your expences in Court, and where you not told that you were to have a share of the reward? - A. I expected to have my expences of Mr. Read.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were you not referred to the next Sessions for your share of the reward? - A. Mr. Carpmeal ordered me to come here, I did not know what it was for, I was sent for; I told Carpmeal he was welcome to that to share it among them, only to pay my expences.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know what you were sent for about - do not you know it was a share of the reward? - A. I gave it away; I told Carpmeal it was too much for my expences.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not standing close by the Recorder and his clerk at the time you divided the reward? - A. No; I was a great deal further from him than I am from you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that that was your share of the reward? - A. I do not know; whether it was or not I meant to ask Mr. Read for my expences, and Carpmeal told me I was to come the next Sessions for my expences.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear he did not tell you, that you were to come for your share of the reward? - A. I don't remember that he did; I told him to take and share it among them, because I did not want any thing of the kind, I wanted only the expences.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what kind? - A. I did not know then that it was a share of the reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that as true as all the rest of your evidence? - A. I did not think it was a share of the reward of the men being hung.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that, till the present time, you did not know that that two pound note was your share of the reward? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Whether it was for a reward, or whatever it was you felt yourself satisfied for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040042"/>your trouble and expences with less than forty shillings? - A. Yes; and I gave them the rest.</p>

               <p>JOHN AUDSLEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a waterman: On Sunday morning, I was at Wood's wharf; I saw some persons in a boat, between four and five in the morning; there were two fitting and two rowing, and the boat looked very deep; we had had information of the robbery; four of us stepped into a boat, and we pursued this boat, and the goods; they found that we came up with them, and they got upon Wood's wharf, and got ashore, and all ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of their persons? - A. I know neither of them, but the waterman's boy; and I did not know that it was him till afterwards: we went on board a boat and brought her up to Westminster; we found many bundles of cloths and pieces of linen, and articles of that kind; the boat was taken to a place where I live, and there I took care of them till I delivered them to Carpmeal, the officer. I found also a basket in the boat, but I do not know the contents. There was Mitchell, Herne, and me took the goods out of the boat; we kept them from six to ten or eleven, and then Carpmeal had them; Lawrence took the basket out.</p>

Yes, that is the man; he held me by the shoulder while another man took six pair of silver watch-cases from me, and ran away with them; they were in a white ticking bag; it was between four and five o'clock; it was not quite dark, it was light enough to distinguish a man's countenance; the prisoner ran across the square into Little Britain; the other ran a different way, and I did not see any more of him; then this man called out stop thief, himself; and I ran after him, and he was stopped.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: I was at work in Little Britain; I heard a cry of stop thief; the boys were making a lamentation of losing their property; I saw the prisoner and Carpenter together; I asked the prisoner what he was, he said he was a gentleman; I asked him where he lived, he said he was a master beaver-hat maker, No. 1, Red-lion-passage, Cloth-fair.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. That man wanted me to go about my business; he said he was convinced I had not any thing about me, and the mob would not let me go; I know nothing at all about it.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: on Wednesday night; about six o'clock. I perceived the prisoner Edwards come out of Mr. Barnfield's shop; I watched her some way up Bishopsgate-street, and I stopped her; I felt something hard in her pocket, and I took her into Messrs. Barnet and Cookson's, haberdashers; I there searched her, and in her right-hand pocket I found two cakes of soap; under her left arm I found a shirt, and some more things in her left-hand pocket, which are not mentioned in the indictment; I have had them in my possession ever since.

I sent a friend to ask Mr. Osborne to watch up stairs who went into my warehouse; I went to Mr. Duffield's house till Mr. Osborne sent over to inform Mr. Duffield of it. I then went out to watch her coming out, and I had Mr. Sapwell there ready, and he stopped the prisoner Edwards; this is my soap, here are the pepper-corns in it; I know the shirt by the initials of my name.</p>

               <p>JOHN WAINEWRIGHT sworn. - I am a constable of Dowgate ward: On the 8th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming down Thames-street, just opposite the Steel-yard, and the prisoner was pointed out to me by one John Stevens, a master carman; I saw the prisoner go close up to the cart, with his face towards it, close to the wheel of the cart; I did not see him take any out of the bag; I went round, in order to lay hold of him; he walked on a few yards, I laid hold of him; he made a little resistance, and said he was left in care of the cart by the carman, while he was gone down the yard; I then saw some cotton round him, between his shirt and his waistcoat; I asked him how he came by that cotton, he said he picked it up about the cart-wheel; I then saw that the bag of cotton was cut; I took him down into the yard, and asked the carman if he had left him in care of the cart; the carman said he was not left in care of the cart, and he had no business there; I then took him to the accompting-house, took the cotton from him, and conveyed him to the Compter; I asked him if he had a knife, he said he had not, but I found one down by the side of his breeches. (Produces the cotton).</p>

Panther and Giles's shop is up that yard; then I saw Martin, the prisoner, come down the gateway, and beckon Turner up the yard; Martin turned round and followed him; then Martin beckoned with his hand, in this manner, for Turner to keep back; Turner then stepped back; he went to Mr. Panther's warehouse, and Turner followed him in; they might be in as much as ten minutes together; then I was joined by John Bolton; I desired him to stay for the purpose of watching them Turner then came out with two coach-springs, one upon each shoulder; he came down the gateway, turned to the right hand, and went across Oxford street; he stopped under the portico of the Pantheon; Martin soon after came out with four springs, in a short bag; he was followed by

               <p>Q. When they had got there, has they gone the nearest way? - A. Certainly not; then they went down Blenheim-steps, which is along side the Pantheon, and along-Marlborough-street, into Poland-street; I then left them to fetch Mr. Panther; Bolton was absent from them about a quarter of an hour; Bolton acquainted me, where he had left them, and then I followed them again; before I left them, I saw them go into the Goldenlion, the corner of Church-street; Bolton and I went into the public-house to hear the conversation, the landlord was not up, and we called for some purl, as well as they did, and we could not have it, they left the springs at the public-house door; I heard the prisoner say to Turner, do you know where you are going with these things? he replied, no; the prisoner said, go straight down and turn to the left, which they did; I saw them go into the Cock, in Graston-street, and then to an old iron shop in Graston-street, kept by

               <p>Q. Was that lot afterwards missing? - A. It was; I heard nothing of that article till I saw it at Bow-street, upon the apprehension of these men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You do a pretty considerable deal of business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a considerable deal of hurry in doing that business too? - A.Rather so.</p>
               <p>Q. It is nothing unsual that mistakes have happened of the sort we are now talking of? - A. It is very possible.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not less likely that the goods amounting to a guinea and a half, and the other amounting to a guinea and a half, the sum being the same? - A. Very unlikely.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it uncommon for persons to purchase in another name than their own? - A. It is not unusual.</p>
               <p>Q. This Major Crump did not give in the whole of his name? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had been persons frequenting your sales? - A. Yes, About in particular; they had purchased a great many things at our sales, and paid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. A mistake never happened with them before? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 9th of October? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have seen them at sales since that? - A. Yes, once I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they purchase any thing? - A. I think they did.</p>
               <p>Q. And paid for it? - A. They always paid for what they bought.</p>
               <p>Q. To what amount do you think they had purchased? - A. Pretty considerably at different sales; they have bought of me, of my brother, and they have bought of my nephew.</p>
               <p>Q. And they have always paid fairly and honestly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate that you thought it was very likely to be a mistake? - A. I said, it was possible a mistake might have happened in the delivery.</p>
               <p>Q. The articles purchased by Mr. George, was the knife-case containing knives and forks; and the articles they purchased were knife-cases? - A. Yes; after an article is sold, they are left in the room till they are called for; the knife-cases all stood together.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be very possible that even the porter might have delivered it by mistake? - A. I think not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Robins; the prisoner Abbot, came on the 10th of October, for the lots he had purchased; I looked them together, and placed the four knife-cases by themselves upon the table; he said, he could not take them with him then; we had a sale in the other room that day, and he went to attend the sale in the next room; and I saw the other prisoner, Tanner, in the next room, at the time Mr. Robins was felling; he said, he wanted to take them away; I then took the keys of the ware-room, and he went with me, I could not stay any longer; he said, Tanner was gone for a coach, I left him in the room; when I thought there had been time enough for a coach to be called, I went into the room again; I found Abbott there and the goods were removed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember if there was any mark upon the lot that Mr. George bought? - A. Yes; it was marked with chalk, lot 203; he went away, and I locked the door; a few days afterwards, Mr. George enquired for his lot, and I could not find it any where; a few days after he came to our sale-room; I asked him if he had taken the knife-case away in a mistake; he said, he believed not, but the knife-cases that he had taken away, he had sold to Tanner; he said he would enquire of Tanner about it; I saw him again afterwards, and he told me he had enquired of Tanner, and that he had not got the lot marked 203; I had given him the number of the lot upon a piece of paper; I believe I saw him as much as three or four times, or more, after that.</p>

               <p>Q. How long after was it that he was taken to Bow-street? - A. I should suppose a month, or more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you first spoke to the prisoner, Abbott, the other prisoner was not in company with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After these things had been missed, Abbott came several times to the auction room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The two prisoners did not lodge together at this time? - A. He said he had sold them to Tanner.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was taken into custody, he was taken to his father's house? - A. I understood so.</p>
               <p>Q. You never attempted to take him into custody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he had spoke to Tanner, and Tanner told him he had not got it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other knife-cases in the room besides? - A. Yes, there was one other, containing knives and forks, which he purchased the day that he came to fetch the others away.</p>
               <p>Q. When they are upon sale, you open the head, and shew the articles? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when they are sold, you put down the head, and put them away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I hardly need ask you if you can tell, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040050"/>it is shut down, whether it is full or empty? - A. No.</p>
               <p>MARY-ELIZABETH COLLINSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live in the same house with the prisoners; it is Abbott's father's house; Tanner lived with Abbott; I came to live there about five weeks ago, and they lived there then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember their coming home in a backney coach together? - A. Yes, once they did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they bring with them? - A. I believe two waistcoat-pieces that they had bought.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any knife-cases in that house? - A. Yes; I saw some up stairs in Mr. Abbott's room; Mr. Tanner slept with him in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see who brought these knife-cases into the room? - A. No, they were not brought there while I was there; the knife-cases were all laid up in a corner, and their dirty cloaths laid at the top of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Abbott was living in the house with his father? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Tanner was acquainted with him, and lodged in that room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the coach came, you are sure no knife-cases came then, but waistcoat-pieces? - A. I saw no knife-cases then.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there any chalk upon these knife-cases? - A. I did not look at them.</p>
               <p>JOHN LIMBRICK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the patroles of Bow-street: I apprehended the two prisoners on the 17th of November; Tanner was brought to my lodgings by a master tailor, and I took him into custody; I afterwards went to Abbott's lodgings, in Nell Gwynn's-buildings, Battle-bridge; and there I found this knife-case, and five more; (produces it;) it is marked at the back, 203.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The mark still remained at the back of it, though it was four or five weeks after the sale? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Robins. This is the lot that was sold to Mr. George; there has been one desert-knife put into it to make the set complete.</p>
               <p>Tanner's defence. I never had an intention to defraud Mr. Robins of his property; if they were taken away, it was a complete mistake.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Abbott left his defence to his counsel, and called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Tanner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             called for brandy and water; I said that is a very good house of your's Mr. Forbes, you seemed pretty busy; yes it is, says he, I have been sitting up the skittle-ground; I asked him if he had not better send his wife word that he should not be at home all night to prevent her being uneasy, and offered him a sheet of paper for that purpose; his answer was he could not write; Grace offered to write for him, which he did; Grace read to him what he wrote, and went with it; Plenty of brandy and water was drank; two or three ladies came to see him, and he was very liberal with his brandy and water, but paid nothing; the next morning several came to see him, one a younger brother, and a person of the name of Crawley, and several others; from circumstances which appeared to me suspicious, no bail being offered, I sent for Mr. Wyatt, the attorney for the plaintiff, to send somebody to identify the person; his clerk came over, and from him I understood that I had not got the right person; I then did not know what to do; I went in and asked him if his name was not John Forbes, and he said that was no matter; I cannot exactly say; when he was let out, for he was let out when I was not at home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. And after you had been informed by the clerk of the attorney that he was not the man, still you ran the risk of keeping him? - A. The clerk said it was not the man, but if they were in the habit of personating one another he could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect the name of the plaintiff? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you do not recollect the name of the plaintiff, for whom you served that writ? - A. Really for the moment I cannot; if you will give me leave to look at the warrant, I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it happen to you every day that you have actions against you for a mistake? - A. Once besides this since.</p>
               <p>Q. And you mean to say you do not recollect the name of the plaintiff? - A. In the other instance, I have an execution for the money now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you consulted Mr. Chester about trying that gentleman for a conspiracy? - A. No, because he behaved like a gentleman; Mr. Forbes never said he was not the man, and that gentleman did immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that either you or Mr, Chester explained the warrant to him? - A. He read the warrant to him but not loud.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you standing when Mr. Chester read the warrant? - A. In the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. And you heard him read every word of it? - A. I do not know that he read every word, but he explained it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he read and explained it to him? - A. I do not mean to say he read every word; but he told him he must go with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that it was explained to him that it was a writ against John, and not against Richard Forbes? - A. It was explained that

               <p>Q. Had you not your assistant with you? - A. Yes; but I asked Mr. Chester to go to be a witness, whether he was the landlord or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you refused that offer? - A. I did refuse that offer, in consequence of the costs being more than five pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. The warrant had been read to him? - A. Yes; in her hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. And, therefore, she could not but be acquainted that the arrest had taken place upon his person? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the wife seem to recover her spirits, and appear less agitated, after that? - A. No, I think not; he then asked her for some money, and said, do not let me go without any money; she happened to be in the bar at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first came in, Mrs. Forbes was in the bar? - A. When I called for a pint of beer, I saw the defendant, Richard, in the tap-room, standing by the fire, and this lady in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at the lady, and be sure that that is the lady? - A. I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think Purkis expressed himself with as much concern and good nature? - A. He is used to things of that sort, and his feelings, of course, must be more callous.</p>
               <p>Q. How close was she to Purkis at the time the warrant was reading? - A. I suppose two or three yards; I was paying attention to the warrant being read.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman say any thing to Purkis? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040057"/>Q. Do you recollect any chat between them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They were some time in chat together, were they not? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Purkis from the man at the time he asked the wife for the money, and said, do not let me go without some money? - A. He was either in the passage or the tap-room; Purkis was in the passage when the warrant was reading.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Grace when this man asked the wife for some money? - A. With his master.</p>
               <p>Q. The wife had seen all this, you say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came any body to be foolish enough to suggest, that a note should be written to let the wife know where he was? - A. Mr. Purkis sent Grace in with a piece of paper, and a pen and ink, for him to write to her.</p>
               <p>Q. The man began to write, but afterwards would not go on with it? - A. I think not, I think be said he could not write.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go back to the lock-up house? - A. I went to smoke my pipe; I thought I might as well go there as any where else.</p>
               <p>Q. And you having to go to Jermyn-street? - A. That was all in my way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand that this conversation, between the wife and the husband, took place at the Falcon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the wife go with the husband to the lockup house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till after they got to the lock-up house that the paper was produced for him to write? - A. No.</p>

             was then acting the part of the landlord, as they said they were in hopes Purkis would come in, and take him for the brother, and Richard was to put an apron on, that he might look more like the landlord, to deceive the officer; I cannot recollect whether he did put the apron on or not; Richard Forbes and Mrs. Forbes were in high glee, they seemed to be very cheerful, and said, that if Purkis should take the brother, he would be glad to make it up if he paid the debt for him; I wished them a good evening, and went away.</p>
