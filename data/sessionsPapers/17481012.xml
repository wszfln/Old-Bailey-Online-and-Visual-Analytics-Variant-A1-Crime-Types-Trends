               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of him of your own knowledge?</p>
               <p>Johnson. No; Mr. Herring told me, he bought the watch of Morris, and that he told him he bought it at Chatham ; he said afterwards, he bought it of a man that was going to Chatham , and desired I would not do him any harm. Mr. Herring had heard of a man that was found concealed in a house at Wapping-wall, and he knew him to be the man he bought the watch of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever see me before that time in your Life.</p>
               <p>Johnson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray my lad what trade are you? [here the prosecutor was stopped.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Herring . On the 22d of September, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my house [by alderman Parson's brew-house] and offered to sell me a watch; I asked him where he had the watch from; he said he was a sailor just come from Guinea, and had money to receive, but he must sell the watch; and he told me he had some gold dust to sell; I told him I did not understand Gold dust, and would not look at it; I look'd on the watch, and asked him what he would have for it; he said it cost him 3 l. at Chatham ; I told him I would give him 45 s. for it; it was worth about that, for the watch was dirty,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120003"/> and the dial-plate was hardly to be seen; and I told him when he had received his money he should have the watch again for 5 s. more. When I found the watch was advertised, I carried it to Mr. Johnson, and he gave me the 45 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner is the man?</p>
               <p>Herring. I know he is the man, but I do not know that I saw him before; some of the people said he was a dangerous fellow; and that some Irish fellows would rescue him, he being an Irish man. When he came to my shop, he appeared very remarkable with his face scratched: he brought the watch to me the very same day it was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give an account how you came by this watch?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought it of a sailor, at the three tuns at Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before you offered it to this Gentleman?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. About 12 o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his name?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not ask his name.</p>
               <p>Q. What ship did he say he belonged to?</p>
               <p>Prisoner . He said he belonged to the Monmouth, Captain Harrison, a 70 gun ship.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was upon a Thursday, last Thursday was a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was upon a Thursday?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, my lord, it was upon a Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. What Tuesday?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was a month yesterday *.</p>

               <p>Q. What were they arguing about?</p>
               <p>Follyer. I found at the latter end that it was about a watch, and the sailor asked the prisoner 3 guineas for it, and said it cost him 3 guineas; the prisoner said it was too dear, and I think they agreed for 40 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other company in the house?</p>
               <p>Follyer. There was no company in the foreroom.</p>

               <p>Follyer. I went to receive some money for rabbits, I deal in rabbits.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any money paid for it?</p>

               <p>Follyer. It was paid in small silver and large silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any gold?</p>
               <p>Follyer. Not to my knowledge, and he bid me take notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he suppose it to be stolen?</p>
               <p>Follyer. I can't tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to come here?</p>
               <p>Follyer. The prisoner sent for us this morning, he knew where to send to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he send to you?</p>
               <p>Follyer. To St. Catherine's Lane .</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to know your names?</p>
               <p>Follyer. He took down our names, and I suppose if there had been other people in the house he would have taken down their names.</p>

               <p>Follyer. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you cross the water?</p>
               <p>Follyer. It is against Iron Gate I believe that we cross'd the water.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't appear ever to have been at Greenwich in your life, speak nothing but the truth, what sort of a place is Greenwich?</p>
               <p>Follyer. It is a very pretty place.</p>
               <p>Q. How many churches are there in it.</p>
               <p>Follyer. I can't tell; there is a park and an hospital there.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to know the prisoner's name?</p>
               <p>Follyer. I did not know his Name till this morning.</p>

             . I live in Hemming's Row by Leicester fields. On the 16th of last month the prisoner at the bar brought this spoon to me, between one and two in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy it of him?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. No, my lord, I asked him how he came by it, and he said he bought it of a woman at Hounslow , I said that did not look likely, for I believed it was stole, for there is a Crest upon it, and I told him he should not have the spoon again unless he brought some person of credit to prove how he came by the spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure him?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. Yes, I carried him before Justice Fraser, and he let him go.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120005"/>Q. How did you find the prisoner again?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. He came on the Tuesday following and asked for his spoon, and I carried him before the same Magistrate, and then he owned that he stole the spoon, and it was the first thing that ever he did in his life.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner desired Mr. Rose might be asked whether that spoon was not delivered to him as a pattern for him to engrave the crest on some pewter.</p>
               <p>Rose. Yes, my lord, the fellow came to engrave the crest on some pewter, and he being a dirty looking sort of a fellow I did not care to trust him with the spoon, and he was to come to my house and do it, and he told my maid he wanted 2 spoons, and she let him have them, and he took the opportunity of going off with the 2 spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he them for any other Purpose than to take off the engraving?</p>
               <p>Rose . No, for no other purpose than to engrave the plates.</p>
               <p>Jacobs. The prisoner said he stole the spoons, and sold the other to one of his countrymen.</p>

            . On the 11th of February I lost a whole piece of superfine scarlet cloth out of my Warehouse; it was perfectly wet as it came from the Dyers, and was not set.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us in what manner you apprehend it was taken.</p>
               <p>Winter . There are some rails that are before my yard that are a sort of an Area, and one of those rails was cut away, and the cloth was drawn through there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your warehouse locked?</p>
               <p>Winter. No, the warehouse is never locked, the wall is almost as high as this cieling .</p>
               <p>Q. And was there room for one man to come through?</p>
               <p>Winter. I did not think it was possible, but I tried myself and I could get thro'.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it could be got thro' without hurting of it?</p>
               <p>Winter. It must be sadly purpled.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear any thing of it?</p>
               <p>Winter . On the Whitson monday there was a letter sent to a person that if I searched Alvarez's lodging, I should find my cloth or some of it in remnants .</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find?</p>
               <p>Winter. I found this waistcoat and breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to have been worn?</p>
               <p>Winter. No, his landlady said they were brought home that morning, and I said I was sure that was my cloth, for it never was planed nor pressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at his lodging?</p>
               <p>Winter. No, he had absconded from thence six Weeks, and was taken by one Johnson a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give any account how he came by this cloth?</p>
               <p>Winter . He said before my lord mayor that he bought it of a Polander.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether that is an English manufacture or a foreign manufacture?</p>
               <p>Winter. It is an English manufacture.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those stains done by fresh water or salt water?</p>
               <p>Winter. I take them to be done by drawing it thro' my rails, for salt water would make it turn quite black.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of importing cloth from Poland?</p>
               <p>Winter. I never heard of any such thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . Bid him look upon the breeches, I had not enough to make a waistcoat and breeches, and I was forc'd to buy a bit to make the waistband of the breeches.</p>
               <p>Winter . The waistband of the breeches is quite another thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Has that waistcoat ever been planed?</p>
               <p>Butler . No, never; these stains are what we call crimsoned, which come by dirt, &amp;c. and if it had been done by salt water it would have turned black, and if it had been close tied up, the edges would have been wet and the inside free.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire after the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Winter. Yes, I enquired after him night and day, and found him about a week or a fortnight before last sessions.</p>

            . Some time in April last, it was on a Friday, but I cannot tell how long it was ago: It was about six months ago, I was coming down Shoemaker-Row, about 9 o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner come to a stall in Shoemaker-Row to buy some fish.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Sampson. I never knew him or saw him before or since in any shape whatsoever, for I did not know his name, and was an intire stranger to him. As that gentleman, the prisoner, was buying the fish, a Polander came to him with two remnants of cloth over his arm, and offered to sell them to the prisoner; the prisoner asked him how much there was of them, and he said, there was a yard and three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know him to be a Polander?</p>
               <p>Sampson . Because he was in a Polander's dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner speak to the Polander first, or the Polander to him?</p>
               <p>Sampson . I cannot tell who spoke first; the Polander asked him a guinea, and he gave him 18 s. for them, I did not see them measured; but the Polander said there was a yard and 3 quarters of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in Shoemaker-Row ?</p>
               <p>Sampson. Why master we want to buy fish as well as other people, and when the bargain was made, we went to one Coveneys, in Shoemaker-Row, and drank a pot of beer together.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you?</p>
               <p>Sampson . A money changer.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is that?</p>
               <p>Sampson. Buying gold and silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the money paid, and the cloth delivered?</p>
               <p>Sampson. I saw the money paid, and the cloth delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. Who asked you to go?</p>
               <p>Sampson. The prisoner asked me to go along with them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cole and Mr. Kay desired to besworn, and they deposed, they had seen the prisoner and Sampson together about last sessions, and that they were acquainted.</p>

            . On Friday the 30th of Sept. between ten and eleven at night, or before the watch went eleven, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked for a penny dram of cinnamon water, (I believe the door was a little upon the jar) and he asked me to drink a dram, and I drank one with him , and he threw down six-pence; and while I was giving him change, he pushed the door too, and I went from behind the compter in order to let him out, and then he pretended he had left some company at the tavern, and wanted to borrow some money to discharge his reckoning (this was at first) and then he insisted upon what I had in my pocket, and said he must have money, and would have money, and then he took 3 s. from me; after he had got the 3 s. the prisoner took me by the collar, and said, if I made any resistance he would destroy me; then he unbottoned my coat, waistcoat, and breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say then?</p>
               <p>Swaine. While he had me by the collar, he demanded the key of the till, I said I had nothing there that was my own; he held me fast, and took me with him to the till, and there was a tobacco box in the till, in which was 18 s. 6 d. and he took that out of the tobacco box, and went away with the money; there was a bag of half pence in the till, he took that up, and asked what they were, I said they were to pay the small beer brewer, and he said he would not take them: then he set a candle down upon the floor, and asked me to let him out at the back door, and after he was out at the door, he said, if ever I saw him again, and ever took any notice of him, he threatened my life. I do not remember the words he said</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner the same clothes on then as he has now?</p>
               <p>Swaine. Yes; but not the same hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before?</p>
               <p>Swaine. No never.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever in any house with him before?</p>
               <p>Swaine. No. The next day I went to the chandler's shop over against me, and told them of it, and about ten o'clock on the Monday night, the woman of the house came, and bid me look into the back room, and see if I knew any body there; I went into the room, and saw the prisoner sitting there, and they brought him some meat, and he asked for pepper and salt; I then said to him, sir, have you no knowledge of my face? he said, no; and I said, by G - d you are the man that robbed me, and then he owned it directly.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. Have you any lodgers in your house?</p>
               <p>Swaine . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not call out to these lodgers?</p>
               <p>Swaine. Because I did not know whether they were in bed or up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this cook's shop open then?</p>
               <p>Swaine. No; there was never a shop open in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know who shut your shop door?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120008"/>Swaine . Because there was no body in the shop but him and I.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know but the door might shut of itself?</p>
               <p>Swaine . I am very sensible to the contrary; for I saw him do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your's a glass door?</p>
               <p>Swaine . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So any body going by might look in?</p>
               <p>Swaine. It slides up.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you cry out, stop thief? do not you think if you had cried out aloud the watchman would have heard you?</p>
               <p>Swaine. I did not care to run the risque of it, for I did not know who was near him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you a great mastiff dog there?</p>
               <p>Swaine. Yes; but he was chained.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keyan . About ten o'clock one Monday night, I think it was the third of October, I was charged with the prisoner by the prosecutor; I took him down to Justice Fraser's, and he was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner confess any thing that night?</p>
               <p>Keyan . No; it was the next night.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say? what were his words?</p>
               <p>Keyan . He said he had borrowed some money of the prosecutor?</p>

I knew him by being a customer, and he asked for a groat's worth of beef (which I served him with) and he went into the back room; and I said to Mr. Swaine, I believed there was some body there that he knew; he looked in, and said, he did not see any body; for the prisoner sat so that the prosecutor could not well see him; and Mr. Swaine went into the room, and said to the prisoner, young man don't you know me, and the prisoner said he did not; and Mr. Swaine said to the prisoner that he had robbed him; he owned he had borrowed some money of him, and said if he did not make it up, it would be the worse for him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he seem to want any money?</p>
               <p>Kinton. He came to me the 23d. of December, and asked if I had any money, and said he had bought a horse, and agreed with a person to go down to Lewis in Sussex ; and he said he had been at Mr. Crockatts in Cloak Lane, he said he had got this note to be paid by Mr. Crockatt, but he Did they did not pay any of these notes but on a Saturday, and that it would be paid next Saturday : the inquest of the ward were at our house then, and said it was a strange thing that such a worthy man as Mr. Crockatt should let a note of 5 l. 5 s. and made payable on demand, that was drawn the 27th of June, 1747, lye to this time unpaid ; he said he did not want money then, and he would not go and demand it: I said I had but three guineas in the house, and I could not leave myself without any money, and if two guineas would be of any service to him, he should have them; and I gave him the two guineas, and said, let me know what I am to have for my money, he said the note was indorsed, and he left it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him indorsed it?</p>

No; I did not, and he said he would come on the Saturday for the remaining 3 guineas, and if I had had 5 guineas in the house then, he should have had them all upon the credit of the note. I went to Mr. Crockatt's house on the Saturday, and there is a Gentleman there that I spoke to, and I said I had brought a note for payment: he looked at the the note and laughed; and said, he would not give me a shilling for it; and he said he knew nothing of this Fawkner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who does this note appear to be signed by?</p>
               <p>Kinton. By J Kynaston Fawkner; but Mr. Plaistowe never came for the Money, and I never saw him since to my knowledge from that night, which was the 23d of December, till the 5th of July, when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. But before the 23d of December had not you frequently seen him?</p>
               <p>Kinton. Yes, he got acquainted with some of the gentlemen that use my house; but he very seldom came at any other time but of an evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Kinton. I believe this gentleman (the prisoner) came to our house the latter end of July, asked if I knew one Fawkner of South Carolina : I said I knew one of the name who came from South Carolina , and there was a note which he brought for 30 l. which was accepted, but not paid, and we should be glad to know where to find him; and Mr. Plaistowe said, he had defrauded him and others, at an election at Southampton; and that he had advertised him the 27th of July, with the initial letters of his name, J. K. F.</p>
               <p>Q. What July ?</p>
               <p>Watson. Last July was 12 months.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that the prisoner said to you then?</p>
               <p>Watson. He said Kynaston had defrauded him and several others, in passing away notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him since that?</p>
               <p>Watson . Never since, till I saw him in court to day; I am not certain whether I did not shew him Mr. Fawkners's acceptance of the bill.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you be certain that that tea was yours ?</p>
               <p>Sharpe . No, I cannot, but he owned he took a pound of hyson tea, and a pound of chocolate; I said these are my goods, and he said they were; I told him I would make it easy, and as we were carrying him before my lord mayor, he got away, but was taken again in Seething Lane, in about five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120011"/> minutes time: the reason of my laying those goods so low was because his parents are very honest people. <rs id="t17481012-9-verdict50" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Did he confess the fact?</p>

               <p>Q. Now did not he say he would find a trick to prevent you?</p>
               <p>Cook. No; he never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. I say it is fact, and it will turn out so; take your time, and consider whether this was not spoke in the hearing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cook. No; it was not said in his hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to hear of your things?</p>
               <p>Cook. By means of the watchman; for the watchman said, peggy, there is the man that has your things.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say the watchman said, Peggy, there is the man that had your things, did he tell you it was the prisoner had them?</p>

             [the sailor.] I lodged at Daniel's house, and went to bed about eleven o'clock on the Saturday night, when the house was robbed ; and between two and three in the morning, I heard the house was broke open and robbed. On the Sunday morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, Fox (the watchman) came, and asked me if I had been robbed, and seemed to smile; I said the house had been robbed, but not I; but I found it was so: and Fox said , if I would give him some small satisfaction, he could help me to my things again.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you would have been willing to have given him a small satisfaction?</p>
               <p>Lemmon . Yes; I was to have given him half a guinea, and Daniel was to have given him another half guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you who had them?</p>
               <p>Lemmon . He said he saw Weston go along between two and three with a bundle. I asked him, why he did not stop him; he said, because he knew him before, and knew him to be an honest man, and one that worked in the neighbourhood.</p>

            , who said, she was house-keeper to Mr. Daniel, at the Queen's Head, in Middle-row, Holborn; I carried him before Justice Hole, and the watchman was talking as if he saw the prisoner go down Chancery Lane with a bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Ind. This was at Lord Cobham's Head . And Justice Hole said, he would be a friend to him, if he would own where the things were. The prisoner was fuddled, and he gave me directions to go to an empty house in Chancery Lane, at the end of White's Alley, and there I found the things.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get into this empty house?</p>
               <p>Ind. I went to a publick house, and borrowed a candle, and got up the wall, and went in to the house, and on the first floor I found them; there was with the things a screw driver, and a gimblet , and I took another screw driver out of his pocket, before the Justice ; the prisoner owned he took the things, and that no body was concerned with him, for he said, he would not charge any body wrongfully.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Ind. I never knew any thing of him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Pris. The woman that appeared here is a very bad woman, and induced me to neglect my master's business, and to do other things that I should not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dolley. I live in Holborn. I have known the prisoner three years as working with Mr. John Hill, and I never heard any complaint of him before; and as he is a jobbing smith, who is employed promiscuously at other people's houses, if he had done any thing amiss, I should have heard it. I never heard that he wronged any body; and it is such a notorious house, that people are afraid to live there.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say as to the Woman who has been the evidence against him?</p>
               <p>Dolley. I would not take her word for a pin ; for she has been the ruin of half the young men in our neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>John Hill. I am the prisoner's master; the prisoner has work'd with me near three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he work with you till he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend him to be an honest man?</p>
               <p>Hill. I do take him to be an honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he would wrong you?</p>
               <p>Hill. I believe not. I took him to be as honest a boy as any in the world, 'till he got into this woman's company; and there is not a boy of fifteen years of age can go by, without being pulled in.</p>

             . The prisoner came up into my room, and there was a lad and a woman; and as soon as he came up, he took my wedding ring off my finger, and went down stairs; and I said, come, give me my ring, but he went away with it, and I did not see him again till the 10th of Febr. and then I charged him with robbing me; and he said, the ring was pawned in Whitechapel, and he would redeem it, and he did redeem it on the 10th of Febr. and I asked him to come to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. So after he had robbed you, you asked him to come to your house; what did you do that for?</p>
               <p>Cornish. In order to get him there, to take him. And on the 21st of Febr. he came again to my room, and took away the same ring that he had redeemed; and then he came another time, and took a ring off a chest of drawers, and I said, you rogue, what, are you come to rob me again? I met him some time afterwards, and asked him where they were, he said he had pawned them, but I should have them again; but he sold them three days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Cornish. I saw him afterwards the beginning of March, at a house where I was (one Bull's, in Dyer's street, Bloomsbury) and he offered me a dram, and I threw down the cup and broke it ; and he took an opportunity to abuse me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no husband ?</p>
               <p>Cornish. Not that lives with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Cornish . I never saw him after March, till he was taken, which was the 28th of Sept.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see him after that till he was taken?</p>
               <p>Cornish. Yes; but I had no body to take him up. I would have taken him up twenty times if I had had an opportunity.</p>

               <p>Q. You say he took the ring off your finger in Febr. was the time of his visiting you before this, or afterwards?</p>
               <p>Cornish. No; it was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. So he visited you for six weeks afterwards?</p>
               <p>Cornish. I do not remember the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the ring in a jocose manner?</p>
               <p>Cornish. Yes; he took it off my finger, and run down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did not you go with this young man to take this ring out of pawn?</p>
               <p>Cornish. Yes; because he promised to pay me for the ring 5 s. a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did not you give him this ring?</p>
               <p>Cornish. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the ring pawn'd?</p>
               <p>Cornish. At one Dawson's, in Bell yard, Whitechappel .</p>
               <p>Q. Now as to the second ring, what time was that taken away?</p>
               <p>Cornish. On the 21st of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Now were they two different rings, or the same ring?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120014"/>Cornish. It was the same ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how often did you see him after the 21st of February, before you got a warrant for him?</p>
               <p>Cornish. About three or four times, I was very ignorant, and did not know how to go about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the third ring taken from you?</p>
               <p>Cornish. At Mrs. Bull's, I was there three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. And had you no bedfellow there?</p>
               <p>Cornish. I lay with Mr. Bull, his wife, and his child.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray now did not Mr. King lay with you one night there?</p>
               <p>Cornish. No.</p>

               <p>Cornish. For nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Estber Lander. About a fortnight ago, the prisoner owned he took the ring, and was very willing to make her recompence, and before the justice, on the 8th of September, he said, as she had let it alone so long, he would take his remedy at law.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barret. I am a plaisterer in Mount Street, by Grosvenor Square, the prisoner worked for me a year and an half, and when work was scarce, I employed him at home, believing him to be a very sober honest man; and I employed him where-ever I could.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dawson . The prisoner and this Woman came to my house to redeem a ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether you asked him if this woman was his wife?</p>
               <p>Dawson. Yes, I did, and he said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this in her hearing?</p>

             . On the second of July the prisoner came to my house, and told me that there were two gentlemen wanted some Allopeans and Grograms, and some silk stockings; and accordingly I took three pieces of Allopeans and Grograms, two pair of black silk stockings, and two pair of white cotton stockings , and the prisoner was very desirous for me to let him carry the goods, but I did not think proper to let him carry them, but I would carry them, and we went away together .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the gentlemen?</p>
               <p>Wilkins . Yes, and as we were going along, the prisoner said he would carry one piece and the yard, for it looked something like a tradesman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him carry one piece?</p>
               <p>Wilkins . He took hold of it, and I did not resist him; he would not go through the Mall, but he would go by Buckingham-house, and when we came to St. James's kitchin door, I put the Allo peans and Grograms down, and the prisoner took the stockings out of my hand and run away with them; I have no other witness, it was in a private place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This person, who says I took the stockings from him at St. James's kitchin door , says wrong; I would ask him whether he would swear I took the stockings from him, or whether he did not give them into my hand?</p>
               <p>Wilkins . He took them out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This gentleman is a pawnbroker, and he told me he wanted to dispose of some grograms and stockings, and other things; I told him I knew some Gentleman that I believed wanted some; and when we came to St. James's kitchin door I agreed for a guinea for the two pair of black silk stockings, and 3 s. and 3 d. a pair for the white , and I carried them to the gentlemen; and I being gone a pretty while, he was gone before I returned .</p>
               <p>Wilkins . I staid there three hours, my lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . He did not stay three quarters of any hour; I desire to know whether in that narrow place I could have got away, if he had but called or lifted up his finger?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. I went after him as fast as I could go, and the first person I saw was a centry, and I asked him whether he did not see a man with a lightish coloured coat and a light wig, and he said he was just<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120015"/> run by, and run away ready to break his neck; while I was taking up my allopeans, he was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. What age is she?</p>
               <p>Sibley. She is at least thirteen or fourteen.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took them?</p>
               <p>Sibley. Because some of them were found upon her, and she owned the taking them; and she charged some to her mother in the country, that she was a partaker with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Sibley . Her going away 10, and not returning, gave me a suspicion of her; and I sent to the vestry-clark of Cheshunt, where I had her from; and he took her up and put her into the workhouse, and then sent for me; I sent a warrant down to bring her up, and she was carried before Justice Hole, and she said that she fell asleep under a hedge, with the things under her head, and they were taken away from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of these things again?</p>
               <p>Sibley. Only a cap and a handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Broom. A little beyond Wood's Close, as you go to Islington; and the prisoner wanted to take her mother up, and I took her and carried her before Justice Hole, and she cleared herself before the Justice of what her daughter accused her of.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the chest of drawers locked?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. Yes; for I put the money in that very morning, for I had been to receive a little prize money.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. About eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out then?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. I went to Tower Hill to receive some prize money, and I went to put more money in, and I missed my money that I had put in before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the chest of drawers open when you came back?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. No, it was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you recovered any of your money again?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. The prisoner returned me 14 guineas again, and said it was the first fact, and hoped I would be favourable to her, and she said she was very sorry for what she had done.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with her?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. Between ten and elaven o'clock at night, coming from Goodmans Fields Wells .</p>
               <p>Q. Was she c oming back to the house?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. No, she would not come back to that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge there?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise to be favourable to her?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. I told her if she returned me what she took, I would be favourable to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you what she had done with the money?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. She said she could not tell what she had done with it, only what money she had laid out in clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door of the room locked?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. Yes; but the key hung upon a nail by the room door, for my father was gone out, and the key of the chest of drawers was in a lower drawer, which was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner lodge in the house before that?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. About a fortnight or three weeks I believe, I had not been there above a month.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That night he lay with me, and he told me where the key of the chest of drawers was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lie with her?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. I never lay with her in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He did indeed, and please you my lord.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it night or day?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. It was in the day time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be asleep at an ale-house in the day time?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. Because I was working late at night, and could not get into my lodging, so I went to this house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a night house?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. I believe it might, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. It was on a Sunday morning; for on the Saturday night I was working late.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this done?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. I believe it was between eleven and twelve o'clock, but I can't tell. I lost my silver stock-buckle, and a shilling in money; the maid of the house saw it done, I did not see it done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the house while you was there?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. I don't know that she was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober when you went there?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. I can't say I was directly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had a shilling in your pocket then?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take the prisoner up?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. I took her up about a fortnight afterwards, upon the information of the maid of the house.</p>

               <p>Mitchell. He used to drink there sometimes in the day time; I never saw him in the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes; I have known her ever since I have been there, by her using the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see the prisoner do?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I saw the prisoner take the stock-buckle out of the prosecutor's pocket, and three half pence, I saw no more; and I said I would call my mistress, and she threatened me, my Lord, if I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. This was just as she was going out at the door; I could not tell my mistress while she was in the house, for she threatened my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your master been here?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. He has been here almost all day.</p>
               <p>Pris. Cunningham put this woman into the warrant.</p>
               <p>Cunningham. I put four of them in, upon suspicion.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120019"/>Pris. But you put Mitchell into the warrant first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mitchell tell you of this before you took out the warrant.</p>
               <p>Cunningham . Yes; she told me of it that very morning.</p>
               <p>Pris. There were two soldiers, and two women there</p>
               <p>Mitchell. There was never a soldier there.</p>
               <p>Pris. The landlord is a very wicked man, my Lord; can he be an honest man, that keeps such a house as that, and keeps his footman?</p>

               <p>Q. Have you lost any thing?</p>
               <p>Millward. I have lost a great many things at different times; but in particular, I lost seven pair of shoes, seven pair of soles, and half a guinea, which was taken off a cup, which stood upon a beaureau in my kitchen. The last of the things I lost was on the Sunday before Bartholomew day.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge the prisoner with any of these things?</p>
               <p>Millward. Only by the confession of a boy.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take the prisoner up?</p>
               <p>Millward . On the 11th of Sept. and carried him before a justice, and he owned he had half a guinea from the boy, and that it was a bad one, for it was but a nine shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner work'd for you?</p>
               <p>Millward. About four years, or three years and an half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any thing upon the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Deaton. Yes. I took them before my master came down, and gave them to him, and he went and sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time were the soles taken?</p>
               <p>Deaton. He had five pair the Sunday before Bartholomew day; and he always advised me when I took any money, not to take less than sixpence, for if I took a penny or two pence, they would miss it the sooner.</p>

               <p>Hasler . I found a pair of my stockings on the prisoner's legs, and I had them taken off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she live in your house?</p>
               <p>Hasler . No; she used to come early in the morning with shoes, or to do any odd things, and she enticed a young servant of mine to give her several things.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell them why you took them up?</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you do that?</p>

I went to my father's, and I told him some persons had showed me some things, and I told him what sort of goods they were; and he said he believed they were the poor woman's goods, and we went directly and got a search warrant, and went to the house, but we did not meet with the prisoner at home.</p>

I keep a house in White Cross Street, at the Angel, and sell old clothes; on the thirty-first of August, the two prisoners came to my house about five in the afternoon, and she had her apron tucked up, and she opened a little bundle of linnen, for she had divided them into several parcels, and she took the bundle out of her apron: The man [Presgrove] stood at the threshold of the door, and she said it was her husband, and she said come in Will ; he did not come in directly, but stood leaning upon the hatch.</p>

               <p>Q. So you paid her either 49 s. or 51 s?</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of these things?</p>
               <p>Webb.

               <p>Q. What were they doing?</p>
               <p>Bailey. They were aiding and assisting in running goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Chapman on the 10th of March?</p>
               <p>Bailey. At Horsey in the county of Norfolk; and I saw Goldsmith there on the 11th of March; Chapman had a piece, and asked me whether that was not a defensive weapon, and as I am not a person that understands fire arms, I told him, I could not tell; and on the 11th of March, when the cutter came up, Chapman, called for his arms, and rode out of the horse yard of Mr. Pierce's house. I don't know the name of his arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Chapman go?</p>
               <p>Bailey. He went down to Horsey Beach .</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go afterwards?</p>
               <p>Bailey . I was used in the most cruel manner that could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you conceal yourself from the gang ?</p>
               <p>Bailey . I could not conceal myself there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Goldsmith there?</p>
               <p>Bailey . Yes, he had two pistols before him</p>
               <p>Q. Was he on horseback?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of people were assembled together?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Upwards of 40.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all armed?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I believe they were all armed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were most of them armed?</p>
               <p>Bailey. They were most of them armed with fire arms; and a boat came on shore from the cutter, and one of them said, d - n you, this is mine, and another said, d - n you, this is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods did you see?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I did not see any goods, but I knew the package, and took them to be tea and brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity might be in a bag?</p>
               <p>Bailey. About 26, 27, or 28l. weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Chapman or the boat come on shore?</p>
               <p>Bailey . No; they were all loaden then, and they would have had me gone down to the beach, and have held their horses; and when they came from the beach, they march'd like an army of soldiers with the goods along with them.</p>

            . What are you?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I am an assistant to an officer of the Customs in London; I kept a coffee house at Yarmouth ,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120028"/> till I was afraid to stay any longer, and then I removed to London.</p>
               <p>Q. I desire to know what you went down to Horsey for?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I went down to see Mr. Manning, a friend of mine, and I was very ill used before I got to Manning's house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down to the beach, did you see Mr. Morley there?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Goldsmith and Morely is the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man is he?</p>
               <p>Bailey. He is as jolly a man as I am.</p>
               <p>Pris. Co. You are a very jolly man.</p>
               <p>Bailey. So I am, for all I am very thin.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Morley in the front, or the middle of them, or where?</p>
               <p>Bailey. He went down with the rest to load.</p>
               <p>Q. You are speaking of the first part of it.</p>
               <p>Bailey. No I am speaking of the latter part, when they all went down to load.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a horse was he upon?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I did not mind the horses, I minded the men. I do not know whether it was a horse, or a mare.</p>

               <p>Q. What coloured coat had he on?</p>
               <p>Bailey. He had a light coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you, upon your oath, whether you did not declare before a Justice of the peace, that you saw Morley on Tower Hill?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I don't know that I was on Tower Hill. I did not see him before I went to justice Burdus.</p>
               <p>Q. What Justice did you go to then?</p>
               <p>Bailey. A Justice that lives in the Minories near Tower Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I believe it was Justice Ricards.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to declare to this court, that he was riding with fire arms before him? How can you be positive to the fact of his riding with fire arms, when you said before the Justice that he had none?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I can give you a reason; there was a great number of people about the yard, that I was afraid to declare that; I did not know but I might have been knocked on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it between the time of the fact being committed, and your giving information of it before Justice Burdus?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I believe it was a year.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you never declared that you had nothing to lay to Morley's charge? I ask you whether you never declared that you never saw Morley at Horsey?</p>
               <p>Bailey. No; I know he was there; and I said I had nothing to lay to his charge about the assault.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you did not declare that Morley was not there?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I believe I said that I was not certain whether he had fire arms or not.</p>
               <p>Pris. 2d Coun. On the 11th of March, where did you see Morley first?</p>
               <p>Bailey. He was going down to the Beach.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he came from?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether he came out of the same house the other smugglers did?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I did not see him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you declare a year ago that he had no fire arms?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I have given you my reason why I said so at Justice Ricards's, for I was afraid of being surrounded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the Justice that?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I had not presence of mind.</p>
               <p>Coun. for the Cr. When you was before Mr. Ricards , did you recollect that he had any holsters?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I said positively he had holsters, but I don't know whether he had pistols or not.</p>

               <p>Holmes. I was there from morning till night.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120031"/>Ellis . Yes; but when I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it within this fortnight?</p>
               <p>Ellis . I believe it may.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were there?</p>
               <p>Ellis . There were several, Mr. Woolno was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Kelly with you upon this Conversation ?</p>
               <p>Ellis . I do not know whether he was or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you read?</p>
               <p>Ellis . I can neither read nor write .</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you this was on the eleventh of March ?</p>
               <p>Ellis . I asked what day of the month the sow was killed , and I was told it was on the eleventh of March .</p>
               <p>Q. What was it the month before October?</p>
               <p>Ellis . I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What was last month?</p>
               <p>Ellis . I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the next month?</p>
               <p>Ellis . I cannot tell the name of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you a question, and I desire you would give yourself a good deal of time to answer this question; recollect your past life for three or four years together, and tell me whether you can remember any one particular day besides this?</p>
               <p>Ellis. No; I cannot tell, because I do not take particular notice of every thing; I never had such an accident before .</p>
               <p>John Brown, Attorney . The prisoner applied to me for advice, and I advised him to come to London. On the eighteenth of April the prisoner was advertised in the Gazettee, in order to his surrendering himself according to the act of parliament, and I advised him to go down to Norwich, and surrender , and he took my advice, and did go down; and he did surrender himself to one Mr. Brooks , a Justice of the peace for the city of Norwich , and I went with him to surrender himself, and set it down the same day, and the justice would not commit him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why would he not commit him?</p>
               <p>Brown. Because he would have been admitted to bail upon his surrendering, and the Justice would not admit him to bail; Mr. Morley did apply to me about bringing an action against this Hubbard, for killing his hog, but I advised him to let it alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before, or after his surrendering?</p>
               <p>Brown. It was before his surrendering, and he mentioned the eleventh of March, as the day the hog was killed on.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was talking with him about the hog, did he say he was at Horsey or not?</p>
               <p>Brown . He said he was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he was?</p>
               <p>Brown . He said he was at home.</p>

               <p>Frost. Yes ; and I searched him, and found six mother of pearl shells upon him, and the pocket was large , and uncommon.</p>

               <p>Frost. four or five shillings, sometimes they are worth more, and sometimes less, I cannot set a value upon them; and I took him to the Castle in Mark Lane.</p>

               <p>Mr. Letchmere, a warehouse-keeper to the East India Company, produced a letter the prisoner sent to him, directed to Mr. Letchmere, in Mark Lane, in which was a petition to the hon. the East India Company (which was read) in which he humbly acknowledges his fault, in taking six mother of pearl shells, out of the drug warehouse; and asks pardon of the hon. the East India Company, and begs of them to pardon him as being the first time, and assures them, that he never knew any body that robbed them.</p>

             . I am a Journeyman to Mr. Delaport , Mr. Smith came in about the 20th or 21st of June last, to my master's shop to buy some hairs, and he was asking what price such hairs were, and he said 12 s. an ounce; he said he had several parcels of that sort, that did not cost him so much money , and I said they were my master's hairs I went home as fast as I could and got two or three bits to match them; and I said to the prisoner, these are my master's property. Mr Smith had not paid him for the last parcel of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120037"/> hairs, and he ordered him to meet him at the Gentleman and Porter , at Temple Bar, to receive his money; and when Mr. Smith saw him, he said you must produce the man you had those goods of; and he said, you know Mr. Smith, I cannot produce the man; I said Mr. Herbertson, do you know nothing of these hairs, and he said he did not; then said I, you are going to receive money for my master's hairs, and he could not give any account how he came by them.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know them to be Mr. Delaport's hairs ?</p>
               <p>Brown . They are his hairs , and there was a servant of Mr. Delaport's , that run away when the prisoner was taken up, and I believe they were both concerned , for they kept company together.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up?</p>
               <p>Brown. The 21st, 22d, or 23d.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the other servant run away?</p>
               <p>Brown . It was the second day after Mr. Herbertson was taken up.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun . That cannot be true, because he was carried before Sir
